0;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;US society needs a broadband big dig to get out of its hole;Overhauling the internet’s infrastructure would create jobs and reduce poverty;Almost nothing is growing these days, with one exception: internet use.Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen the sort of uptick in broadband usage that you’d expect to see over the course of years.Italy, Spain and the UK have all had high double-digit increases in traffic. In the US, data usage via the cable company Comcast is up 32 per cent nationwide, and by over 60 per cent in locked-down cities. Verizon had a 75 per cent increase in gaming traffic in just one week in mid-March.No wonder network latency, or the time it takes for data to travel, is a major issue. New York, San Diego, San Jose and Houston are all experiencing declines in download speeds. Just try watching a Netflix or Amazon video after dinner and you’ll see what I mean.With bricks and mortar businesses closed, and ecommerce booming, there’s little doubt that the transition to a digital economy will be dramatically sped up by coronavirus. The richest and most powerful tech companies, from Amazon to Google, will undoubtedly be even stronger post-crisis than before.Meanwhile, entire sectors of the economy, including retail, commercial real estate, and many parts of the travel and tourism sector, won’t come back anytime soon — if they come back at all.These areas were among the strongest job creators in recent years. In the last US jobs report, issued before the virus hit, restaurants were the second fastest growing category. But now we’ve come through a second record week of unemployment claims, and Congress is busy trying to craft yet another multitrillion dollar stimulus package.Legislators are rightly discussing support for everything from greener forms of transport such as passenger rail, to highway and bridge repair. As everyone knows, America’s infrastructure is woefully inadequate, and money for major public spending programmes has never been cheaper. But there’s also a case to be made for a public works programme that would make high-speed fixed broadband an essential infrastructure, just like water or electricity.Let me be very clear: a major infrastructure spending programme isn’t a substitute for short-term emergency aid. Millions of individuals and small businesses will need debt write-offs (and not just loans), as well as grants and other cash infusions over the next few weeks and months.Even so, unemployment is likely to remain elevated for a year or more, until a vaccine can be developed and normal travel and labour patterns resumed.A broadband infrastructure programme would kill several birds with one stone.For starters, a “big dig” to install broadband fibre, the most robust and resilient kind of broadband connectivity, would focus on the kind of work that can be done soonest in the midst of a pandemic, namely large scale, protected, outdoor projects.It could employ and deliver needed services to some of the most vulnerable Americans. Only about half of those with incomes of $30,000 or less have broadband at home. Nearly 68 per cent of those live in rural areas. Others include urban poor who can’t afford the $72 national average cost for the internet (it’s more than $100 in many cities).Many people who cannot work from home are falling into poverty, and children who cannot access virtual curricula are falling behind in school. This is nothing less than a national security issue. The internet is almost the only thing that has kept the economy and society functioning over the past few weeks. Imagine if it went down the next time around.There are several challenges to installing universal broadband in the US. Coverage is currently provided via a patchwork of local monopolies.In addition, a dysfunctional political economy is at work: state politicians in hock to large companies can prevent cities or rural areas from accessing public funds to hire competitors to build out networks. In recent years, private companies in the telecoms and tech sectors have also opted to do share buybacks rather than invest in costly infrastructure.But money shouldn’t be an issue here. Even before the coronavirus crisis, the Federal Communications Commission had allocated $20bn to broadband expansion, on top of hundreds of millions from the Department of Agriculture. More cash will very likely be allotted in a future stimulus bill. This could be used to prompt telecoms providers to keep workers on the job and employ more to build new services and improve existing ones.Money could also be given to local municipalities to build their own systems, like the 1935 Rural Electrification Administration programme that transformed America’s heartland and increased productivity for decades.Costs should be shouldered by the private sector too. Public debt may seem not to matter now, but it will someday. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google — the so-called “FAANG” companies — are the heaviest generators of internet traffic, and have far higher profit margins than telecoms. Already brimming with cash, they will emerge from the crisis even richer and more dominant than before.If there was ever a time for a digital tax on the data wealth that these companies currently harvest for free, it’s now.If we allow another financial crisis to pass without forcing the richest companies to do their part for the national interest — and that means more than delivering toilet paper — we will see a further erosion of trust in both the public and private sector. That is something that we truly cannot afford.rana.foroohar@ft.comFollow Rana Foroohar with myFT and on Twitter
1;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-01-23T05:00:29Z;Comcast takes aim at CNN with NBC-Sky global news channel;US group seeks long-elusive recognition for its brands in rare bet on profit-thin sector;Comcast’s NBC and Sky will this summer attempt to overturn three decades of CNN pre-eminence in international television news, jointly launching a new channel in a rare commercial bet on the profit-thin global news business.NBC Sky World News is a bid to win the news services’ long-elusive international recognition and will mark Comcast’s first effort to unite its transatlantic brands since its $30bn acquisition of UK-based Sky in 2018.Andy Lack, chairman of NBC News, told the Financial Times the service would draw on a 3,500-strong combined workforce and over time hire 100-200 dedicated staff. Ten new bureaus will open worldwide, extending the NBC-Sky reporting footprint by about 50 per cent. On launch the television channel will reach 130m households.Aside from state-backed entities willing to burn money to gain soft power, few companies have dared challenge CNN International and BBC World News in global television news, a business with no accurate viewing figures and a limited pool of advertisers.For years the situation left NBC deeply frustrated at its inability to convert its US news clout — NBC and MSNBC boast some of America’s most-watched network and cable news shows — into worldwide prominence.“We’ve longed for an international channel,” Mr Lack said. “Going back to the Gulf war when CNN essentially came on to the scene, we knew then at NBC that if you weren’t in the 24-hour news business globally, you weren’t really in the news business. So when I first went to NBC in 1993 it was like, goddamn, how do we get one of those?”That opportunity finally arose with Comcast’s 2018 purchase of Sky, the pan-European broadcaster that owns Sky News. The takeover provided a European infrastructure to build on — NBC Sky World News will be based at Sky’s Osterley campus on the outskirts of London, housed in the Rupert Murdoch Building.The question for Comcast and NBC is whether the new venture will have the financial patience, news gathering élan and distinctive voice to cut through in a crowded market moving increasingly online. One executive at a rival channel compared the risks to a Friends episode in which Jennifer Aniston “makes a combination of trifle and shepherd’s pie”.At the helm of the operation is Deborah Turness, a British TV executive who ran NBC News through a turbulent spell between 2013 and 2017 before being given responsibility for developing its international arm.Even at her first breakfast meeting with Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts, Ms Turness recalls he “most wanted to talk about how we go about becoming a global news brand”.“That was clearly top of his mind,” she said. “He travels so much . . . he would stay in hotels and consume lots of international news and lament the fact that although he had America’s number-one news brand . . . it wasn’t global and he felt by rights that it really ought to be.”Ms Turness sees a gap in the market for a service “with a truly global perspective, that doesn’t come from a national point of view” — a veiled reference to CNN International pulling back from some overseas bureaus and relying on more content from its US channel.While its editorial plans are still under wraps, the NBC-Sky channel will be heavier on news than commentary and open to innovation with mobile technology and social media. “We must be distinctive,” Ms Turness said. “We are not going to just be churning newsreel.”For some time Mr Lack and NBC have been dogged by journalist Ronan Farrow’s claims that the network obstructed his reporting on Harvey Weinstein — an accusation NBC denies. Asked if he had any regrets, Mr Lack said: “None at all . . . I feel good about NBC’s reputation and as it relates to coming together with Sky we are excited about the work we will do together.”Some competitors are baffled by NBC’s plans given the sector’s business challenges, especially since it will be unlikely to benefit from the distribution payments that make up more than a third of CNN and BBC revenues, according to insiders.NBC Sky World News will be available online and through streaming services such as NBC’s Peacock. But rather than earn income from traditional television distribution, NBC Sky World News will probably need to pay some carriage fees if it is to approach CNN’s 388m television reach outside the US and the BBC’s 468m worldwide.BBC World News, which makes an operating loss, generated £25m in TV advertising in 2019 and £21m in licence fees paid for its channel. CNN International does not disclose its accounts, but revenues are in the range of $350m-$450m, according to people familiar with the company.“Why go into a sector as mature as international television news?” asked one news executive in the sector. “One thing is for sure: it isn’t to make money. It is like football clubs. It’s good for players and fans, not so much for the owners.”The Lack-Turness duo have experimented in the sector before, with mixed results. In a 2017 deal worth roughly $30m, NBC bought a 25 per cent stake in struggling channel Euronews with the aim of “changing the landscape of international news”. Although NBC will remain a shareholder, the Sky acquisition totally shifted the focus of effort.Mr Lack brims with confidence about his parent company’s “real and long-lasting” commitment to making the service a success. “This isn’t work for the faint-hearted,” he said, but added that with Comcast behind them “we will be fine”.Under the arrangements, the new service will share reporters, video feeds and resources with the NBC family of news outlets, including CNBC and NBC correspondents. In a nod to commitments made during the takeover, Sky News will independently decide when and where to pool resources.Mr Lack and Ms Turness remained tight-lipped about the business plans and the editorial vision for the new channel, or how it would develop a digital presence.But they acknowledge what will be the most important measure of its success. “Don’t take us too seriously as business types,” he said, adding: “It’s the journalism, stupid.”
2;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-01-16T22:37:33Z;NBC unveils streaming service that is more like TV;Comcast-owned broadcaster launches Peacock, which many customers can watch for free;Comcast’s NBCUniversal unveiled a new streaming service that will be free to many customers, separating itself from a pack of Hollywood giants looking to persuade people to pay for online television. In a presentation on Thursday, NBCU executives made their pitch for Peacock, the last major streaming debut in a flurry of product launches as media groups look to fight back against Netflix. But while Disney and AT&T’s WarnerMedia have tackled Netflix head-on through paid streaming, NBCU is taking a different tack. Comcast, the dominant US cable provider, is offering Peacock to its traditional television customers for free. Those who are not Comcast or Cox cable customers can also use a free, more limited version of Peacock with about half the content — or pay $5 a month for the full product. For $10 a month, people can watch Peacock without advertisements. Speaking from Saturday Night Live’s Studio 8H at the 30 Rock building in Manhattan, NBCUniversal chairman Steve Burke predicted there will be demand from more price-conscious consumers for a free streaming service amid the pack of competition. “We like the idea of zigging when others zag,” he said, noting that the majority of streaming viewership happens on free, ad-supported platforms like YouTube. The traditional television business has stalled, spurring media companies to re-evaluate their strategies. Comcast is the fourth major company in the past year to host a glitzy presentation for investors for an online video streaming service. Apple, Disney and WarnerMedia have all unveiled streaming services to rival Netflix costing between $5 and $15 a month. Like its rivals, Comcast anticipates its streaming business will lose money for years. The company expects Peacock to break even in 2024, when it will reach between 30m and 35m users. However Comcast's projections are less ambitious compared to its competitors — Disney expects to lure between 60m and 90m subscribers in 2024, while AT&T expects HBO Max to lure between 75m and 90m subscribers.Amid all these offerings, analysts expect that consumers will ultimately buy between three and five subscriptions. But while other services aim to imitate Netflix — spending billions of dollars to produce original, exclusive shows that people will pay to stream on-demand — NBCUniversal’s service resembles elements of traditional television. There will be live sports and news, such as access to a few Olympics shows a day, as well as a large catalogue of older sitcoms, and the service will primarily rely on advertising. Peacock also caters to passive television watching: the service will include “streaming channels”, which will function as 24/7 playlists of news or Saturday Night Live skits, to help viewers avoid searching through a platform for something to watch. Late night talk shows hosted by Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers will air on Peacock a few hours before they do on conventional television. “In some ways, we are creating the equivalent of the 21st century broadcast TV business, over the internet,” Mr Burke said.Peacock launches widely on July 15.

Analysts were looking for 75 cents on $27bn.Comcast has relied on high-speed internet growth as it loses more cable television customers every quarter.In the three months ending in September, the company added 379,000 broadband subscribers, higher than the 330,000 analysts expected.But the company bled 238,000 video subscribers — more than double the 106,000 video subscribers that had defected in the same period a year ago.Sales at NBCUniversal slipped to $8.3bn, down 3.5 per cent from a year ago, weighed by declines across cable and broadcast television as well as Universal’s film studio.Comcast is joining the streaming wars with an upcoming service, named Peacock, set to debut early next year featuring NBC hits such as The Office and Parks & Recreation.
4;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2019-07-25T11:18:06Z;Comcast earnings boosted by pick-up in broadband customers;;Comcast offset its declining television business by scooping up more broadband customers, helping the Philadelphia cable giant eclipse expectations for earnings in the second quarter.The company, which bought Sky as part of a series of media megadeals last year, reported adjusted earnings per share grew to 78 cents a share on sales of $26.9bn. Wall Street analysts were looking for 75 cents a share.Comcast and its rivals have been challenged by a shift away from traditional television and towards alternatives such as Netflix. That trend continued in the quarter: Comcast lost 224,000 video customers in the three months ended June 30, an acceleration from 140,000 a year ago. MoffettNathanson analysts said this month that Comcast, like its peers in cable, “is increasingly comfortable letting video find its own level”.Comcast has been investing in its high speed internet product, where it has added millions of new customers in the past few years, to make up for the millions of Americans who are ditching their cable boxes. The company added another 209,000 broadband customers in the quarter.However the Universal film studio weighed on results for Comcast’s NBCUniversal business. The second quarter of 2019 had a weaker film slate compared to the same period a year ago, when a blockbuster Jurassic Park sequel was in cinemas. Universal’s revenues dropped 14.8 per cent from a year ago to $1.5bn, while NBCU’s overall sales slipped 0.8 per cent to $8.2bn.Another weak spot was Sky, as Brexit and other macroeconomic uncertainty weighed on advertising sales in the quarter, which dropped 10.7 per cent to $563m.Comcast is preparing a streaming service to debut next year, joining the fight as traditional media companies such as Disney and AT&T look to do battle with Netflix. The company has snatched back the rights to The Office for its service, starting in 2021.Shares in Comcast have climbed more than 30 per cent this year, outperforming the broader equity indices.
5;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2019-06-25T16:36:24Z;Head of Dutch telecoms group quits after big blackout;KPN said Maximo Ibarra’s exit unrelated to problems that affected emergency number;The chief executive of Dutch telecoms company KPN has quit the day after a large-scale network blackout.Maximo Ibarra, who has been in the role for only a year, said he would leave at the end of September to return to Italy and take up a new executive position.The Dutch government has launched an investigation into the blackout, which knocked out the country’s emergency services number for almost four hours on Monday. It has blamed a network failure and said that the problem was not caused by a security breach.Mr Ibarra’s departure was attributed to a “pressing family matter” and was unrelated to the network problems, the company said.Mr Ibarra said: “I have been with KPN since 2017, and appointed CEO in 2018. I regret the timing, but family reasons gave me no choice. I will dedicate myself the coming months to secure a seamless transfer to my successor.”The short tenure of Mr Ibarra contrasts with his predecessors. He replaced Eelco Blok, who spent seven years as CEO. Before that, Ad Scheepbouwer ran the company for a decade.Mr Ibarra, 50, is leaving part of the way through a three-year turnround programme he unveiled in November that aims to cut costs and stabilise revenues. He spent 20 years in the Italian telecoms industry and led the integration of the Wind and Tre mobile networks there. He is expected to be named as the head of Sky Italia, part of Comcast, according to reports in the Italian press.KPN shares, which have risen 11 per cent in the past year, fell 2 per cent on the news.Siyi He, an analyst at Citi, said she expects that investment in full fibre broadband networks and industry consolidation in the Netherlands will help KPN deliver its growth targets despite Mr Ibarra’s exit. “The departure of the CEO in the middle of transformation may not be sentimentally positive at first, but we think it will unlikely derail the progress of transformation,” she said.Are you interested in the latest company news?

6;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2019-05-14T13:29:31Z;Disney to take full control of Hulu in Comcast deal ;Agreement would give video streaming service a minimum valuation of $27.5bn ;Walt Disney has struck an agreement with Comcast to take full control of Hulu, the video streaming service that rivals Netflix in the US.Comcast will sell its 33 per cent stake in Hulu to Disney as early as January 2024 at a minimum valuation for the streaming service of $27.5bn.The put/call deal will allow Disney to take operational control of Hulu immediately, while giving Comcast the chance to maximise its investment in a company it believes will continue to grow over the next five years. “Disney was keen to be the sole driver of the business and Comcast was willing to give them that in exchange for the economic upside of being a silent partner,” said a person close to the two companies. Comcast had been wrestling for several months over whether to retain a minority stake or sell its entire holding, according to one person briefed about its strategy.The person close to both companies said Tuesday’s deal was the best compromise the groups had managed to agree. Hulu was conceived in 2006 as a joint venture among traditional media companies NBCUniversal and News Corp, which were looking to get into the online video business. It has grown into a formidable rival to Netflix and Amazon, luring in subscribers with original hits such as The Handmaid’s Tale and licensing rights to old favourites including Seinfeld. The Hulu deal comes as Disney pushes into streaming with its own services due to launch this year. Bob Iger, the media group’s chief executive, said Disney was “now able to completely integrate Hulu into our direct-to-consumer business”.For Comcast, Tuesday’s agreement is a way to bet on Hulu’s continuing growth. Disney executives said last month they expected Hulu to grow from 28m subscribers to 40m-60m by 2024. Disney expects it to become profitable in 2023 or 2024. Comcast will have the option to continue investing in the business alongside Disney over the next five years, but if it decides to reduce its capital in Hulu, its stake will be diluted accordingly.The two companies said on Tuesday that whether Comcast participated or not in future investments in Hulu, its stake in the company would not fall below 21 per cent., guaranteeing it at least $5.8bn from Disney when it takes full ownership by January 2024.AT&T last month sold its 10 per cent stake in Hulu back to the company in a deal that valued the streaming service at $15bn. As part of Tuesday’s agreement, Comcast and Disney will split AT&T’s stake.While Netflix dominates video streaming with 149m subscribers worldwide, Hulu has been growing quickly, adding 3.8m subscribers in the first four months of this year.
7;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2019-04-25T11:27:48Z;Universal Studio film ‘Us’ helps boost quarterly sales at Comcast;Telecoms group seeks to offset declining pay-TV business with high-speed internet service;Hit films like Us and How to Train Your Dragon boosted Universal Studio sales at the start of the year, while parent company Comcast surpassed forecasts for earnings in the first quarter.Comcast made adjusted earnings of 76 cents a share on revenue of $26.9bn in the three months to March. Wall Street analysts predicted 68 cents on $27.3bn in sales.The Philadelphia-based telecoms group has been offsetting its declining pay-TV business with new customers for its high-speed internet service, which has padded out earnings. The trend continued in the first quarter, as Comcast reported adding another 375,000 high-speed internet subscribers. Meanwhile the company lost 121,000 video customers, an acceleration from the 96,000 it shed in the same period a year ago.Comcast and its rivals have been grappling with a shift away from traditional television and towards alternatives such as Netflix. Research group eMarketed predicts 33m US customers will “cut the cord” on their cable boxes this year, up from 27m last year.The Universal film studio was a bright spot, with revenues rising 7 per cent to $1.8bn, helped by the success of Us, the horror movie by director Jordan Peele. However sales at NBCUniversal fell 12.5 per cent compared with a year ago, when the business was boosted by the broadcasts of the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl.
8;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2019-04-10T03:57:33Z;AT&T discusses sale of HBO Europe to pay down $170bn debt;Comcast seen as potential buyer if telecoms group resolves to sell;AT&T has held internal discussions about selling the European arm of HBO, the TV network that makes Game of Thrones, as it attempts to cut its $170bn debt load, according to several current and former senior executives.HBO was seen as the crown jewel of the Time Warner media empire, which AT&T acquired last year in a $80bn deal. But there has since been discord between the Texas-based telecoms company and its New York-based media executives, which led to the departures of HBO chief executive Richard Plepler and chief revenue officer Simon Sutton. HBO Europe is one of a number of assets the telecoms group has considered selling, according to multiple people familiar with the matter, who say the prospect soured relations with veterans at the TV network.HBO, which also has divisions in Latin America and Asia, has operated in Europe for decades, licensing its programming to local broadcasters and pay-TV companies across more than 20 countries. HBO Europe, which has about 200 employees, is considered a prized asset by several executives at AT&T and WarnerMedia. In recent years it has become a competitor to Netflix in the region, pushing its own direct-to-consumer streaming service and amassing about 10m subscribers in countries including Spain, Sweden, Denmark and Poland.As well as distributing popular HBO series such as The Sopranos, it also makes popular local-language programmes and offers content made by other networks. AT&T declined to comment. But John Stankey, the longtime AT&T executive now running the rebranded WarnerMedia, said on Wednesday: “There is no truth whatsoever to the Financial Times’ story saying AT&T is or has considered selling HBO Europe. It’s completely baseless and inaccurate. HBO Europe is a valuable asset for our growth plans in Europe.”This was contradicted by several current and former senior executives who had direct knowledge of internal talks about a sale of HBO Europe. Three people added that AT&T does not want news about a potential sale to go public as it could lead to further defections at HBO.The contrasting positions highlight the unrest and turmoil that has followed the combination of two companies with very different corporate cultures. AT&T is a much larger organisation that focuses on efficiencies, while WarnerMedia aspires to creative success.AT&T’s US leadership is “so focused on the American business, they don’t see that HBO has a substantial business in Europe”, said one person close to the telecom company’s management in Europe. The Texas-based group has been considering a sale of its HBO Europe arm since November but has held no formal discussions with potential buyers, according to people familiar with the matter.Comcast-owned Sky would be an obvious buyer, according to several people at AT&T and HBO, given its existing relationship with the network. HBO content is licensed exclusively through Sky in the UK, Germany and Italy. WarnerMedia is looking to launch a streaming service to rival Netflix this year, and has touted HBO as central to this product. Since clearing the final legal hurdle in its Time Warner purchase at the end of February, AT&T has quickly left its stamp on its new media empire.The company announced a management shake-up last month, installing former NBC chairman Robert Greenblatt to run a newly integrated media business. In addition to Mr Plepler, other members of Time Warner’s old guard have left, including David Levy, chief executive of Turner, which includes channels TNT, TBS and the Cartoon Network.*This story has been updated since initial publication to include a comment from WarnerMedia’s chief executive.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
10;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2019-02-07T17:48:32Z;Broadband groups cut capital expenditure despite net neutrality win;US industry had argued that scrapping Obama-era rules would unleash investment boom;The big four US broadband companies invested less in capital projects last year than they did in 2017, undermining one of the rationales for a controversial decision by the Trump administration to remove so-called net neutrality protections.Earnings reported in recent weeks show the four companies — Verizon, AT&T, Charter Communications and Comcast — collectively undertook slightly less capital spending in 2018 than in 2017, the first time there has been a drop in three years. They spent $56.9bn in 2018, compared with $57.1bn the previous year and $56.1bn in 2016.The findings call into question one of the main arguments the industry used in its successful campaign to have the Federal Communications Commission overturn the Obama-era net neutrality regulations — a move that sparked anger among internet companies, activists and Democratic politicians. “Despite enormous tax benefits from the GOP tax scam [the tax cuts enacted by President Donald Trump], and the elimination of net neutrality rules, many of the largest ISPs invested less in broadband than in previous years,” Frank Pallone, the Democratic chairman of the House commerce committee, said on Thursday.House Democrats are keen to make this a big issue over the next two years, to support their claims that Mr Trump’s deregulation drive has hurt consumers. In a congressional hearing on Thursday, Tom Wheeler, the former chairman of the FCC, criticised the abolition of the net neutrality protections, saying: “No matter how technology develops, the essential networks must be open, just and reasonable.”Companies such as AT&T and Verizon had argued for years against net neutrality rules that forced them to treat all internet traffic equally. The companies said that without such restrictions, they would be able to charge companies more for delivering their internet traffic faster, bringing in money they could use to invest in their networks.In late 2017 Ajit Pai, the Trump-appointed FCC chairman, announced his organisation would repeal the rules, in one of the most significant pieces of deregulation undertaken by the Trump administration.Mr Pai said at the time the previous rules had “depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation”.[Net neutrality rules] depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovationHowever, the 2018 figures suggest that the change has not led to an immediate investment boom. Following the introduction of the net neutrality rules in 2015, the big four telecoms companies increased overall capital spending in both 2016 and 2017. Last year, however, investment slipped by 0.4 per cent.AT&T and Verizon, the biggest two telecoms companies in terms of customer numbers, both spent less on capital projects in 2018 than in 2017. AT&T’s investment slipped from $21.6bn to $21.3bn, while Verizon’s fell from $17.2bn to $16.7bn. Verizon said its capital spending reduction was “due to the availability of 5G equipment and the company’s more efficient capital management processes”.Comcast, which said in 2017 it would invest “well in excess” of $50bn over the next five years as a result of both the Trump tax cuts and the net neutrality changes, made $9.8bn in capital spending last year, adjusting for its acquisition of British broadcaster Sky. This was up very slightly from the $9.6bn it spent in 2017. The company’s spending just on networks increased a more sizeable 8 per cent, however.One company that did increase capital spending significantly was Sprint, which is smaller than its largest four rivals. It raised capital investment in its networks from $2.5bn in 2017 to $3.8bn last year. The company told the Financial Times that the rise “has nothing to do with net neutrality” and was instead based on a longer-term plan to invest in its networks, including a 5G mobile network.There is little expectation that capital spending will rise dramatically in 2019.Craig Moffett, a telecoms analyst and founding partner at MoffettNathanson, said: “You have to ask whether any sane person would make long-term investments based on a change in FCC policy, especially one that is subject to so much legal and political volatility.”Mr Moffett estimates the industry will increase its capital spending by 3.3 per cent this year, something he called “relatively restrained” given the favourable tax and regulatory regime the Trump administration has tried to put in place.US Telecom, the telecoms industry body, argued the effects of the FCC’s changes would be felt in the longer term. A spokesperson said: “The question is not what happens to broadband investment from one period to the next, but what long-term investment would look like under a different regulatory regime.”The FCC also defended the deregulation in a statement. “Fibre (fibreoptic internet) was made available to more new homes in 2018 than any year ever, and fixed broadband speeds increased by over 35 per cent — meaning more and more Americans are getting access to high-speed broadband. “The commission’s policies are working,” it added.The capital spending figures will add weight to the claims of internet companies such as Google and Facebook, which argued vociferously against dropping the net neutrality protections. The web browser company Mozilla has been leading a legal case against the FCC’s decision, the hearings for which began in Washington this month.Meanwhile, Democratic politicians are also keen to push the issue. Mike Doyle, a Democratic representative and member of the House commerce committee, recently told an industry conference that the repeal of the net neutrality rules had been a “massive, well-funded attack on our democratic process”, and should be investigated.
11;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2019-02-01T17:26:54Z;Entertainment One chief makes share sale;Company’s content library is now valued at £2bn;It seems that M&A is the acronym du jour for large media groups. US giant Comcast bought Sky for £30bn, while Walt Disney recently won the battle for 21st Century Fox’s media assets.This heady climate for acquisitions and an attractive content library are two reasons we remain optimistic about a potential bid for Entertainment One. The company’s library was valued at $2bn (£1.5bn) on March 31 2018, up from $1.7bn a year earlier.But it has not all been plain sailing. The way consumers view content is changing, contributing to the decline of the home entertainment market. As a result, the company is focusing increasingly on production activities.In any case, it can prove unnerving to see a director offload shares — as per chief executive Darren Throop’s recent £5.8m disposal. The company confirmed that the sale related to a personal project.Henry Boot has performed well given the various headwinds it faces. Economic uncertainty has prompted some investment decisions to be put on hold, while the flawed planning process has also acted as a drag.However, Hallam Land Management — the division that brings land through the planning process before it is sold to housebuilders — has performed well. And its joint venture housebuilder Venture Homes also achieved 145 sales in 2018, up from 79 the previous year.Recently, non-executive director Jonathan Sykes sold 125,000 shares at 247p a share. But this is not overly concerning: he still holds a non-beneficial interest in 20.7m shares or more than 15 per cent of the company’s share capital.
12;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2019-01-24T05:00:35Z;BuzzFeed to lay off 15 per cent of its workforce;News and entertainment site’s cuts come amid deteriorating climate for online publishers;BuzzFeed is to lay off 15 per cent of its staff - more than 200 jobs - amid a deteriorating climate for online publishers that has already claimed several victims.Jonah Peretti, its founder and chief executive, told BuzzFeed staff in an email seen by the Financial Times that the cuts would put the company on “a firm foundation”.They come as other publishers such as Mashable and Mic have laid off employees and scaled back operations because digital ad revenues have failed to grow as expected, with Facebook and Google the beneficiaries of most new digital ad spending. Mr Peretti said that BuzzFeed revenues had grown by double digits but that “revenue growth itself isn’t enough to be successful in the long run”. The restructuring “will reduce our costs and improve our operating model so we can thrive and control our own destiny, without ever needing to raise funding again”, he added. It is unclear which parts of the business will be affected by the cuts, which come days after Janine Gibson, BuzzFeed’s UK editor in chief, stepped down after three and half years in charge. BuzzFeed split its operations into separate news and entertainment units in 2016, a move which appeared to presage a sale or more permanent separation. Last year Ben Smith, BuzzFeed’s editor, had discussions with Emerson Collective, the company started by Laurene Powell Jobs, about investing in the news division. The talks did not lead to a deal.Mr Peretti recently floated the idea of a merger between BuzzFeed and another publisher, telling the New York Times that it made sense for five or six of the largest players in the space to merge. Mr Peretti said there would be safety in scale, mentioning Vice Media, Vox Media, Group Nine and Refinery29 as companies that were doing “interesting work”. His comments came amid shrinking valuations for digital news groups, with some missing revenue targets. Vice was among those hit, with Walt Disney, which bought a 10 per cent stake in Vice for about $400m in 2015, recently writing down the value of its investment by $157m. BuzzFeed has missed revenue targets in recent years, as has Vice, which has hit sentiment around the once hot sector. Traditional media companies were among the investors that once jostled to buy into the space, with Comcast’s NBC Universal acquiring significant stakes in BuzzFeed and Vox and Disney buying a 10 per cent stake in Vice.
13;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2019-01-23T12:40:29Z;Comcast boosted by strong broadband subscriber growth;;Comcast offset its declining pay-TV business by adding high-speed internet customers, helping the US cable giant beat forecasts for profits and revenues for the fourth quarter.Comcast has been investing in its high speed internet product, where it has added millions of new customers in the past few years. The company added another 351,000 high-speed internet customers in the fourth quarter — about the same pace as a year ago, and 1.35m for all of 2018.This helped power a beat on quarterly profits and sales. Excluding the impact of a one-time tax benefit that had lifted results in the year-ago quarter, Comcast made adjusted earnings of 64 cents a share on revenue of $27.8bn in the fourth quarter. Wall Street analysts were looking for 62 cents a share on $27.6bn in sales.The Philadelphia-based company lost another 29,000 video customers in the three months ending in December. For the full year, Comcast bled 370,000 cable TV subscribers, an acceleration from 2017, when it had lost 151,000.In the US, Comcast and its peers have been pressured by the disruption from Netflix. Research group eMarketer expects 33m Americans will this year “cut the cord” on their traditional TV service in favour of streaming, accelerating from 27m last year.Shares in Comcast were up more than 3 per cent in premarket trading.The Universal film studio weighed on results for Comcast’s NBCUniversal unit. Adjusted earnings at Universal dropped 24 per cent to $179m, which Comcast said reflected higher operating costs. However profits at NBCU as a whole climbed more than 12 per cent to $2.1bn in the quarter, helped by strength in broadcast television.Comcast also reported financial results for Sky for the first time since acquiring the UK pay-TV company last year. Sky reported adjusted earnings of $765m on $5bn in sales.
14;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-12-27T14:00:23Z;Sky/Comcast: waiter service;Best and worst deals of 2018: good things come to those who wait;War and Peace seems positively succinct compared with the tale of Sky’s sale for £37bn. The business first received a bid — from News Corp — in 2010. Comcast clinched the purchase of the UK broadcaster this September. A full account of the machinations of magnates and ministers could fill volumes. For Sky investors, the takeaway is simple: all shall come to he or she who waits.By the time the Murdoch family resumed its attempt to take full control of Sky in 2016, the broadcaster had fallen from favour on the London market. The slickly managed group was too small to prosper in an age of giants. Well-funded rivals, notably BT, were pushing up the price of sports rights. Pundits — Lex included — saw the 39 per cent stake already held by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox as an obstacle to competing bids for Sky.Comcast called that bluff. The US cable group was willing to contemplate controlling Sky with Disney, purchaser of Fox’s entertainment assets, as a minority investor. Comcast could not have integrated Sky and obtained the full benefits it sought. But nor could Disney have expected any dividends. Comcast was willing to pay £17.28 a share for Sky. That compared with Fox’s opening bid of £10.75.Topped in a blind auction, Disney agreed to sell the Sky stake. The deal shows that fear loosens purse strings as readily as greed. Comcast’s business model is imperilled as customers ditch cable in favour of online video. Sky’s content and customers could help the group survive the shift. A resilient, well-run company will generally be worth something to someone, even if the market has de-rated it.Lex files this deal under “good”. It certainly is for Sky investors, implying a hefty enterprise value of 15 times ebitda. However, that was also the multiple Disney agreed to pay in its $71bn acquisition of Fox entertainment businesses. Comcast’s debts will be steep but not unmanageable. The split of assets gives both US corporations greater scope to build online muscle.Deal watchers relish the audacity of Comcast boss Brian Roberts. He raided the market for one-third of Sky, faced down the mighty Mouse and all for a transaction he jokes a London cabbie talked him into.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
15;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-12-20T12:23:37Z;Jeremy Darroch scans new horizons for Sky under Comcast;Chief’s initial focus will be on content collaboration with NBC in news and sports;"Jeremy Darroch is recalling the conversation he had with Rupert Murdoch three months ago when Comcast beat Walt Disney in a high-stakes auction to acquire Sky. “It was certainly emotional,” the Sky chief executive says, becoming a little emotional himself at the memory.The sale would end Mr Murdoch’s long association with the pay-TV company he founded in 1989, but Mr Darroch is sticking around, with Comcast enlisting him and his management team to plot the next phase of its growth.Comcast paid £30bn for Sky, a price that makes it the most valuable UK company to be sold in the past 30 years. Its sale also marks a turning point in UK media.Mr Murdoch launched Sky to challenge the hegemony of UK broadcasting and the company initially had strictly domestic concerns, its main competition being cable operators and free-to-air rivals such as the BBC and ITV. But the media industry has globalised, with “over the top” streaming players such as Netflix and Amazon competing with Sky for viewer attention.Sky is now part of a larger company, adding its European operations in markets that include the UK, Germany and Italy to Comcast’s operations. Comcast is the largest provider of cable television and broadband internet services in the US and also owns NBC Universal.“The priority for the combined business is to exploit what we’ve put together,” said Mr Darroch. This would initially mean content tie-ups with NBC. “If you think of the US midterm elections, [Sky News] would be using a lot of agency [reporting]. NBC would have 300 people [working on it] and suddenly we have access to that.”There are other opportunities in sports coverage. “You can think of the Premier League, the Ryder Cup in golf, NFL . . . there are lots of ways to collaborate. For example, can we get their best NBC commentators to Sky for the London NFL games?”Sky would also draw on Comcast’s leading position in internet provision as it added broadband services in Italy. “We can now plug into the Comcast cable development team and cherry-pick some of their best ideas and use it there.”Beyond greater collaboration, an immediate goal “is to get the debt levels down a bit” — Comcast’s net debt increased to more than $100bn so it could finance the Sky purchase.Mr Darroch is aware that a new era in media competition is about to begin. Disney is working on a global direct-to-consumer streaming service, which will deliver content such as Marvel and Star Wars movies as well as television programming. AT&T, the new owner of Time Warner, is also developing a streaming service, which will include programming from HBO.Claire Enders, of Enders Analysis, said any company hoping to launch a streaming service in Europe would have to talk to Sky and Comcast because of their scale and reach as distributors. “There isn’t room for a successful subscription video on-demand service in any market unless it is on all the cable infrastructure,” she said, in a nod to distribution deals Netflix has struck with Sky and others in the UK and Comcast in the US.Mr Darroch appears to agree. “The idea that you can launch a streaming service and just put it out there and then for it to naturally scale is, I think, a real stretch. You need retail operations to make that happen and we’ve got it all here.”He joined Sky as chief financial officer in 2004, working for then chief executive James Murdoch, succeeding him in that role three years later.“I remember looking at Sky when I joined and it was a great business but it was rapidly running out of road. It was in danger of losing its ambition.”He and James Murdoch wanted to “reset” Sky as a growth business. “We seemed to be saying 7m customers was our ambition.” A target of 10m subscribers was set; today the company is in 13m households in the UK, a number that rises to 23m when its European operations are included.Comcast’s successful bid has also made Mr Darroch very wealthy. He sold his holding of Sky shares for £13.4m on completion of the deal, as well as shares that he received as part of an executive incentive plan for an additional £24.9m, according to a stock market filing.Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, has promised to allow Mr Darroch to run Sky as he sees fit. The relationship with Rupert Murdoch has not been completely severed: last week Comcast named Sky’s studio building after him during a ceremony at its headquarters in west London. Mr Murdoch, Mr Roberts and Mr Darroch then dined together that night.Mr Murdoch is the antithesis of the short-term view that Mr Darroch says is prevalent among UK institutional investors. “He likes risk-takers. When I first met him before I joined Sky I went to New York to have lunch with him. He was in his early 70s then and all he wanted to talk about was where the world was going to be in 20 years.”Jeremy Darroch appointed Sky chief financial officerSky acquires Easynet to launch broadband serviceDarroch succeeds James Murdoch as chief executiveSky unveils Sky Go mobile serviceLaunches Now TV streaming serviceAcquires Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia for £5bnLaunches Sky Mobile and streaming service in SpainComcast beats Walt Disney in auction for Sky with £30bn offer"

European regulators have approved the deal — with the condition that Disney sell some of the European channels it controls — while the transaction was also cleared by US regulators, provided Disney sell 21st Century Fox’s regional sports networks.The deal, when complete, will broaden Disney’s portfolio of intellectual property, giving it characters and franchises ranging from X-Men and Avatar to Toy Story, Mickey Mouse and Han Solo. It will also give it channels such as FX and National Geographic, as well as the Fox movie studio and library.Disney had hoped to acquire Sky, the European media group in which Fox held a 39 per cent stake, but sold the shares to Comcast after the US cable operator won an auction for the business.Comcast, which also owns NBC Universal, has completed its purchase of Sky, which recently delisted from the London Stock Exchange. The two deals set the stage for a new round of global competition between Disney and Comcast as they grapple with the threat posed by streaming players such as Amazon and Netflix.Shares in Disney rose 0.8 per cent in recent trading, while Fox jumped 3.2 per cent.
17;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-11-07T05:00:27Z;Comcast sets its sights on European pay-TV market;US group to target 60% of households without pay-TV after £30bn Sky takeover;US cable group Comcast has set its sights on the 60 per cent of European households without a pay-TV subscription following the completion of its £30bn takeover of Sky.In a joint interview, Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, and Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s chief executive, pointed to the “headroom” for subscriber growth in Europe — as well as the prospect of selling other products and services to Sky’s 26m customers.“The big story in Europe is headroom [for growth] with 40 per cent of people having pay-TV,” Mr Darroch said.He and Mr Roberts declined to comment on which countries they would target for the next phase of Sky’s expansion. The company has operations in the UK and Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria and recently expanded into Spain with a digital service that does not require a satellite dish. Analysts expect this model to be deployed in other new markets.Sky delists from the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday, bringing an end to its 30-year run as an independent company. Mr Roberts said its integration with Comcast had begun, pointing to adverts Sky channels will run for The Grinch, a new animated movie distributed by Comcast’s Universal movie studio.We think of Sky as the third leg of the stool along with Comcast and NBCUniversalThe promotion is in line with Comcast’s “Symphony” programme through which it promotes movies from Universal across its NBC broadcast network and portfolio of cable channels.The group recently said it would suspend a share buyback programme until 2019 in order to complete a bond sale — the fourth largest on record — to borrow $26bn to fund the Sky purchase.“The deal is paid for,” Mr Roberts said, adding that Wall Street investors had initially misunderstood Sky’s appeal for Comcast: some analysts had initially dismissed the company because of its origins as a satellite operator. Sky now offers broadband, mobile and streaming services, as well as pay-TV.“One of the things that attracted us to Sky was its content position, both in content creation and content partnerships” with companies such as HBO, Mr Roberts said. “We think of Sky as the third leg of the stool along with Comcast and NBCUniversal. As a standalone business it has always grown. Together with our platform, we are both better as a result.”Mr Darroch, who has agreed a new contract with Comcast to stay on as Sky chief executive, said the company would benefit from being part of a larger business “from a capital allocation perspective”.The company had three goals, he added. “How do we get to more customers, how do we sell more services to those customers and how do we enter new markets?”The company has identified 6m households in its existing markets that it can target with its streaming service. He added that there would be other new markets “to come” following its expansion into Spain but declined to give details.
18;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-11-06T18:22:25Z;Disney gains EU approval for Fox deal;;Walt Disney has promised to sell some European channels in order to secure EU approval for its $71bn purchase of Twenty-First Century Fox.European authorities worried the tie-up would eliminate a strong supplier in drama, documentary and scientific programmes in the European Economic Area. The concerns were assuaged by Disney’s commitment to sell its History, H2, Crime & Investigation, Blaze and Lifetime channels in the EEA.No further asset sales were required as the EU’s competition commission concluded Sony, Universal and Warner Bros would continue to provide significant competition in the markets for film production and distribution as well as the distribution of TV content.The deal was at the heart of a drawn-out takeover battle which ended with Disney securing a deal to buy Fox in July, beating out rival Comcast who subsequently agreed to buy Fox’s 39 per cent stake in broadcaster Sky.Comcast and Disney both sought to bulk up in order to take on Netflix, Amazon and other digital companies that have disrupted traditional media businesses.US officials cleared the Disney-Fox deal in June, after the companies promised to sell 22 of Fox’s regional sports networks to mitigate their competition concerns.
19;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-10-28T18:35:43Z;Megyn Kelly: a star of the Trump Age wanes at NBC;Gamble of bringing a Fox News provocateur to a more liberal audience failed to pay off;"The 2016 presidential election made Megyn Kelly the biggest star in television news. This week she was dropped from NBC with a two-sentence statement.After confronting Donald Trump during a campaign debate over his treatment of women the longtime Fox News anchor won plaudits from across the political spectrum, her new-found mainstream appeal landing her on the covers of Vanity Fair and the New York Times magazines. Roger Ailes, whom she would later help oust from Fox News over sexual harassment allegations, declared Ms Kelly could become “bigger than anyone” in US television.Last year Ms Kelly left Fox News for NBC, the broadcaster. The move made headlines for its price tag — she turned down a $20m offer from Rupert Murdoch, which would have made her the industry’s highest paid presenter. But it also rattled the news landscape, raising questions about whether her skewering, “non-PC” interview style, fine-tuned over a decade at Fox News, would work in a softer daytime environment where personalities such as Ellen DeGeneres have thrived. US television news is driven by big personalities and it is not unusual for presenters to switch networks. Yet this was a gamble. A year-and-a-half later, it has failed. On Tuesday, Ms Kelly made comments on-air defending white people dressing up in blackface for Halloween. She was admonished both within and outside of NBC. On Wednesday she opened her programme by apologising, and at the close of the show said: “we’ll see you tomorrow”. She did not return on Thursday. On Friday, NBC confirmed that her show would not be back. Ms Kelly is still negotiating an exit; her contract is reported to be worth $69m. NBC had thought: ‘well we're accused of being liberal, so what a coup to take someone like this who is a little nuanced’. But you can’t take the most moderate part of Fox and translate it to NBCHer swift downfall is the latest drama in a tumultuous few years for NBC’s news business under the leadership of Andrew Lack, who had fought hard to bring Ms Kelly to NBC. He said at the time that he “didn’t invest in her because of her ‘star power’”, but because she was a “serious journalist”.It also reflects the cut-throat world of television, in which even the biggest names can be ousted from their perch if ratings do not deliver. Ms Kelly had been drawing 2.7m viewers to her popular Fox News show, The Kelly File. But she never quite found her footing at NBC: Today’s 9am ratings sank when Ms Kelly took over last year, from 2.8m to about 2.3m viewers through September, according to Nielsen data. Early episodes were panned by critics, while she also clashed with celebrity guests including Jane Fonda and Debra Messing. JPMorgan pulled its advertising when Ms Kelly decided to interview Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist, on a Sunday night programme. That Sunday show was later dropped.Ken Doctor, analyst at Newsonomics, says that NBC’s failed experiment is proof that “audiences don’t always travel with presenters”. “Kelly was hired early in the Trump Age, and we had no idea how audience loyalties would morph.” he says. “NBC had thought: ‘well we're accused of being liberal, so what a coup to take someone like this who is a little nuanced’. But you can’t take the most moderate part of Fox and translate it to NBC.”From a public relations perspective, “It’s an easy call for NBC to get rid of her,” says Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W, a public relations agency. “You can’t lose when you say you're firing someone over blackface.”The question remains whether Mr Lack will face repercussions for this $69m mistake. Observers were quick to point out that Ms Kelly had been accused of making racist statements in the past, making her hire a liability from the start. Don Lemon, a lead anchor on CNN, on Thursday said “it is partially the fault of the people who hired her . . . Megyn’s record . . . it’s all there. All you have to do is do a Google search.”NBC News has already been coping with the loss of its morning programme’s longest-serving host, Matt Lauer, who was fired last November following claims of inappropriate sexual behaviour. The company had also come under fire this year for its decision not to air an explosive investigation by Ronan Farrow into allegations of abuse by Harvey Weinstein. The report was later published in the New Yorker magazine, where it won a Pulitzer Prize. The event put Ms Kelly further at odds with NBC management, as she called on-air for NBC to hire an outside lawyer to investigate Mr Lack for passing on the story. Today continues to be a profit centre for NBC and its parent Comcast, the largest US cable company, generating about $500m in advertising revenue a year according to Kantar Media. Viewership at MSNBC, NBC’s cable news network, has soared, powered by the popularity of hosts such as Rachel Maddow. But excluding the impact of the 2016 Olympics, advertising revenue for NBC’s broadcast networks — NBC and Telemundo — declined about 2 per cent last year to $5.6bn, which Comcast attributed to “continued declines in audience ratings”. NBC and its peers are under pressure as they prepare for a future where most people will watch programmes not through a high-priced television subscription but through streaming video. NBC has made its own push into digital delivery with partnerships with Snapchat and BuzzFeed. Wall Street analysts say that Comcast investors are unlikely to be fazed by this latest crisis. “I doubt that heads will roll over this, besides Megyn’s,” says Jonathan Chaplan, an analyst at New Street Research who covers Comcast. “$69m may seem like a high cost but it is insignificant in the context of . . . Comcast’s calculated bets. They have lost a great deal more money on their investment in Snap at the IPO than they have on Megyn Kelly.”As for Ms Kelly, Mr Torossian calls her “fairly untouchable” now. The 47-year-old’s mainstream approval had come from tackling the subject of sexual harassment, becoming an unlikely champion for women in the workplace just before the #metoo movement took hold. Describing in her memoir the decision to come forward about abuse by Roger Ailes, former chief of Fox News, Ms Kelly said “by this point in my career, Roger could not destroy me”. It is unclear whether her career is now destroyed. Mr Doctor points to the ordeal as indicative of a peculiar time in American society. “The president could have gotten away with saying this. If Trump had [made these comments] at a MAGA rally, it would have just been more of what you expect. But not a news presenter at NBC,” he says. “It’s a weird cultural moment we are in.”"
20;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-10-25T16:05:53Z;Comcast looks to Sky deal as US cord cutting hits home;Cable group upbeat about acquisition but results point to grim outlook for set-box TV;Comcast will retain Jeremy Darroch as chief executive of Sky after Comcast clears its near $40bn acquisition of Britain’s largest pay-TV company, which was defended by the US group.On an earnings call following results that showed heavy cable TV subscriber losses, Mr Darroch and Comcast’s chief Brian Roberts confirmed the plans as they justified the deal they say will reshape the global media landscape. Mr Roberts touted Sky’s achievements while describing Sky as “maybe misunderstood and mispriced”.“In the case of Sky, Rupert Murdoch figured out a long time ago that television was going to transform itself,” he said. Mr Roberts called the Sky acquisition a “monumental moment” that will “open up scale and innovation and . . . ultimately shareholder value”.Comcast’s quarterly results underscored why the largest US cable company will pay a hefty price for Sky, a TV player dominant in Europe where cord-cutting has been less severe than the US.In the US, Comcast and its peers in the business of piping television to homes have been heavily pressured by the insurgence of Netflix. Research group eMarketer expects 33m Americans will this year “cut the cord” on their traditional TV service in favour of streaming, accelerating from 27m last year. Comcast lost another 106,000 video customers in the three months ending in September, although this was better than the 154,000 Wall Street analysts had expected. So far this year, Comcast has bled 342,000 cable TV subscribers, an acceleration from the same period last year, when it had lost 118,000.The results come a day after rival AT&T revealed 300,000 US television customers had ditched their TV subscriptions, sparking fresh fears about the future of legacy media groups and sending AT&T’s stock to its worst showing in 16 years. Comcast’s pay-TV losses were “better than expected . . . which demonstrates that AT&T’s woes are specifically AT&T’s,” said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research. Shares in Comcast were up 4.7 per cent in morning trading on Thursday, after a poor year-to-date performance. Despite the grim outlook for set-box TV, Comcast handily surpassed forecasts for profits and revenues, helped by the success of its high-speed internet business. The company reported adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share on revenues of $22.1bn. Analysts were looking for earnings of 61 cents on sales of $21.8bn. While rivals AT&T and Disney are investing in content to take on Netflix with their own streaming services, Comcast has founded success in improving its high-speed internet business, which has helped offset losses in TV. Comcast added 363,000 high-speed internet customers in the quarter — 70 per cent more than the same period a year ago.Mr Roberts told analysts on a call that “there’s been a bit of a rush to say ‘oh the traditional television business is over and we have to get into streaming’.” “We think it’s challenging economically and we don’t want to rush into anything,” he added. The Universal film studio weighed on profits for NBCUniversal in the quarter. Adjusted earnings at Universal dropped 44 per cent to $214m, which Comcast said reflected a weaker film line-up compared with last year. Adjusted earnings at NBCUniversal fell 8.5 per cent to $2.1bn.The results come after a summer of jockeying between Comcast and its media rivals. Comcast lost a high-stakes battle with Disney over 21 Century Fox’s prized entertainment assets, but in September triumphed over 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney in the auction for Sky. 
21;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;In the M&A market, this time really might be different;There are signs investors are getting better at punishing bad deals;Mergers and acquisitions activity is booming. The record levels of 2017 have already been outstripped so far in 2018. With broader financial markets becoming distinctly jittery, not only those who remember the heady, pre-crisis days of 2007 are questioning whether the M&A market is riding for a fall — or checks and balances in the system are working better this time.There are definitely warning flags. Valuations in certain sectors are stretched. Money is still cheap but is becoming more expensive. And the very length of this M&A bull market — nine years and counting — suggests it is due a reversal.Some of the mega-deals that have been announced, moreover, make questionable long-term sense. Comcast’s £37bn acquisition of Sky, or Walmart’s $16bn purchase of Flipkart, look less like examples of visionary thinking than attempts to respond to disruptive domestic challengers by buying themselves out of obsolescence.But there are crucial differences to the past. In 2007, valuations were high, but the mix of deals was different. Highly leveraged and stock-financed transactions made up more of the total. The €71bn acquisition by Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis and Santander of ABN Amro, now seen as the peak of pre-crisis hubris, is only the best-known example of overvalued banks buying another overpriced bank.While some sectors, such as tech and pharmaceuticals, today look toppy, these constitute only a fifth of all deals since January 2017, according to Dealogic.Deals in other sectors, such as industrials, remain on more defensible multiples. One indicator of a bull market about to peak is when most deals use (often expensive) stock to finance their acquisitions, but at present the ratio of cash to stock deployed is a comfortable four to one. Even if some deals look like the death throes of fatally disrupted goliaths, many others have genuine industrial logic — for example, BP’s $10.5bn purchase of BHP Billiton’s shale assets in July.The damping of animal spirits by the prospect of US-China tension turning into a global trade war may also be having a calming effect. Transactions in the third quarter have started to fall. The overall statistics have been distorted by a few mega-deals— $50bn worth were announced on September 24 alone.It is always dangerous when a new generation of market actors believes it is smarter than its forebears. Bust has followed boom in financial markets with depressing regularity. There are, however, some signs that the broader market today is better at punishing bad deals.Boards have remained very risk-averse since the financial crisis, and directors are warier of deals likely to embroil them in regulatory or competitive tangles. Investors, meanwhile, are having more success in ending bad ones. A quarter of announced deals since January 2017, totalling $1.5tn, have failed to cross the finish line.A further crucial difference between now and 1999 or 2007 is the much greater role played by activist investors. There are numerous examples of activists forcing companies not to do dilutive transactions, such as Corvex, a hedge fund, scuttling Clariant’s planned takeover of Huntsman. Activist Insight, a research firm, says nearly half of campaigns aimed at opposing a deal since 2013 have been successful.Suggesting that markets have become more efficient than in past booms is often an indicator in itself that a correction is imminent. There is reason to believe, though, that this time really could be different.

Led by Jeremy Darroch and his superb team — now together with Comcast — our combined global leadership in technology and content paves the way for us to accelerate investment and growth in Sky’s brand and premier platforms,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive. He added the company was “fully committed” to Sky News and would maintain “its editorial independence”.Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s chief executive, said the company would work with Comcast “to achieve further growth and development of Sky’s business”.He added that Sky News would “benefit greatly” from Comcast’s funding commitments over coming years and arrangements put in place “to preserve and enhance its editorial independence”.
23;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-10-03T00:18:21Z;Comcast clinches one of biggest ever bond issues for Sky deal;Blockbuster issue raises $27bn after attracting orders of $88bn;Comcast borrowed $27bn to fund the US cable group’s £30.6bn ($39.7bn) acquisition of pan-European broadcaster Sky on Tuesday, clinching the fourth largest corporate bond sale on record.Investor orders for the sale, which follows a protracted takeover battle in which Comcast and its rival Walt Disney scrapped for control of Sky, climbed to $88bn before banks closed their books, according to two people with knowledge of the sale.The surge of orders prompted the company to increase the size of the blockbuster bond sale by $7bn after initially marketing the borrowing at $20bn. The ravenous appetite for high-quality corporate debt comes at a time when the durability of the US economic expansion has been called into question by an intensifying trade war with China and rising interest rates.Comcast raised the funds across 12 tranches of floating- and fixed-rate bonds, ranging from two- to 40-year maturities. The $4bn of new 30-year bonds, which were said to have attracted the strongest interest from investors, priced with a yield 150 basis points above the benchmark US Treasury, or at roughly 4.71 per cent.The company’s outstanding debt that matures in 2048 traded on Tuesday with a yield of 4.56 per cent, according to bond trading platform MarketAxess.Bankers leading the sale were able to lower the yields on the debt as they topped up investor orders. At $27bn, the Comcast bond sale trails only the debt offerings of Verizon, Anheuser-Busch InBev and CVS Health by size.The sale arrives as overall bond issuance this year has slowed from 2017, a year that saw a high-water mark. Companies took advantage of record-low financing costs and raised more than $4.3tn through debt offerings, according to data provider Dealogic.But that deluge of borrowing has weighed on the overall credit quality of the $9tn US corporate bond market, and the amount of debt rated triple-B — the lowest investment grade tier — has swollen. That deterioration has increased the relative attractiveness of Comcast debt, which is rated A-minus by S&P Global and Moody’s.Andrew Forsyth, a portfolio manager with BNP Paribas Asset Management, said Comcast needed to fulfil promises to the rating agencies to de-lever, “but when you model off their cash flows, they have a pretty clear runway to do so”.Matthew Brill, the head of US investment-grade credit at asset manager Invesco, added that strong demand for longer-dated Comcast bonds was partly driven by corporate pension funds. US companies have made large pension contributions this year to take advantage of higher tax deductions. and those pension plans tend to invest in bonds with maturities longer than 10 years.And Mr Brill added: “With equity prices where they are, there are definitely signs of a rotation out of equities and into fixed income given overall credit markets are near this 4 per cent yield.”Bank of America and Wells Fargo led the bond offering, alongside Credit Suisse, Mizuho Securities, MUFG and SMBC Nikko.

Tesla will shortly reveal end of quarter sales figures that Mr Musk has pledged will finally make the company profitable.In a statement issued by Tesla on Thursday night after the suit was filed, Mr Musk said: “This unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed. I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.”US cable company Comcast saw off 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney in the battle for Sky with a £30.6bn bid that will redraw the global media landscape.Comcast’s offer of £17.28 a share beat a rival £15.67 bid from Fox, which was backed by Disney, and came in the final round of an auction for the broadcaster. The Comcast bid, which valued Sky at almost £4bn more than the Disney-Fox bid, brings an end to Rupert Murdoch’s association with Sky, which he founded in 1989, and which ushered in the pay-TV era in the UK.Comcast is the largest broadband company in the US with 26m users on its cable network and it derives half of its profit from internet access. Sky has 6m broadband customers in the UK, 24 per cent of the market.The US cable group is now seen as a potential consolidator of European broadband. Senior industry executives have argued in private that in the absence of a big merger in UK telecoms, such as Vodafone and Virgin Media or Three and O2 in mobile, it could be Comcast that forces the issue.Banco Santander named Andrea Orcel, UBS’s investment banking head, as its next chief executive on Tuesday, highlighting the shift in power at the world’s top financial institutions from trading and advisory services to commercial banking.The appointment will be seen as an indication that the Spanish lender is ready to embark on acquisitions, potentially bulking up in the US. Italian Mr Orcel, above, has reshaped UBS’s investment bank since joining in July 2012, cutting more than half its balance sheet and thousands of jobs.The appointment throws into question the future direction and leadership of UBS, where the veteran City dealmaker was seen as a candidate to succeed chief executive Sergio Ermotti.More broadly, Mr Orcel’s move underscores the waning attraction of investment banking since the 2008 financial crisis — tougher regulations have sapped the profitability and diminished the allure of the world’s top advisory and trading groups while the biggest consumer and commercial banks such as Santander have fared better.Mr Orcel, who has advised Santander’s ruling Botín family for more than 20 years, is leaving the Swiss bank on September 30. He will replace José Antonio Alvarez, who has been CEO of Santander since January 2015 and moves to a vice-chairman role.Instagram’s founding fathers, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, are to quit the photo-sharing app they sold to Facebook for $1bn six years ago.Their departure comes at a time of change for Facebook, which has lost several senior executives following concerns about fake news and data privacy. It also follows a shake-up of the group’s executive ranks after Chris Cox, a member of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s inner circle, was put in charge of the “family of apps” that includes Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.They follow WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton out of the door, who quit earlier this year after clashing with Mr Zuckerberg over privacy and data protection in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch, head of communications, Elliot Schrage, and vice-president of partnerships, Dan Rose, also announced their departures over the summer.The Danske Bank whistleblower who alerted the Danish lender to a €200bn money-laundering scheme was identified as a British executive working in its Estonian branch.Howard Wilkinson, head of markets in Estonia from 2007 to 2014, warned managers in late 2013 that the bank had breached “numerous regulatory requirements . . . [and had] a near total process failure”, according to emails seen by the FT.Lawyers for Mr Wilkinson called on Danish and Estonian watchdogs to protect him complaining his identity had been leaked without his consent.Danske is reeling from the fallout of the €200bn money-laundering scandal, which has already cost the chief executive, Thomas Borgen, his job and has prompted Danish regulators to reopen their investigation and criminal prosecutors in Denmark to launch a probe. Other authorities in Estonia and the United Kingdom have related investigations, while authorities in Switzerland and — most worryingly for the bank given their history of swingeing fines — the US are reported to be circling.Michael Korswent shopping for Versace, picking up the family-owned Milanese fashion house for €1.83bn ($2.1bn) including debt as it looks to reinvent itself as a purveyor of “made in Europe” high luxury. The US group plans to ramp up online revenues and sales of high-margin accessories at Versace, pitting it against LVMH, Kering and Richemont.John Idol, chief executive, who oversaw Michael Kors’ acquisition of Jimmy Choo for $1.2bn last year, said the high luxury market was faster growing and offered a more “sustainable market” than the lower-priced accessible luxury represented by the eponymous Michael Kors brand.Michael Kors, which will be renamed Capri Holdings once the deal is completed, had struggled for several years after like-for-like sales slowed and discounting intensified at retailers seeking to woo customers.
25;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-28T03:00:46Z;Rupert Murdoch’s Sky adventure reaches end of the road;But ‘New Fox’ has the potential to become a sizeable player in US media;After almost 30 years Rupert Murdoch is selling Sky, one of his most treasured assets, as part of the dismantling of an entertainment empire that took him decades to assemble. The confirmation this week that his 21st Century Fox group would sell its 39 per cent stake in Sky to Comcast represents the end of an era for pay-television in Europe.It would have been unthinkable even a year ago to imagine Mr Murdoch severing his ties with Sky. He had a strong emotional bond with the company and it almost bankrupted him in its first years of operation. But it went on to become a central part of his empire, revolutionising English football, giving the BBC a run for its money in news and providing much-needed competition to broadband providers when it began offering internet services 12 years ago.Mr Murdoch and his children exit with a small fortune, but this does not draw the curtain on their involvement in media. Yes, the family will not have any television investments in the UK, Germany or Italy, where Sky operates. It will also no longer be directly involved in Hollywood content creation, having sold its film and television production assets to Walt Disney in a $70bn deal.But “New Fox”, the name given to the company Mr Murdoch and his eldest son Lachlan will run, has the potential to become a sizeable player in US media. It has kept its Los Angeles base, which includes the 50-acre movie studio lot and its 15 stages, although most of the space will be leased to Disney as part of its purchase of the Fox production businesses. New Fox will also house the assets not being sold to Disney — namely the Fox sports channels, US broadcast network and Fox News Channel, its polarising but highly profitable news and conservative opinion network.This combination of assets will generate free cash flow of more than $2bn a year, which raises the question of what the Murdochs plan to do with the money. They will initially pursue a live sport strategy and have accumulated a hefty portfolio of sports rights — including NFL American football, Ultimate Fighting Championship and World Wrestling Entertainment. But the broadcast network will need programming to run in between all that sport. Will they get back into the content business and buy a production company?Sony Pictures Entertainment, the studio behind shows such as Breaking Bad, would be one option. Lionsgate, the producer of Mad Men, Walking Dead and other hits might be another. Or New Fox could develop its own production entity. Netflix went from a standing start to the biggest producer of content in Hollywood in a matter of years. New Fox could take a page out of its book.Making its own original content for the Fox broadcast network would be more economical than paying a premium for entertainment produced by other companies. It would also generate a second revenue stream: programming could be sold to other networks, channels and streaming services.Lachlan will steer New Fox as chief executive. His brother James is leaving the family fold but it is unclear what he will do next. He is a board member of Tesla and may do something with his friend, the film producer and director Matthew Vaughn. An investment fund is also a possibility, according to people who know him.Reuniting New Fox with News Corp, the home of Mr Murdoch’s print assets such as the Wall Street Journal and The Times, has been mentioned as a possible move for Mr Murdoch. But this is unlikely in the short term — getting New Fox up and running is his main goal. It has better growth prospects than News Corp, which continues to grapple with the woes afflicting the news industry, although it has diversified its revenue base with a move into digital real estate services.Yes, the sun has set on the Murdochs’ involvement with Sky. They have broken up the family empire and its international businesses, with Star of India going to Disney as part of the asset sale. But the Murdochs will continue to be a major media force. The cash generation capability of New Fox, and the ability of live sport to attract viewers and advertising dollars, means Rupert and Lachlan will continue to play a big role. And with the sale of Sky to Comcast and the entertainment businesses to Disney, they will be billions of dollars richer.matthew.garrahan@ft.com
26;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-26T14:15:08Z;Disney-Fox to sell Sky stake to Comcast;Move ends Rupert Murdoch’s association with broadcaster and smooths its sale;Comcast has cleared the final hurdle in its bid to take full control of Sky after Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox said they would sell their 39 per cent stake in the British broadcaster to their US media rival.The decision, which concludes one of the most drawn-out takeover battles in recent years, ends media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s 30-year association with the Europe-wide media group he launched as Britain’s first pay-TV service.The sale will put Comcast on course to take full control of Sky and generate proceeds of about £11.6bn for Disney, which the US media group plans to invest in content creation for new digital streaming services.Fox currently holds a 39 per cent stake in Sky, which would have gone to Disney as part of its $71bn purchase of Mr Murdoch’s entertainment assets. But after Comcast beat Disney in the auction for Sky on Saturday evening, Disney decided to sell rather than remain a minority shareholder. Disney is also selling the regional sports networks it is acquiring from Fox as part of its purchase of the entertainment assets.Bob Iger, Disney chief executive, said the sale of the Sky stake and sports networks would “substantially reduce the cost of our overall [Fox] acquisition and allow us to aggressively invest in building and creating high-quality content for our direct-to-consumer platforms”. The RSN and Sky stake sale are expected to generate about $30bn.Sky ushered in the pay-TV era in the UK when it was launched in 1989 by Mr Murdoch on “a wing and a prayer” from a draughty industrial park on the outskirts of west London.Its early financial troubles almost bankrupted him but, eventually, its mix of exclusive sports rights and films, and later additions such as broadband and mobile services, turned it into one of Britain’s most valuable companies.Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s chief executive, hailed Mr Murdoch’s contribution to the company. “His vision and belief has enabled us to grow into Europe’s leading direct to consumer media business,” adding that “we close one chapter while simultaneously opening another . . . our aim is to make the next 30 years as exciting.”The sale of the Fox-Disney stake in Sky will push Comcast over the acceptance threshold for its offer, meaning that the company can begin working with Sky. If they had held on to the stake, they could have prevented Comcast from consolidating Sky’s cash flow, although the US cable company would still have controlled the broadcaster.Disney has launched ESPN Plus, a sports product, and plans to launch another streaming service aimed at families that will include content produced by its Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm divisions. It will also develop new content for Hulu, the US streaming service, which is among the Fox assets it is acquiring.Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that Sky would operate independently once it completed the acquisition, with Mr Darroch, its chief executive, given autonomy to run the business.“The consistent theme at Comcast has been letting leaders of our businesses make their own decisions, being decentralised and keeping an entrepreneurial spirit,” Mr Roberts said. “We’ve said this to Jeremy and the rest of the Sky team . . . They will be able to act as an independent company but with the resources of a $150bn company behind them.”
27;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-26T11:11:03Z;Comcast’s Sky deal roils European broadband;Victory over Disney in £37bn takeover battle raises consolidation question;Comcast’s victory over Disney in the £37bn battle to acquire Sky changes the stakes for European broadband.If Disney had prevailed, Sky’s broadband business — the second biggest in the UK behind BT — was widely expected to be sold, along with a fledgling mobile phone business.But the US media group lost in an auction that concluded on Saturday evening. The fact that Sky will be owned instead by a cable company alters the calculation. Instead of a seller, Comcast is seen as a potential consolidator of European broadband.“If it decides to invest in telecoms it could significantly alter the competitive and investment landscape, not just in the UK, but also in the other territories [including] Ireland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain,” said Wilton Fry, an analyst with RBC.Sky entered the broadband market in 2005 when James Murdoch, the then chief executive, paid a meagre £211m to acquire small operator Easynet. The bet has paid off and changed the telecoms landscape in the UK. Sky now has 6m broadband customers in the UK, 24 per cent of the market, although they are mostly connected via BT’s network.Comcast is the largest broadband company in the US with 26m users on its cable network and it derives half of its profit from internet access.James Barford, an analyst with Enders, argued that Comcast could look to boost Sky’s telecoms arm by investing in business telecoms, given it has a strong presence in the US, or by buying spectrum to boost its mobile arm. However, he said it was also possible that it could look to acquire companies such as TalkTalk, which has 4.2m broadband customers, or smaller competitors.North American telecoms companies have struggled to crack the highly competitive European telecoms market in the past, with failed forays including AT&T in Italy and Carlos Slim in the Netherlands, and the market dynamics are vastly different to the US where cable companies often enjoy regional monopolies.Yet Comcast now has a beachhead in Sky. Senior industry executives have argued in private that in the absence of a big merger in UK telecoms, such as Vodafone and Virgin Media or Three and O2 in mobile, it could be Comcast that forces the issue.Vodafone is a potential fit if Comcast has wider European telecoms ambitions. The British company is Europe’s largest broadband business having built and bought cable networks in markets partly aligned with Sky’s footprint including Germany, Italy and Spain. It has a smaller market share in UK broadband, where it resells BT’s network and has backed smaller operator CityFibre.The high premium paid has reduced the likelihood of a price war in UK broadband. “The price they have paid is eye-watering and that suggests cost cutting but not price cutting. The market won’t heat up,” said one person with direct knowledge of meetings that have taken place since the Sky auction ended.If Comcast went the other way, Sky’s broadband business is valued at £3.9bn by RBC based on a calculation of £650 per customer. A disposal of the telecoms asset could lower the acquisition price.However, more than 80 per cent of Sky’s pay-TV customers also take internet in the same package. Breaking up is hard to do.
28;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-25T17:37:42Z;Comcast’s expensive bet on the future of media;Sky deal is the latest megamerger aimed at countering the technology titans;"In an age of media megamergers — think of Disney’s $71bn purchase of Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment assets, or AT&T’s $80bn deal for Time Warner — Comcast’s winning bid at the weekend for Sky, even at £37bn ($49bn) including assumed debt, is not one of the very biggest. But it is another vivid illustration of how technology companies’ expansion into television and film is prompting a reshaping of the traditional media industry. The rush to consolidate has two big goals: bringing together content with distribution — and the sheer pursuit of scale.The reason, above all, is the Netflix effect. The internet-based streaming service that started life mailing DVDs to customers has, in just a few years, become one of the world’s biggest commissioners of TV, and increasingly film, content. It can pump out its wares, in principle, to anyone with a fast internet connection, even on their phone. It can also track minutely the viewing habits of its 130m (as of June) paying subscribers — so that it can target specific content to them, and even make informed guesses on the likely success of new movies or TV shows.But Netflix is not alone. Amazon’s streaming service is on its heels. Google, Apple and Facebook have their own streaming platforms. That is making pay-TV companies, and their longtime content providers, fear the “cord cutters” — subscribers who decide they can get all the TV they need from cheaper streaming services. The phenomenon has given new impetus to the longstanding push to bulk up and create integrated content and distribution businesses.All that leaves the purchase by Comcast of 51 per cent of NBC Universal in 2009, and the rest in 2013, looking prescient. The US cable group withdrew in July from a battle with Disney for the other entertainment assets of Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. But its victory over Disney in a weekend auction, though at a high price, continues its march towards being an integrated, global player. It brings Comcast international exposure, in a well-managed business that is one of the few sizeable providers of pay-TV and broadband across Europe. Sky has some premium content — including first-run rights in its territories to HBO series such as Game of Thrones — and attractive sports rights, plus a reputation for technological savvy.The deal will not in itself, however, turn Comcast into a true content giant. Oddly, it might have made even more sense for Disney — which acquired 39 per cent of Sky in its deal with Fox — to pay up for the rest. Even Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive, called Sky a “jewel” of the Murdoch portfolio.For Mr Murdoch himself, the Comcast and Disney deals are a vindication of the commercial nous of the man who created Sky in 1989 and saw it almost go bust in its first year. The 87-year-old must surely have some regrets over breaking up the entertainment empire he spent a lifetime building, and the failure of two attempts since 2010 to retake full ownership of Sky. But he is, at least, selling out for lofty valuations.The buyers of these and other media assets, conversely, are making stunningly big bets in an environment changing with vertiginous speed; eight years ago, Netflix was not even a content producer. In doing so, they are only aping everyone from grocery retailers to pharmacy groups in trying to anticipate how the march of the technology titans will remould their industries. Getting out in front of disrupters is a tricky business. Shareholders of Disney, AT&T and Comcast can only hope that their expensive bets turn out to be the right ones."
29;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-25T12:12:19Z;Comcast/Sky/Disney: hair apparent;The cable group is livin’ on a prayer;Halfway there but livin’ on a prayer? Bouffant rocker Jon Bon Jovi could have been singing about Brian Roberts, not blue-collar Americans. Comcast, the business run by Mr Roberts, grabbed a third of Sky in the market for £8.6bn on Monday. The group lodged the highest bid for the UK-listed broadcaster and broadband group at the weekend.Any lingering doubts rival bidders had about Mr Roberts’ seriousness have evaporated, like a puff of hairspray. He craves Sky’s content, technology and European reach. These are ingredients in a possible antidote to the malady of “cord-cutting”.Mr Roberts’ difficulty is that Fox, underbidder in the auction run by the UK Takeover Panel, already has 39 per cent of Sky. Disney has promised to purchase the stake with other 21st Century Fox media assets.The lyrics of New Jersey’s sixth-best singer are therefore apt. Comcast needs just over 50 per cent of all Sky’s shares to gain control. UK takeover rules give it a clear run until October 11, as Jefferies notes. But unless Fox and Disney capitulate, Comcast can buy only from the 60 per cent owned by minorities. A 29.1 per cent market purchase at the £17.28 offer price means Comcast is halfway to that target.The cable group is livin’ on a prayer because minorities with 10 per cent could deny Comcast control, through inertia or design. The shock and awe of the market purchase is meant to discourage that. Mr Roberts is telling Disney to play ball, too. He wants Bob Iger to sell into his bid via Fox. Disney’s debts are rising. Proceeds of £11.6bn would reduce them.A disposal might also put Mr Roberts in a good mood to discuss selling Comcast’s 30 per cent of streaming service Hulu. Disney will have 60 per cent following its purchase of Fox assets. Legal threats preclude a back-to-back deal. But Hulu might naturally come up if Mr Roberts and Mr Iger meet in a month or so to josh about that nail-biting auction in London.The Lex team is interested in the views of readers. Is Comcast overpaying for Sky? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.
30;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-24T19:06:55Z;Labour’s employee share plan denies workers’ right to cash in;Predictable business flap over the proposals does not negate its fundamental flaws;Labour’s would-be chancellor, John McDonnell, wants to “redress the balance of power at work”, away from an “elite” to those “who create the wealth”. And his latest proposal for doing so — handing 10 per cent of a UK company’s shares to an employee ownership fund— may earn more support than typical measures on pay.Two factors suggest this: co-authorship of his plan by the IPPR think-tank, and panicked protests from other sets of initials — the CBI, IoD, BCC, etc. To these “pro-business” bodies, handing billions of pounds of equity to employees is “draconian” and “unprecedented over-reach”. They were presumably too busy telling this to Sky News to comment on the £484m being handed Sky staff after its takeover — as one FT Twitter wit noted.Business is, however, right to identify the economic flaws in the idea. Reducing other investors’ shareholdings could hit the value of employees’ pensions and savings. It might also reduce their employment opportunities by deterring businesses from listing and investing in the UK.Political pundits are also right to point out the contradictions. Employees would benefit financially only from dividends, which private companies cannot be made to pay, and listed companies can drop in favour share buybacks. UK employees of overseas companies would not benefit at all. And employees of privatised utilities who already have shares would lose them under Labour’s plans to renationalise their employers — and then be ineligible for a new share fund.But the real problem with the idea is that it contains three misconceptions about employee share ownership.First, the notion that greater equality with the “elite” can be achieved though a fund holding shares and only distributing dividends. That elite did not get rich from holding on to shares, but selling them. Britain’s first high-profile highly-paid executive at British Gas was portrayed as “Cedric The Pig”, not “Cedric the Buy-and-Hold Investor”. Similarly, big payouts at Persimmon, BT, and BP have been all about managers’ ability to cash in their bonuses.Second, the belief that companies with employee shareholders perform well. Royal Mail staff hold 12 per cent of the FTSE 100 group, but it has not helped avert decline or cost pressures. John Lewis, wholly partner owned, had its half-year profit wiped out by costs and investment.Third, the idea that dividends alone can make a difference to people’s lives. Water company Pennon has a plan to give customers a £20m shareholding — generous, until the Guardian noted that was £25 each and a £1.25 dividend.Labour even plans to cap employee dividends at £500 per worker, with an estimated £2bn excess after five years going to government — in effect, a tax. By contrast, through 11,850 non-compulsory employee share schemes, government sends £920m the other way, in tax and national insurance relief. And those employees enjoy that great privilege of the elite: they can sell their shares whenever they like.Is Sky worth the £17.28 a share that Comcast bid in last weekend’s auction? Can a European pay-TV company’s customers really be worth nearly four years’ subscriptions, as competition for broadcast rights and viewers intensifies — necessitating a deal with Netflix, and bringing Amazon into the fray?At one point on Saturday, when Comcast was deciding how much to offer to trump its rival Fox/Disney, the answer to all these questions was evidently, yes.Unfortunately, by Monday, others had a very different response. As the London market chased Sky’s shares up to the new bid price, the New York market sold Comcast’s down 8 per cent. Analysts said it was clear that the US cable group was overpaying for Sky, noting the bid price negated any gains from improving the business. One even claimed: “Disney/Fox . . . clearly was not prepared to go much higher than its last bid of £14.00 before the auction process began”.It is easy to make the argument for overpayment after the event. Paying £17.28 a share seems steep, even for Sky’s 117 consecutive quarters of revenue growth. It seems even more excessive when 110 consecutive quarters was valued at only £7.55.But post-bid critics perhaps forget certain factors. Sky’s management team did a brilliant job of selling the growth narrative throughout a process that began back in December 2016. Disney/Fox did well to push Comcast to the last bid and last minute without overpaying. And if Disney/Fox “clearly” was not going much higher, why hadn’t that mind-reader said so previously? Or won a place on the Comcast bid team?Reports that the slightly receding Philip Jansen, co-chief executive of Worldpay, is in talks to replace Gavin Patterson as BT’s next boss also said his pay might be an issue.

Companies are racing to remake themselves by snatching trophy assets or consolidating with rivals before the business cycle turns.Deals lined up on Monday ranged from the glitz of the catwalks in Milan — as Michael Kors readied a multibillion dollar takeover offer for storied Milanese fashion house Versace — down to the grit of the mining world, with Canada’s Barrick Gold agreeing a $6bn all-stock purchase of Randgold Resources.But the biggest prize was in media, as Comcast trounced 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney in a weekend auction for Sky with a £30.6bn bid, while in the radio sector SiriusXM secured a $3.5bn deal for digital music provider Pandora Media.Global mergers and acquisitions have totalled $3.24tn so far this year, 40 per cent higher than the same time a year ago and ahead of the record pace set in 2007, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Megadeals of more than $5bn in value accounted for 44 per cent of transactions this year.Midterm elections and a potential trade war are in the back of people’s minds …The marketplace is not necessarily highly concerned and the presumption is that you will end up with reasonable outcomes on all thisA rally in global stock indices has assuaged concerns that the intensifying trade dispute between the US and China would dent economic activity, and in turn dealmaking. The S&P 500 has climbed 16.5 per cent over the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index rose by 19 per cent, and both sat near record territory on Monday.However, shares of some of Monday’s dealmakers were knocked, including a 7 per cent drop in Comcast stock, as investors showed some reluctance to the ambition and high prices being paid by the acquirers.“At the moment, the midterm elections and a potential trade war are in the back of people’s minds but at the same time you obviously have an S&P and Dow at just about an all-time high point,” said Leon Kalvaria, chairman of Citi’s institutional clients group, which provides advice to large corporations.“The marketplace is not necessarily highly concerned and the presumption is that you will end up with reasonable outcomes on all this.”Cross-border deals accounted for the vast majority of activity in recent days, as US-based Comcast extended its reach into Europe and Michael Kors looked to Italy’s Versace in a deal that will help create a US rival to European luxury conglomerates LVMH, Kering and Richemont. Cross-border M&A has totalled $1.3tn in 2018, two-thirds higher than last year and the strongest period for such deals since 2007.US dealmaking has been fuelled by the surging value of the dollar, which has jumped 6 per cent in the past six months. “At the start of 2016 and 2017, US domestic mergers dominated the landscape and you wondered if cross-border activity had gone out of fashion,” said Bruce Embley, global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Freshfields, the law firm. “Cross-border deals are alive and kicking … In many cases, the real opportunities are outside of your home market.”James Del Favero, a former Goldman Sachs partner and co-founder of Ardea Partners, said that the Trump administration’s decision to give more power to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which reviews inbound investments for national security threats, could also boost deal activity in the coming months.“We may also see non-US investors trying to get deals done ahead of the implementation of the new Cfius regulations, which will result in broader filing requirements,” said Mr Del Favero.Casino, the French retailer, claimed on Monday that it had rejected an approach from Carrefour, albeit one that its larger rival said had never officially been made.Advisors across the globe said the appetite for dealmaking remained robust in all regions, particularly in India, where Warren Buffett made his first major investment in Asia’s third-largest economy by acquiring a stake in Paytm, India’s largest mobile payments company. This came after Walmart completed its $16bn acquisition of Flipkart, an e-commerce giant that rivals Amazon.

Comcast’s offer also represents a more than 100 per cent increase on where Sky shares were trading at before Fox’s initial approach in December 2016.Sky shares by contrast were up 8.6 per cent at £17.21 while those for Fox rose 1.1 per cent.
33;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-24T07:25:17Z;Opening Quote: Barrick sees Randgold as golden opportunity ;;"Randgold Resources-Barrick Gold merger“Gold! Always believe in your soul, You've got the power to know, You're indestructible, Always believe in …” But the trouble is, unlike statuesque Spandau Ballet crooner Tony Hadley, people don’t believe in gold so much these days.Despite the best efforts of the US president and UK prime minister to send their electorates scurrying to the nearest bunker clutching bars of the yellow metal and tins of baked beans, the gold price is down almost a tenth this year.And shares in the biggest producers are down even more: Barrick, the world’s number one miner of the stuff, has seen is its share price fall 25 per cent amid criticism of its strategy, while London-listed Randgold has lost 34 per cent of its value as it has struggled with operational issues, including a strike at one of its biggest mines.Hence this morning’s news that Barrick and Randgold are joining forces in an $18bn deal to create an even more efficient producer. According to the two companies, their proposed all-share merger will “create an industry-leading gold company with the greatest concentration of tier one gold assets in the industry, the lowest total cash cost position among senior gold peers, and a diversified asset portfolio positioned for growth in many of the world's most prolific gold districts”.By choosing Randgold, Barrick is able to expand its footprint in Africa, a region that has been a source of difficulty for the company over the past two years. Barrick is currently negotiating with Tanzania’s president to end a stand-off over Acacia Mining, in which it holds a majority stake, which has been unable to export from the country since April 2017.By contrast, Randgold is known for its ability to conduct business in some of the most difficult countries in the region. It operates five mines in three countries across the continent: in Mali, Côte d’Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the government has just introduced a controversial new mining code.Key numbers:Bottom line: Barrick gains Randgold’s 1.3m to 1.35m ounces of gold this year, but more importantly its expertise in Africa.As the City expected? No, but there were clues. In a recent interview with Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper, Barrick chief executive John Thornton said he admired Randgold and wanted to emulate its “superior returns”. What was said: Mr Thornton said: ""The combination of Barrick and Randgold will create a new champion for value creation in the gold mining industry, bringing together the world's largest collection of Tier One Gold Assets, with a proven management team that has consistently delivered among the best shareholder returns in the gold sector over the past decade.”Randgold chief executive Mark Bristow said: “The merged company will be very different. Its goal will be to deliver sector leading returns, and in order to achieve this, we will need to take a very critical view of our asset base and how we run our business, and be prepared to make tough decisions. By employing a strategy similar to the one that proved very successful at Randgold, but on a larger scale, the New Barrick Group will leverage some of the world's best mines and talent to create real value for all stakeholders.""OQ verdict: Barrick under Mr Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has sold off assets and focused on cash flow rather than expanding its gold reserves. That has also seen its output fall, threatening its position as the world’s largest gold producer. Buying Randgold is one way of addressing those concerns. But Randgold shareholders might ask why there is no premium being offered. They might also ask what Mr Bristow means by: “we will need to take a very critical view of our asset base and how we run our business, and be prepared to make tough decisions”. Sky auction won by ComcastSo, the Sky really was the limit for Comcast, in the sealed bids auction for the pay-TV group this weekend. Its winning offer values Sky at almost £4bn more than the Disney-Fox bid. No wonder Sky’s announcement this morning is headed: “Accept the Recommended Comcast Offer Immediately.”Clearly, Comcast wasn’t going to lose the deal for the sake of a few pounds. According to reports of the auction process, in the first two rounds of the auction, when bidders were able to respond to rival bids, they each edged up their initial offers “by pennies”. This was to ensure that they were able to deliver their best offer in a sealed, final round bid. But the Disney-Fox side surprised those involved in the process by only going from £14 a share to a final £15.67 a share offer.Key numbers:Bottom line: This is finally a done deal: it has an acceptance threshold of 50 per cent plus one share, which means it will complete even if Comcast fails to acquire a 39 per cent stake currently held by Fox that is being sold to Disney.As the City expected? Comcast’s purchase of Sky is priced significantly higher than some analysts had expected but Alice Enders of Enders Analysis said Sky’s move into broadband and its recent successful bid for a new Premier League rights contract had bolstered the company’s appeal.What was said: Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts said: “This is a great day for Comcast … Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand and accomplished management team. This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally.”People briefed on the process told the FT: “Disney wanted it but they weren’t going to overpay,” and “Comcast just paid $3bn more than they had to.”OQ verdict: So, everyone’s a winner. Sky shareholders no longer have Rupert Murdoch in control, but do get to pocket a 70 per cent plus return plus a stake in an independent company with the resources of a $150bn US group behind them.Mr Roberts told the FT that the company encouraged its top executives to act entrepreneurially. Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s chief executive, is expected to stay on following the acquisition. Meanwhile, Fox has its 39 per cent stake in Sky – which means Disney will be able to recoup about $15bn if, as expected, it sells its Sky shares to Comcast.Today’s Small Talk column by Kate Burgess focuses on listed hospitals group Spire Healthcare:

“If we find the cause, we can find the cure”, said Hippocrates, Greek physician, formulator of the bedside manner and father of western medicine. Would that curing the ills of Spire Healthcare, one of the UK’s top three private businesses in the sector with 39 hospitals and dozen clinics, were so straightforward. Last week, its shares fell 5 per cent to 162p – 48p below the 2014 float price 2014 and nearly half the 315p offered by FTSE 100 rival Mediclinic in cash and shares in November.Read the rest of the column here.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
35;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-24T03:00:56Z;Sky deal opens new horizons for Comcast;US cable behemoth that lacked overseas presence has bought itself a powerful European launch pad;It was shortly after the July 4 holiday in the US last year when executives at Comcast first began thinking about bidding for Sky.Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, knew that the company built by his late father Ralph, needed to bolster its presence abroad. Comcast is the largest cable operator and provider of broadband services in the US but lacks international exposure. Its core US market is maturing: pay-TV penetration is very high, unlike in Europe, and “cord-cutting” — the cancellation of cable and satellite subscriptions — has disrupted business models.Sky, one of the few providers of pay-TV and broadband with scale across Europe, looked like a good bet. The company ushered in the pay-TV era in the UK when it was launched almost 30 years ago by Rupert Murdoch on “a wing and a prayer” from a draughty industrial park on the outskirts of west London.Its early financial troubles almost bankrupted the media mogul. But, eventually, its mix of exclusive sports rights and movies, and later additions such as broadband and mobile services, turned Sky into one of Britain’s most valuable companies. Its money has revolutionised the Premier League, turning it into a global brand, while its technological innovation has won it admirers across the Atlantic. European expansion, and the merger with Sky operations in Italy and Germany have given it a solid presence on the continent.Sky’s growth in recent years won it plenty of admirers and when Mr Roberts and his colleagues first began thinking about buying Sky in the summer of 2017 the company was already the focus of a bid from Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox group. Having failed years earlier in a first bid to acquire all of Sky, withdrawing amid outrage sparked by the tabloid phone hacking scandal, Mr Murdoch was trying for a final time to regain control of the company he started in 1989.But his bid had become mired in regulatory troubles. The Comcast management team wondered in that summer of 2017 whether their company could become an alternative buyer.It took several months for this early interest to crystallise. The catalyst came in November, when Mr Murdoch stunned the media world with a plan to break up his entertainment empire, selling his film studio, cable channels – and 39 per cent stake in Sky – to Walt Disney. Mr Roberts, a competitive squash player who, as a younger man, won five medals at the Maccabiah Games, often known as the Jewish Olympics, sprang into action. He mounted a rival bid for the Fox assets before eventually withdrawing to concentrate solely on Sky.That persistence paid off on Saturday afternoon when, after three rounds of bidding, Comcast was declared the winner of a Sky auction, beating a rival Disney-backed bid from Fox.Mr Roberts and his lieutenants spent Saturday in a conference room at The Stafford, a five-star hotel a short walk from the offices of Robey Warshaw, the boutique investment bank that has been advising Comcast.The auction was managed by the Takeover Panel, the UK body that regulates public dealmaking in the UK: it intervened in line with rules that were established to prevent takeovers dragging on indefinitely.It received the bids from Comcast and Disney-Fox via a secure web portal — but for the first two rounds there was little action, with the rivals offering increases of only “pennies” on the £14.75-a-share price that was Comcast’s leading offer going into the auction, according to a person briefed on the process. “They wanted to keep their powder dry for the final round,” another person close to the process said.And in that final round, when the two bidders made their best and closing offers, Comcast’s £17.28-a-share bid blew the final Disney-Fox’s £15.67 out of the water. Disney’s offer surprised some involved, given that it was pitched below the market price of Sky shares: they had climbed to £15.85 in the weeks before the auction, largely on interest from hedge funds that had bet on Comcast and Disney-Fox bidding up the price.But Disney had a number in mind and was not prepared to go over it or saddle itself with too much debt in pursuit of Sky, according to another person close to the bidding.The scale of the Comcast offer surprised observers, with Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research saying he was “stunned” at the price. Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research said it was unclear if Disney would come to regret not making a higher bid. “If management generally believes in a strategy, it is better to overpay in the short term and then get it right in the long term,” he said.Missing out on the Sky bid means a windfall is coming Disney’s way on the Sky stake it is getting as part of its $71bn purchase of Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment assets — assuming that it decides to sell the stake, as seems likely. The Fox assets Disney is buying include a 39 per cent stake in Sky which, at the Comcast offer price, is now worth £11.8bn ($15.3bn). “Disney will have to take as a consolation prize that Fox’s position in Sky will end up worth much more than when Disney originally agreed to buy it,” Mr Wieser wrote in a research note.What will Comcast do with Sky? It has a similar business model to Sky in that it owns both content and distribution. “Comcast will look at Sky and they will see a business that is vertically integrated like theirs … they will understand the balance between content and distribution,” said Mike Darcey, a former chief executive of Mr Murdoch’s News UK and a former chief operating officer at Sky.Mr Roberts has no big plans to change Sky and said he admired what Mr Murdoch, his son James, Sky’s chairman, and the company’s management team had achieved with the company. “They built something magnificent,” he told the FT.But an era has ended with the Murdochs getting out of pay-TV in Europe. The Roberts era at Sky is about to begin.
36;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-23T18:04:43Z;Comcast chief pledges to preserve Sky’s independence;£30bn deal ends Murdoch era while 23m subscriber base gives US group European launch pad;Sky will operate independently after Comcast completes its £30bn takeover of the British media company, the US cable group’s chief executive has said after winning a drawn-out battle against rivals Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox.Comcast won an auction for Rupert Murdoch’s pay television group this weekend with an offer of £17.28 a share, trumping Disney-Fox’s bid of £15.67 a share and concluding one of the UK’s longest takeover sagas.The deal ends Mr Murdoch’s involvement with Sky almost 30 years after he created the satellite television group that came to be the main rival of the UK’s dominant terrestrial TV players.They will be able to act as an independent company but with the resources of a $150bn company behind themBrian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, which also owns NBCUniversal, told the FT that the company encouraged its top executives to act entrepreneurially. Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s chief executive, is expected to stay on following the acquisition.“The consistent theme at Comcast has been letting leaders of our businesses make their own decisions, being decentralised and keeping an entrepreneurial spirit,” Mr Roberts said. “We’ve said this to Jeremy and the rest of the Sky team … They will be able to act as an independent company but with the resources of a $150bn company behind them.”Comcast’s offer has been recommended by the independent Sky committee created to assess bids for the company. It has set its acceptance threshold at 50 per cent plus one share, which means it will complete its deal even if it fails to acquire a 39 per cent stake currently held by Fox that is being sold to Disney.Disney has not commented on its plans for the stake. This summer Disney bought Fox’s entertainment businesses, including its Hollywood movie studio, cable channels and Star of India, for $71.3bn excluding debt. The assets included Fox’s 39 per cent stake in Sky — which means Disney will be able to recoup about £11.8bn if it sells its Sky shares to Comcast.Comcast’s purchase of Sky is priced significantly higher than some analysts had expected but Alice Enders of Enders Analysis said Sky’s move into broadband and its recent successful bid for a new Premier League rights contract had bolstered the company’s appeal.“It is a unique company,” she said. “It brought premium entertainment to the British public and really made the competition raise its game.”With 23m subscribers across Europe, Sky will give Comcast a launch pad for new digital services in an era increasingly shaped by streaming providers such as Netflix and Amazon.The battle for Sky started in December 2016 when Mr Murdoch’s Fox group made a £10.75-a-share offer.With the tabloid newspaper phone-hacking scandal still fresh in people’s minds, the UK government was under pressure to ensure that a sale of Sky did not hand Mr Murdoch more influence of the UK’s media market.A lengthy regulatory review then followed until Mr Murdoch stunned his rivals last November when he revealed plans to sell his entertainment assets to Disney. That deal included Fox’s Sky stake, putting Disney in the driving seat to acquire the rest of the company. But Comcast crashed the party: it made a rival bid for the Fox assets, which it later dropped — but not before Disney had to increase its own offer. Comcast then made a separate bid for Sky.
37;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-23T09:05:24Z;Sky/Comcast/Fox: sudden debt shootout;It is Sky that emerges from the gun smoke as the real hard-bitten survivor;The paradox known as the gunfighter’s dilemma insists that a reactive shot is more deadly than an isolated one. So neither Comcast nor 21st Century Fox had a tactical advantage in the final shootout to control Sky. Both bid blind, in an auction run by the UK’s takeover regulator. With no opposing price to react to, beyond that set by Comcast itself in the second round, the US cable giant outgunned the US news and entertainment group with a winning bid at an enterprise value of some £37bn.It is moot who has really been left sprawling in the dust by the encounter, whose prize is a high-quality foothold in the European media industry. Comcast is paying an extraordinary price for Sky. The UK-listed broadcaster and broadband group had been written off as doomed to slow decline by many UK investors, until Fox came in with a long-awaited offer for the group in December 2016. The premium Comcast is offering over the Sky market price just before that offer is an incredible 124 per cent.The multiple of ebitda to enterprise value is an elevated 15 times, according to data for S&P Global. But this is also the ratio at around which Disney is buying the entertainment assets of Fox, including a 39 per cent stake in Sky.As a result, Comcast and Disney are now confronting each other down a dusty main street. The Mouse has to decide whether to sell out at £17.28 per share, as independent shareholders would be well-advised to do. The alternative is to hang on as a minority investor, powerless except in the ability to block the integration of Sky by Comcast.That would leave the cable group, which is menaced by the US trend for “cord-cutting”, unable to trade content and technology with Sky except at arm’s length commercial rates. Comcast would still be stuck with sharply higher net debt of over $100bn, a quick-and-dirty calculation suggests. That is equivalent to about 3.3 times combined forward ebitda, which is high, though not ruinous.You may not credit great prudence to Comcast boss Brian Roberts, who jokingly claimed a conversation with a London cabbie inspired him to bid for Sky. But you cannot fault his resolve. He won because he wanted Sky more. Given doubts over Comcast’s business model – Disney has the backstop of a superb rights catalogue – he may simply be more desperate.Sky, meanwhile, has proved all its detractors wrong. A business whose debt-burdened demise was regularly prophesied in the noughties survived monopolistic competition to become a trophy asset in the digital era. It is Sky, rather than Comcast, that emerges from the gun smoke as the real hard-bitten survivor.

It brings an end to Rupert Murdoch’s long association with Sky, which he founded in 1989, and which ushered in the pay-TV era in the UK.The competing bidders had circled each other warily on a day when the fate of Britain’s largest pay-TV player was to be decided. In the first two rounds, when bidders were able to respond to rival bids, they each edged up their initial offers “by pennies”, according to one person close to the process. This was to ensure that they were able to deliver their best offer in a sealed, final round bid.But the Disney-Fox side surprised those involved in the process with their final £15.67 a share offer. “Disney wanted it but they weren’t going to overpay,” one person briefed on the process said. Another told the FT: “Comcast just paid $3bn more than they had to.”The auction put Sky at the centre of a high-stakes poker game between the world’s two largest media groups.Disney and Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, have sparred this year in a tussle for Rupert Murdoch’s Fox empire. In the summer Disney prevailed with a bid for Fox’s entertainment businesses, including its Hollywood movie studio, cable channels and Star of India, that valued them at $71.3bn not including debt. The assets included Fox’s 39 per cent stake in Sky — which means Disney will be able to recoup about $15bn if, as expected, it sells its Sky shares to Comcast.With operations in Germany, Italy, Austria and Ireland, as well as the UK, Sky has 23m subscribers and will give Comcast a powerful launch pad for new digital services in an era increasingly shaped by streaming providers such as Netflix and Amazon.“This is a great day for Comcast,” Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand and accomplished management team. This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally.”Disney declined to comment on the auction but Fox said in a statement that it was “considering its options” regarding the 39 per cent stake in Sky and “would make a further announcement in due course”.The conclusion of the auction brings to an end one of the UK’s longest running takeover battles.It started in December 2016 when Mr Murdoch’s Fox group made a £10.75 a share offer for Sky that valued it at £18.4bn.With the tabloid newspaper phone-hacking scandal and the behaviour of some journalists at Murdoch newspapers still fresh in people’s minds, the UK government was under pressure to ensure that a sale of Sky did not hand Mr Murdoch more influence of the UK’s media market. A lengthy regulatory review process then followed.Ofcom, the UK’s media watchdog, and then the Competition and Markets Authority scrutinised the Fox offer. But with the regulatory review process dragging on, Mr Murdoch stunned his rivals last November when he revealed plans to break up his media empire, selling most of his entertainment assets, including his movie studio and portfolio of cable channels, to Walt Disney.That deal included Fox’s stake in Sky, putting Disney in the driving seat to acquire the rest of the company. But Comcast crashed the party. It made a rival bid for the Fox assets, which it later dropped – but not before Disney had to increase its own offer. Comcast then made a separate bid for Sky.Before Fox made its offer for Sky in December 2016, Sky shares were trading around £7.50. The final £17.28 bid from Comcast represents a more than 100 per increase on Sky shares before that first Fox offer.Sky’s management team, led by chief executive Jeremy Darroch, is expected to stay with the company, which will give its new owner significant cash flow and a big European footprint.“This is the beginning of the next exciting chapter for Sky,” said Mr Darroch. “As part of a broader Comcast we believe we will be able to continue to grow and strengthen our position as Europe’s leading direct-to-consumer media company.”
39;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Sky bidding battle approaches auction climax;Takeover Panel sets process guidelines as tussle between Fox and Comcast nears end;The £26bn takeover battle for Sky is set for a dramatic ending on Saturday when Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and US cable group Comcast will be forced into a high-stakes auction for the pay-TV operator. The Takeover Panel, which regulates public dealmaking in the UK, has laid out the guidelines for up to three rounds of an auction process that will decide the owner of Sky.The winner-takes-all process will conclude an almost two-year takeover battle in just a single day, with the rivals each able to tender up to two bids in a matter of hours in what will be a test of auction gamesmanship.Sky has been in play since December 2016 when Fox struck an initial agreement to buy the portion of the European pay-TV operator that it did not already own at a price of £10.75 per share. Fox holds a 39 per cent stake in Sky, which means that it stands to benefit from an improved price should Comcast win. If Fox wins, the company will ultimately be owned by Disney, which has separately agreed to buy the majority of Fox, including its Sky stake, for $71bn.Disney initially fended off competition for Fox from Comcast late last year. However, Comcast then launched a two-pronged assault in 2018. First it bid for Sky to disrupt the deal struck in December 2016 and then forced Disney to raise its bid for Fox by $20bn.The process revealed on Thursday is an unusual conclusion to a UK takeover battle. Only a very few panel-run auctions have been staged in the UK since 2000. Corus was sold to Tata by auction in 2008, while the sale of the Canary Wharf development was also decided through the procedure back in 2004. In this case, it was triggered by panel rules after neither Comcast nor Fox declared their latest bids best-and-final with just two weeks to go before the end of a 60-day offer period.The companies, along with the Walt Disney Group, which has acquired the vast majority of Fox since its initial bid for Sky, have all agreed to the weekend auction. The process comprises three rounds. In the first, the participant with the lowest offer will be able to make an increased bid, which can be topped by the other party in the second round. If the auction procedure has not concluded after the second round — which it will if no increased bid is made — there will be a final round, in which both suitors may make an increased bid.As it stands, Comcast has tabled a £14.75-a-share offer for Sky, while Fox has bid £14-a-share. By mid-morning in London, Sky shares were trading at £15.81 in anticipation of further price increases by the two companies.The fight has centred on a battle for Sky’s 23m subscribers, which Disney and Comcast hope to get hold of to boost their distribution, technology and content production at a time when the media landscape has been upended by the rise of Netflix and Amazon. 
40;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-12T17:30:24Z;Sky/Comcast/Fox: code red;The battle for the media group could end up being resolved by the regulators;After thousands of hours of haggling and millions of dollars in fees for advisers, the battle for Sky could be resolved in the humdrum offices of a low-profile City regulator. If neither Fox nor Comcast makes a knockout bid for the UK-based pay-TV group soon, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, a 50-year old body staffed mostly by secondees from law firms and banks, will squeeze one from them.Stakes are high. The sport and drama purveyed by Sky is coveted by the US groups, with the wrinkle that Fox itself expects to be bought by Disney. Compelling content is the best defence against Netflix, Amazon and other disruptive media groups.Normally, by this advanced stage of a bid, one contender has made a move which the other party cannot, or will not match. UK rules designed to prevent sieges require that if the warring parties are still locked in combat 46 days after the second (or final) contestant entered the fray, the matter should be settled by an auction.These are rare. They have happened about once every six years since the mid-1980s. The rules are set out in the Takeover Code, the fat rule book that governs UK M&A. This details a default process with five bids over five days.The consequent game theory could give Garry Kasparov a headache. Fox, Comcast and Sky could opt for a different number of rounds or stipulate minimum increments. They could also come up with their own structure involving a “formula bid”, if the Panel approved it. Comcast, for example, might say its maximum price for Sky is £15.50p a share, but that it will always pay 50p more than Fox. Fox might say its maximum is £14.50, and it will always pay 30p more than Comcast. If so, Comcast would win at £15.Step back from the detail for a moment. A multibillion-pound bidding contest could be resolved by the City equivalent of a compère auctioning a spa day for charity. Bankers and lawyers would be right to feel embarrassed, to the extent they are capable of it.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

41;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-09-12T04:43:20Z;Sky takeover battle heads for ‘sealed bids’;21st Century Fox and Comcast set to contest rare auction controlled by Takeover Panel;The protracted £26bn battle for control of Sky will be decided by a sealed bids auction contested by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and Comcast unless there is a best-and-final offer for the European media group by the end of next week.The auction will be administered by the Takeover Panel, the body that regulates UK mergers and acquisitions, to draw the curtain on a saga that has dragged on for almost two years, making it one of the longest-running UK takeover battles.The auction will mark the climax of a transatlantic fight between two of the world’s largest media companies for Sky’s 23m subscribers. Fox and Comcast hope to acquire Sky to bolster their distribution, technology and content production at a time when the global media map has been redrawn by the rise of streaming services Netflix and Amazon.Legacy media companies have turned to consolidation to keep up, with AT&T buying Time Warner, the owner of HBO and CNN, and Walt Disney defeating Comcast in the race to acquire Fox’s entertainment businesses — which included a 39 per cent stake in Sky. Old rivals Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, and Brian Roberts, his opposite number at Comcast, have been pitted against each other for the business started by Mr Murdoch in 1989.Comcast has tabled a £14.75-a-share offer for Sky, while Fox, backed by its new owner Disney, bid £14 a share for the 61 per cent it does not own. Neither company has yet said that these offers are their final bids, so shareholders have anticipated improved terms: Sky shares are trading at £15.44. A number of high-profile hedge funds are holding stakes on the assumption that Sky shares will rise, including Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group, Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, Davidson Kempner and Odey Asset Management.Takeover Panel rules stipulate that bids cannot be changed two weeks before the end of a 60-day offer period, with the clock having been set when Fox submitted its formal document in early August. This means September 22 is the last day for Fox and Comcast to revise their bids.If neither company specifies that they have made a best and final bid, an auction process will be triggered under panel rules. People following the process told the FT that the panel might step in before September 22 to spell out the rules of any forthcoming auction.The panel is a light-touch regulator independent of the UK government and has limited enforcement powers. However, it has real clout in the UK market thanks to its ability to censure companies, individuals and advisers that break its rules.Panel-run auctions are extremely rare with only a few having been staged in the past decade. Tata defeated CSN in a 2008 auction to acquire Corus, the UK steelmaker, while the Canary Wharf development was once sold at a panel-run auction.
42;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T17:44:25+0000;Why television’s bogeymen are here to stay;Proposals to protect broadcasters will not stop the likes of Netflix and Amazon;Another week, another kicking for the new bogeymen of UK media. Streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon deliver original television shows and movies to an increasing number of households and have the financial clout to outbid broadcasters for the most sought-after projects. But their growth has sparked concerns.Tony Hall, director-general of the BBC, did not mention Amazon, Netflix or other “digital giants” such as Facebook and Apple in a speech this week, but it was clear which companies he was referring to when he said “new global players” had created “huge super-inflation” in the market for programmes.“We can’t allow what our countries produce at home to be crowded out,” he warned.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, went further in a speech on Thursday at the Edinburgh Television Festival, proposing a new tax or digital licence fee on the likes of Amazon and Netflix to subsidise the BBC.The incursion by technology companies into television is a theme that dominates media industry conferences, and there is plenty of hand-wringing by anxious executives. Their fears would appear to be justified: a recent report by media regulator Ofcom found that people aged 16-34 now watch more non-broadcast than broadcast television content, with YouTube taking an increasingly large share of available audiences. More people in the UK now subscribe to a streaming service such as Netflix and Amazon than pay-television — part of what Ofcom has described as a “major shift in the UK’s viewing habits”.The question for traditional broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV is whether anything can be done about this shift. Digital levies or windfall taxes of the sort proposed by Mr Corbyn could certainly raise money for the BBC at a time when the broadcaster is under pressure to save money. Other measures, such as ensuring that public service broadcasters are prominently featured on the home screens of new smart TVs, which Channel 4 chief executive Alex Mahon has called for, would at least ensure that the PSBs remain visible.However, none of these ideas will stop the streaming players growing. And European media companies may have left it too late to compete with them.A decade ago, the UK’s leading broadcasters held discussions about pooling resources into a streaming service that they would jointly own and operate. The project advanced far enough to have a working title (for some reason they decided to call it Kangaroo) but ultimately it was blocked by regulators. These days the broadcasters operate their own broadband-delivered “catch-up” services, but these lack scale and breadth of programming when compared with Netflix and Amazon.With that in mind, the UK’s broadcasters have recently begun talking about reviving the Kangaroo concept. In Germany, a similar project is in the works: Discovery, the US group that owns Eurosport, and ProSiebenSat.1, the German media group, recently announced plans to build a subscription streaming service that will integrate programming and digital services from the two companies. They have also invited German operators RTL, ARD and ZDF to join the venture.National broadcasters have one built-in advantage over the likes of Netflix and Amazon: they have a closer understanding of the tastes and interests of local audiences, and are better placed to develop programming that caters to those viewers.A streaming service that aggregates UK content from the BBC, ITV and others would undoubtedly appeal to UK viewers. Yet any collaborative service would be at an overall disadvantage when compared with Netflix, which spends most of its annual spending — now at more than $8bn — on its own original programming. It owns the global rights to this content, which never leaves the Netflix service — a contrast with the BBC’s iPlayer, where series appear for limited periods of time before being withdrawn in order to be licensed to other channels and services.European broadcasters are unlikely to stop licensing their content in this way anytime soon: doing so would cut off a much-needed source of revenue. With that in mind, Netflix and deep-pocketed peers like Amazon will continue to have the upper hand as audiences in the UK and Europe continue their migration to on-demand platforms.With Walt Disney also working on a global streaming service— and vying with Comcast, the US cable operator, to acquire Sky — the streaming market is about to get even more crowded. The bogeymen are increasing in number, and UK broadcasters are right to fear them.This article has been amended to reflect the fact that project Kangaroo was blocked by UK regulatorsmatthew.garrahan@ft.com
43;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-08-08T20:56:35Z;21st Century Fox results top view ahead of Disney deal;;21st Century Fox delivered better quarterly results as Rupert Murdoch prepares to split his media empire through a sale to Disney.Adjusted earnings for the three months ending in June surged to 57 cents a share, from 36 cents a year ago, and eclipsing Wall Street forecasts for 53 cents. Revenues grew 18 per cent to $7.9bn, also beating estimates for $7.6bn.Shares in Fox were little changed in after-hours trading. The stock has gained 20 per cent in the past three months, lifted by a bidding war between Comcast and Disney for Fox’s entertainment assets that “unlocked enormous value for shareholders”, Fox said on Wednesday.Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, executive chairmen, said that Fox’s rising share price “recognises the work we have done to position our business to succeed during a time of great change.”Mr Murdoch is selling most of Fox’s entertainment and overseas assets to Walt Disney, in a $71bn deal that has already been approved by shareholders and the Department of Justice. However the acquisition still needs to be approved by regulators in other countries, including China.What’s left of the company after the sale will be Fox Broadcasting company, the television stations, Fox Business, Fox News and its sports channels. Mr Murdoch plans to separate these assets into a newly-listed company, which executives call “new Fox”. Matthew Harrigan, analyst at Buckingham Research, argues that the new Fox will be “better aligned with a live-TV future”, with its focus on sports and news, which should appeal to advertisers.In the three months ending in June, sales from Fox’s cable channels, which includes National Geographic, increased 13 per cent to $4.9bn.Fox benefited from a busy summer for movies, which has also helped Disney’s earnings in the quarter. Sales from Fox’s film studio jumped 43 per cent to $2.3bn, boosted by the success of Deadpool 2, which has made more than $730m globally at the box office.The future of Sky, the pay-TV company that Fox owns a 39 per cent stake in, is still up in the air. Fox made a bid of £14 a share for the rest of Sky, which Comcast one-upped with a £14.75 offer. Fox has until September 22 to raise its bid for the rest of Sky.Fox on Wednesday said that it is “currently considering its options” with regards to Sky.
44;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-07-26T11:13:35Z;Comcast profits tick higher despite TV subscriber loss;Fall in subscribers comes as increasing number of consumers ‘cut the cord’ on traditional TV;Comcast posted better than expected profits as the largest US cable company weathers an industry-wide shift away from traditional television.The Philadelphia-based company, which just last week backed away from a high-stakes battle with Disney over Fox entertainment assets, lost 140,000 cable TV subscribers in the second quarter. However this was offset by strong demand for fast internet as people increasingly watch shows online. Comcast added 260,000 high-speed internet customers in the quarter — nearly 50 per cent more than the same period a year ago.Earlier this week eMarketer, the research group, unveiled a stark forecast for legacy media: this year 33m Americans will “cut the cord” on their traditional TV service in favour of streaming, accelerating from 27m last year.Comcast was able to increase profits by 5 per cent to $7.4bn in the quarter, despite a plunge in revenues from the Universal film studio that weighed on its NBCUniversal arm. Adjusted earnings per share jumped to 65 cents a share from 52 cents a year ago — above street forecasts for 60 cents. Revenues rose 2.1 per cent to $21.7bn.Sales at NBCUniversal were flat at $8.3bn. Filmed entertainment sales slipped 20 per cent, which the company attributed to a weaker film slate compared to the blockbuster success of The Fast and the Furious sequel a year ago.Comcast and its rivals in the media business have been looking to consolidate to fend off the rising power of tech companies like Netflix and Amazon. Comcast bid unsuccessfully for the entertainment businesses being sold by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, but is still trying to buy Sky, the UK pay-TV group.Comcast has most recently bid £14.75 a share for Sky, valuing it at £26bn, as the Philadelphia company looks for growth outside its core US business, where Comcast has placed tens of millions of cable boxes into US households.
45;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-07-26T06:40:31Z;Sky beats expectations amid Disney-Comcast bidding war;UK broadcaster eyes more original content and global expansion despite takeover battle;Sky has signed off as a listed company by posting better than expected annual results and detailing how it plans to drive future growth with more content production, international expansion and a further push into mobile.The UK media company has been caught in the middle of a tug of war between Walt Disney and Comcast, the cable company, which have been battling to acquire 21st Century Fox over the past year. Fox, which owns a 39 per cent stake in Sky, had already agreed to buy out the UK company before it decided to sell itself to Disney. But Comcast dramatically outbid it for Sky in March and raised its offer this month. The takeover fight has sent Sky shares higher.Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, has dropped out of the race for Fox to focus its efforts on clinching a £26bn deal to acquire Sky. Fox, whose bid is being supported by Disney, could still raise its bid.Sky dispelled any notion that the bidding war had derailed performance with 500,000 new customers joining the company in the past year. “We are excited about our opportunities no matter what our future ownership is. We are not slowing down,” said chief executive Jeremy Darroch.The broadcaster said that revenues grew 5 per cent to £13.5bn in the year to June, topping expectations of 4 per cent, while pre-tax profit increased to £864m from £803m. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation improved 9 per cent to £2.3bn, beating expectations of a 7 per cent rise.The financial strength came in spite of a £2 decline in its average revenue per user in the UK and a €2 dip in Germany over the course of the year. Mr Darroch argued that a reduction in costs, which fell by 70 basis points as a percentage of revenue, offset the slight decline.The company said that it had generated £200m in sales of its own shows around the world with Patrick Melrose, the drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch, sold into 60 markets before it was aired in the UK. Sky will increase its production budget for original content by 25 per cent with 59 of its own shows due to be made this year. It will also film its first series in collaboration with HBO be based on the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.Sky also remains active on the telecoms front having signed a capacity deal with Telefonica’s O2 in the UK, where its customer base has grown to 500,000 users. The company plans to launch ultra-fast broadband in Italy in 2019 as well, where the company posted its best performance for seven years adding 56,000 users in the year to June. Mr Darroch said the addition of exclusive Champions League rights, bolstered by Cristiano Ronaldo’s move to Italian club Juventus, would maintain its growth.Mr Darroch said he was not surprised that his rivals ITV and the BBC were preparing to launch a new streaming platform, as broadcasters bid to forge closer links with consumers. “It is one thing to be a contender in this space. It’s another thing to be a winner,” he said of his rivals’ plans.Paolo Pescatore, a telecoms and media analyst, said: “A stellar quarter to end its fiscal year with key premium content such as the Premier League secured. A prized asset for both Comcast and Disney (via 21st Century Fox). Whoever comes out on top will ensure that Sky has the resources to be an even more formidable player in the rapidly changing media landscape.”Shares were up 5p to £15.12 by early afternoon, still above the £14.75 Comcast offer.
46;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-07-20T04:00:32Z;What’s next for Brian Roberts after losing a big media prize?;Comcast has surrendered Fox to Disney but the chase for Sky is still on;"Brian Roberts, chief executive of America’s largest cable TV company, followed a familiar script on Thursday: a concession speech over a failed mega-deal.The head of Comcast congratulated longtime rival Walt Disney chief executive Bob Iger as he announced he would walk away from a high-stakes $71bn battle for Rupert Murdoch’s Fox entertainment empire.It was the deal-hungry executive’s third such forced statement. In April 2015, Mr Roberts announced that “today, we move on” from a blocked attempt to buy Time Warner Cable for $45bn. A decade earlier, he had used the same language after Disney rebuffed Comcast’s hostile takeover bid, conceding: “It is time to move on.”All was not lost this time round, however. After gatecrashing Disney’s agreed purchase of Fox’s film and cable assets and months of jockeying, Comcast has managed to push up its rival’s acquisition expenses by nearly $20bn — which could constrain Disney’s ammunition in future dealmaking. Investors appeared relieved that Comcast would not be lifting its debt to $170bn by winning the tussle for Fox, pushing its shares up 2.6 per cent on Thursday. But in the long term, observers question whether this battle was one that Mr Roberts could afford to lose, as the media industry undergoes a massive reshaping. “These are once-in-a-lifetime assets,” said the chief executive of one large US telecoms company. “Forget price. Rupert is only selling once.” Mr Roberts’ vigour in going after Fox underscores how badly he is trying to transform Comcast’s business, as he contemplates a future beyond the set box TV. A third of US households have a Comcast cable box, but media giants globally are under threat as technology companies such as Amazon and Netflix have convinced millions of people to cancel their cable subscriptions in favour of streaming services. The uncertainty has fuelled landmark consolidation in the past few years, most notably AT&T’s $80bn acquisition of Time Warner. By winning Fox, Disney is in pole position to come up with a formidable answer to the likes of Netflix with its own streaming service. If the deal goes through, Disney could offer programming ranging from the Marvel and Pixar films to ABC and The Simpsons. Compounding Mr Roberts’ woes, Fox was viewed as the last big global media prize up for grabs after Time Warner. “The problem with walking away is that I don’t see what the other choices are. There’s no obvious plan B,” said Rich Greenfield, analyst at broker BTIG. “The question now is: does he end up with anything?”A keen sportsman, the softly spoken Mr Roberts does not like losing, and he has lost the biggest bet of his career to the same executive who helped thwart another attempted mega-deal. Mr Iger was the number two to former Disney chief executive Michael Eisner when the group rejected Comcast’s advances in 2004. The odds were stacked against Mr Roberts throughout the Fox contest. The son of Comcast’s founder Ralph, he was thrust into the media business at an early age and has been president of Comcast for 29 of his 59 years. But while Mr Murdoch and Mr Iger have been receptive to one another, Mr Roberts has, by definition of his job, been an adversary to the Murdochs. As a distributor of television, Comcast negotiates how much it pays content companies, including Fox, for their programming, which has led to tense moments between the executives. How badly Mr Roberts has lost now hinges on what happens to UK broadcaster Sky, shifting the battle to Europe. The appeal of both Fox and Sky was that they would fill in missing pieces of a global jigsaw puzzle. The Fox assets up for grabs derive 70 per cent of their revenue outside the US, according to Comcast estimates. Comcast makes 9 per cent of revenues from outside the US; acquiring Sky would increase this to 25 per cent.“If there is any upside for Comcast, it is that Disney is maybe less able to complete the Sky transaction than they would have been before,” said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research. Comcast is trying to clinch an acquisition of Sky for £26bn, after raising its offer last week. Fox already owns a 39 per cent stake in Sky, which Disney will now acquire as part of its purchase of Fox assets. Fox had been trying to buy the remaining Sky shares, and the question now is whether Disney-Fox will come back with another offer. “That’s the asset they’ve really wanted all along, so it seems much less likely that Comcast will withdraw [from Sky] without at least a few more rounds of bidding,” said analysts at MoffettNathanson. Mr Roberts “rightly believes that being a player in media will require enormous scale”.While some expect Disney-Fox will sell the 39 per cent stake to Comcast as a consolation prize, Mr Greenfield warned this was far from assured: “If I’m Disney and you just cost me $20bn . . . I would do anything to stop you from getting Sky.”"
47;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Comcast/Disney: Skyfall;When it comes to Sky, Brian Roberts might finally have the upper hand;The pursuit of Fox is over for Brian Roberts. His torment is not. On Thursday, the head honcho at Comcast decided to throw in the towel for the Fox assets he had been chasing. Rupert Murdoch never really favoured Comcast’s entreaties anyway. Still, the bidding war that Mr Roberts created forced Disney to raise its purchase price by 36 per cent. Disney’s bid values the Fox entertainment assets at $71bn. This is worth around $3bn in additional gross value to the Murdochs.Comcast has decided to turn its attention to Sky. It is also fighting with Disney over the satellite and entertainment group but, for now, seems to have the edge with a bid of £14.75 per share. This is above Disney’s last bid and around twice the price that the bids started at. But Disney is about to acquire Fox assets — including a 39 per cent stake in Sky. Mr Roberts is not done tangling with Disney just yet.One approach suggested is that Disney simply stands down and concedes Sky to Comcast (technically, Fox has been bidding for Sky). The Fox television and film parts are more crucial to Disney’s ambition to create a streaming rival to Netflix. The cost to win Sky, while also buying Fox, is excessive. The last £14.75 bid is already 37 per cent higher than the price was in December.However, that still leaves the question of whether Disney should sell or swap that 39 per cent stake in Sky so that Comcast can own Sky outright. The stub position had always been awkward for Fox and will be so now for Disney. Research firm MoffettNathanson notes that the Sky stake is tax inefficient since it cannot be consolidated for financial reporting purposes.Comcast would undoubtedly like to own Sky outright. It could negotiate with Disney to swap assets such as its own stake in US streaming service Hulu for the 39 per cent stub, if Disney is willing. Mr Roberts might finally have some leverage over Disney. He should use it.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

48;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-07-19T17:26:20Z;Comcast’s Fox retreat gives Disney the edge in battle for Sky;Iger is back in the driving seat and Roberts is clearly hoping he is ready to do a deal;A round of blockbuster bids that pitted the world’s biggest media companies against each other in a protracted fight for supremacy is nearing a conclusion — and Walt Disney appears to be heading for victory.Comcast’s withdrawal on Thursday from the pursuit of entertainment businesses being sold by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox means Disney can finalise a $71bn deal agreed with Mr Murdoch. The purchase will add the Fox movie studio and cable channels, as well as Star of India, to a portfolio of assets that includes Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar.Comcast, the US cable group that also owns NBC Universal, had bid unsuccessfully for Fox but conceded defeat in order to focus on Sky, the pay-TV group Mr Murdoch founded almost three decades ago. Its recent bid of £14.75 a share for Sky values the European media group at £26bn and was recommended by an independent Sky committee that is assessing offers for the company.But neither this recommendation nor Comcast’s withdrawal from the pursuit of Fox guarantees that Brian Roberts, its chief executive, will get his hands on all of Sky. This is because Disney will ultimately own 39 per cent of Sky, with the stake among the assets it is acquiring from Fox.Comcast maintained when it launched its first bid for Sky in April that its offer was contingent on it acquiring 50 per cent and one share of Sky. It would like to own all of the company, but Fox and Disney have a binding agreement: the Murdochs cannot unpick their sale to the Mouse House and cut a side deal on the Sky stake with Comcast.Disney could sell Comcast the Sky stake once it completes the Fox acquisition. But will it? Bob Iger, its chief executive, has referred to Sky as a “jewel” of the Murdoch portfolio. Owning it outright would give Disney a hefty distribution presence in Europe — the company has 23m subscribers — and a new content engine. Given that Disney has ambitions to launch a global streaming service to compete with Netflix there is a strategic rationale to owning Sky, which has already developed a healthy streaming business with its “over the top” Now TV service.There are other benefits for Disney in owning Sky. It has sophisticated advertising technology and a strong brand. But it is fundamentally a distribution company, which is not Disney’s area of expertise.Assuming there are no further bids for Sky from Fox-Disney, Comcast would end up owning 61 per cent of Sky, with Disney holding the remaining 39 per cent. The two rivals would be uneasy bedfellows but they have experience of owning a company together: both are shareholders in Hulu, the US streaming service.This would not be ideal for either company. Owning 100 per cent of Sky would mean the company’s cash flow could be consolidated. It could also be used strategically to cross-sell and promote other services operated either by Comcast or Disney — such as a Disney streaming service, for example.If Disney decides against backing a new bid by Fox for Sky, it will have a valuable stake in an asset Comcast wants to own outright. It could use the 39 per cent stake as negotiating leverage with Comcast — perhaps with a view to persuading Comcast to sell it its 30 per cent stake in Hulu. Disney is in line to get Fox’s 30 per cent stake in Hulu when it completes the Fox acquisition and owning Hulu outright would certainly appeal to Mr Iger.But if Disney wants full control of Sky, and all the indications are that it still does, it will have to back a new offer for the company. Analysts say it has plenty of wriggle room for a new bid, while some of the hedge funds that have taken positions in Sky are convinced the bidding war will continue.Whatever happens, Disney is back in the driving seat. Mr Roberts is clearly hoping that Mr Iger is ready to do a deal over Sky. If he is not, Comcast will have to look elsewhere for growth outside its core US market. John Malone’s Liberty Global, which has an extensive presence in Europe — it owns Virgin Media of the UK — would arguably be a more sensible acquisition for Mr Roberts. But Sky is his first target. He will have to wait to see how much Mr Iger wants it before plotting his next move.matthew.garrahan@ft.com
49;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-07-19T16:56:32Z;Disney ready to seize Fox after Comcast walks away;US cable company concedes to focus on battle for TV group Sky;Comcast conceded defeat to rival Walt Disney on Thursday in the $71bn battle to buy most of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox media empire.The cable group that also owns NBC Universal said it would instead focus its efforts on clinching a £26bn deal to acquire Sky, the European pay-TV company. Comcast is attempting to fend off rival interest from Fox, which already owns a 39 per cent stake in Sky and whose bid is being supported by Disney. “I’d like to congratulate [Disney chief executive] Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive. Mr Iger said Disney was “extremely pleased” with the news. “Our focus now is on completing the regulatory process and ultimately moving toward integrating our businesses,” he said in a statement.Comcast’s withdrawal draws to a close one of the biggest bidding wars in media history, a months-long contest that raised the price for Fox’s assets by nearly $20bn, and shifts the global media power struggle to Europe, where Sky has operations in the UK, Germany and Italy.Comcast and Disney fought over Fox as a way to bulk up in the face of digital disrupters such as Netflix and Amazon, which have rapidly undercut traditional media businesses. Shares in Comcast climbed 3 per cent to $35.09 in afternoon trading in New York, as investors expressed relief the bidding would not go any higher. Fox, on the other hand, dropped 1.4 per cent to $46.05.For most of this year, Disney and Comcast have been fighting to acquire two separate stakes in Sky: the 39 per cent held by Fox and the remaining shares owned by others. Shares in Sky closed down 1.5 per cent to £15.09 in London. Last week, Comcast raised its offer to buy Sky to £14.75 per share, up from its initial bid in April of £12.50. The offer came only hours after Fox unveiled its own improved £14-a-share offer, with Disney’s backing, to buy the 61 per cent of Sky it does not already own.Disney will acquire Fox’s 39 per cent stake in Sky as part of its acquisition of Fox entertainment assets, including the Fox movie studio and cable channels. But it is unclear if Disney-Fox will now make an improved offer for the rest of Sky.Michael Nathanson, media analyst with MoffetNathanson, said investors wanted Disney to drop its pursuit. “Most of our clients who own Disney would be more than happy if Disney sold the 39 per cent to Comcast,” he said.Sky would give Disney scale in Europe, as well as a strong position in sports media rights and streaming video, he added. “But American investors think of it as a satellite business and they have a negative view of satellite.”While Comcast explored increasing its offer for the Fox assets, and considered working in tandem with a private equity or technology company to defeat Disney, its higher debt load constrained its ability to surpass Disney’s latest offer. From the start of discussions, the Murdoch family has also preferred to sell the Fox assets to Mr Iger. As part of the Disney deal, the Murdochs are planning to retain ownership of parts of their broadcast empire, including the Fox network and Fox News, and put them into a new company. Some investors believed the 15 per cent decline in the Comcast share price this year — before it announced it would drop the Fox bid — made any stock component of an offer from the cable company less attractive than one from Disney, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations. Disney shares have climbed 3 per cent this year, outpacing the broader S&P 500 US stock market benchmark. A decisive moment came late in June when US antitrust officials cleared Disney’s deal with Fox on the condition it sold some of the regional sports networks it would acquire in the transaction. That decision gave Disney the upper hand as it made its case to Fox shareholders that its offer would face less regulatory scrutiny than a deal with Comcast. The US justice department recently decided to appeal against a judge’s ruling that gave the green light to rival telecoms company AT&T in its $80bn takeover of Time Warner, owner of CNN and HBO.
50;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:22:32+0000;Week in review, July 14;Sky bidding war, oil fund divestment, Facebook fine, Deutsche Bank and TP ICAP;A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Comcast leads bidding war for Sky with £26bn offerThe transatlantic bidding war between Comcast and Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox for pan-European pay TV group Sky saw the US cable group end the week on top with a £26bn offer, write FT reporters.Comcast said on Wednesday that it had raised its pitch to buy the UK-based Sky to £14.75 per share, up from its initial bid in April of £12.50.The offer capped a frenzied day of activity that began with Fox unveiling its own improved offer to buy the remaining 61 per cent of Sky it does not already own to £14 a share.The new Fox bid came with the support of Disney, the US media group that is separately seeking to acquire the bulk of Mr Murdoch’s company, including its 39 per cent stake in Sky.The UK government on Thursday cleared Fox’s bid for Sky, with the conditions that Sky News is spun off and its editorial independence is protected.Adding to the drama, the heads of Disney, Comcast and Fox were all gathered in Sun Valley, Idaho, for an annual conference that draws the elite of the global media industry.The situation amounts to the clearest sign that Disney and Comcast are engaged in a multi-continent struggle to shape the future of the media industry, at a time when digital disrupters led by Netflix are wreaking havoc on the business models of long-established companies.Observers said the bidding war was not over. “Comcast’s new £14.75 cash offer to all Sky shareholders is merely the opening shot in an endgame which will gather pace,” Jefferies analysts wrote in a note, raising their price target to £17.50.Comcast is fighting two bid battles on different continents. In the US it is also vying to acquire the entertainment assets of Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox — including the company’s 39 per cent stake in Sky — but has been outbid by Walt Disney, which has offered $71.3bn, not including debt.Shares in Sky closed at £15.37 on Friday, up from £14.58 at the start of the week, reflecting investor expectations that the bidding war would continue.Norway oil fund sells out of Buffett-owned utilityNorway’s $1tn oil fund is still selling out of companies that use too much coal, taking action at three of Warren Buffett’s utilities this week, writes Richard Milne.The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund gave the results of its fourth round of looking at companies that produce or consume too much coal.It revealed it had sold out of the bonds of US utility PacifiCorp while it placed its parent company Berkshire Hathaway Energy and fellow electricity group MidAmerican Energy under observation, meaning that it could exclude them from its portfolio if it judges they have not taken sufficient action.Norway’s parliament has set a number of limits on what the oil fund can own, forbidding it from holding shares or bonds in companies that produce nuclear weapons, cluster bombs, tobacco, or derive more than 30 per cent of their business from coal.The fund has spent several years examining which companies contravene those guidelines on coal as few definitive figures exist. As of the end of 2017, it owned $164m in bonds in Berkshire Hathaway Energy, $129m in PacifiCorp, $43m in another US electricity seller Tri-State Generation and Transmission that it has sold out of, and $33m in MidAmerican.The fund also announced it had sold out of JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker that has faced severe corruption allegations in Brazil, and that it would follow Indian chemicals group UPL through its active ownership process for the next five years to see if it has rid itself of child labour.Among the companies the oil fund cannot invest in are Airbus, Boeing and Walmart.Facebook fined for data leak and accused of breaking the lawFacebook was hit with its first financial penalty over the data leak to Cambridge Analytica after a watchdog accused the social network of breaking the law, writes Aliya Ram.The fine of £500,000 — the maximum financial penalty allowed under old data protection laws in force during the period in question — was issued as part of a stinging report from the Information Commissioner’s Office, in Britain. It accused Facebook of not protecting user data and failing to be transparent about how it shared data with third parties.The ICO said it had been astounded by the amount of personal data in the possession of the UK’s major parties — personal data sold on by brokers without consent.After the ICO findings the Financial Times reported that former Cambridge Analytica employees had set up a business that would use its data analysis techniques in the Middle East and Africa.The company, called Auspex International, will be based in London and be headed by Mark Turnbull, the former head of Cambridge Analytica’s political team outside of the UK and US, who was caught in an undercover documentary boasting of the company’s links to intelligence agencies.Its sole investor is Ahmad Al-Khatib, a former director of Emerdata, a business that was established to acquire and rebrand Cambridge Analytica before it was hit by the Facebook scandal.Cambridge Analytica’s technique of combining behavioural insights with other data is the subject of controversy but is still considered valuable by companies and governments.Investors frown on ‘strange’ Deutsche Bank mandateThe announcement this week that Deutsche Bank was hiring Cerberus, one of its biggest investors, as an adviser on restructuring its operations did not go down well with some of the lender’s largest shareholders, writes Olaf Storbeck.“It’s similar to accountants working as consultants — it’s not illegal, but it’s surely not looking good,” a person close to one of Deutsche’s largest shareholders said of the move.One issue of concern to shareholders is the possibility that the US private equity group might gain access to potentially confidential information as an adviser. A person familiar with Deutsche’s internal discussions argued that the lender was trusting in Chinese walls between Cerberus’s consulting business and its investment activities.However, the person close to a large shareholder was sceptical. “You just have to ask yourself how Cerberus is ultimately earning most of its money — surely not with its advisory activity.”A person close to a second big Deutsche shareholder called the bank’s move “really strange” given that Cerberus is a “related party” and subject to ongoing market rumours that it might increase its stake in the Frankfurt-based lender.“You really have to ask yourself: why Cerberus? Aren’t there any other, independent advisers around that Deutsche could use?”The private equity group will be restricted in buying or selling Deutsche’s shares while advising the management board, according to a person familiar with the matter.TP ICAP shares tumble as costs rise and boss oustedTensions at TP ICAP, the world’s largest interdealer broker, came to a head on Tuesday with the ousting of chief executive John Phizackerley and a profits warning, writes Philip Stafford.Chairman Rupert Robson informed Mr Phizackerley his near four-year tenure was over in a meeting late on Monday. To the CEO the news was out of the blue. In his view, it was a dispute with Mr Robson over pay.The company told investors cost savings targets arising from integrating its £1.3bn purchase of ICAP’s broking assets in 2016 were not attainable. A target of £100m in annualised savings by 2019 from the deal was cut back, to £75m. Broker pay, which Mr Phizackerley tried to curb, would rise slightly. Financing costs would also rise this year, it warned.The news hit the already weak sentiment around the share price, slicing more than a third off TP ICAP’s value. By the end of the week it was trading at about 266p per share, less than half of what it was in March.“It would appear John was not the detail man that we hoped he was,” said one top ten shareholder.But some also pointed the finger at Mr Robson, arguing he should have addressed the cost problems — first flagged in March — and shareholders’ concerns earlier.New chief executive Nicolas Breteau, formerly head of global broking, and Robin Stewart, confirmed as permanent chief financial officer amid Tuesday’s fallout, will now need to restore the confidence of employees and investors
51;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-07-13T11:55:16Z;Watchdog arbitrates between shareholders and Disney in Sky battle;Disney must offer all Sky investors £14 a share if other bids collapse, Takeover Panel rules;The UK’s takeover watchdog has intervened to arbitrate between minority shareholders in Sky and its possible future owner Disney, setting the price the US media group will have to offer investors if rival bids for the pay-TV network collapse.Disney must offer Sky shareholders at least £14 a share to buy the business if its wider deal to acquire the bulk of 21st Century Fox completes before competing takeover bids for Sky, the UK Takeover Panel has ruled.The £14 minimum price has left some investors who had been pushing for a higher level — or “floor” — after Disney raised its offer for Fox in June disappointed, however.The Takeover Panel’s intervention is the latest twist in a fiendishly complicated bidding frenzy over both Fox and Sky that has seen Disney been pitted against US rival Comcast in a fierce battle for assets that each believes is crucial to survive the digital disruption ravaging the media business.Sky — already 39 per cent owned by Rupert Murdoch’s Fox, which has been trying to buy the rest since late 2016 — is the target at the centre of the battle. Earlier this week, Comcast trumped a raised bid by Fox for Sky, offering £14.75 to Fox’s £14 a share.Disney will be forced to make the £14 a share offer for Sky only if neither the Comcast bid — which, assuming it is formally put to investors, needs 50 per cent plus 1 of Sky shares to approve it — nor the one from Fox complete before the bigger transaction does.In those circumstances, Disney picks up the 39 per cent of Sky owned by Fox, but must offer the other 61 per cent of shareholders a price of at least £14 a share after the Takeover Panel confirmed a “chain principle” applies to the deal.The Takeover Panel’s latest intervention followed significant pressure from Sky’s independent directors and a series of hedge funds who have piled into Sky shares with the aim of squeezing as much value as possible out of the deals in contention.In April the watchdog intervened to require Disney to match the value of Fox’s bid for Sky, should Disney complete its Fox acquisition first. But that ruling was based on an earlier Disney-Fox deal, that valued the entertainment assets of Mr Murdoch’s company at just $52bn.A new deal between Fox and Disney valued the assets at 35 per cent more, $71bn, and was designed to see off rival interest from Comcast. Investors had lobbied the Takeover Panel that the 35 per cent increase should also be applied to Disney’s potential bid for Sky. That would lift the mandatory offer price to more than £14.50 a share.One analyst said: “Sky shareholders are disappointed about the Panel decision. They see it as a weak decision, and don’t see getting £14 price as protection from the Panel.”Sky has requested a review of the decision.The April ruling had already put the body in unprecedented territory and in an uncomfortable position of setting the minimum price for an asset in an auction. Customarily, the UK body plays a light-touch role and relies on its rule book to make sure all shareholders of a target company are treated fairly in a public battle.Shares in Sky were trading at £15.40 by midday in London on Friday, reflecting investor expectations that the bidding war for the asset would continue.This article has been amended to clarify the implications of the Takeover Panel’s ruling

Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder, gave what was deescribed as am extremely impressive keynote address.ATT& chief executive Randall Stephenson received news that the US government launched an appeal on Thursday of a court ruling that gave AT&T the greenlight for its $80bn takeover of Time Warner, setting up a fresh round of litigation.The collection of leading corporate figures was rounded out with a regular Sun Valley conference attendee from industry, Mary Barra, the chief executive of GM, and Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Uber, which made the decision this week to replace “safety operators” in its self-driving cars with specialists ahead of new testing on public roads.
53;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-07-12T18:50:07Z;Sky might not be the limit in unfolding Comcast-Fox bid drama ;Could trio ultimately reach a deal that spares companies further debt and dramatics?;How does Sky’s senior independent director, Martin Gilbert, find enough time for golf? A new bid for the pay-TV group from Comcast of the US, trumping an offer from 21st Century Fox, was the fourth he has had to deal with. It is a good job his full-time employer, Standard Life Aberdeen, let him remain in the role. It must be awfully time consuming having to work out that £14.75 for a Sky share is worth more than offers he previously recommended at £14 and £10.75.A rather more difficult job, however, is working out how this bidding drama concludes. Fortunately, neither Mr Gilbert nor Sky’s shareholders need worry about that. They are already assured of a satisfactory denouement. Sky’s shares hit £15.34 after Comcast bid £14.75 — double the price before the bids started, and proof the market expects more from Fox, now backed by its own would-be acquirer, Disney.Some analysts noted that Disney was publicly supportive of Fox’s £14 offer on Wednesday, and willing to take on more debt to fund it. Others looked at the bigger picture: ownership of Sky is an unfolding battle, pitting Rupert Murdoch’s Fox and Bob Iger’s Disney against Brian Roberts of Comcast — the world’s largest entertainment group. At stake is nothing less than future of the media industry, as it tries to compete with disrupters led by Amazon and Netflix. As one analyst wrote: “Another bid for Sky — thank you, Amazon!”But there may be more counter-arguments to this breathless narrative than there are counterbids.Mr Murdoch does not need to bid more for Sky. He already owns 39 per cent of it and has secured the sale price he wants for that from Disney. He persuaded Disney to lift its offer for his Fox assets, including the Sky stake, by 35 per cent. Other Sky investors then demanded a 35 per cent higher bid for their shares, so minority shareholders were treated equally. Ironically, Comcast has provided this: its £14.75 is 37 per cent higher than Fox’s original £10.75. So Mr Murdoch ends up with the sale price he wants, regardless of whether he sells 100 per cent to Disney or 39 per cent to Comcast. Mr Murdoch arguably does not want to bid more for Sky, either. If the price Fox has to pay for Sky keeps going up, but the price Disney has agreed for Fox does not — and Disney is already lead bidder — then Mr Murdoch’s margin on the Fox deal is theoretically squeezed. And Mr Murdoch probably cares a lot more about a $71bn sale of his Fox assets than he does about a £26bn bid to buy and then sell Sky. Selling Fox to Disney represents a good cultural fit, commentators suggest — which will be important to Mr Murdoch if he plans to remain a shareholder. Accepting Disney’s cash-and-shares offer for Fox would also be more tax efficient for Mr Murdoch than having to take a rival all-cash offer from Comcast. Disney buying Sky through its Fox acquisition is a less obvious fit. Both deal in media content, but Disney has less experience of offering home technology or direct to consumer subscription services.Comcast, by contrast, has — and still does. Its business is TV boxes, broadband hubs, and TV content to send to both. Adding 23m European customers to 29m in the US would make developing and buying these products more cost effective. Buying Sky, which already has a deal to provide Netflix content on its platform, would help it negate the disruptive threat, as well.Comcast’s speed in countering Fox’s Sky bid also informs the narrative. Mr Roberts oversaw the £14.75 offer while at the Sun Valley media conference with Messrs Murdoch and Iger. Might the three ultimately agree a Comcast deal for Sky that leaves the rest of Fox to Disney — and spares their companies further debt and dramatics?It would make sense. But sense does not always come into it. Why else is paying double the market value of Sky, and well above analysts’ £13 fair value, now such an imperative? Gaining such boardroom talent as Mr Gilbert might justify the price tag. Gaining such onscreen talent as ex-footballer Paul Merson and The Apprentice contestant Michelle Dewberry rather less so. On the morning after England’s [insert preferred adjective] defeat to Croatia in the World Cup, was there any sadder sight than the limp St George’s crosses still hanging from white-van wing mirrors? Yes, there was: the limp equity research notes some analysts were made to write, attempting to identify “World Cup winners”.They tried heroically but, under pressure, found themselves resorting to aimless punts . . . the analysts, I mean. All the old strategic errors were repeated. Pub groups’ rising costs and lower profits were overlooked, as some tipped Greene King. Sports Direct’s maverick boss was deemed less of a factor than its replica shirt sales. ITV’s football viewing figures overcame worries about the wider advertising decline. It took a more sober scribe to note that ITV’s 9 per cent share price rise, year-to-date, suggests “upside from the World Cup is already priced in”. For now, ITV shares — like England — have probably gone as far they can.matthew.vincent@ft.comThis article has been amended since initial publication to clarify Disney’ s news and consumer offerings.
54;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-07-12T16:49:57Z;More Sky bids expected in Fox-Comcast battle;Shares in pan-European media group rise on prospect of further moves in bidding war;Investors are betting that the bidding war for Sky between Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and Comcast is not finished after shares in the pan-European media group rose 3 per cent — and above a new offer from Comcast.Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, bid £14.75 a share for Sky late on Wednesday, which was recommended to Sky shareholders by its independent committee. The bid, which values Sky at £26bn, trumped a £14-per-share offer from Fox earlier that day.But shares in Sky have continued to climb and closed up 3.4 per cent at £15.45 on Thursday, valuing the company at £26.7bn.The new bids from Comcast and Fox come as the UK government has cleared Fox’s first bid for Sky after almost 18 months of regulatory review. The deal has been cleared with several conditions, including the sale of Sky News by Fox to Walt Disney, which is separately trying to acquire Fox.Jeremy Wright, the UK culture secretary, said on Thursday that the approval marked “the final stage” of regulatory scrutiny, adding that “it is now a matter for the Sky shareholders to decide” whether to accept Fox’s bid.Observers said the bidding war was not over. “Comcast’s new £14.75 cash offer to all Sky shareholders is merely the opening shot in an endgame which will gather pace following the granted approval of Fox-Sky by the secretary of state,” Jefferies analysts wrote in a note, raising their price target to £17.50.Comcast is fighting two bid battles on different continents. In the US it is vying to acquire the entertainment assets of Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox — including the company’s 39 per cent stake in Sky — but has been outbid by Walt Disney, which has offered $71.3bn, not including debt.“Until now there was a widely held view that Comcast would refrain from a Sky bidding war, keeping its powder dry to contest Disney for Fox’s entertainment assets,” the Jefferies analysts added. In raising its offer, “Comcast has made clear that it sees Sky as a valuable prize in itself”, while “Fox cannot rely on Disney-Fox completion and should be highly motivated to avoid the outcome of being without control of Sky”.The hedge funds that have piled into Sky, including Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group, Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, Davidson Kempner and Odey Asset Management, are also betting that the bidding war continues.Crispin Odey, the founding partner of Odey Asset Management, which owns about 1 per cent of Sky, said he thought the company’s shares could hit £18. “I think [the bidding war] has only just started,” he said, pointing to Sky’s emergence as a producer of original content that can be distributed across Europe.The threat posed to all established media companies by Netflix, which has amassed more than 125m subscribers around the world, gave each bidder additional impetus, he added. “You need two silverbacks in the room and you need a threat in the background, which is where Netflix comes in,” said Mr Odey. “And you need an asset which looks better every time you look at it again.”
55;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T19:36:57+0000;UK government gives all-clear for Fox to buy Sky;;"The UK government has finally cleared plans by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox to acquire the remaining 61 per cent of UK pay TV operator Sky it does not already.

Mr Murdoch now faces just one problem. Late last night, US cable group Comcast outbid Fox for Sky for the second time, trumping Mr Murdoch’s £14 per share offer with its own £14.75 bid, which values Sky at £26bn.Still, the UK government clearance eliminates a critical obstacle to Fox’s pursuit of Sky. Jeremy Wright, the newly installed UK culture secretary, confirmed the position of his predecessor that Fox’s plans to divest Sky News to Disney “or to an alternative suitable buyer could potentially remedy the public interest concerns identified.”The sale of Sky News to Disney was first proposed by Fox several months ago to allay regulatory concerns about its bid. Politicians from across the political spectrum had previously expressed opposition to Mr Murdoch’s full takeover of Sky and pushed for the deal to be blocked.Fox has also made a series of undertakings to protect the editorial independence of Sky News.Mr Wright said:The publication of the undertakings marks the final stage of the public interest consideration of this case. It is right that Ofcom, the CMA and my Department have taken such care in ensuring the bid is properly and effectively scrutinised. It is now a matter for the Sky shareholders to decide whether to accept 21CF’s bid.Fox first agreed to buy Sky in December 2016, offering £10.75 per share. That was before Mr Murdoch decided that it was time to relinquish a huge part of his media empire by selling to Disney. Since then, Disney and Comcast have been fighting to acquire both the Fox assets, which include a 39 per cent stake in Sky, and full control of Sky. As it stands, Comcast has a recommended offer to buy Sky for £26bn and Disney is set to buy the Fox assets for $71bn."
56;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Opening Quote: Sky shareholders think it’s all over... ;;A titanic struggle between some of the greatest players of their generation. At stake: the biggest prize in televised football. One side takes an early lead. Then, late on, the other hits back. A nation that has grown up glued to its TV screens watching such stars as, er, Phil Thompson, Paul Merson and Jeff Stelling, sits on the edge of its seat, awaiting the outcome. And then comes the decisive move….No, not the inevitable 2-1 defeat of the England football team by Croatia in the World Cup. Opening Quote is referring to the battle between Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and its US rival Comcast for Sky plc - home of live football in the UK. Latest score from Sun Valley Idaho, where the players are gathered for the annual media conference: Comcast has taken the lead, by increasing its bid to buy pan-European pay TV group Sky to £26bn, or £14.75 a share. That puts it ahead of a rival £14 offer made by Fox 24 hours earlier on Wednesday. Comcast said in a statement that it had agreed to raise its offer from an initial bid in April of £12.50, which had it put it into the lead, after Fox opened the scoring with £10.75. And the action is becoming frenzied. It only seems like hours ago that Fox upped its offer to buy the remaining 61 per cent of Sky it does not already own to £14 a share. That new Fox bid came with the support of Disney, the US media group that is separately seeking to acquire the bulk of Mr Murdoch’s company, including the 39 per cent stake in Sky. How will it be decided?Industry pundits reckon it will go to extra time in Sun Valley - because all the exhausted players are present. They need a result, as they are running out time and weighed down by debt. Notably, the heads of Disney, Comcast and Fox are all on the pitch and all needing to come away with a result. With Disney and Comcast engaged in a multi-continent struggle to shape the future of the media industry - and both wanting a final showdown with digital disrupters led by Netflix - expect a decisive deal.Some think Fox will let Comcast take out Sky, to give itself a European presence, if it means Fox can go on to win the ultimate prize of a bigger deal with Disney. We are in injury time…don’t go anywhere.Talk about a dodgy refereeing decision going against European players. There has to be better use of VAR…No not the inevitable emergence of video evidence to prove England woz robbed in the World Cup somehow. Opening Quote is referring to the anger of a top-five shareholder in Unilever, who has has warned that many UK investors will be forced to selling the consumer giant’s shares because if its change in legal struture and move to the Netherlands. Unilever has gone on the “offensive” with its UK shareholders, according to reports, after they expressed dissent over the company’s likely ejection from the FTSE 100 index. That would mean some fund managers who are expected to hold FTSE 100 stock would have to sell Unilever shares. Now Nick Train, joint founder of Lindsell Train, a top-five shareholder with a 2.5 per cent Unilever stake, urged holders of Unilever’s UK-listed stock to “give serious consideration over the summer as to whether the proposal is in their interest”.He clearly deems it offside - and his comments to the FT highlight the battle Unilever faces in winning the required 75 per cent of UK shareholders to vote in favour of the Netherlands move, alongside 50 per cent of Dutch shareholders. .And finally, another slight disappointment from a team accustomed to winning… Asos, the Aim-listed online fashion retailer has said full year sales growth would be “towards the lower end” of a 25-30 per cent range, but that gross margin increased by more than expected in its most recent trading period.In the four months to end-June, retail sales overall were up 22 per cent with UK sales — still over a third of the total — growing slightly ahead of that. Retail gross margins rose by 1.3 percentage points but the rise for the full year will be closer to 1 point, it said. Pre-tax profit is likely to be in line with consensus, which is around £100m on £2.45bn of revenue.Asos has had a few iffy results of late. In April, a warning that capital spending would need to be stepped up to accommodate sales growth resulted in a sell-off in the shares. More recently, an adverse ruling on sales taxes at the US Supreme Court affected shares in all online retailers negatively, with Asos falling 5 per cent. And that’s the final whistle. At least there’ll be no more awful football analogies for… about a month.Today’s Lombard column focuses on BT shareholders voting against executive pay.BT engineers used to warn each other that the spring-loaded door on a K6 red telephone box could “fly back sharply and cause injury” on the way in. BT shareholders, by contrast, appear to have told chief executive Gavin Patterson not to let the door hit him in the arse on the way out. Why else would 3.5 per cent of them have bothered to vote against his reappointment at Wednesday’s annual general meeting — when his departure from the telecoms group had already been announced on June 8?A possible motivation for their parting shot was not difficult to find. It appeared further up the ballot paper: the directors’ annual remuneration report.Read the rest of today’s Lombard column here.

57;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

Sky shares climbed 2 per cent on Thursday to £15.21 each. The rise takes them above the £14.75 a share bid Comcast made for the group late on Wednesday, which was itself a counter to the £14 that was offered by 21st Century Fox just hours earlier.The skirmish underscores the high stakes for Comcast and 21st Century Fox, as well as Walt Disney, which is seeking to scoop up a large swath of Fox’s assets in a separate deal. The media industry is facing intense disruption from the likes of Netflix, the video streaming site, and other competitors.The latest set of offers represents a sharp increase to the £10.75 Rupert Murdoch’s Fox initially agreed to pay in late 2016.“Red letter days are coming thick and fast for Sky shareholders. Investors are now close to doubling their money as a result of the bidding war for Sky, and there may yet be another twist in this tale which will swell their coffers even more,” said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown."

That hurdled a $65bn bid from Comcast and usurped its own initial offer by nearly $20bn.The increased offer underscored Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts’ desire to diversify the cable behemoth outside of the US and beat his Disney rival Bob Iger in a fight for profitable entertainment assets.Mr Roberts told his inner circle that he wanted the new bid put out immediately, for his advisers to move quickly and not allow even a day to pass without beating the latest Fox offer, according to people close to Comcast.Mr Roberts and his team have also been working in recent weeks on a counter-proposal to gatecrash Disney’s deal with Fox, according to people close to the cable company.He said: “We are pleased to be announcing a recommended increased offer for Sky today. We have long admired Sky, which we believe is an outstanding company and a great fit with Comcast. Today’s announcement further underscores this belief and our commitment to owning Sky.”Martin Gilbert, the deputy chairman of Sky, said the entertainment group’s independent committee had unanimously recommended the improved offer from Comcast.

If the decline holds, it would be Fox’s largest one-day percentage drop since early February, according to Thomson Reuters data.As the FT reported, Fox increased the terms of its offer for Sky, the pan-European media company, to £14 a share on Wednesday in a deal worth £24.5bn. It is a significant premium to the original £10.75 a share deal it made with the London-based company in December 2016 before US cable group Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, swooped in with a counterbid, with its most recent offer standing at £12.50 a share.Comcast is currently exploring another counterbid to try and edge out Fox, which is itself preparing to sell its entertainment assets to Walt Disney in a $71bn takeover.Investors could be worried about the ramifications for Fox of the latest flare-up in the bidding war between the two companies, as media companies attempt to adjust to counter the meteoric growth of new rivals like Netflix.Comcast shares are up 1.33 per cent on Wednesday, while Disney shares have gained 1.67 per cent.

It also trumps Comcast’s most recent £12.50-a-share offer.Sky’s independent committee said on Wednesday that the new Fox bid represented “a substantial increase in value relative to the Comcast offer”, adding that it “intends to unanimously recommend” the offer to Sky shareholders.“We welcome this increased offer which is 30 per cent higher than 21CF’s initial bid and 12 per cent above Comcast’s,” said Martin Gilbert, head of the committee. “This offer reflects the strong position the business is in and is an attractive premium for shareholders.”However, Mr Murdoch’s company has yet to receive UK government clearance on its planned takeover of Sky, which remains a key obstacle to a deal. The government’s decision is expected by Friday.The new offer is pitched below the trading range in recent days for Sky shares, which closed on Tuesday at £15.01 giving the company a market value of £25.6bn. Sky has net debt of £7.4bn, according to FactSet data.The shares slipped back to £14.94 by the close of London trading on Wednesday.Analysts questioned Fox’s latest offer. “It seems inconceivable a deal can go through at this £14 level,” said Alex DeGroote, an independent analyst. “This is not a knockout blow at all [and] we are puzzled it’s recommended.”A number of hedge funds, including Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group, Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, Davidson Kempner and Odey Asset Management, have piled into Sky shares in the expectation of a continuing bidding war.In addition to competition from Comcast, the increased Fox offer reflects improvements in Sky’s operating performance thanks to its recent success in securing rights to the English Premier League at a price lower than most analysts had expected.Fox said on Wednesday that Disney provided its consent to the extra debt it would incur as a result of the higher offer. Disney has also offered to reimburse Fox £1bn, or £1 per Sky share it does not already own, if its own deal to acquire Fox is blocked by regulators and thus disrupts the new arrangements made for Fox’s takeover of Sky.Last month Disney revealed that it projected Sky’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and free cash flow would be much higher from 2020 than when it first struck a deal for Fox. For that year, it estimated that ebitda would be £3.06bn, more than 27 per cent higher than its previous forecast.Disney hopes to add programming and films from Fox to a global streaming service it is developing and Sky would give it a much heftier presence in Europe, with 23m customers in the UK, Germany and Italy.Fox said: “This transformative transaction will position Sky so that it can continue to compete within an environment that now includes some of the largest companies in the world, but none of whom have demonstrated the same local depth of investment and commitment to the UK and to Europe.”

Back then it was possible to fiddle with TV buttons to help keep the picture straight. Such a mechanism would be helpful in clearing up the drama over 21st Century Fox assets, including Sky. The image has grown steadily more blurry over the past 18 months. Comcast shareholders should switch over.Fox wants to buy the parts of Sky it does not own. Disney and US rival Comcast both want to buy Fox, including Sky. Counterbidding has caused the deal value to roll upwards. On Wednesday, Fox increased its all cash offer for Sky to £14 per share, worth £24.5bn. That is an improvement on its original bid by almost a third. It is not, however, the end.Never mind that Sky’s board has once again recommended Fox’s offer shortly after it was received. Hedge fund managers have piled into Sky shares in the belief of a continued bidding war. One, Crispin Odey, claims the shares are worth £18. Given that the latest Fox bid is still about a pound below Sky’s market price, he is not alone.While Comcast has bid for all of Fox, it began this saga by tilting at Sky for £12.50 in April. Comcast must publish its offering document for Sky by this Friday to comply with UK Takeover Panel rules. This provides an opportunity for Comcast to raise its bid. But its shareholders are unlikely to stomach another round of bidding.True, Comcast would get another 23m international customers from Sky but its content centres on football, an expensive business. Though Sky did well to keep costs down in the latest UK media rights auction, Amazon is lurking. It threatens to push up media rights costs and has already bought up a sliver of Premier League matches this year. It also owns rights in other sports such as tennis. Meanwhile, Sky is getting pricier by the week. Its enterprise value to ebitda, a cash earnings measure, of 14 times is at its historical high. This looks excessive for a mature distribution business.Comcast’s interest is starting to smack of desperation. Shares are off a sixth this year. Disney already has US regulatory approval for its Fox takeover plan and Fox’s intentions continue to get a good reception from Sky’s board. For Comcast, the picture is too fuzzy. A higher bid would drag its share price further down. Stay tuned.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Will Comcast bid more?

63;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-07-10T07:54:46Z;Fox prepares new Sky offer to outbid Comcast;Countermove to US cable group for pan-Europe TV channel could come this week;Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is preparing a new bid for Sky that would value it at about £25bn in a clear sign it is committed to beating Comcast in the race to acquire the pan-European pay television group.Fox is preparing to make the new bid as soon as this week if, as expected, its earlier bid for Sky to be formally approved by the UK government.Fox is expected to pitch the new offer at a premium to the most recent bid from US cable group Comcast, which has offered £12.50 a share, according to two people briefed on the matter.Sky share closed on Monday at £14.68, with some analysts expecting the new Fox offer to come in above that price. The shares rose 1.5 per cent to £14.89 in early Tuesday trading. Fox declined to comment.The new Fox bid will be the latest salvo in an 18-month takeover battle for Sky, which has become a pawn in a global media power play between Disney and Comcast. Disney has agreed a $71bn takeover of Fox’s entertainment assets — including its 39 per cent stake in Sky — and will take full ownership of Sky if Fox succeeds with its bid.Comcast is trying to insert itself into both deals and has made an all-cash offer for the Fox assets, as well as a separate offer for Sky.Comcast is preparing to post details of its £12.50-a-share offer before a Friday deadline under UK takeover rules, which state a company has 28 days to post its offer document to shareholders after receiving clearance from regulators.The bidding war comes as media companies adjust to the meteoric growth of Netflix, which has amassed more than 125m subscribers and has a market value greater than Disney. Fox initially agreed to buy Sky in December 2016 in a deal that valued the company at £10.75 a share before Mr Murdoch decided to break up his empire by selling his entertainment businesses to Disney.Disney hopes to add programming and movies from Fox to a global streaming service that it is developing and Sky would give it a much heftier presence in Europe with 23m customers in the UK, Germany and Italy.A number of hedge funds including Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group, Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, Davidson Kempner and Odey Asset Management have piled into Sky shares on the expectation that the bidding war between Fox and Comcast will continue.After Disney outbid Comcast for Fox by increasing its initial bid for Mr Murdoch’s company by 35 per cent, Sky shareholders and its independent directors have argued to the UK Takeover Panel that Fox must raise its offer for Sky by at least a similar amount.
64;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-06-30T04:02:40Z;Comcast’s fight for Fox: the role for family money;Investments intended to last generations are increasingly involved in dealmaking;The bidding war for 21st Century Fox has become a tortured affair, as Bob Iger and Brian Roberts — the respective chieftains of Disney and Comcast — try to wrest control of some of the entertainment company’s most prized assets. Price no longer seems to matter. And as Mr Roberts readies to top Disney’s last $85.1bn offer, he has started to contemplate the addition of a partner for his approach. Comcast, after all, is constrained by how much more debt it can deploy and the credit markets have become less welcoming of late.Financial conditions in the US have steadily been tightening and are now the most restrictive they’ve been in nearly a year, according to Goldman Sachs. Rising yields on corporate bonds come at an inopportune time for a suitor launching the largest ever cash bid.In June, when Comcast tabled a $78bn offer including debt, the company said it was “highly confident” in its ability to finance what would be the largest all-cash bid in dealmaking history. In its corner, it had Wall Street giants Bank of America and Wells Fargo lined up with funding.But another source of capital is available for the family-controlled Comcast: wealthy families that are increasingly investing directly in big corporate deals. Some are household names such as the Pritzkers and Dells, although banks across Wall Street are courting hundreds more. Others invest through boutiques such as BDT Capital, the investment management and advisory firm run by Byron Trott, confidant of Warren Buffett.Consider this another type of patient capital, but one where holding times are not thought of in three- or five-year increments popular with private equity investments. In fact, as one investment banker on Wall Street recently put it, some of these families are hoping to make investments that will last generations. They have grown somewhat aloof from the traditional private equity investment strategy. Data from PitchBook shows that these families have more than doubled their activity in dealmaking over the past five years.For traditional fixed income investors, the arrival of this type of patient capital is a welcome sign. These families tend to be less reliant on leverage and don’t rely as much as other investors in using debt to boost returns, in part because they are not after a fixed 20 or 25 per cent internal rate of return.They also have an ability to compete for deals in volatile markets when other buyers, such as private equity, might struggle to convince a bank to lend money to help finance an acquisition. The reason: some family investing ventures are willing to hold the debt themselves until it can be publicly placed through the capital markets or via banks.Over the past year, deals have included the $2.8bn purchase by magazine publisher Meredith of rival Time Inc, which contained a $650m preferred equity investment from Koch Equity Development. And the takeover of Ring Container Technologies, the plastics group, by MSD Partners was formed by the partners who manage Michael Dell’s wealth. JAB Holdings, with its investments in sandwich chain Panera and Krispy Kreme, is another well-known family-run investment group.The increased interest by these families in direct investments will probably add extra kindling to the already record run of mergers and acquisitions. That pace of dealmaking has unsettled some in the market, who recall the peaks seen in 2000 and 2007 and the resulting recessions. But that itself is not a clear signal that the cycle is about to turn. It’s a red herring.Activity has been heated in many sectors this year, unlike in the past when it hinged heavily on the technology industry. A drop in M&A activity in 2017, as companies awaited the outcome of US tax reform, also meant many groups came into the year ready to pull the trigger on a deal. Investors would do better to look for a return of risky financing strategies — à la the pay-in-kind toggle note that was ubiquitous before the financial crisis — or the venture capital investments being doled out to lossmaking companies such as WeWork or Uber for signs of overheating.Better yet, investors should look at the rising leverage levels on deals as the indication that things are becoming feverish. The bidding war for Fox, if anything, underscores the still rational thought process under way at Comcast and Disney corporate headquarters, especially if the assets — including streaming service Hulu — prove critical in the ever-evolving media space.While each company is willing to load up on debt, neither wants to test the lower boundary of the investment grade universe. It is why Comcast is right to contemplate a role for a partner. Amazon or Apple might be the right fit. But the cable giant may also want to look at the universe of wealthy families who are looking to deploy their money in a long-term investment. Preferred equity would after all keep leverage down and moreover provide Comcast with extra firepower in its bid against Disney. It’s just a matter of Mr Roberts finding the right family.eric.platt@ft.com
65;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T19:13:39+0000;Comcast chief must consider sharing load in Fox tussle;Brian Roberts may have to bring in a partner to knock off Disney’s proposal;"The race to buy Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment businesses is entering the final stretch and Walt Disney has taken a decisive lead, securing clearance from the US government and a recommendation from the board of Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. Comcast’s hopes of turning Mr Murdoch’s head with a rival offer seem to be receding. Is it too late for the US cable giant to get back in the game?Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, has pulled off several multibillion-dollar deals over the years and does not like losing. But he may have to consider bringing in a partner if he is to make an offer that truly knocks out the Disney proposal. Without one, Comcast’s debt could soar to eye-watering levels. Disney’s latest $38-a-share bid values a collection of assets that include Fox’s movie studio, cable channels and holdings in Sky and Hulu at about $71bn not including debt. Comcast’s latest all-cash offer of $35 a share valued the Fox assets at $65bn, which would have lifted Comcast’s debt to about $170bn — greater than the debt of some countries. While Comcast’s cable business generates a lot of recurring revenue from the millions of US households that subscribe to its services, which will help in paying down the debt, the added borrowings that would be necessary to take another tilt at Fox mean a partner might be the best solution. But who should it be? There are many attractive businesses and investments in the Fox portfolio that might tempt another company to join forces for a new bid. Sky is the pick of the Fox assets, having expanded beyond the UK in recent years with the merger of its German and Italian operations. Deutsche Telekom, the owner of T-Mobile in Europe, might be interested in Sky, although any involvement in a Comcast bid would be a big departure from its recent strategy of investment in fibre and connectivity, rather than content. Vodafone, the UK telecoms group, is another name bankers trying to gatecrash the deal might want to consider tapping as a potential Comcast partner.But it is unclear if Mr Roberts would consider sharing Sky, given Comcast has made a separate bid for the pay-TV company. Another option would be to bring in a private equity partner to buy the Fox regional sports networks and spread the balance sheet risk that way. There are other more obvious buyers of the RSNs, whether they end up being sold by Disney as a condition of its takeover of Fox, or Comcast. John Malone, the so-called “cable cowboy” and one of the pre-eminent media dealmakers of recent years, told the Wall Street Journal recently that his Charter Communications cable group could look at RSNs. Whether it brings in a partner or not, Comcast faces an uphill battle for the Fox assets now Disney has secured US regulatory approval. “The pressure is now back on Comcast to come in with a more significant bid above Disney’s $38-per-share offer to help sway the Fox board to reject the bird-in-the-hand regulatory clearance,” MoffettNathanson analysts wrote this week.Not everyone agrees that Disney’s success in gaining US government approval puts it in a stronger position. Christopher Hohn, whose TCI Fund owns 7.4 per cent of Fox, wrote to Mr Murdoch this week pointing to the large international component of the Fox assets and saying that a sale would require clearance by international regulators, as well as by the US Department of Justice. With the sale of Time Warner to AT&T, Fox is the last international media company up for grabs. However, if Disney prevails there are alternative, albeit smaller, options available to Mr Roberts and other buyers interested in media assets. Sony’s Hollywood movie and television studio has attracted plenty of interest over the years and in Kenichiro Yoshida the company now has a chief executive who is more likely to be open to offers than his predecessor, Kazuo Hirai, ever was.But Mr Roberts knows that Fox is the big prize, which is why he is pulling out all the stops to give Disney a run for its money. Sharing the spoils with a bid partner may not be overly appetising for Mr Roberts but he may have to bite the bullet if he and Comcast are to stay in the race.

66;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-06-28T15:44:20Z;Activist Hohn urges Murdoch to keep Comcast in the hunt for Fox;;Sir Christopher Hohn, the activist investor behind the hedge fund TCI, is urging Rupert Murdoch to keep Comcast in the running to buy 21st Century Fox after its rival bidder, Walt Disney, won US government antitrust approval for the deal on Wednesday, moving it a step closer to a deal.“Horizontal antitrust issues for Comcast are no greater than for Disney, and in most instances lower,” Sir Christopher wrote in a letter to Mr Murdoch. “The announced settlement on June 27 between Disney and the Department of Justice sets a strong precedent and template for a Comcast settlement.”Sir Christopher’s fund has built a 7.4 per cent stake in Fox, which is controlled by Mr Murdoch through dual class shares. He was previously a Comcast shareholder.He also wrote to Mr Murdoch in May, urging the mogul to “immediately engage” with Comcast on a possible deal. But on Wednesday, in a setback to Comcast, Disney reached a deal with the DoJ’s antitrust division to sell some of its regional sports networks in order to acquire Fox.A deal with Disney could also “be constrained by the timetable of international approvals, which we would expect to take between six and nine months,” Sir Christopher wrote in the letter on Thursday. “Comcast should not be on a significantly dissimilar timetable in respect of its international approvals.”
67;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-06-27T08:58:27Z;Hedge funds push regulator to set higher Sky price;Investors seek revised valuation to reflect Disney’s move to outbid Comcast;Investors demanding a higher takeover offer for Sky have been given fresh ammunition by a sharp increase in the profits forecast for the broadcaster by Walt Disney as part of its bid for Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.Sky has become ensnared in a transatlantic bidding war between US cable group Comcast and Disney to acquire the bulk of Fox, the group that owns 39 per cent of Sky. Fox had been trying to purchase the remaining shares in Sky that it did not already own when the bidding war broke out.Hedge funds are pushing the UK Takeover Panel to rule that Fox’s bid for London-based broadcaster Sky must be increased if Mr Murdoch’s global media group is taken over by Disney.The long-running takeover saga has prompted a number of hedge fund investors to build positions in Sky’s shares, including Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group, Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, Davidson Kempner and Odey Asset Management.The Takeover Panel ruled in April that Disney would need to follow through on Fox’s planned deal for Sky at the £10.75 per share price originally offered by Mr Murdoch’s company to ensure all minority shareholders were treated equally.Since then, Comcast gazumped Fox’s deal with Sky, which was first agreed in December 2016, and recently made a formal £12.50 a share offer for Sky, valuing the group at more than £22bn.Disney also has since renegotiated a deal to acquire Fox, agreeing to increase its offer by 35 per cent, valuing the company at $71.3bn, not including net debt, up from a previous deal worth $52.4bn.And in a filing this week, Disney said it projected that Sky’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and free cash flow would be much higher from 2020 than originally thought. For that year, it projected that ebitda would be £3.06bn or more than 27 per cent higher than its previous forecast.The argument is over how much of Disney’s new offer to Fox should be ascribed to Sky. We believe Sky’s performance has been better than the rest of Fox and it deserves more than a linear increaseHedge funds say that the increased bid for Fox reflected increased expectations for the profitability of Sky. Consequently, they argue the Takeover Panel should set an increased “floor” price for Sky so minority shareholders in the pan-European broadcaster receive the same amount as Fox for their shares.“The argument is over how much of Disney’s new offer to Fox should be ascribed to Sky,” said one large Sky shareholder. “We believe that Sky’s performance has been better than the rest of Fox and therefore it deserves more than a linear increase.”Hedge funds also believe a new floor price would reflect the value of improvements in Sky’s operating performance, thanks to its recent success in securing rights to the English Premier League at a price lower than most analysts had expected.Mark Kelly at Olivetree Financial said that the Disney disclosure was the first evidence that the valuation of Sky had increased over the timeline of its bidding for Fox. He said the new forecasts implied a valuation of up to £14.75 per Sky share.“Ever since Disney bumped its offer for Fox last week there has been an intense lobbying of the UK Takeover Panel to argue that the see-through value for Fox’s Sky stake should increase accordingly,” he said. “We are in somewhat uncharted territory as to how the regulator might model the necessary bump to Sky shareholders implied via the improvement offered to Fox.”Disney said in the filing that its new projections for Sky “should not be construed as profit forecasts for the purposes of Rule 28 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers”.The Takeover Panel declined to commentShares in Sky rose 0.3 per cent in early Wednesday trading to £14.40.Disney and Fox published their joint merger agreement, which also revealed that the Fox board had assessed the Comcast offer as containing a greater degree of regulatory risk than the Disney proposal.“While a potential Disney transaction was likely to receive required regulatory approvals and ultimately be consummated, a strategic transaction with Comcast continued to carry higher regulatory risk,” the filing stated. The Comcast offer contained “relatively higher regulatory risk . . . in terms of both delay and closing risk”.

People close to Mr Roberts said that Comcast was working on sweetening its offer to outbid Disney.The assets put up for sale by Mr Murdoch include his film and television studios, cable entertainment networks and a stake in internet streaming company Hulu, as well as international holdings such as Star India and a 39 per cent stake in pan-European broadcaster Sky.It is unclear whether an extended bidding war would further fatten the advisory fees for both Goldman and Centerview, a boutique investment bank that also advised 21st Century Fox. Centerview is set to make $22m for the advice that its top banker on the transaction, Blair Effron, provided to the company during the sale process, according to the regulatory filing on Tuesday.JPMorgan and Guggenheim Partners, who are advised Disney in the takeover process, are estimated to make $27.5m in fees each, according to the same filing.

Yet according to our best thinkers on the future of capitalism, the corporate titans driving these decisions are heading firmly backward.AT&T and Comcast are communications companies that are attempting to go vertical and control every layer of a media empire from underground cables to the creation of content. It all seems very last century, if not 19th century. Back then, Andrew Carnegie was determined to own coal mines and railroads as well as steel mills. The goal was control from top to bottom, closed access and economies of scale.But that is old-fashioned thinking, according to the current crop of books on the dramatic economic changes being wreaked in the next phase of the information age. They argue that vertical integration amounts to building silos in an era that will be dominated by platforms — owning in an era of renting — and looking for mass markets when customers want individualised products.Hemant Taneja makes a strong case for “customised microproduction and finely targeted marketing” in his book Unscaled. An investor for the Boston-based firm General Catalyst, he does not question the value of having many customers rather than few. But he argues that fast-growing companies in sectors ranging from energy to healthcare and education are succeeding because they customise their goods and services to a “market of one”.The rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing allows these companies to “rent scale”, he writes. Small, nimble companies can now out-compete big ones in specific markets, adding scale as they need to.These companies are also taking advantage of the changing nature of capitalism. Viktor Mayer-Schönberger and Thomas Ramge argue in Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data that markets are shifting from relying on price to relying on data to determine an item’s inherent value. As any buyer of aeroplane tickets knows, we now search for products largely based on price.AI will make it possible to take into account a much wider range of personal preferences, from style to materials to carbon footprint. Once the computer has matched a complex set of attributes with the available products on offer, it will negotiate a price with the seller and close the deal — for a market of one.Companies will become smaller, because it will no longer be as efficient to organise human activity centrally. The future is more likely to belong to companies that have a small number of managers overseeing machines and freelancers, the gig economy writ large.So why would vertical integration make sense in media? AT&T has said it plans to use “robust content” to drive “viewer engagement to new levels” and micro-target customers and advertisers through data analysis.That would fit the new capitalist playbook, except that Messrs Mayer-Schönberger and Ramge predict that advertising as we know it will disappear as “push” is replaced by “pull”. Rather than being bombarded by targeted sales pitches, customers will opt to select specific media products and pay for the ability to see them without being constantly interrupted by adverts.AT&T says it is seeking to “transform how video is distributed, paid for, consumed and created”. But in reality it is chasing Netflix, a far smaller company in terms of costs and revenues, and hence a much nimbler one.Netflix’s market value exceeded that of Comcast back in May and it is now bigger than Disney. Its global headcount is 5,500, nearly one-fifth of Time Warner’s and one-50th of AT&T’s. Netflix does not have the size to build as large in-house AI capabilities. But a quick search for “media data analytics” reveals a score of companies. Why pay for that capability when you can rent it?AT&T-Time Warner does have one final advantage: a massive 5G wireless and fibre network. Now that the US has stopped requiring “net neutrality”, at least for now, network providers could leverage their market power to charge out-of-network content streamers more, just as Andrew Carnegie charged higher prices to rival steel companies who wanted to use his railroad.

70;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-06-21T03:55:28Z;Media titans duel for perfect ending in Fox bid battle;Contest between long-time Disney and Comcast chiefs will come down to debt sustainability;Executives at Walt Disney’s Pixar unit were cheering over the weekend. Incredibles 2, the company’s long-awaited animated superhero sequel, debuted to a record-breaking box office haul.The film centres on Elastigirl, whose superhuman elasticity allows her to stretch her limbs hundreds of feet. Now Bob Iger, who has led Disney as chief executive for more than a decade, is the one who has had to stretch.The company is stuck in an intensifying bidding war with US cable giant Comcast for some of the marquee assets of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, including its movie studio, FX cable network, and a stake in pan-European broadcast group Sky. On Wednesday, Disney lifted its bid by nearly $20bn, valuing the company at $85bn including its net debt and vaulting over a rival offer from Comcast by roughly $6bn.The battle presents a showdown between two longtime media executives — Mr Iger and his Comcast counterpart Brian Roberts — who have helped shape the entertainment business over the past three decades. Analysts view the fight for Fox as an existential challenge for Disney, with an expectation that losing out could make the serial acquirer a target for tech giants eager for a foothold in the media industry.We have a really hard time seeing Iger ending his career in defeat to Comcast and then simply retiring after the lossThe question for all involved is how high the bidding could go for Fox, with Disney’s latest offer already ranking among the largest media deals ever contemplated. Comcast and Disney will ultimately be constrained by the amount of debt they are able to sustain as well as their ability to navigate an increasingly tumultuous regulatory backdrop.“The only outstanding question was whether Disney’s board and management would go to the mat on this transaction,” analysts with MoffettNathanson Research wrote. “We now know the answer is clearly yes!”Comcast is already gearing up for a new bid. The company, which owns the NBCUniversal media group, has contacted its bankers at Bank of America and Wells Fargo to draw up plans to raise more cash without straining its investment grade credit rating.Investment grade ratings are critical to both Comcast and Disney. Whichever company succeeds in the fight for Fox will see its debt levels soar and have greater reliance on bond markets for financing in the future. Disney has an edge as its debt levels are lower than Comcast, giving it more room to borrow to fund a cash payment to Fox.Naveen Sarma, a senior director at credit rating agency S&P Global, said the current Disney bid could push its rating to triple-B plus from A plus. Comcast’s latest offer, by contrast, could drive its rating to triple-B minus, one level above junk territory.“Comcast does not want to go to triple-B minus. It is something they’re not comfortable doing,” Mr Sarma said. “Brian [Roberts] is definitely concerned about the quantum of debt and the ability to de-lever. It is his company and his family’s company and he would not want to do something that would harm the company.”The exact amount of debt either company can take on is being hotly debated by both groups’ financial advisers, and is affected by Fox’s ability to close its takeover of Sky.Moody’s analyst Neil Begley said that there was “no danger” either Disney or Comcast would be stripped of their investment grade ratings. He estimated Comcast could increase its bid by another $40bn and retain investment grade ratings. That would push Comcast’s debt levels to more than five times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation — a heady level for any company.Disney’s lower debt load gives it more flexibility. By Financial Times calculations, it could add roughly $50bn to its bid before hitting a similar leverage contemplated by Mr Begley. Either company could also offer more stock if leverage climbs too high. Neither Disney nor Comcast has said they would pay that much for Fox.Disney’s other pitch to Fox shareholders is certainty. Disney is widely viewed as a safer bet for regulatory approval because it would involve a tie-up of two media companies, or a horizontal merger, versus a so-called vertical merger, similar to AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner, which the US Department of Justice unsuccessfully sought to block.Mr Iger reiterated this point repeatedly on a call with investors on Wednesday. However, in light of last week’s court ruling to greenlight AT&T’s deal, analysts believe Comcast now faces lower regulatory hurdles. “It seems to us that most of the Fox assets — and especially the Fox assets that Comcast most wants — have very little regulatory concern,” said Todd Juenger, an analyst at Bernstein.With Wednesday’s offer, Disney’s commitment has been laid bare. The question remains how far Comcast — and Mr Roberts — are willing to push back.If Mr Roberts pulls off a deal with Fox, it would be his third $10bn-plus acquisition at Comcast, the company founded by his father in 1963. The Philadelphia native devised the $50bn merger of Comcast with AT&T Broadband in 2001, and a decade later acquired NBCUniversal. He has also failed: a bid for Time Warner Cable in 2015 was blocked by regulators, while Disney rebuffed his advances in 2004.Mr Iger is also putting his legacy on the line. The 67-year-old has promised to stay at the helm of Disney until July of next year as the company searches for a successor.“We have a really hard time seeing Iger ending his career in defeat to Comcast and then simply retiring after the loss,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG. “On the other hand, we cannot imagine Brian Roberts as an owner who is looking out 30-plus years losing the last major chess piece on the game board that he covets, especially to Disney. That is not the storybook ending Roberts wants either.”
71;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-06-20T17:29:45Z;Disney/Fox: hotter than July;The Mouse has more firepower so the question is conviction;Like a summer “tent-pole” movie franchise, the sequels are seemingly endless. On Wednesday, Disney predictably bumped up its purchase price for the 21st Century Fox assets that it is fighting Comcast over. Disney has a deeper war chest than the rival bidder. But does the Mouse and its shareholders have the conviction to keep going?Wednesday’s deal values the Fox assets at $71bn. By comparison, Disney’s first terms from December valued them at $52bn. Comcast’s offer last week was worth $65bn, all in cash.There are other changes beyond the headline value. Instead of all-stock, Disney will now allow shareholders to choose between $38 per share in cash or stock. The final split between the two currencies is fixed for the whole bid at 50 per cent each. Moreover, Fox shareholders who choose Disney stock will receive a “collar” arrangement that fixes the $38 per share value as long as the Disney stock price moves in a 10 per cent band up or down.The collar and the choice between cash and stock are real victories for Fox shareholders beyond just the higher headline price. As far as paying cash, Disney’s A credit rating gives it significant slack for borrowing more should it need to keep raising its bid. Comcast’s ability to ante up is more constrained. Its supervoting shares are down 20 per cent so far this year. Its underpowered ordinary shares are even less appealing. Unlike Disney then, it cannot offer stock to Fox shareholders, essentially forcing it to keep borrowing — it too has an A credit rating — if it wants to keep pace.Comcast is unlikely to bow out after a single round of bidding. But Disney looks determined. It wants Fox’s library to build out its own Netflix-killer streaming app. Disney shares rallied slightly on Thursday giving Bob Iger, the Disney CEO, a vote of confidence. It has $20bn of cash it has diverted from a buyback, and stock currency that has proved to be resilient.

72;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-06-20T17:15:25Z;Disney ups the ante in Fox fight with new $71.3bn offer;Sweetened cash-and-shares deal aimed at fending off rival bid from Comcast;Walt Disney sought to shut down the nascent bidding war for the majority of 21st Century Fox by upping its offer for Rupert Murdoch’s movie studio and cable channels by nearly $20bn to $71.3bn, significantly outstripping a rival offer from Comcast.The new Disney bid, which shifted its original all-stock deal to one with nearly $36bn in cash, came days after US cable giant Comcast formalised a $65bn proposal for Fox’s assets, the largest all-cash bid ever made in a takeover.Disney had signalled it was unwilling to let Fox slip through its hands, but investors were not prepared for the scale of its counter-offer, with Fox shares rising more than 7 per cent in midday New York trading to $47.89, a record high.Disney chief executive Robert Iger reached his original $52.4bn deal with Mr Murdoch in December. But Mr Iger said he was certain the new price was worth paying even though, once Fox’s nearly $14bn of outstanding debt is included, its overall value would be $85.1bn, making it one of the largest media takeovers on record.“After six months of integration planning we’re even more enthusiastic and confident in the strategic fit of the assets and the talent at Fox,” Mr Iger said.Although the high counter-offer appeared intended to scare off Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, the rival has privately indicated it was preparing to raise its own bid. Two people with direct knowledge of its strategy said Comcast has reached out to its bankers at Bank of America and Wells Fargo to find ways to raise more cash without losing its investment-grade credit rating.Moody’s has already warned it could downgrade Comcast. Analysts with the rating agency estimate that the US cable group would have debts of roughly $170bn if it is successful in its current bid for Fox’s assets, making it the world’s second-most indebted company.A person close to the Murdoch family said that Fox was expecting Comcast to return with a higher offer.“This isn’t the end of this bidding war,” the confidant said, adding the Murdoch family continued to believe Disney was a better buyer since it poses fewer regulatory hurdles than Comcast. A spokesperson for Comcast declined to comment.The takeover battle comes as traditional media are scrambling to consolidate in the face of competition from streaming players such as Netflix and Amazon, which have deep pockets, massive programming libraries and growing global subscription businesses.The Disney-Fox deal would combine the company behind Avatar, X-Men and The Simpsons with Mickey Mouse, Iron Man and Han Solo, creating an intellectual property powerhouse with international distribution operations such as Star of India. The new deal values the Fox assets at $38 a share, which Fox characterised as a “significant increase” over Disney’s prior offer. If Fox shareholders vote to approve the deal, they will own about 19 per cent of Disney. “We are extremely proud of the businesses we have built at 21st Century Fox, and firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace at a dynamic time for our industry,” said Mr Murdoch, who is executive chairman of Fox.Comcast had offered to pay a $1.5bn fee had Fox walked away from its deal with Disney. Fox on Wednesday said its new merger agreement still included provisions that would allow it to evaluate competing bids.Christine McCarthy, Disney’s chief financial officer, said the company would fund part of the $71.3bn takeover with debt, increasing its leverage. She warned that the higher debt levels meant Disney no longer expected to buy back shares worth as much as $20bn, which it announced last year as part of its original deal with Fox.If Disney succeeds it will be in pole position to take full control of Sky, the pan-European media group in which Fox owns a 39 per cent stake. Sky is the subject of a separate takeover battle, with Comcast having recently submitted an offer that valued it at more than £22bn. Fox’s rival offer for Sky values the group at about £18.5bn.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in London
73;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Concessions put UK closer to approving Fox-Sky deal;;Britain said it had moved closer to approving Twenty-First Century Fox’s takeover of Sky after it won new concessions from Rupert Murdoch’s media group and Walt Disney, as a multi-layered bidding war for the entertainment and news company intensifies.Disney has agreed with the UK government to maintain the Sky News brand for 15 years and has promised not sell the unit for at least that long. The US entertainment conglomerate has also formally agreed to preserve the editorial independence of Sky News, according to Matt Hancock, the UK’s secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport.If Disney succeeds in its takeover of Fox, it would add the FX cable network and Twenty First Century Fox movie studio to its stable of divisions, as well as give it control of Sky*. Mr Murdoch agreed to buy the remaining part of Sky in December 2016, before putting the most prized assets of Fox up for sale.The UK government’s support for the Fox-Sky deal comes as Disney is locked in a bidding war with Comcast to acquire Sky in Europe and Fox’s US and international assets.US cable group Comcast last week offered $65bn in cash to buy the Fox assets that Mr Murdoch agreed to sell to Disney for $52.4bn. That all-stock bid has climbed in value as Disney’s stock price has risen, and is now worth roughly $55bn. The company is now preparing a sweetened bid for Fox, which is expected to include a cash component.Separately, Comcast earlier this year made a bid for Sky that valued the European media company at £22bn — almost £4bn more than the Fox bid. Comcast’s proposed offer to buy Sky has already won the regulatory support of the UK government and EU competition regulators.Mr Hancock wrote that the revised conditions would help ensure that Sky News remained “financially viable” and “is able to take its editorial decisions independently, free from any potential outside influence.”In a statement, Fox said: “We now look forward to a final decision clearing our transaction.”There will be a 15-day period for public consultation on the deal, with the secretary of state expected to make a final decision sometime thereafter. Sky said the deal had received all other competition and regulatory approvals.“The UK approval process remains the only outstanding precondition prior to 21CF’s offer being put to Sky shareholders,” Sky added.*This post has been amended to note that Disney has said it is interested in Sky independent of its deal for Fox.
74;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;US leveraged bids: high-wire act;Companies are keen to assure investors that debt is fine because of ‘rapid de-levering’;An enduring cliché litters company PowerPoint decks: “rapidly de-lever”. In a low-interest rate world, corporations have borrowed massively to pay for blockbuster mergers and acquisitions. Investors have mostly been supportive. But the consolidation of US media and telecoms is pushing the boundaries of what a financial world nurtured by quantitative easing can tolerate.If Comcast succeeds in its pursuit of 21st Century Fox as AT&T did with Time Warner, the pair will have more than $300bn in debt. That invites comparisons with sovereign nations.The borrowers, like AT&T and Comcast, riposte that future combined cash flows juiced with synergies should allow them to reduce debt and assuage rating agencies in short order. They might. But shareholders need to comprehend that previously sleepy mobile phone and pay-TV businesses have become far riskier creatures, burdened with billions in annual interest expenses even as their industries are upended.Debt balances should not exclusively be examined in simple, nominal terms. Borrowings are supported by cash flows. In the cases of AT&T and Comcast, after their transaction, debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation will be approaching four times. That figure, while manageable, is just on the border between high yield and investment grade. AT&T was downgraded last week to two levels above “junk” status.Large companies usually get the benefit of the doubt from rating agencies. However, mobile phone price wars and cord-cutting have put the clamp on cash flow growth at AT&T. The sustainability of its dividend, whose yield is 6 per cent, has been a constant worry. A downgrade to junk status could be disastrous. Much of AT&T’s bond investor base would likely have to sell immediately. Investors are already skittish about overexposure to a coalescent media/telco sector. So expect acquirers to prioritise debt paydown over capital expenditure and other investments.

75;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-06-18T16:34:44Z;Disney plans to add cash to its bid for Fox;Entertainment group seeks to regain upper hand in M&A tussle with Comcast;Walt Disney is readying an increased offer for 21st Century Fox, a week after the US cable group Comcast gatecrashed its deal to buy Rupert Murdoch’s prized assets.Disney is planning to add a cash component to its previously agreed $52.4bn stock offer for Fox assets including the FX cable network, movie studios and its stake in Hulu, according to two people with knowledge of Disney’s plans.It is unclear whether Disney’s new bid will top Comcast’s $65bn all-cash offer, but it will argue that its proposal has a higher chance of winning antitrust approval, said people familiar with the matter. The value of the all-stock bid had already increased because Disney shares have climbed since it was announced. On Monday, it was worth more than $55bn, even though Disney shares fell as investors worried about how far it would go to counter Comcast’s offer.“Disney will respond,” Todd Juenger, an analyst at AllianceBernstein, said on Monday. “But we doubt that was Comcast’s best-and-final offer.”Disney and Fox declined to comment. Comcast had been itching to re-enter the bidding for Fox after it lost out to Disney in talks last year, but held off from bidding publicly until a US court determined the fate of AT&T’s $80bn purchase of HBO and CNN owner Time Warner. That ruling accepted AT&T’s argument that media consolidation can be good for consumers in a competitive landscape being shaken up by the likes of Netflix and Amazon.People close to Disney have argued that it would be a mistake to assume regulatory approval for AT&T foreshadows a similar outcome for Comcast.“These are two very different deals . . . there’s a lot of overlap between Comcast and what Fox is selling,” one of the people said. Fox last week said its board would consider the offer from Comcast. At the time it added that it had not made a decision on postponing or cancelling its shareholder vote on the Disney deal, which has been scheduled for July 10.If Fox’s board, which is meeting on Wednesday, says the offer from Comcast is superior to Disney’s, the latter will have five business days to match its rival. Comcast has promised to pay the $1.5bn fee Fox would owe to Disney if it walked away from its agreement. CNBC earlier reported that Disney was prepared to add cash to its offer.Mr Murdoch has faced shareholder pressure to consider the competing bid for Fox. Christopher Hohn, the activist investor behind hedge fund TCI, last month disclosed he had built a 7.4 per cent stake in the company.In a letter to the billionaire media mogul, Mr Hohn said he was “aware that the Murdoch family has a potential conflict of interest because of capital gains tax, which could lead them to preferring a lower priced Disney stock offer, to a higher priced offer from Comcast”.Shares of Fox were little changed at lunchtime in New York on Monday. Disney was down 1.5 per cent and Comcast was down 2.6 per cent.
76;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Week in Review, June 16;"Comcast crashes Disney party; WPP, Abraaj, and cyber attack also in the news";A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Comcast trumps Disney’s bid for Fox with $65bn offerComcast gatecrashed Walt Disney’s agreed deal to acquire Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox with a $65bn takeover bid for some of the main assets, write FT reporters.The formal approach from Comcast, which had previously declared its intention to beat a $52bn stock offer from Disney, could now spark a bidding war with Disney for the business.The offer was made at $35 a share in cash for Fox’s film and television studios, cable entertainment networks, its stake in internet streaming company Hulu, as well as international holdings such as Star India and a 39 per cent stake in the European broadcaster Sky.Fox News and national sports networks would be separated and remain under the Murdoch family’s control. Fox said its board would “carefully review and consider” the offer.The Philadelphia-based company led by Brian Roberts, chief executive, said the offer was a 19 per cent premium to Disney’s bid. Fox has $13.5bn of net debt on its books.Comcast’s $65bn bid for 21st Century Fox is the largest cash offer in history, but analysts said that Disney could still increase its bid with extra cash given a balance sheet with lower debt that its rival.Both sides want to create a global content and ­distribution company in order to better compete with new internet-based rivals such as Netflix, Amazon and Google.A federal judge this week also rejected an attempt by US antitrust authorities to block AT&T’s purchase of media group Time Warner.WPP vows to boost code of conduct after Sorrell probeIt has been a dramatic week for WPP and Martin Sorrell, the advertising conglomerate’s talismanic former chief executive, writes Madison Marriage in London.After 33 years at the helm of the FTSE 100 advertising group, the 73-year-old had found himself being investigated over whether he used company funds to pay a prostitute in London’s upmarket Mayfair district.The full extent of the allegations — which Sir Martin has strenuously denied — were revealed by the FT on Monday following weeks of speculation among shareholders and staff about why WPP opened an investigation into his “personal conduct” and use of company money in March.Sir Martin resigned as chief executive on April 14, several weeks after the WPP probe — led by US law firm WilmerHale — began.The FT additionally disclosed that Sir Martin’s alleged mistreatment of staff was also an issue, with several current and former WPP employees alleging he was verbally abusive towards them. Sir Martin has accepted he can be difficult at times, especially in cases of poor performance, but denied he mistreated or bullied staff.The WPP investigation concluded there was no proof of misuse of company funds and the amounts of money in question were “wholly immaterial”. The company has this week vowed to improve its code of conduct and reporting channels to ensure staff feel “safe and supported” at work.The revelations came two days before WPP’s annual shareholder meeting, at which Sir Martin was absent.Cyber attack exposes 6m Dixons credit card recordsDixons Carphone disclosed it had been hit by one of the UK’s biggest data hacks, saying that nearly 6m credit card records were exposed in a cyber attack.The seller of white goods, electronics and mobile phones said that in addition to the credit card records, hackers had gained access to personal data from more than 1m customers.The group said the hack began last July but was discovered only in the past week. Managers were unaware of the breach when they issued an unscheduled trading update on May 29.Cyber experts said the hack could be the largest yet against a British company and it raised long-held concerns about the level of care taken by executives in storing sensitive customer data.The National Cyber Security Centre — part of GCHQ, Britain’s intelligence and security service — is investigating the breach, alongside the National Crime Agency and the Information Commissioner’s Office.The Financial Conduct Authority is also examining the attack.It is the first major breach to be disclosed since the UK’s new data protection laws came into force last month.Dixons said it had “no evidence that this information has left our systems or has resulted in any fraud at this stage”. About 5.8m of the cards affected had chip-and-pin protection but 105,000 non-EU cards were also compromised, Dixons said.Chip-and-pin cards liaise with payments terminals to create a unique transaction code meaning less information is stored by retailers.Abraaj files for liquidation after ‘pain and turbulence’Abraaj filed for provisional liquidation in the Cayman Islands this week, setting in motion a court-driven restructuring process ending founder Arif Naqvi’s 15-year stewardship of the private equity group, writes Simeon Kerr in Dubai.Mr Naqvi, who built a modest Dubai-based company into one of the leading emerging markets investors, has been roiled by claims that his group mishandled investor money at its $1bn healthcare fund.Cash shortages and debt defaults pushed the group to the brink, forcing Abraaj to seek court protection against winding up claims because of defaults to two unsecured creditors: a Kuwaiti pension fund and a US fund holding a loan related to a shareholder.“The recent events have caused Abraaj employees and our stakeholders undeniable pain and turbulence for which I apologise unreservedly,” Mr Naqvi wrote in a letter to staff and associates on Thursday, saying he was unaware of intentional wrongdoing.He said gaps in internal governance and operating procedures had put Abraaj into “very challenging circumstances,” damaging the group’s value and “undermining the business”.Abraaj will use the Cayman courts to push through a restructuring proposal, backed by secured creditors, to sell off assets to repay its $1bn debt pile.Cerberus Capital Management, the US distressed investment specialist, is waiting in the wings with a $125m bid for Abraaj’s asset-management arm, and $50m in working capital to sustain the business.Once stabilised, Abraaj would hope to sell stakes in its own funds, as well as other assets, such as its stake in a Karachi utility group.However, advisers fear that investors could still vote Abraaj out as manager of the funds that Cerberus — or any another suitor — hopes to take over.Abraaj has already released investors of their $3bn in commitments to a $6bn emerging markets fund and placed its $1bn healthcare under an interim manager.Dutch payment group’s shares soar after listingAdyen, the Dutch payments group, attracted a flood of investor interest when it listed on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam on Wednesday, writes Aliya Ram in London.Shares soared more than 90 per cent on the day and the start-up finished the week with a market value of €12.5bn, bigger than established financial institutions such as Commerzbank and Mediobanca.Founded 12 years ago, Adyen acts as a middleman between merchants and other payment companies, negotiating deals with the likes of Visa and Mastercard in the US and UK, Cartes Bancaires in France, Oxxo in Mexico and Alipay and UnionPay in China.The company has become a favourite with global Silicon Valley businesses such as Uber and Airbnb and has grown rapidly as companies seek an easier way to facilitate payment by customers who have signed up to disparate payment providers.But the investor response to Adyen’s debut also marks a wider enthusiasm for European start-ups, which have increasingly turned to public markets as the sector has matured.European investors had often found it hard to get large stock allocations in US-listed IPOs, leaving them on the sidelines of that market, said Lise Buyer, an IPO adviser who worked on Google’s 2004 stock market listing.Adyen’s debut comes ahead of expected listings from online luxury fashion marketplace Farfetch and Funding Circle, the peer-to-peer lender, according to people familiar with the company’s plans.
77;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Comcast says it wins unconditional EU approval for Sky bid;;Comcast said Friday it has won approval from EU antitrust regulators for its proposed £12.50-a-share takeover of Sky, without any conditions, as the US cable operator and owner of NBC challenges Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox takeover attempt.The decision comes on the heels of the UK government’s clearance of the competing Sky bids.Comcast chief executive and chairman Briand Roberts said in a statement:“Comcast welcomes today’s decision by the European Commission to clear the Acquisition. We are excited by the opportunities that a combination of Sky and Comcast will bring. As we have said from the outset, we will invest to grow and enhance Sky’s business and be a strong steward of its valuable brand. Sky is a great British business — with us, that’s the way it will always be.We now look forward to posting our offer document to give Sky shareholders the opportunity to accept our superior cash offer.”Earlier this week, Comcast launched another major takeover proposal, offering $65bn for some of the marquee assets of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and going head-to-head with Walt Disney, which had launched its own bid.Comcast shares are up 0.25 per cent to $33.90 in morning trading in New York.
78;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-06-14T18:20:33Z;Comcast/Fox: cat and Mouse game;Mr Murdoch has two very different offers on the table;Does Rupert Murdoch really want out of Hollywood? When he agreed to sell much of 21st Century Fox to Disney in a complex deal six months ago it was not quite a swansong. Disney was paying $52bn in shares so the Murdochs would have owned about 5 per cent of the Mouse. That gave the family a chance to ride the ups or downs of the combined animal. On Tuesday night, however, Comcast boss Brian Roberts presented a clean break. He offered to buy the same Fox assets — including Fox television and movie studio and the X-Men franchises — all in cash.In reality, this is a second chance for Mr Murdoch to get out. He rejected a cash bid from Comcast last year, worried about regulators killing a vertical transaction where Fox’s content would be paired with a pay-TV company with nearly 30m subscribers.Literally 24 hours after a federal judge cleared the vertical AT&T-Time Warner merger, Comcast pounced. The Philadelphia company is now offering $35 per share for a total equity value of $65bn. As importantly, it has agreed to the same package of antitrust remedies, including divestitures, and a $2.5bn termination fee if the deal is blocked. On top of all that, Comcast will pay Disney another termination fee of $1.5bn for breaking up its deal with Fox.All this adds up to a valuation of the Fox assets exceeding 17 times 2018 ebitda before cost savings. For reference, Comcast trades at just seven times and AT&T will acquire Time Warner at about 10 times. That underscores the type of bidding war Mr Murdoch has unleashed.Disney is likely to raise its bid, perhaps with some cash as a sweetener. But the fundamental dilemma for Mr Murdoch remains. Taking Disney’s equity allows him to stay invested in the entertainment business. A stock consideration also has tax advantages for recipients.It is not Mr Murdoch’s decision alone. The family has supervoting shares. But the Fox shareholder vote will have all investors voting as a single class. The Roberts’ control of Comcast, meanwhile, means that family has less need to build consensus. Comcast shares are down 20 per cent this year. But it remains undaunted in its Fox hunt. One Fox investor, TCI Fund Management, has urged Mr Murdoch to strongly consider the all-cash takeover. Being a mogul is not easy. Neither is knowing when to give it up.

79;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-06-13T20:12:49Z;Comcast gatecrashes Disney deal with 21st Century Fox offer;All-cash $65bn offer raises prospect of bidding war between US media groups;Comcast has launched a $65bn takeover bid for some of the marquee assets of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, gatecrashing the media billionaire’s agreed deal with Walt Disney and setting the stage for a bidding war.The long-awaited proposal by Comcast, which had previously declared its intention to top a $52bn stock offer from Disney, came a day after a federal judge rejected an attempt by US antitrust authorities to block AT&T’s purchase of media group Time Warner.Comcast said it would pay Fox shareholders $35 a share in cash for its film and television studios, cable entertainment networks, its stake in internet streaming company Hulu, as well as international holdings such as Star India and a 39 per cent stake in pan-European broadcaster Sky.The Philadelphia-based company led by Brian Roberts, chief executive, said the offer amounted to a 19 per cent premium to the current value of Disney’s bid. The $65bn offer is the largest all-cash bid ever made, according to data provider Dealogic. Fox has $13.5bn of net debt on its books.Media companies and telecommunications providers are racing to consolidate as they try to fend off competition from technology groups such as Netflix, Amazon and Google in the battle for market share.“This is what we do well,” Mr Roberts told reporters in a call, citing how his dealmaking prowess had taken the family company from being a small regional cable group to a dominant provider of cable television access, broadband internet and content producer with its NBCUniversal news, TV channel and movie studio arm.In an open letter addressed to Mr Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James, Mr Roberts said: “After our meetings last year, we came away convinced that the 21st Century businesses to be sold are highly complementary to ours, and that our company would be the right strategic home for them.”Fox said its board would “carefully review and consider” the offer from Comcast in consultation with its advisers and that it had not yet made a decision to postpone or cancel the July 10 meeting for a shareholder vote on the Disney deal.Disney has five days to match Comcast’s offer, according to people with knowledge of the deal conditions. Analysts and investors fully expect it to return with a higher offer. As part of the initial deal with Fox, Disney chief executive Bob Iger — who had been linked to aspirations for a presidential run — announced he would forgo plans to leave the company and would stay until 2021 to see through the deal.Each of the offers on the table allows Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch to form a new company comprised of Fox’s broadcast network as well as its news, sports and business cable channels.The Murdoch family had spurned a takeover offer from Comcast in favour of a less valuable all-stock bid by Disney last December, calculating that a deal with the owner of Pixar and Marvel Studios would face less regulatory risk and create a limited tax liability for Fox shareholders.In an effort to address Mr Murdoch’s concerns, Comcast said it was willing to match the regulatory commitments that Disney made to Mr Murdoch’s company, including the payment of a $2.5bn termination fee payable to Fox should a deal be blocked by regulators. It has also offered to pay the $1.5bn fee that Fox would owe Disney should it walk away.Comcast said it was “highly confident” in its ability to finance the transaction, adding that it had lined up Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo to help fund its bid. The Wall Street banks were not, however, committed to the transaction and could back out if markets turn.Comcast also said it would continue to pursue, in parallel, a deal to acquire the 61 per cent of Sky that is not owned by Fox.Christopher Hohn, the activist investor behind hedge fund TCI, revealed last month that he had built a 7.4 per cent stake in Fox and said it was imperative for the media company to sell to the highest bidder.Mr Hohn wrote in a letter to Fox directors in May that he was “aware that the Murdoch family has a potential conflict of interest because of capital gains tax, which could lead them to preferring a lower priced Disney stock offer, to a higher priced offer from Comcast”.Shares of Fox, which has a market value of $81bn, slipped 0.3 per cent to $43.54 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Comcast shares declined 0.4 per cent to $32.20, weighing slightly on its $148bn market capitalisation. Walt Disney stock was little changed at $106.05, valuing the company at $158bn.
80;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

82;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;AT&T-Time Warner ruling opens door for more media consolidation;DoJ’s loss will buoy ambitions of dealmakers seeking to stitch businesses together;Almost 140 people crammed into Richard Leon’s courtroom on Tuesday to hear his verdict on AT&T’s $80bn takeover of Time Warner. Wearing black robes and a red-and-white striped bow-tie, the judge gave the deal his blessing and excoriated the government’s evidence. As his audience of mostly lawyers and journalists rushed out with the news, media stocks shot up.Judge Leon’s decision capped a nearly two-year journey for the two companies, as well as six intense weeks in a Washington courthouse as the Department of Justice tried to show that the deal would harm competition. The government’s loss will buoy the ambitions of dealmakers seeking to stitch large media businesses together.Attention has already turned to Comcast, which unveiled a formal $65bn cash bid for most of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox on Wednesday. A bidding war between the Philadelphia-based group and its rival Walt Disney is likely to ensue for the Rupert Murdoch-controlled entertainment business.“This decision will have wide-reaching ramifications across the telecommunications, media and tech industry for decades to come,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.The reshaping of the entertainment industry is likely to accelerate in the wake of Tuesday’s ruling, which did not force any divestments from AT&T or Time Warner. The media sector is in the midst of sweeping consolidation with the old guard — cable channel operators and TV distributors — racing to combine as new entrants as Netflix and Amazon take market share. The decision could affect strategy at media groups and former corporate stablemates CBS and Viacom, which this year held talks on remerging. Separately, it could coax a telecoms company such as Verizon or a cable distributor like Charter to bid for media assets. The entertainment industry has long been rife with dealmaking, with buyers trading Hollywood studios and other content producers seeking scale through acquisitions.Judge Leon’s 172-page opinion on the first big vertical merger litigation in decades detailed the government’s failure to build a convincing case. He said the justice department had not provided adequate evidence that mergers between content providers and distributors harmed competition, a finding that will reassure the likes of Comcast.“It’s a blow to the government in pursuing any other media mergers of this kind,” said George Hay, an antitrust professor at Cornell Law School, who said it would make the justice department less likely to challenge a Comcast takeover of Fox. “If they did, Comcast would know exactly what to do to win the case at trial.”The decision is a setback for Makan Delrahim, the justice department’s antitrust chief, who has argued vociferously that the government should seek structural solutions to competition concerns, for example divestments or outright blocking of deals. He has dismissed behavioural solutions, such as the arbitration mechanism AT&T pledged to handle pricing disputes, as ineffective.The higher-risk approach had failed to pay off in the case of AT&T, said Amy Ray, an antitrust partner at Cadwalader. “The DoJ may have to rethink whether its stance to pursue structural remedies first or only is the appropriate strategy in future merger reviews,” she said.The government faced an uphill battle in the case as vertical mergers, which combine companies with distinct roles in the supply chain for the same product, have long been viewed as pro-competitive when compared with horizontal mergers, in which companies eliminate direct competitors. Judge Leon’s ruling will serve as yet more evidence of the difficulty the government faces in challenging vertical deals.“The DoJ will have a harder time making a credible threat that it can take a vertical merger to trial and block it,” said Eric Mahr, a partner at Freshfields who previously served as the director of litigation for the DoJ’s antitrust division. “It will affect the negotiating dynamics.”Politics has swirled around the case since its announcement in 2016. On the campaign trail, then-candidate Donald Trump pledged to stop the deal going ahead, and after the justice department sued to block in November, AT&T attempted to argue that the decision was politically motivated. After the trial ended, it emerged that AT&T had paid Michael Cohen, Mr Trump’s personal lawyer, for advice on the deal in 2017.Judge Leon kept the politics out of his courtroom, instead deciding to rule on the merits of the justice department’s evidence, which he found severely lacking. In court on Tuesday he said the government’s economic modelling was “founded on improper assumptions”. He also dismissed as “of little to no value” the evidence it provided to show prices would increase because of the combined company’s enhanced leverage over rivals.He rejected the government’s argument that AT&T and Comcast’s dominance of the telecommunications and entertainment market would lead them to squeeze out new, online-only networks. And he said of the government’s suggestion that AT&T-Time Warner would prevent other networks from using HBO as a promotional tool: “At the risk of stating the obvious, this is a gossamer-thin claim.”In his written opinion, Judge Leon noted the declining customer numbers of traditional networks and indicated he was persuaded by AT&T and Time Warner’s argument that they were seeking the deal to develop new products and better respond to the competitive threat from technology companies. “This is not a case containing direct, probative evidence of anti-competitive intent on the part of high-level executives within the merging company,” he wrote.His ruling required no remedies from the companies, although it did incorporate their commitment to arbitrate price disputes, the same mechanism he approved in 2011 when Comcast bought NBC Universal.The names of more than a dozen potential AT&T competitors dot the opinion, underlining the significant shifts under way in the media industry. The US judge name-checked investments by companies such as Apple and Netflix as well as the advent of new TV services, including Sony’s PlayStation Vue, Google’s YouTube TV and Hulu Live. He even quoted Bob Dylan: “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.”Logan Breed, a partner with law firm Hogan Lovells, said that point should not go unnoticed by dealmakers. He noted that the decision focused on how competition in the media industry had been in flux for some time. “That line of reasoning could have a much broader application,” Mr Breed said.The verdict was striking in how firmly Judge Leon found in favour of the two companies, whose courtroom defence was led by Daniel Petrocelli. However, in a courthouse lift after the hearing, Paul Cappuccio, Time Warner’s general counsel, raised with Mr Petrocelli one omission from Judge Leon’s comments. “He didn’t say how handsome you were,” he joked.
83;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:19:13+0000;UK government clears rival Sky bids;Culture secretary Matt Hancock says 21st Century Fox would need to divest Sky News;The UK government has cleared two bids for Sky from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and Comcast, setting up a bidding war for the pan-European media company.Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, waved the Comcast bid through, saying there were no broadcasting standards or public interest grounds on which to intervene. On the Fox deal, he agreed that a commitment by Fox to sell Sky News to Walt Disney was sufficient to alleviate concerns about UK media plurality.Discussions will now begin between officials at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and Fox, Sky and Disney “to finalise the details with a view to agreeing an acceptable form of the remedy”, Mr Hancock told parliament.Fox’s bid of £10.75 a share values Sky — which was founded by Mr Murdoch — at about £18.5bn. Its offer has been scrutinised by two regulators, first Ofcom, the UK media watchdog, then the Competition and Markets Authority, for 16 months.Comcast made a competing offer for Sky this year at £12.50 a share, which valued the company at about £22bn.“I agree with the CMA that divesting Sky News to Disney . . . or to an alternative suitable buyer, with an agreement to ensure it is funded for at least 10 years, is likely to be the most proportionate and effective remedy for the public interest concerns that have been identified,” Mr Hancock told parliament.He added that any sale had to ensure that Sky remained financially viable over the long term, would continue to operate as a UK-based news provider and was able to maintain its editorial independence.The sale of Sky News to Disney was first proposed by Fox several months ago to allay regulatory concerns about its bid. “We note that the secretary of state agrees with this solution,” the company said.Disney said it was “ready to engage in any discussions requested by the secretary of state”.The Fox bid for Sky has attracted significant political opposition, with a cross-party group of MPs that includes Ed Miliband and Ken Clarke pushing to have the deal blocked.Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, hit out at the proposed sale of Sky News to Disney, pointing to possible repercussions from Fox’s own planned sale of its entertainment assets. Disney is attempting to buy those businesses, including Fox’s Hollywood movie studio and its 39 per cent stake in Sky, in a $66bn deal, including debt.“Were the Fox-Disney deal to fail it could leave Sky News isolated from Sky and owned by a foreign company with few news interests in the UK. It’s hard to see how that would be in the public interest,” Mr Watson said.With Disney hoping eventually to acquire Sky via its purchase of the Fox assets, Comcast is fighting Disney on two fronts. Comcast, the US’s largest cable operator and the owner of NBCUniversal, recently said it was working on a rival proposal for the Fox assets that would be pitched at a “superior” price to the Disney offer.The takeover battle is raging amid significant upheaval in the media landscape. The rise of companies such as Netflix and Amazon has fuelled sweeping changes in consumption patterns, which has put pressure on established media groups to consolidate in order to stay relevant and prosper.
84;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Disney/Fox/Comcast: taking stock;Rupert Murdoch knew what he was doing;It has already been a long week for Walt Disney. Between the racist antics of sometime TV star Roseanne Barr and the box office disappointment of Solo, its latest Star Wars instalment, good news has been in short supply. Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is about to decide whether it wants to ride such high and lows at the House of Mouse. On Wednesday, Fox announced it would hold a shareholder vote on the proposed combination with Disney on July 10.Lurking in the background is an expected but not-yet-disclosed bid for Fox’s assets from Comcast — whose entreaties Mr Murdoch has already rejected.The ostensibly competing offers are tricky to compare. Comcast has lined up as much as $60bn in financing to support its all-cash bid for Fox’s entertainment assets. Disney’s all-stock offer is currently worth just over $50bn. The gap is misleading because Comcast is offering to cash out Fox shareholders by paying them upfront for transaction synergies.With Disney, Fox shareholders get to share in any future prosperity. Yet this does not represent pure upside. The Mouse reported a good first quarter but its shares are already down a tenth in 2018 over worries about the viability of legacy media. Shares in rival Netflix are up 74 per cent this year. The streaming service’s market value of $150bn has zoomed past Disney’s even as its forecast 2018 revenue is just a quarter that of the Magic Kingdom.Activist investor Christopher Hohn has wondered aloud whether Mr Murdoch’s choice of partner will come down to the significant personal capital gains tax his family would owe if he chose the Comcast cash bid. The Disney deal is tax-free to shareholders. Perhaps, but Comcast must still deliver a knockout price. Disney is the best positioned legacy media company. Recent mis-steps aside, it has been pivoting shrewdly. Mr Murdoch knew that when he preferred its bid the first time round and when he decided that what he wanted was its stock.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

85;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Fox sets shareholder vote on Disney deal for July 10;;Shareholders of 21st Century Fox will vote on the $66bn sale of the company’s assets to Walt Disney on July 10, the media and entertainment group said on Wednesday.The timing of the shareholder vote gives Comcast, which last week publicly confirmed it was in the “advanced stages of preparing” a bid for Fox assets, the opportunity to evaluate a US judge’s ruling on AT&T’s proposed $85.4bn takeover of Time Warner.Comcast has said it was considering an all-cash offer for Fox’s film and television production studios, a suite of its cable channels including FX, and its stake in streaming TV provider Hulu. But it had to submit a formal bid. Sources with knowledge of the US cable provider’s plans said the group first wanted to review the AT&T-Time Warner decision.The Trump administration has sought to block that deal on antitrust grounds and has shown an unwillingness to allow large content providers to join distributors. The ruling in that case is expected by June 12.Fox said it was aware that Comcast was preparing a bid for the company. Its merger agreement with Disney includes so-called no-shop provisions, which would prevent Fox from soliciting a proposal from another bidder. However, the company could consider a bid from a third-party if it received a formal offer.The Rupert Murdoch-led group said it could delay or adjourn the July 10 special shareholder meeting should it be required to send additional disclosures to its investors.“21CF’s board of directors recommends that stockholders vote in favour of the proposal to adopt the Disney merger agreement and the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting,” Fox said in a statement.
86;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-05-24T12:16:33Z;Comcast and Disney fight it out for 21st Century Fox assets;Media rivals raise stakes in battle to buy range of assets at Rupert Murdoch’s company;Some old scores are about to be settled in a long-simmering rivalry between the world’s two largest media companies in a battle for Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.Walt Disney has agreed an all-share deal worth $52bn — or $66bn including debt — for Fox’s entertainment assets, including its movie studio, cable channels and stake in Sky. But Comcast, the US cable operator that also owns NBCUniversal, is trying to gatecrash the transaction, and confirmed this week that it was working on a “superior all-cash offer” for the Fox assets. This came after it made a formal bid for Sky last month that valued the European broadcaster at £22bn.The fight for Fox is not the first time that Comcast and Disney have crossed swords. In 2004, Comcast made a $54bn unsolicited offer for Disney, with Brian Roberts, the company’s chief executive, saying a purchase would “restore the Disney brand” following a fallow few years. Steve Burke, then Comcast’s chief operating officer and now the chief executive of NBCUniversal, said at the time that the deal would improve the performance of Disney’s ABC television network, describing the channel as “weak”. The comments did not exactly endear Comcast to Disney management, which rejected the group’s offer, preferring to remain independent. Comcast subsequently missed out on a company that rocketed in value, with Disney’s shares rising sharply in the decade that followed under the leadership of chief executive Bob Iger. Disney’s growth was fuelled by winning bets on content, such as the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm, which have given it a market capitalisation today that is close to $100bn above the value of Comcast’s offer in 2004. Fourteen years on from that bid, relations between the two companies are cordial, if competitive: Comcast is one of Disney’s biggest distributors and a fellow shareholder in Hulu, the online streaming service. If any animus remains from 2004, neither side is showing it. Yet each company is fiercely determined to prevail in a battle that could hinge on which proposal offers the least regulatory resistance. Comcast is eyeing the outcome of the US Department of Justice’s attempts to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner. The trial is under way in Washington and a verdict is expected next month. If AT&T wins, as most analysts expect, that is likely to strengthen Comcast’s resolve that its bid for the Fox assets will also clear regulators.But supporters of the Disney deal say that even if AT&T prevails, there is no guarantee that regulators would not block a Comcast-Fox combination. Comcast is a cable company — Fox has no cable assets — but in NBCUniversal, it has a large content business that is similar in many ways to Fox. “AT&T-Time Warner is a vertical merger,” said one person briefed on deal discussions between Disney, Fox and Comcast. “But Comcast-Fox would be a vertical and a horizontal merger. There is much greater regulatory risk.”Comcast’s first all-cash offer for the Fox assets landed in November last year and was pitched at a premium to the Disney all-share offer. But it was rebuffed by Mr Murdoch and the Fox board because Comcast refused to offer a break-up fee. This week Comcast said it was working on a new bid that it suggested would address Fox’s concerns about the structure of its previous offer. “The structure and terms of any offer by Comcast . . . and the regulatory risk provisions and the related termination fee, would be at least as favourable to Fox shareholders as the Disney offer,” the company said.Supporters of the Disney deal said Comcast would have to offer a more generous break-up free than the $2.5bn it has proposed because of the additional regulatory risk. But advocates of a Comcast-Fox deal denied a potential combination would attract more regulatory risk than a Disney-Fox merger. They pointed to the horizontal overlap between businesses owned by Disney and Fox: both companies own movie studios, for example, but Disney has the most market share in the US and would effectively be combining with the third largest studio. Disney has a similarly strong position in sport via its ownership of network ESPN.However, analysts said there was more regulatory risk in a Comcast-Fox combination which would affect the likelihood of a drawn-out bidding war. “Given the regulatory hurdles involved with a Comcast bid (even if AT&T-Time Warner is approved) we believe Fox would likely still favour a Disney bid over Comcast,” wrote MoffettNathanson analysts. This would “limit how much Disney would need to further increase its bid in any potential bidding war”.Fox continues to support the Disney deal. “We are committed to our agreement with Disney and are working through the conditions to bring it to a closing,” said Lachlan Murdoch, Fox’s executive chairman, on the company’s recent earnings call. Still, the drum beats for a Comcast-Fox combination are getting louder. Late on Wednesday evening, Christopher Hohn, the activist investor behind the TCI fund, sent a letter to the Fox board urging it to engage with Comcast when the cable group makes a formal offer. TCI has built a stake of 7.4 per cent in Fox in recent weeks. The media company should “ immediately engage” when Comcast makes a formal offer, he wrote, adding that the regulatory risk of both the Disney and Comcast offers was “equal and low”.“It is imperative that the 21st Century Fox board runs a fair auction . . . and sells it to the highest bidder,” he added.With the world’s two largest media companies vying for their hand, the Murdochs and other Fox shareholders know they are sitting pretty.

In a letter to Mr Murdoch, Sir Christopher called on Mr Murdoch to welcome any proposal from Comcast.Comcast on Wednesday confirmed that it was exploring an all-cash bid for the Fox assets, adding that any offer would be at a premium to a rival all-stock deal offer from Walt Disney. Disney has agreed a deal with Fox that values the entertainment assets at $66bn, including debt.“We are aware that the Murdoch family has a potential conflict of interest because of capital gains tax, which could lead them to preferring a lower priced Disney stock offer, to a higher priced offer from Comcast,” the letter said.“However, the personal tax position of the Murdoch family must be an irrelevant consideration for the board, in order for the board to comply with their fiduciary duties.”Sir Christopher added in the letter that he viewed the regulatory risk in both offers “to be equal and low”. “It is imperative that the 21st Century Fox board runs a fair auction . . . and sells it to the highest bidder,” he said.Fox would owe Disney $1.5bn if it walked away from the deal in return for a higher offer from Comcast, according to a filing with US securities regulators. The merger agreement includes so-called no-shop provisions, which would prevent Fox from soliciting a proposal from another suitor. However, Fox can consider a bid from a third-party if it has received a formal offer.Sir Christopher, whose wealth was estimated at $3bn by Forbes magazine, is among London’s best known activist investors. He established TCI in 2003 and has taken noteworthy stakes in several leading companies. In 2016, TCI helped successfully advocate for a higher offer from Anheuser-Busch InBev to clinch the beverage group’s £79bn takeover of SABMiller. More recently, Sir Christopher has clashed with Donald Brydon, the chairman of the London Stock Exchange Group.21st Century Fox declined to comment. Lachlan Murdoch, executive chairman of the company, told analysts on an earnings call earlier this year that Fox was “committed to our agreement with Disney” and that its directors were “aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.”The sale of the Fox film and television studios, flagship cable television networks like FX and its stakes in television streaming service Hulu, has been seen as highly consequential to the broader US media industry. Companies have raced to consolidate as the challenge from Netflix and Amazon intensifies.The threat of subscriber losses at the major cable companies — so-called cord cutting — has helped fuel a number of combinations. Discovery earlier this year completed its $14.6bn takeover Scripps Networks, which owns the Food Network and HGTV home improvement channels. The Redstone family, which holds controlling interests in both broadcast network CBS and cable channel operator Viacom, had also pursued a combination of the two media groups.A bid from Comcast is likely to hinge on the outcome of another media takeover: AT&T’s $85.4bn deal for HBO-owner Time Warner, according to several people following the Fox sale. The US government has sought to block the AT&T transaction on antitrust grounds. A judge is expected to rule by June 12, which could sway Comcast’s decision to launch a formal offer for Fox.
88;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-05-23T16:58:03Z;Comcast in ‘advanced stages of preparing’ Fox bid;Bid by cable group sets up showdown between US media rivals over Murdoch empire;Comcast set the stage for a bidding war against its media rival Walt Disney on Wednesday, announcing it was in “advanced stages of preparing” a bid to gatecrash a deal for large parts of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.The US cable and entertainment provider said it was considering an all-cash offer for all of Fox’s assets except its news channel and main sports and business networks — or the parts of Fox that Disney has already agreed to acquire for $66bn.“Any offer for Fox would be all-cash and at a premium to the value of the current all-share offer from Disney,” Comcast said in a statement. Other terms, including those designed to address risks that regulators might block a deal, such as termination fees, would be “at least as favourable to Fox shareholders as the Disney offer”, it added.Comcast’s comments mark the first time it has publicly acknowledged reports that it would seek to disrupt the deal between its two rivals, which was unveiled with much fanfare by Mr Murdoch and Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, in December.Disney was chosen as a suitor over Comcast by Mr Murdoch even though Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, offered better terms to Fox at the time, in part because of regulatory concerns. Comcast’s ownership of NBC Universal would be likely to raise competition problems because of its dominant position in both media content and distribution.The showdown pits two of media’s most powerful executives, Mr Roberts and Mr Iger, in an increasingly personal fight over the assets built by a third, Mr Murdoch.It is understood the Murdochs want to sell to Disney. Comcast is going to need to appeal to a larger shareholder base and make a good offer publicly [to] force the board to review it“It is understood the Murdochs want to sell to Disney,” said Brett Harriss, an analyst and portfolio manager with Gabelli & Co. “Comcast is going to need to appeal to a larger shareholder base and make a good offer publicly [to] force the board to review it.”Mr Roberts has already launched a £22bn bid for Sky, the European pay-TV group which is 39 per cent owned by Fox, and which was set to be acquired by Disney should its deal with Fox go through. Comcast’s £12.50-a-share bid for Sky is superior to Fox’s previously agreed deal to buy Sky, which was inked at £10.75 a share.Both Comcast and Disney shares sold off in anticipation of a summer-long bidding war, with Comcast dropping as much as 2.2 per cent to near two-year lows at $31.80 and Disney falling nearly 2 per cent to $102.15. Fox shares rose as much as 1.6 per cent to $38.77 in early New York trading.The fight for 21st Century Fox has broader implications for the entire entertainment landscape as traditional media groups rush to consolidate in the face of “cord-cutting” that has seen viewers flee to challengers like Netflix and Amazon.The Redstone family has separately sought to combine broadcast network CBS with Viacom, which owns the MTV and Nickelodeon television stations. CBS’s board has sued the family and its investment vehicle National Amusements in an attempt to block that deal.The Trump administration has signalled it is unwilling to allow big content providers to join with distributors, having filed a lawsuit to block AT&T’s $85.4bn takeover of HBO-owner Time Warner. A ruling in that case is expected by June 12.If AT&T prevails, it could give Comcast the confidence it needs to pursue a deal for Fox. Comcast on Wednesday said it had made progress on sewing up the financing needed for a Fox takeover.Antitrust experts have warned that even an AT&T victory is no guarantee Comcast would succeed in clearing regulatory hurdles in a Fox acquisition.The deal Fox originally struck with Disney included the sales of its film and television production studios, a suite of its cable networks like FX, and its stake in streaming TV provider Hulu.
89;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-05-21T17:12:47Z;UK likely to clear way for Comcast to bid for Sky;Culture secretary Matt Hancock ‘minded’ not to refer £22bn offer to media regulator;The UK government has indicated it will not refer Comcast’s £22bn offer for Sky to the country’s media regulator, removing a hurdle in the US cable group’s race to acquire the pan-European media group.Comcast is hoping to trump a rival bid for Sky from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox with a £12.50 a share offer. The Fox proposal, worth £10.75 a share, values Sky at £18.5bn but has been stymied by two lengthy regulatory reviews — first by Ofcom and then most recently by the Competition and Markets Authority.The Fox side has been privately lobbying the UK government to subject the Comcast offer to equivalent regulatory treatment. But Matt Hancock, culture secretary, said in a statement on Monday that he was “minded” not to intervene “on the basis that the proposed merger does not raise concerns in relation to public interest considerations which would meet the threshold for intervention”.Mr Hancock will come to a final decision on the Comcast bid by Thursday. He is to decide by June 13 whether to clear or block Fox’s bid for Sky.In a letter to Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, the UK department of culture, media and sport said a Comcast-Sky combination would not have “a significantly larger presence in the UK news market” than that of Sky and Sky News and would have “no greater ability to influence the news agenda”.The Fox offer for Sky has raised regulatory concerns about Mr Murdoch’s influence in the UK media market. The mogul also controls News Corp, owner of UK newspapers such as The Times and The Sun.Opponents of the Comcast offer have lobbied the DCMS, saying that the owner of NBCUniversal owns a stake in BuzzFeed, the digital news site. But the DCMS said in its letter on Monday that Comcast has a “non-controlling investment” in the company and that this was not a “concern for wider UK media plurality”.Fox has offered remedies to assuage fears about media plurality, including an offer to sell Sky News to Walt Disney.Disney has separately agreed to acquire Fox’s entertainment assets, including its 39 per cent holding in Sky. Comcast is arranging financing for a hostile bid for the assets with the aim of knocking out the Fox offer.
90;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-05-10T04:00:53Z;Comcast to include $2.5bn break fee in any new Fox approach;Latest twist in cable group’s battle with Disney after Murdoch rejected initial offer;Comcast will include a $2.5bn break fee in any new offer for the entertainment assets of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox after an earlier proposal was rejected by the mogul, according to people briefed on the deal.The break fee would be payable in the event that any Comcast-Fox deal ran into regulatory trouble. The US cable group, which also owns NBCUniversal, did not include a break fee in its first approach to Fox in November, when an offer that valued Fox’s entertainment assets at about $60bn was rebuffed.The Fox board instead recommended an all-stock offer from Walt Disney that valued the Fox assets, including its movie studio, cable channels and 39 per cent stake in European pay-TV group Sky, at $52bn, or $66bn including debt. However, Comcast will pitch its new offer at a significant premium and is in talks with US banks to secure up to $60bn in financing, according to people briefed on its plans.The inclusion of a break fee is the latest twist in a months-long battle that will reshape the global media landscape. Mr Murdoch’s decision to break up a company that took him decades to assemble has triggered a race by Comcast and Disney, which are keen to strengthen their hands against deep-pocketed streaming players such as Netflix and Amazon.The inclusion of a break fee would be an important component of a new Comcast bid. A recent Fox regulatory filing revealed it walked away from Comcast’s November approach because the cable group did not offer to include such a fee.The filing said that “party B” — widely known to be Comcast — “was unwilling to agree to an acceptable allocation of regulatory risk” associated with the purchase of the Fox assets. The subject of a break fee was raised multiple times in discussions between the two sides, according to the filing, but Comcast never included one in its offer. Disney included a $2.5bn break fee in its own offer, which was ultimately recommended by the Fox board.Comcast is now ready to make a comeback offer but people briefed on its plans cautioned that a new bid was not guaranteed. The final decision on whether it makes a new move is likely to hinge on the approval by a US judge of AT&T’s $85bn takeover of Time Warner, which is being challenged in court by the US Department of Justice.Several antitrust experts in Washington following the AT&T case believe the US telecoms group has a good chance of getting its deal approved, as so-called vertical mergers between two businesses operating in different sectors are rarely challenged.However, Comcast has more overlapping business units with Fox — both companies own cable channels and a movie studio — which means regulators are likely to scrutinise a Comcast-Fox combination regardless of whether AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner is cleared.Comcast has separately made a formal bid for Sky, which values the company at about £22bn — a premium to a rival offer from Fox.
91;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;M&A debt: Extend and pretend;Credit investors are bullish but heed the signs shareholders are sending;To the dismay of its shareholders, Comcast’s M&A adventures continue. After earlier this year making for a £22bn play for Sky that remains unresolved, it is preparing  to bid for all of the 21st Century Fox entertainment assets that Disney has an existing deal to purchase for $52bn. Since the beginning of the year, Comcast shares are down nearly a quarter. Some of the decline follows the slowdown in its core business of cable television — but worries about pricey bids hurt too.Banks, however, are far more enthusiastic. They are prepared to commit funding of close to $100bn for these all-cash deals, part of a broader deal-driven debt wave that will generate massive fees for lenders, and high-yielding assets for the portfolios of credit investors down the line. But this entire ecosystem, obsessed with their short-term objectives, ignores the painful reckoning that awaits.It is no surprise that overall leverage has exploded. Debt held by non-financials in the US as a proportion of economic output is at 5.5 per cent, a record high. The nature of that debt has evolved as well in recent years. The leveraged loan market— borrowings led by banks that have floating interest rates tied to Libor — is almost as big as the junk bond market with annual issuance exceeding $1tn.Mega deals like Sprint/T-Mobile, Takeda/Shire, and Comcast’s pending conquests have made M&A a crucial driver of the loan market. With the rosy global economy generating good earnings for companies, banks and investors are comfortable not only underwriting and buying debt but doing so with minimal covenants as protection. More advanced credit metrics such as interest expense coverage show a less extreme picture. But the ultimate problem is that companies will need to either refinance this debt, likely at higher rates, or pay down a big chunk before a recession hits. Debt investors think this is all do-able but they should pay attention to the signals that shareholders are sending.

Under the terms Mr Murdoch agreed with his Disney counterpart Bob Iger, the company behind Mickey Mouse and Captain America will also assume Fox’s $13.7bn of net debt.A wave of media deals have been struck in recent years as traditional players are facing growing competition from a new generation of digital players with deep pockets, ranging from Netflix to Amazon and Apple.US president Donald Trump has threatened to break up Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, the media group with assets that include Universal Studios and the NBC broadcast network, arguing it has too much power over US TV viewers. It is unclear how Mr Trump would be able to enforce the break-up of NBCUniversal from Comcast, although it is technically possible.AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner is being challenged on similar grounds but several antitrust experts have said that the likelihood is slim that a US judge will back the DoJ’s request to block the merger.A victory in court for AT&T would significantly boost Comcast’s chances of successfully acquiring Fox’s assets, which include movie studio and a portfolio of cable television channels but not Fox News, which will continue to be controlled by the Murdoch family.Comcast declined to comment on the news, which was first reported by Reuters.

Brian Roberts, chief executive, said his company was “hopeful” that the commitments would be “anticipatory of any issues that might arise”.But Lord Grade, who is also a former chief executive of Channel 4, told the Financial Times that the Comcast bid should be referred to Ofcom by Matt Hancock, the UK’s culture secretary. “There’s a case for the secretary of state to refer it to Ofcom in the same way that Sky was referred,” he said. “There should be equivalent treatment.”“I think there is a case for them to be looked at as the potential owner of an influential piece of British media,” he added. “Little is known in this country about Comcast.”The Comcast offer will be filed formally with European regulators shortly for a review that will take about a month. “We’re making good progress with our normal regulatory process in Europe since we announced our proposal in February,” Mr Roberts said this week. “And most importantly we want to be in a position to be able to offer Sky shareholders the chance to accept our superior cash offer.”The Fox bid for Sky has been scrutinised over whether a deal would give Mr Murdoch and his family too much influence in the UK media market, given that he already has a newspaper portfolio, including The Sun and The Times, through News Corp, which he also controls.Ofcom has also looked into the sexual harassment scandal at Mr Murdoch’s Fox News Channel. Although it found evidence of what it said was “extremely disturbing” behaviour, these concerns did not merit a referral to the secretary of state on broadcasting standards grounds.Comcast has been grappling with its own sexual harassment scandal. NBC News, part of NBC Universal, was the subject of a report in the Washington Post this week that detailed allegations of inappropriate behaviour by Matt Lauer, its former star presenter.The next few weeks will be key for the future of Sky. The CMA will present its report to Mr Hancock by May 1 having assessed the likely impact of the Fox-Sky deal on UK media plurality and examined Fox’s commitment to broadcasting standards. Mr Hancock will then have 30 working days to decide whether to block or approve the deal.

However, his bid was dealt a blow on Wednesday when a committee of Sky’s independent directors withdrew its recommendation of his £10.75-a-share offer.The change of heart of Sky’s committee comes after Comcast, the US cable group, gatecrashed Mr Murdoch’s takeover approach with a higher offer of £12.50 a share, valuing the London-listed group at £22bn ($31bn) — almost £4bn more than the Fox bid.Comcast’s bid for Sky will put further pressure on Fox, as its 39 per cent stake in the European media company is included in the deal it agreed with Disney. The Fox offer for Sky, which was first submitted in December 2016, was still being looked over by UK regulators. The Competition and Markets Authority has privately indicated to Fox executives that it would not recommend the deal to Matt Hancock, the UK culture secretary, without additional safeguards to ensure the editorial independence of the Sky News channel.One person said that TCI had acquired a stake in Fox as it believed Comcast could try to also gatecrash Disney’s deal with Mr Murdoch by making a higher offer to buy its international assets.Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, had been in the race to acquire Fox’s assets. Despite making an offer higher than Disney proposed, Comcast’s bid was turned down by Mr Murdoch as the media mogul feared the transaction faced high regulatory hurdles. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported TCI’s investment in Fox, said on Wednesday that Comcast was considering making a new offer for some of Mr Murdoch’s assets. If Comcast came back with a higher bid for Fox, TCI would make significant gains on its investment. The fund run by Mr Hohn disclosed in February that it had purchased a small stake in 21st Century Fox late last year. However, the shares were valued at less than $300m at the time.TCI is not the first activist fund to invest in the US entertainment group, which owns the namesake Hollywood studio and broadcast and cable channels. ValueAct, the activist hedge fund founded by Jeff Ubben, held a near $2bn stake in 21st Century Fox at the end of last year, according to a filing with US securities regulators in February.TCI declined to comment. Comcast, Fox and Disney could not be immediately reached for comment.
96;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-04-25T19:05:35Z;Sky, Whitbread and Shire deals test government’s taste for M&A;Moves highlight new potential hypocrisies for dealing with cross-border transactions;"British viewers will happily binge on US TV dramas. Tea drinkers will slurp American-style decaf skinny lattes. UK consumers will swallow Japan’s low-fat cuisine and its blood pressure tablets (even some of its newspaper coverage). But a new US bid for broadcaster Sky, an American activist securing a break-up of Costa Coffee owner Whitbread, and an agreed Japanese deal for drugmaker Shire pose a broader question about changing national tastes: does the UK government still have the stomach for cross-border mergers and acquisitions?On Alphaville, the Financial Times blog, the rhetorical question raised on Wednesday was: “When was the last time we had two FTSE 100 bids on the same day?” On Whitehall, however, it was more probably: “What did we say the last time we had a FTSE 100 bid, let alone two plus a demerger involving overseas companies?” Because the political treatment of M&A under the current administration has been anything but logical or consistent. It has ranged from threatening to block last month’s all-UK takeover of GKN, to waving through the 2016 sale of Arm to SoftBank of Japan.All three of Wednesday’s deals highlight new potential hypocrisies.Comcast, in announcing a formal £22bn offer for Sky, was at pains to emphasise that this was not only 16 per cent richer than the bid from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox but also more palatable to UK government and regulators. Brian Roberts, chief executive of the US group, expressed confidence in quickly gaining the necessary regulatory clearances — in marked contrast to the protracted and politicised review of Fox’s bid, amid concerns over media plurality. But Comcast’s Sky bid poses as many industrial concerns as Fox’s, and arguably more than Melrose’s bid for GKN. Sky employs 30,000 mainly in the UK and is a significant investor in Britain’s creative industries — but no clearance is required for overseas ownership. GKN employed only 6,000 in the UK but drew an intervention from the minister for “Industrial Strategy”. Comcast pointed out that it, too, had invested in such British successes as Downton Abbey. Still, there was no requirement for Sky’s would-be overlord to retain all the below-stairs kitchen staff.Elliott Advisors, the US activist pushing for Whitbread to demerge Costa, would appear to have given the board a caffeine injection from one of its own coffee machines. Just four weeks after Elliott declared a 6 per cent stake, Whitbread agreed a Costa spin off. In reality, Whitbread’s Alison Brittain had already been reviewing the group’s structure to better realise the value of its Premier Inns hotel chain. But insiders admit the UK group has been pushed into the process earlier than it wanted. And people familiar with Elliott’s plans say it will press for a faster demerger than Whitbread intends: nearer the UK average of 23 weeks than the 24 months Ms Brittain says she needs. That is likely to draw out overseas bidders for both Costa and Premier — analysts say IHG, Marriott and Accor will be working on plans. It will also fast-track the splitting of a UK pension scheme with a £300m deficit. While overseas bidders for divisions of GKN did not concern the government, the pension funding of the 259-year old British company did. Whitbread is 17 years older — which must surely raise exactly the same age-old concerns. Takeda’s fifth offer for the Dublin-based and London-listed Shire shows how much appetite it has for its rival’s product portfolio. That desperation has since hit Takeda’s share price, making a successful cash and shares deal look far from certain. But Takeda’s hunger has been such that it led at least one other overseas bidder to consider taking a further bite. Allergan of the US considered a counter bid, before ruling itself out for now. Yet mention of Allergan only highlights the contrast between US and UK political interventions. In 2014, it was the US government that opposed a takeover of Shire by AbbVie, due to concerns over loss of revenue through a tax inversion. It seems the UK has no objection to the loss of Shire from the UK stock market.And that would be fine, if it were a consistent approach; an acceptance of ever-changing FTSE 100 company ownership; a demonstration that Britain is “open for business”. However, it isn’t — and there is no system for providing bidders, shareholders and wider stakeholders with consistency.Government intervention in the Melrose-GKN takeover did set one precedent: a requirement for bidders to provide binding undertakings on investment in UK skills and technologies. Comcast’s very deliberate pledges to maintain current levels of investment in Sky News, increase investment in UK film and TV production, and back technology innovation show this is understood. But the irony is that — in the continued absence of a UK equivalent  of the US Committee on Foreign Investment, and given the ongoing reluctance of the Takeover Panel to act as UK industrial monitor — there is no one to whom Comcast can serve up its undertakings.matthew.vincent@ft.com"
97;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-04-25T18:13:55Z;Comcast piles pressure on Fox with Sky bid;Offer valuing the pay-TV group at £22bn brings prospect of bidding war;Comcast made its interest in Sky official on Wednesday when it submitted a formal offer for the European pay-television group. But regardless of whether it triumphs in its bid at £12.50 a share, shareholders in the company that Rupert Murdoch founded in 1989 have reasons to be grateful for its intervention.The Comcast bid, which was unveiled on Wednesday morning, values Sky at £22bn and gives its shareholders two competing offers — with the latest at a significant premium to a rival proposal from Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox group.It puts pressure on Fox to raise its own offer of £10.75 a share — a move analysts believe is likely, given that the company is hoping to include its Sky stake in a collection of assets it is selling to Walt Disney.Both Disney and Comcast, the world’s two largest media companies, wanted the Fox assets, which include its movie studio and cable channels, but Disney prevailed at the end of 2017 with an offer that valued the Fox portfolio at $66bn including debt. This was partly because Mr Murdoch and his family viewed Comcast’s all-cash offer as inferior to the Disney bid — which included a hefty amount of Disney shares — and partly because Comcast said it was unwilling to pay a break fee.This is likely to be about what Disney is willing to pay for Sky as Disney will be the buyer of the Fox assetsBut with Comcast now officially in the race for Sky, the game has changed. “The outcome for Sky is dependent upon any response by Disney now that Comcast have firmed their offer,” Macquarie analysts wrote in a note. “Tension between Disney and Comcast could lift the offer price at least 10 per cent.”Any improved offer by Fox for Sky is likely to be made after discussion between Fox and Disney, given that a successful Comcast acquisition of Sky would have a significant bearing on Disney’s own plans for the Fox assets. “A counterbid from Fox will likely mean agreeing it with Disney,” said Ian Whittaker, analyst with Liberum. “This is likely to be about what Disney is willing to pay for Sky as Disney will be the buyer of the Fox assets.”Disney has indicated that owning Sky was an important factor in its bid for the Fox assets. The company is working on a global direct-to-consumer streaming service that will compete with rival services such as Netflix and Amazon. Sky will give it a strong position in Europe with 29m customers and the ability to market and promote other products — such as a streaming network.“Disney has to be mindful of becoming involved in a bidding war with Comcast for [Sky],” said Mr Whittaker. “However, ownership of Sky would seem central if Disney wanted to expand its plans to build a direct-to-consumer network in North America and into Europe as it would give Disney the number one pay-TV operator in the UK, Germany and Italy.”With Sky shares closing up almost 4 per cent at £13.49, there is an expectation that an improved offer from Fox will be made. But it is unclear if that will come before or after Fox learns if its own bid will be blocked or cleared by the UK government.It made its latest bid for Sky in December 2016 and the offer has been in regulatory purdah since. Opposition from a cross-party group of politicians, which includes Vince Cable of the Liberal Democrats, and Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, has weighed on the Competition and Markets Authority, the latest regulatory body to scrutinise the deal.The CMA has concerns about the impact of a Fox-Sky purchase on media plurality in the UK. Unlike Mr Murdoch, Comcast does not control any UK newspaper titles and Brian Roberts, chief executive, said on Tuesday the company was confident that buying Sky would not raise any regulatory issues.However, supporters of the Fox offer are pushing for Comcast to receive equivalent regulatory treatment. Even Mr Murdoch’s critics say Comcast’s bid should be subject to the same scrutiny.“Sky News is a particularly important part of the UK news market and it is good to see that Comcast has committed to funding it for a decade after any merger in this bid,” said Tom Watson, Labour’s shadow secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport. “As with all bids it is important that Comcast’s undertaking are properly scrutinised and full due process is followed.”Comcast expects an acquisition of Sky to generate annual synergies of about $500m through a combination of revenue benefits and recurring cost savings. It added it expected only a “limited impact on headcount” as a result of the deal.The appetite of Mr Murdoch and Disney to engage Comcast in a takeover battle will determine whether Mr Roberts gets his chance to put those plans into action.

Its shares fell sharply when it first unveiled its proposal to acquire Sky in February, partly on fears that satellite television faces secular challenges.But Mr Roberts said that Sky had been mistakenly characterised as a “satellite company”, pointing to its record in technological innovation and international programming investment. “Sky is a multi-country company,” he said. “Their road map fits Comcast’s extremely well.”The Fox offer for Sky, which was first submitted in December 2016, is still being pored over by UK regulators. The Competition and Markets Authority has privately indicated to Fox executives that it will not recommend the deal to Matt Hancock, the UK culture secretary, without additional safeguards to ensure the editorial independence of the Sky News channel.This is because of concerns about Mr Murdoch’s influence over the UK media market via the portfolio of newspapers, such as The Times and The Sun, owned by the UK arm of News Corp, which he also controls.Fox has proposed measures to address the CMA’s concerns — including a commitment to sell Sky News to Disney. The CMA is due to inform Mr Hancock by May 1 whether the Fox remedies are sufficient to meet public interest concerns about the deal’s impact on media plurality.Comcast has also attempted to ward off concerns about the effect on media plurality with a commitment to maintain investment in Sky News and preserve its editorial independence. It said on Wednesday that it would give a “binding post-offer undertaking” not to acquire any majority interest in a UK newspaper for five years.Sky shares closed up almost 4 per cent.

There is shrewd calculation in his £22bn cash bid for the shares of Sky Plc. He has not only staked a claim to a valuable UK media asset. He has poked Rupert Murdoch in the eye to boot.The boss of 21st Century Fox must have assumed that with 39 per cent of Sky, his own prior bid would succeed. He predicated a big asset sale to Disney partly on it. Mr Roberts has called the bluff of the Digger and the Mouse. Advised by bankers, cab drivers and other sages, the US cable group has trumped Fox with an offer at £12.50 per share. “Gee, golly gosh!”, as one of the homespun characters portrayed by James Stewart might put it.Mr Roberts at least qualifies as a man of the people in his enthusiasm for Sky, which has tenaciously built a business among ordinary Britons by giving them what they want: football and drama. He has acted neighbourly towards Sky staff — and an increasingly protectionist government — by pledging to limit any job cuts.Unlike Mr Murdoch, who is disliked in corners of the UK establishment, Mr Roberts is no press baron. He would keep Sky News independent and buy no local papers for five years. He must also be prepared to leave Sky with its own listing, if Fox refused to sell.Comcast’s price sits 16 per cent above the Fox offer, before an expected final dividend in June of 21.8p, which Comcast would pay. Sky may well have been undervalued back when Fox first bid in December 2016. It is certainly well valued today, at £13.56. At an enterprise value of 13 times estimated operating earnings with usual adjustments, Sky has not traded so dearly since October 2007.Mr Roberts and his crew are rolling up their sleeves. They would expect to garner $300m of cost savings. Taxed and capitalised, that would cover the premium over Fox’s bid price. Comcast’s promised buybacks, worth $5bn each of the past two years, would probably stop. Debts would rise.The market evidently thinks there will be another bid. This could come from Fox, Disney, or both. Disney boss Bob Iger may be wondering where this will all end. Sky’s independent directors, sometimes accused of lacking spine, have done the right thing in withdrawing their recommendation for the Fox bid. For Sky’s independent shareholders, as for viewers of Stewart’s best-known movie, it’s a wonderful life.Is another bid for Sky going to materialise?

Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, said its Sky offer was a “significant premium” to the Fox proposal and pointed to “significant opportunities for growth by combining our businesses”.Sky said it welcomed the news from Comcast and was withdrawing its recommendation for Fox’s bid. Shares in Sky rose more than 4 per cent on the news to £13.62.Comcast owns NBC Universal, which includes the Universal movie studio and NBC broadcast network. “Sky will be our platform for growth across Europe,” Mr Roberts said. “The combined customer base of approximately 52m will allow us to invest more in original and acquired programming and innovation as we strive to deliver a truly differentiated customer experience.”He added that Comcast would make “a series of important binding commitments which will underpin our future investment in Sky and the UK”. These include commitments to maintain investment in Sky News and preservation of its editorial independence — issues that have become sticking points for the UK regulators scrutinising the Fox bid for Sky.The Competition and Markets Authority, which is examining the Fox offer, has raised concerns about the impact of a Sky purchase by Mr Murdoch’s group on the plurality of the UK media market. Comcast said it would give a “binding post-offer undertaking” not to acquire any majority interest in a UK newspaper for five years.Comcast expects the generate annual synergies of around $500m, through a combination of revenue benefits and recurring cost savings across the enlarged company. It added it expected only a “limited impact on headcount” as a result of the deal.

That stupidity seems to have been inherited by the daughters of Cho Yang-ho, chairman of Korean Air.“I feel crushed by the immature behaviour of my daughters,” Mr Cho said on Sunday as he removed them from senior roles at the company. Heather Cho is notorious for having humiliated a Korean Air crew over how her in-flight nuts were served in 2014, while her sister Cho Hyun-min allegedly threw water at an advertising agency executive during a dispute.Mr Cho has pledged to reinforce Korean Air with more professional executives, but his offspring are not done. Cho Won-tae, his son, is president of the company and may one day lead the Hanjin chaebol founded by Mr Cho’s father. It is difficult to curb the instinct to keep business in the family.Yannick Bolloré, 38-year-old son of the investor and industrialist Vincent Bolloré, who was arrested on Tuesday in a bribery probe, last week described his appointment as chairman of the supervisory board of Vivendi, the French media group that his father controls, as “very natural”. It is equally natural for Alexandre de Rothschild, 37-year-old son of David de Rothschild, to take control of the family bank next month.It is natural, but is it wise? The downfall of the Korean Air heiresses shows the pitfalls of entitlement among millennial heirs. The rarity of a founder’s son or daughter being fully qualified for the top job is what leads to most family companies being put into the hands of professional executives after the founder has died.There can be advantages to continued family control, either through board oversight or when a son or daughter occupies the executive suite. It often happens in the media business — AG Sulzberger has succeeded his father as publisher of the New York Times — and it can work. Brian Roberts took over the Philadelphia cable company Comcast from his father Ralph and has since turned it into a global force.The scion can be more dedicated to the long-term health of the business, and more willing to ignore short-term pressure from outside investors. A study in Germany found that entrepreneurs make longer-term investments in Mittelstand companies when their children are likely to succeed. Employees may put more trust in, and be more dedicated to, a family leader.But although companies overseen by families often outperform those with a thorough separation between investors and managers, the verdict on next generation chief executives is brutal. “When descendants serve as CEOs, firm value is destroyed,” concluded one study of Fortune 500 companies. So what must scions do to beat the odds and become suitable leaders?First, be humble. This is the hurdle at which the Cho heiresses spectacularly fell, behaving as if their family status brought immunity from the usual rules of conduct. In fact, it is the opposite: if everyone knows you did not get a job solely on your merits, you must prove your ability even more.Keeping your voice down helps. It is noticeable that both AG Sulzberger and John Elkann, who chairs the Agnellis’ investment company Exor, are known for working hard and being quiet. The fact that Lachlan Murdoch is less brash than his brother James has helped him to emerge as the likely successor to their father Rupert at 21st Century Fox and News Corp.Second, be prepared. Family heirs will fail if they lack the credibility in both education and experience of the professional executives with whom they are compared. This means not only having a good degree, even an MBA, but working their way up within the family business. Mr Cho’s daughters had jobs at the family company but they did not learn to deal with being subordinate.Ideally, the next generation should have put in time beyond the family business, as all of Rupert Murdoch’s children from his second marriage — Elisabeth, Lachlan and James — have done. Even if they do not match their parent’s skill, external experience brings valuable experience and self-respect.Last, know your strength. Heirs have an advantage over other executives from growing up in the business. As a teenager, Brian Roberts was brought by his father to meetings with banks to discuss Comcast. If the next generation can pass the test of competence, it adds continuity; no one inside the company needs to be convinced that heirs are there for the duration.Insiders and outsiders have contrasting strengths. The latter are more likely to have the skill and detachment to manage operations efficiently but there will always be questions about their loyalty. It is hard to combine both qualities — one study found that only 10 per cent of US family businesses endure to the third generation — but when an heir has both, it is powerful.Cho Hyun-min failed the leadership challenge when she threw water at a hapless executive. Inheriting a business is the easiest thing in the world; handling it is very difficult.john.gapper@ft.comWhy older generations turn to millennial-bashing / From Brian Conlan, Washington DC, US"
102;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-04-19T01:16:30Z;21st Century Fox quit Comcast talks over break fee;Filing shows cable group was not offering a payment if deal collapsed;Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox walked away from a potential blockbuster sale of its entertainment assets to Comcast because the cable group, which owns NBC Universal, did not offer to pay a break fee in the event that its proposed deal collapsed, according to a regulatory filing.The S4 filing reveals how close Mr Murdoch came to pursuing a sale to Comcast that it ultimately struck with Walt Disney. The Disney deal gives the Fox assets — which include its cable networks, movie studio and international businesses such as its stake in Sky — an enterprise value of $66bn.The Fox filing reveals that “party B” — widely known to be Comcast — “was unwilling to agree to an acceptable allocation of regulatory risk” associated with the purchase of the Fox assets. The subject of a break fee was raised multiple times in discussions between the two sides, according to the filing.NBC Universal has significant overlapping media interests that both Comcast and Fox acknowledged would have been an impediment to the deal. Barclays analysts recently suggested Comcast could have to sell NBC Universal to get a purchase of Fox cleared by US regulators, and in a research note pointed to the dim view taken of behavioural remedies mooted for AT&T’s $85.4bn purchase of Time Warner. The US government has sued to block that deal.In the filing, Fox states that Comcast “was unwilling to offer a reverse termination fee despite repeated requests by 21CF and its representatives”.The filing also suggests that Comcast’s deal proposal would have potentially created a tax liability for Fox that would have effectively lowered the value of the Comcast offer. In the filing, Fox says that Comcast’s response to any potential regulatory intervention would have effectively reduced the value of its offer.The filing states that Fox’s management “remained concerned” that Comcast’s proposal “created a potential to diminish the acquisition premium” due to Fox shareholders.Mr Murdoch and Fox ultimately opted to sell the company’s entertainment assets to Disney, after turning down Comcast and rejecting interest from Verizon, referred to in the document as “party A”.But Comcast has not given up on getting some of the Fox assets. The company recently made a proposal to acquire Sky, the pan-European pay TV company in which Fox has a 39 per cent stake.Mr Murdoch and Fox are in the midst of a protracted regulatory review and will sell 100 per cent of Sky to Disney if the acquisition is approved by the UK government.But Comcast has offered to buy Sky at £12.50 a share — a hefty premium to Fox’s £10.75 offer — although it has yet to make a formal offer.Fox, Disney and Comcast all declined to comment.
103;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-04-03T18:57:53Z;Murdoch’s gladhanding of Disney in the Sky arm-wrestle;Party small-talk could have cleared way for main course of media deal;"Rupert Murdoch’s Bel Air dinner party guest list raises many fascinating questions. Did Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson use the correct form of address for Mohammed bin Salman? Did the Saudi crown prince adopt a suitable sobriquet for the wrestler-turned-movie-star? Who received more selfie requests from the MBS entourage: The Rock or Morgan Freeman? How many Ubers did they need to ferry said entourage back to its 285 rooms at The Four Seasons?Alas, The Hollywood Reporter does not disclose whether it was all “Your Royal Highness” and “Your Rocky Hardness” when Gulf royalty met film royalty at the weekend. No matter, the FT Lombard column is far more interested in the greeting between the host and another guest: Walt Disney chairman and chief executive Bob Iger. One suspects this was warm, and very familiar. Because, by Tuesday morning, Mr Iger was offering to buy Sky News, just to help Mr Murdoch win an arm wrestle with UK regulators over his bid to buy the rest of Sky plc— and let him sell the TV group on, with other entertainment assets, to Disney.Like much of Mr Murdoch’s socialising, then, it appears mutually beneficial. Ever since his 21st Century Fox group bid £11.7bn to buy the 61 per cent of Sky it does not already own, he has found himself in the position of one of his dinner guests in a narrow stone-clad corridor: between a Rock and hard place. UK regulators came down hard on a Fox-Sky tie-up, on grounds of media plurality — citing Murdoch control of other UK news outlets. In January, the Competition and Markets Authority concluded that there were only three options: block the deal; agree a behavioural remedy to insulate Sky News from Murdoch influence; or secure a structural remedy to ringfence or sell the Sky News unit.Now Mr Iger has provided the third of those: new ownership for Sky News, regardless of whether Disney can later buy Fox. He is evidently willing to pay in advance, and take completion risk on the bigger deal.And Mr Murdoch has provided the second: making Sky News a legally distinct company with a guarantee of 15 years’ funding and no Fox interference — going further than his political critics’ demands, and even tacitly conceding the influence issue.Analysts formed an apparently rock-solid argument from all of this. Mr Murdoch is now willing to do whatever it takes to win Sky, and must have gladhanded Mr Iger. So, with US rival Comcast suggesting it could offer 16 per cent more for Sky, shareholders can expect a higher offer from Fox — with the agreement of Disney.However, Mr Murdoch likes to leave things late. He bid for Sky in December 2016 but chose not to offer the Sky News remedy until now — a month before the final CMA recommendation. He waited for the CMA to make its move first. He is sure to do the same with Comcast — to find out whether its combative stance is real, or just a spoiling tactic. As a former wrestler, Mr Johnson would doubtless approve.What’s the biggest problem with flying from Cardiff or Southampton airports? Apart from finding you have a return ticket? It is that there are plenty of aircraft, but not enough snow ploughs. For regional airline Flybe, the latter issue meant hundreds of cancellations in February and March, as ground crews struggled with icy conditions brought on by the Siberian “ Beast From the East”. Across the UK, Flybe had to cancel 994 flights in the quarter to March 31, incurring a £4m hit to revenue that will cut full-year profit.But it is arguably the former that is the bigger matter, as Flybe still had plenty of aircraft taking off — so many, in fact, that its flights were not even three-quarters full. In the three-month period, its passenger load factor was 6.8 percentage points higher than a year ago, but still no more than 73.5 per cent. By contrast, Ryanair’s load factor in its last reported quarter was 96 per cent, easyJet’s was 92.1 per cent, and Wizz Air’s was 89.4 per cent. Of course, purely regional airlines will always operate with lower load factors, partly because they fly to Cardiff and Southampton rather than Corfu and the south of France. They can also afford to, as they operate cheaper turboprop aircraft that break even on lower passenger numbers. Even so, Flybe needs to cut capacity by more than the 6 per cent it achieved in the past three months. Over-ambition in the past has left it with too many jets allocated to marginal routes. Six aircraft are being returned at the end of their leases but, with new orders having only now stopped, the fleet shrinks by just four, to 79. Progress will continue to be slow, even though Flybe also owns aircraft that it could sell. In many cases, waiting for lease expiry remains a more cost-effective option than selling newer aircraft on attractive financing deals.Passengers have had to get used to waiting. But can shareholders? At least Flybe’s largest backer appears to be prepared for the short-haul long haul: it’s Hosking Partners — the investment boutique set up by the co-founder of the fund manager …Marathon. matthew.vincent@ft.com"
104;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-04-03T16:22:17Z;Disney offers to buy Sky News to ease Murdoch fears;Media group wades into UK political storm to clear Fox-Sky deal’s regulatory hurdles;Walt Disney has waded into the years-long dispute over Rupert Murdoch’s influence in UK media by offering to buy Sky News, attempting to ease political and regulatory fears that Fox’s acquisition of the television outlet would deepen the media mogul’s dominance in Britain.The Disney offer, made in a submission to UK regulators, was applauded by some of Mr Murdoch’s biggest critics in a sign the move could neutralise much of the political opposition to the deal.Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader who has been one of the most vocal opponents of the Fox takeover, gave the prospect a guarded welcome. “If it were approved by [regulators], and if Sky News were truly independent as part of any deal, and James Murdoch didn’t somehow appear on a board of directors somewhere, then I think we would be content,” an aide said. However, the party would continue to oppose Fox’s takeover of the rest of Sky on other grounds.The Murdoch family would gain full control of the cable news channel if UK regulators approve the planned £11.7bn takeover of its parent Sky by 21st Century Fox. But the Competition and Markets Authority has signalled it will not recommend the deal because it would concentrate too much power in Mr Murdoch’s hands.Disney has separately agreed a $66bn deal to acquire Fox’s entertainment assets — including its stake in Sky, the pay-TV group Mr Murdoch launched in 1989 — although the path to completing that transaction has been stymied by the regulatory delay in the Fox-Sky deal. A surprise offer for Sky from Comcast, the US cable group, at a premium to the Fox offer has further complicated the picture.Over the course of nearly 30 years as Sky’s founding shareholder neither [Fox] nor the Murdoch family have ever sought to influence the editorial direction of Sky NewsDisney’s move on Tuesday would untangle the process by, in effect, leaping over Fox to acquire Sky News directly. In a statement, Fox said Disney’s interest in buying Sky News would stand “whether or not Disney’s proposed acquisition” of Fox moved forward.Disney said it would be willing “to sustain the operating capital of Sky News and maintain its editorial independence” once it took over the news channel. Sky shares closed up more than 2 per cent to £13.25 in London.A Disney deal was one of two options offered by Mr Murdoch to win over the CMA. Fox said it could also separate Sky News from Sky and establish it as an independent company with its own independent board, as well as pledging to fund it for 15 years — five more than it offered two months ago. This would be similar to the legal separation last year of BT and Openreach, which owns its phone and broadband cable networks.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader and a Murdoch critic, said the CMA and communications regulators should still “exercise all of their powers of scrutiny” on any bid by Disney “to ensure that Sky continues to be a truly independent news service and that media plurality is upheld”.Fox, which currently owns just 39 per cent of Sky, expressed confidence either option would address the CMA’s outstanding concerns.“We have proposed a set of solutions that address and resolve any and all questions or concerns that may have been raised by the transaction,” said Gerson Zweifach, Fox’s senior executive vice-president and group general counsel. “We look forward to concluding this acquisition — finally — in a timely and expeditious manner.”Sky also said the proposals would address regulatory concerns. “Sky believes that both of these remedy proposals comprehensively address any plurality concerns the CMA may have, and would guarantee the long-term future of Sky News and its ongoing editorial independence,” it said.The CMA declined to comment ahead of a May 1 deadline for the regulator to deliver its recommendations to the government.Fox said it had offered the CMA “personal undertakings” from its executive chairman, Mr Murdoch, and its chief executive — his son, James — “not to influence or attempt to influence the editorial choices made by the head of Sky News”. “We offered this even though the record before the CMA shows that over the course of nearly 30 years as Sky’s founding shareholder neither [Fox] nor the Murdoch family have ever sought to influence the editorial direction of Sky News,” the company added.The CMA has taken evidence from critics of the deal, including Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, and Ken Clarke, the Conservative MP and former UK chancellor. They argue that Mr Murdoch and his family, who also control News Corp, owner of The Sun and The Times, as well as Talksport radio, have too much influence over the UK media market. “We are aware that a group of politicians that is opposed to the transaction is seeking to influence the CMA and is making a number of unsupported and fanciful assertions,” said Fox, adding that a rejection of its new proposal “would compromise the integrity of a system” by capitulating to political pressure.Analysts suggested that the new suggestion may be welcomed.Guy Peddy, an analyst with Macquarie, said that selling Sky News to Disney would take plurality issues that have plagued Fox out of the equation. “This accelerates the likely endgame,” he said.Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis, said that Fox has presented two very credible options to the CMA. But she added that the regulator or Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, could look to extract a “third option” from the company which would involve Disney also committing to a governance and independence model. “It may be that this is not enough and the secretary of state may want to get his pound of flesh as well,” she said.Disney would still have to receive regulatory approval if it agrees to buy Sky News. But it has a much smaller presence in the UK media market — it does not own any newspapers, for example — and is unlikely to generate the same political opposition as Mr Murdoch.Additional reporting by Nic Fildes and Henry Mance

Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

The value of $5bn-plus deals is more than triple year-ago levels, according to data provider Thomson Reuters.More than half of the $1.2tn worth of acquisitions in the first quarter — the fastest start to a year ever — have been worth in excess of $5bn.The overall level of activity is up more than 67 per cent from a year earlier and about a third ahead of 2007, the previous high-water mark for takeovers.The surge of big transactions — with more than 20 deals worth at least $10bn — has been bolstered by a desire by boards to head off disruptive technological threats and accelerate growth, according to bankers and lawyers who spoke to the Financial Times.The deals have been spurred by quickening global growth and robust business confidence, as well as tax cuts passed in the US last year that have added to the firepower for marquee acquisitions.“In an environment where growth is back, companies feel the pressure to justify the multiples they are trading on,” said Alison Harding-Jones, Citigroup’s Europe, Middle East and Africa M&A head.Dealmaking in Europe has more than doubled from year-ago levels, led by accelerating activity in the UK, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. Some bankers and lawyers expect the pace of divestitures to accelerate, opening the door for private equity groups.That was apparent in a €10.1bn deal, including debt, clinched this week between Carlyle and Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel for the latter’s speciality chemicals business. The acquisition is one of the largest European private equity deals agreed in recent years.Stephen Arcano, head of M&A at Skadden, said companies were being vigilant about potential political risks but for the time being there was no evidence that the pace of deal talks would slow down later in the year.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi and James Fontanella-KhanHere are some of the significant themes that have emerged in the first quarter of dealmaking in 2018.Morgan Stanley dethroned its rival Goldman Sachs from the top of the world’s M&A rankings in the first quarter of 2018, due to a consistent pipeline of megadeals in the first three months of the year, writes James Fontanella-Khan.Morgan Stanley advised buyers and sellers around the globe for a total of $385bn worth of deals, about a third more than the $264bn worth of transactions Goldman advised on during the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.The advisory division led by Robert Kindler, Morgan Stanley’s vice-chairman and global head of M&A, worked on fewer deals than Goldman during the same period — 65 compared with 85 — but on significantly more big-ticket transactions.Morgan Stanley advised on six out of the 10 largest deals, including US health insurer Cigna’s $68.5bn acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts and European media group Sky, which was approached by US cable company Comcast in a deal worth $39.8bn.Although the data for Morgan Stanley were slightly skewed by the inclusion of Unilever choosing Rotterdam over London for its single legal base — which Thomson Reuters valued as a $90.5bn transaction — the New York investment bank would have still ended the quarter at the top.JPMorgan Chase and Citibank followed the two investment banks in third and fourth position in the rankings, respectively.Centerview Partners, which jumped from 21st to fifth in the ranking, was the only boutique investment bank to make it into the top 10.The firm co-founded by Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan advised Express Scripts in its sale to Cigna and Thomson Reuters in the $17bn sale of the majority of its financial and risk assets to Blackstone.Bankers and lawyers are blaming regulatory uncertainty and jittery relations between the US and China for a 15 per cent decline in Chinese cross-border dealmaking so far this year, writes Don Weinland.Chinese companies spent just $25.2bn on overseas assets in the first quarter, while the number of deals fell to the lowest mark since 2005, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The only sizeable negotiation so far in 2018 was Geely’s unsolicited $9bn investment in Germany’s Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz.Behind the low deal count is a deterioration of relations between China and the US and more resistance against China’s acquisitions of US technology.“For me the biggest challenge is the regulatory uncertainty in the US and the future of US-China relations,” said Miranda So, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Davis Polk. “It’s this risk that has subdued some of the appetite for overseas deals.”In a report for new tariffs on Chinese exports last week, the US named several companies that have repeatedly bought US businesses and technologies. The accusation from the US administration is that Chinese policy and cheap loans from state banks were behind the flurry of deals over the past three years.But M&A activity is expected to pick up in coming months as China’s political situation firms up, although the focus could fall outside of the US.“The government’s new economic team is in place in Beijing and everything has settled down,” said Tang Zhenyi, chairman of Hong Kong-based investment bank CLSA. “Now the corporations can focus on going out, on going global. I think that means it will be a big year for Chinese companies doing overseas deals.”A series of sensitive political meetings kicking off in October of last year had disrupted deal flows in 2017, with companies such as HNA Group waiting for clarity on what types of outbound investment would be allowed.The crackdown was swift, just as much as it was unexpected. In short order earlier this month, the US government acted to, in effect, block the prospects of the largest technology acquisition of all time: the $142bn takeover of chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom, writes Arash Massoudi.The use of national security concerns by President Donald Trump to block a takeover that had yet to be agreed was unprecedented and spooked dealmakers around the world at a time when the US government is pursuing more protectionist policies.It is uncertain whether a further freeze in global dealmaking will take a hold, but for now cross-border mergers and acquisitions account for more than $511.7bn in overall activity in the first quarter of this year. That is up 76 per cent from the same period a year ago and advisers see no sign that a slowdown is coming.“M&A dialogue remains robust despite concerns about the potential impact of changes in America’s trade and national security policies on deal activity,” said Stephen Arcano, head of M&A at Skadden.One area where the US actions did have an effect however was in deals from China, with companies from the country registering just 4 per cent of the activity so far in 2018.US companies launched more than $101bn worth of overseas deals, with the largest move coming from cable group Comcast as it tries to break up a takeover of UK pay-TV broadcaster Sky.Other significant cross-border transactions in the period include Italy’s Atlantia and Spain’s ACS teaming up to jointly take over Abertis, the Spanish highway concessions group.The largest European deal into the US came in January when privately held consumer group JAB Holding agreed to pay $18.7bn in cash to acquire soft-drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple and combine it with its Keurig Green Mountain coffee business.Global private equity deals have enjoyed their strongest start in five years, buoyed by the record amounts of cash flowing into the sector as institutional investors look for ways to boost their returns, writes Javier Espinoza.Buyout-backed transactions totalled $79.7bn in the first quarter, a 30 per cent rise from a year earlier. The figure represents 7 per cent of overall global dealmaking activity, according to Thomson Reuters data.The US saw the biggest increase in private equity transactions with a 52 per cent rise in deals led by buyout funds, accounting for a total of $46.4bn so far this year. In Europe dealmaking jumped 27 per cent, totalling $19bn and the most active year since 2007. Asian deal flow shrank slightly.The two largest transactions for the first quarter were Blackstone’s $17bn acquisition of the financial terminals and data unit of Thomson Reuters and Carlyle’s €10.1bn acquisition of Akzo Nobel’s speciality chemicals unit.Rob Pulford, head of financial sponsors for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs, said he expects activity levels to surpass those of 2017. He said: “This year is as good as last year and I think 2018 will be even more active. We are seeing the biggest deals in a long time.”Mr Pulford expects a bulk of the deals to come from private equity groups acquiring listed companies following a doubling in the value of such deals last year. “The level of dialogue and conversation around public to private transactions has accelerated from last year. Boards of companies have decided that what’s on offer is compelling,” he said.But as the pace of dealmaking speeds up, advisers to buyout funds have warned that there is a risk of overpaying for assets as multiples have already surpassed the record highs of before the financial crisis.* This article has been amended since original publication to correct the denomination of the Nex Group acquisition from dollars to pounds
107;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-03-12T02:30:24Z;Cartoon: Comcast disrupts Murdoch’s Disney deal, March 12;US cable operator’s bid for Sky values pan-European media group at £22bn;‘We’ve got to put on our thinking caps, Donald, because our friend Rupert needs help pronto. Seems a monster called Comcast is trying to gobble up his Pie in the Sky.’
108;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-03-06T18:18:55Z;Comcast: leap of faith;A company is eschewing bigger buybacks — and paying a price;Scolds who argue that US companies should buy back less stock and invest in their businesses can look to Comcast as an exemplar. The media titan was once a sleepy Pennsylvania cable television operator. Through a series of splashy M&A deals — buying NBCUniversal and AT&T Broadband — it transformed its business into a content-and-distribution monster worth $235bn. That track record has not been worth much lately. Since launching an unsolicited bid for Sky last week, its shares have fallen nearly a tenth. Reinvention is proving tougher than expansion.In January, Comcast said it would raise its dividend by 25 per cent and buy back at least $5bn in stock this year. Investors could thank US tax reform and an 18 per cent increase in earnings in 2017. To some observers, those capital return figures were light. They make sense in the light of the Sky pursuit.An element of “trust us” is at play. Brian Roberts, the deadpan boss, jokingly attributed Comcast’s interest to a conversation with a cab driver. Comcast is almost purely a US company so the direct cost savings are limited. Mr Roberts’ more serious argument is about his company jumping from 29m subscribers across broadband and cable television to 52m in “total relationships” when adding Sky’s satellite and internet customers. There are cross selling opportunities and more leverage with Comcast and Sky’s customers and counterparties such as Netflix who want their content. Both companies have big research spends that can be layered over a bigger set of customers.Those are nebulous. Mr Roberts is therefore depending on the goodwill he has generated with his investors. Strategic considerations aside, the process for Sky is more complicated than those other deals. There may be a bidding war for Sky with Fox (or its putative acquirer Disney).Comcast should note the apprehension of shareholders and remain disciplined in its pursuit of Sky. But investors should also recognise they pay management to find better things to do with their capital than buy back their shares.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

109;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-03-02T18:59:34Z;Sky without limits: the battle for the broadcasting powerhouse;The group founded by Rupert Murdoch is at the centre of a flurry of deals by companies trying to keep up with Netflix and Amazon;"The journalist Maggie Brown remembers clearly the night Rupert Murdoch launched Sky. It was a February evening in 1989, the location a “glorified prefab single-storey building” in a grim industrial park west of London, near Heathrow airport. When the moment came for Mr Murdoch to push the button marking the start of satellite television in Britain, Ms Brown, who worked for The Independent newspaper, approached the mogul. “I said, Rupert, will it work?” she recalls. “And he said: ‘It’s a wing and a prayer.’ ”Almost three decades later, Sky has grown from a risky bet that nearly went bust in its first year of operation into a pan-European media powerhouse at the centre of a bidding war and of an industry facing an identity crisis.This week Comcast, America’s largest cable operator and the owner of NBC Universal, gatecrashed plans by Mr Murdoch to take full control of Sky, making a proposal of its own worth £22bn. This late intervention, more than a year into regulatory reviews of Mr Murdoch’s own offer, has complicated Walt Disney’s planned purchase of the entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, which Mr Murdoch controls. The sale he has negotiated with Disney includes Fox’s Hollywood studio and cable channels — and its 39 per cent stake in Sky.Disney and Comcast have been effusive in their admiration of Sky. Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, recently said it was a “crown jewel” among Fox’s businesses while Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, this week described it as a “consistent innovator”, saying he was “terribly impressed” with the technical wizardry of its latest Sky Q set-top box.The company Mr Murdoch created to disrupt the cosy UK hegemony of the BBC and ITV has suddenly become a hot global property. But in the era of digital streaming, handheld devices and “cord-cutting” — the cancellation of pay-TV in favour of cheaper online alternatives — why are so many US media groups circling around Sky?The broadcaster has certainly changed since the early days, when it initially failed to catch fire with viewers. “What’s the difference between Sky and the Loch Ness monster?” Austin Mitchell, the former British Labour party MP who co-hosted a shortlived programme on the network with former Conservative party cabinet minister Norman Tebbit, once asked. “Some people have seen the Loch Ness monster.”Merging with rival British Satellite Broadcasting in 1990 stabilised its finances and its acquisition of Premier League football rights from 1992 brought in the customers as Sky turned the English game into a cash-rich contest for the world’s best players. Subscribers could not get enough of the drama on the pitch and Sky became a profit machine under Sam Chisholm, the buccaneering New Zealander who Mr Murdoch entrusted with running the company during the 1990s.Mr Chisholm and his deputy, David Chance, relished Sky’s outsider status. “It was like the Millwall of broadcasting,” recalls one former senior executive, referring to the south London football club, whose fans like to sing: “No one likes us, we don’t care.”Even after this initial success, Sky “hit a bit of a wall”, says one former executive who was there at the time. “It was clear we had to invest in the culture and the brand — and not just sports and movies.” Under James Murdoch, who became chief executive in 2003, it moved into new businesses, such as broadband provision, while attempting to create a corporate culture based around innovation and inclusivity. With his passion for environmentalism, the younger Mr Murdoch even had a wind turbine built so Sky could generate its own electricity for its studios.It was a big departure from the freewheeling Chisholm days and the plans often sounded like they had come from a Californian business school (in 2007 Sky even launched an ad campaign with the grandiose slogan “Believe in Better”). But they seemed to work: Sky added customers, revenues went up and it stepped up its investment in original content, a push that accelerated under current chief executive Jeremy Darroch. Sky’s green push has continued under Mr Darroch, with a commitment to remove all single use plastics from its campus by 2020.Sky is still located in the same west London industrial park, but these days the prefab buildings have been replaced by a gleaming £600m high-tech campus with employee cinema and cycle shop that would not look out of place in Silicon Valley.“Sky is an extraordinary success story,” says Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis, pointing to its record of increasing revenue at 5 per cent a quarter. She adds that the company has withstood competitors: the likes of ITV Digital, BT and, more recently, Netflix have all threatened to damage Sky, but have not yet dented its growth. “In the years since Netflix launched its streaming in 2012 Sky’s record in terms of revenue growth is unbroken,” she says.Those profits will no doubt appeal to Disney and Comcast, but they are playing a longer game. The rules of engagement have changed thanks to the entrance of Netflix and Amazon: Rupert Murdoch told the Financial Times recently that he decided to sell his entertainment assets after realising they could no longer compete on price. “I can see a big picture,” he said, pointing to the new generation of strait-laced, deep-pocketed challengers from Silicon Valley that also include Apple and Facebook.Buying Sky would give both Disney and Comcast additional firepower — cash flow and distribution know-how as well as millions of new customers to offer products to. Sky has a large European customer base — since the £7bn acquisition of the Sky Italy and Germany business four years ago its subscribers have risen to 23m — and it has launched Now TV, a lower cost streaming service.Sky still delivers its programming via satellite — technology described as “obsolete” by an analyst at the research group MoffettNathanson this week — but its customer base and streaming knowledge would be very useful for Disney, given that the owner of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm is working on its own Netflix rival. It would also give Disney and Comcast greater scale in Europe.“Netflix and Amazon have taken things to a new level,” says Mike Darcey, former chief executive of Mr Murdoch’s News UK and a former chief operating officer at Sky. The two companies have shown willingness to outspend traditional media players for the best television ideas, with Netflix this week saying it would spend about $8bn on content this year, producing roughly 700 new series and 80 original films.It is not just that Netflix has attracted close to 120m subscribers around the world; by commissioning more content than any of its traditional rivals, the company has sent tremors of fear across Hollywood and beyond.“People are asking: how do I get that kind of scale?” says Mr Darcey. Scale means two things in this context, he says: geographic reach and the ability to compete on price for the best content. Prices are going up: “$1m an hour for the best drama has become $10m an hour pretty quickly,” he says — a reference to the soaring cost of drama series such as The Crown, Game of Thrones or Netflix’s shortlived hip-hop drama The Get Down. This view is shared by Mr Roberts at Comcast, who told the FT this week: “With Facebook, Google and Apple, scale has been redefined.”Sky would give Disney or Comcast greater scale in content — it has in recent years increased the original series it produces such as Gomorrah and Babylon Berlin. At the same time, Sky’s successful recent bid for a new three-year Premier League football deal at a lower price than expected maintains its position as the UK’s leading sports broadcaster. Buying Sky would also give Disney or Comcast greater heft in Hollywood, says Ms Enders. “It is the major customer in Europe of all the big Hollywood studios. Each one relies on Sky to deliver pay-TV viewers to them.”The threat posed by the technology players has revived an age-old debate in media about content and distribution. So-called vertically integrated companies that marry content and distribution fell out of fashion some years ago but are now back in vogue. AT&T’s proposed $85bn takeover of Time Warner will combine America’s largest telecoms group with the owner of CNN, HBO and Warner Brothers movies.The ability of consumers to find content in new ways — and the spending power of companies such as Netflix and Amazon — is driving this shift. “If you’re on the distribution side you see the perils of the last several years of being reliant on licensed content which can be bid up to high levels — or worse, taken away from you,” says Mr Darcey. “Whereas companies on the content side are thinking: I could be much less vulnerable if I have my own distribution so I can’t be held to ransom.”This explains why Comcast and Disney want Sky. Yet before Fox got the ball rolling with its latest offer for all of Sky in December 2016, shares in the broadcaster had been languishing, with investors spooked by the prospect of rising sports costs and competition from the tech players. They had not counted on a Disney-Comcast fight over Sky — or that Sky would seal a new Premier League deal that cost significantly less than its previous contracts.With its shares up on the bid interest, Sky is now one of the most valuable UK companies to have been created in the past 30 years. Yet its future lies as a cog in the wheel of a larger US media company grappling with fierce competition from Silicon Valley in the fight to dominate living rooms around the world."
110;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-03-01T17:06:33Z;Comcast/Sky: Morgan Stanley reunited;Media business bid conjures a host of familiar faces in advising teams;Paul Taubman was nowhere to be seen on Tuesday when Comcast boss Brian Roberts swept into London and sent shockwaves through the media business with his £22.1bn bid for Sky. For years, Taubman has been the preferred banker for Roberts and Comcast. But the former Morgan Stanley exec’s boutique, PJT Partners, has been advising Sky since it agreed to be acquired by Fox in 2016. The PJT team includes Scott Matlock, another top media banker who left MS to join PJT, and Morgan Stanley itself is also advising Sky. Given the conflicts, Roberts, who two years ago poached MS man Robert Eatroff as Comcast’s head of M&A, had to find some more help. And so he brought in London-based boutique Robey Warshaw, fronted by Simon Robey, yet another former top banker from Morgan Stanley. If that wasn’t enough, Comcast’s legal deal team includes Davis Polk lawyer Tom Reid, who spent years working with all of the above at you know where. Cosy.Toys R Us: charity caseAmong those to pity amid the collapse of Toys R Us UK— workers, pensioners, creditors, fans of trashy plastic toys — at least the company’s charity partners have little to fear. Toys R Us said last year that after a staff vote it had chosen to work with Children with Cancer UK and Great Ormond Street Hospital. But its latest accounts reveal the true extent of charitable giving. Back in 2014, the company had been making donations at the (hardly extravagant) rate of £9,400 a year. By last year — as turnover slipped to £418m and the company itself steadily became a charity case — this had tumbled to £21. CWC and GOSH can probably manage without that tenner apiece.SuperReturn: added valueA couple more collapsed private equity owned businesses — Maplin as well as Toys R Us— was not enough to damp the mood in Berlin, where buyout barons gathered for their annual SuperReturn conference. The sector is enjoying record investor inflows, record financing multiples, and record glitz at SuperReturn. There was one sign of cutbacks, though. PE execs tried underhand ways to get into the event without having to fork out for a £5,400 ticket. In the past, a favourite trick saw attendees book a room at the InterContinental hotel, where the event takes place, to secure a big backdoor discount. This year, organisers have booked out the entire venue to thwart that ruse. But sneaky execs have come up with a new strategy to “add value”, as they might term it: borrowing/stealing badges from paying participants. One person was caught with an ID badge naming him as Rachel, suggesting that the sector has either boosted its diversity credentials with a surprise transgender hiring drive, or “Rachel” was a fraud. Scamsters in private equity? Whatever next.HSBC: salad daysA dancing lion greeted guests of HSBC’s investment bank at its Chinese new year party in London this week. City Insider’s man with a champagne flute was almost hit by flying lettuce, spat from the mouth of the traditional dancing beast. HSBC likes to think of itself as the king of the banking jungle and bronze statues of lions adorn its offices. Indeed, its investment bank has been spitting out more than just salad leaves. Just ask Matthew Westerman, the former Goldman Sachs banker who was chewed up and spat out after only 18 months of trying to tame the investment bank as co-head of global banking.
111;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-02-28T05:15:24Z;Comcast reaches for the Sky;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;"Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, strolled into the Financial Times on Tuesday with a message: his US cable group is intent on buying UK broadcasterSky. Why?“With Facebook, Google and Apple, scale has been redefined,” Roberts told us.Only a few hours earlier, Comcast had unveiled a £22.1bn bid for Sky, in a move that sent shockwaves through the media industry. Comcast wants to add Sky’s 23m subscribers in the UK, Germany and Italy to its 29m customers across broadband and cable in the US.But by doing so, it also threatened a carefully orchestrated set of transactions put together by Rupert Murdoch. Now Murdoch’s plans to acquire the 61 per cent of Sky that his 21st Century Fox does not already own, as well as his plans to sell much of Fox to Walt Disney, look deeply troubled. There are so many intriguing developments and plot lines in this tale. And we’ve got you covered with news, analysis and a podcast explaining everything you need to know. Some of the most important takeaways: Shares in Sky soared to £13.30 on Tuesday, well above Comcast’s all-cash offer of £12.50. That’s because investors are pricing in a bidding war as they expect Fox/Disney to come back with a new offer and improve their existing £10.75 per share bid. Here’s Lex on that. But Comcast shares fell 7.4 per cent in US trading, in a sign of just how much its investors do not value a protracted bidding war. Here’s how one analyst put it: ""For Comcast shareholders, there is a mix of good and bad in this morning’s announcement of a topping bid for Sky. Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good."" Disney shares dropped 4.5 per cent on the news, while 21st Century Fox shares dropped 3 per cent. Roberts has not spoken to any member of the Murdoch family about the Comcast bid and has set the acceptance threshold at 50 per cent plus one share — a sign that he wants to get the deal done regardless of the Murdochs’ approval.Attention now shifts to how Sky’s independent directors will handle the situation. Key man: Martin Gilbert, the asset management executive and deputy chairman of the board. See our mini tick-tock on the original Fox/Sky deal.What has Disney/Fox said? So far, not much. Disney chief Bob Iger was with French president Emmanuel Macron when the news hit. We’ll have lots more coverage in the days to come.

That brings us to this FT Alphaville deep dive, which takes us on a trip involving a medical ""magic mushroom"" investor, opaque equity derivatives, and a mysterious Bermuda entity about which Deutsche Bank itself says it has no information. The key to the puzzle appears to be this enigmatic entity called GAR Holdings.But while a corporate logo for GAR appears in some HNA presentations, there is no public information on what the company does and who exactly owns it. Even Deutsche Bank itself has declared in court that it does not know anything about GAR, despite the entity being in the chain of companies that controls the German bank’s stock.To get the whole story, you really must read Robert Smith’s investigation in full here.There has never been a better time in China to tuck into a bowl of chow mein at home on your couch.Online food delivery services have proliferated in the country, and the price of getting fried chicken delivered to your door is only set to fall as China’s two largest tech giants — Alibaba and Tencent — face off in their latest battle for supremacy.Ecommerce group Alibaba is in talks to acquire online food delivery start-up Ele.me in a deal that could value the company at as much as $9.5bn. Here is the FT story.Alibaba and its payments affiliate Ant Financial already own 40 per cent of Ele.me but are looking to buy the remaining 60 per cent from existing investors including Baidu, according to people familiar with the matter.The deal will put Alibaba in direct competition with internet company Tencent, which controls China’s largest online-to-offline food delivery platform Meituan-Dianping, which was valued at $30bn in its latest funding round last year.China’s food delivery market is already massive, at a value at Rmb204.6bn ($32.5bn) in 2017, according to the China Cuisine Association, an industry group.The face-off between Alibaba and Tencent seems familiar. The groups have already waged expensive battles to dominate areas such as ride-hailing apps and bike-sharing businesses in China.They have also been exceedingly active in M&A recently. Tencent has partnered with Chinese supermarket operator Yonghui and Carrefour of France and has invested in online retailer Vipshop, while most recently Alibaba has taken a stake in Easyhome, a furniture retailer, and Shiji, a data service company focusing on the hotel and travel industry.David de Rothschild is stepping aside as chairman of Rothschild this summer to pass the reins to his son Alexandre, who has long been groomed to succeed his father as the seventh generation of the Franco-British banking dynasty that was founded 200 years ago. The 37-year-old joined Rothschild in 2008 charged with building up its private equity business. His career has included a stint as an analyst at Bear Stearns and time as a manager in Argan Capital’s private equity department.

112;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-02-27T18:54:41Z;The cabbie’s tip that sent Comcast on Sky-ward journey;CEO Brian Roberts’ challenge to Murdoch and Disney is latest twist in reshaping global media;The London cab driver asked by an American passenger what he thought of the UK pay-television market could not have known that his answer might potentially sway a set of takeover deals worth tens of billions of dollars.But back in November, Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, asked his cabbie for his opinion. “[He] was incredibly knowledgeable about the differences between Virgin and Sky,” he said. After taking the taxi to a shopping centre, where he saw a demonstration of Sky’s latest set-top box, Mr Roberts was “terribly impressed”.Mr Roberts subsequently identified Sky as his company’s most logical target. Three months later, he has stunned media watchers with a £22.1bn proposal to buy the pan-European broadcaster.The deal sketched out by Comcast — it has not yet made a formal offer — is the latest twist in a reshaping of the global media industry, pitting Mr Roberts, the son of Comcast founder Ralph Roberts, against the Murdoch family and the might of Walt Disney, the world’s largest media company.The Murdochs control 21st Century Fox and have agreed to sell its entertainment assets — including its 39 per cent stake in Sky — to Walt Disney in a deal worth $66bn including debt. Separately, Fox is trying to buy the shares in Sky that it does not own in a deal worth £11.7bn, or £10.75 a share, valuing Sky at £18.5bn.Before Comcast’s intervention, Sky seemed to be destined to become part of Fox and then Disney. Analysts believe the UK government will eventually approve Fox’s offer after it agrees to implement several remedies, such as ringfencing Sky News to prevent the Murdoch family exerting any influence over it. Government approval would then clear the way for Disney to add Sky to the assets it is buying from Fox, including its portfolio of cable channels, Hollywood movie studio and Star in India.But the all-cash Comcast deal, pitched at a significant premium to the Fox offer at £12.50 a share, is likely to appeal to the independent Sky shareholders that own about 60 per cent of the company — and raises the prospect of a counterbid from Fox and Disney.The first communication Comcast made with Sky’s leadership came early on Tuesday when Mr Roberts phoned Jeremy Darroch, Sky chief executive, and Martin Gilbert, Sky’s deputy chairman. Comcast’s pitch in the coming weeks will be geared towards Sky’s independent directors: this has turned the spotlight to Mr Gilbert, whom the Murdochs courted only 14 months ago— and who eventually recommended that shareholders accept the Fox £10.75 a share offer.Sky said in a statement that it noted the possible all-cash offer and advised shareholders to take no action because no firm offer had yet been made.Disney declined to comment on Comcast’s proposal for Sky: Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, was in Paris meeting President Emmanuel Macron to discuss a $2.5bn expansion of its Disneyland Paris theme park around the time Mr Roberts and Comcast were talking through their Sky proposal with the media and investors.But analysts believe the company is likely to respond. “I think Disney will ask Fox to offer more for Sky and then Disney will absorb that cost,” said Michael Nathanson, analyst with MoffettNathanson.Under the guidelines for UK takeovers, Fox and Disney cannot attempt to buy shares of Sky in the market to try and build up enough of a shareholding to block a deal by Comcast. One of the few options available to the two companies if they want to secure Sky is to table a higher offer than Fox’s current proposal. This bid would probably need to be more than the £12.50 a share offer from Comcast.It is unclear how much more Disney and Fox would need to offer — or whether Comcast is ready for a bidding war. Analysts say the company is worth more in light of its recent success in securing rights to the Premier League football for another three years — mainly because it is paying significantly less for the packages it has bought.Analysts had been expecting the cost of the rights packages to increase by £300m a year but instead the cost is falling by £200m. “That’s £500m [a year] lower than originally thought,” said Thomas Singlehurst, analyst with Citi. “Every £100m of costs less than consensus forecast adds 5p to earnings. The standalone Sky valuation in our view is about £13 a share when you factor in the savings from the Premier League.”Mr Roberts told the Financial Times that Sky would be a good fit for Comcast, pointing to his company’s record in acquiring businesses and investing in them. Universal Studios, NBC Universal’s theme park unit, now generates more annual cash flow than its parent company did at the time Comcast bought it in 2011. He says that success is thanks to investment from Comcast.Similarly, the NBC broadcast network now leads its peers after trailing rival networks before it was owned by Comcast. “We just passed CBS in most viewers,” he said, pointing to the recent successes of film studio Universal Pictures, home of The Fast and the Furious series. “It’s just had the three most successful years in its history.”“Comcast has a history of buying companies to build our company,” he added, referring to the long history of acquisition started by his late father in 1963, when he and his partners acquired a cable television operation in Tupelo, Mississippi with 1,200 subscribers. Mr Roberts and his colleagues have big plans for Sky but will have to wait for Disney and Fox to respond before they know whether they will be able to put them into action.The softly spoken Brian Roberts does not come across as an all-conquering dealmaker but in the past 20 years he has been involved in several landmark media deals.As a keen squash player who won gold at the Maccabiah Games — also known as the Jewish Olympics — he knows about the rigours of competition.In 2001, he led the $50bn merger of Comcast with AT&T Broadband in a deal that laid the foundation for the company’s fastest growing business — internet provision. A decade later, Comcast snapped up NBC Universal in a deal that eventually valued the broadcaster at about $30bn.Not all of his big moves have come off. A $54bn bid for Walt Disney in 2004 that looked to marry Comcast’s distribution with Disney’s content was rejected by Disney. Comcast also came close to buying rival Time Warner Cable in 2014 with an all-share deal worth $42.5bn, but eventually withdrew the offer in the face of mounting regulatory opposition.His interest in Sky pits him against old sparring partners — Rupert Murdoch and his sons at Fox, and Bob Iger at Disney. He will know that the competition will be intense.
113;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-02-27T18:13:37Z;Comcast threatens Murdoch’s Sky bid with rival £22bn proposal;Approach by NBC parent sends UK broadcaster’s shares up 20%;"Rupert Murdoch’s plans to offload his entertainment empire to Walt Disney have been disrupted by Comcast, the US cable operator and owner of NBC Universal, which made an 11th-hour bid for Sky that values the pan-European media company at £22.1bn.Comcast’s bid could thwart Mr Murdoch’s long-held desire to acquire the 61 per cent of Sky his 21st Century Fox group does not already own. It also disrupts Mr Murdoch’s plans to sell Sky and the rest of Fox — except his Fox News Channel and primary sports network — to Disney in a $66bn deal designed to help it challenge technology heavyweights such as Amazon and Netflix and give it more leverage with cable groups such as Comcast.Comcast is already America’s largest provider of cable and broadband with 29m customers. Buying Sky would give it a powerful footprint in the UK, Germany and Italy, where Sky has 23m subscribers.Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, told the FT that Sky would give Comcast more scale and international heft, pointing to new digital competition from Silicon Valley. “With Facebook, Google and Apple, scale has been redefined,” Mr Roberts said.Comcast unveiled the proposed all-cash offer on Tuesday morning, valuing Sky at £12.50 per share, a 16 per cent premium to the £10.75 offer from Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. Shares in Sky soared 20.4 per cent to close at £13.30, well above Comcast’s offer price — an indication investors are anticipating a bidding war.The prospect of a fight sent Comcast’s New York-listed shares down 5.6 per cent to $37.53 in afternoon trading.The bid appeared to catch both Fox and Disney off guard; at the time of the announcement, Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, was in Paris meeting Emmanuel Macron, the French president, to unveil a $2.5bn expansion of Disneyland Paris. Disney declined to comment. Fox said it noted that no firm offer had been made by Comcast and it remained committed to its offer for Sky.Mr Roberts said he began sizing up Sky weeks ago after having his offer to acquire Mr Murdoch’s Fox assets spurned in favour of Disney late last year. His group’s offer was not dependent on Fox selling its 39 per cent stake, he added. “We would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50 per cent of the Sky shares,” he said.He added that Comcast decided to come forward with its offer so that it could begin the regulatory approval process and be ready to present a deal to Sky shareholders at around the same time as Fox, in June or July.Analysts questioned whether Sky was a good fit for Comcast, given the two use differing distribution networks. “The underlying technology here is satellite and Comcast will have to twist themselves into knots to explain why satellite distribution won’t be just as obsolete in Europe as it already is in the US,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson. He added there were also concerns the bid could lead Comcast back into the bidding for Fox.Analysts at Olivetree Securities said: “The next move will now be Disney/Fox’s to make. As things stand it is highly likely that Sky shareholders will have a competing proposal in front of them [from Comcast], which is both clean and superior, by the time they decide whether or not to back Fox’s takeover.”Sky had not been aware of Comcast’s plans to make a bid. Mr Roberts contacted Jeremy Darroch, Sky chief executive, and Martin Gilbert, the asset management executive and deputy chairman of Sky, only a few moment before Comcast unveiled its offer.Mr Roberts said the company had had no contact with members of the Murdoch family since deciding to move forward.In a short statement, Sky’s independent directors said they were “mindful of their fiduciary duties” and advised shareholders to take no action since there was no firm offer yet from Comcast.Mr Roberts told reporters Comcast had been monitoring Sky for some time. But he said he had been convinced of the merits of acquiring the company in November on a trip to London when a cab driver told him in great detail about the differences between Sky and its rival, Virgin Media, and saw a demonstration of the Sky Q set-top box in a shop. “We were terribly impressed,” he said.If Comcast succeeds, it will meld Sky with a portfolio of media businesses that includes Universal Studios, DreamWorks Animation, NBC cable channels and the NBC broadcast network, the home of shows such as Saturday Night Live, Today and Meet the Press.Its approach comes just under three years since its last attempt to consolidate the US cable industry with a $45bn deal for US-based Time Warner Cable was scuppered by fears that it would be blocked by regulators.Meanwhile, Fox has been attempting to navigate UK regulatory scrutiny of its Sky bid, as Mr Murdoch tries to avoid the fate of a deal he unsuccessfully tried to pull off in 2011. Its current deal with Sky was agreed in December 2016n.Earlier this month, Mr Murdoch’s company offered to take several steps to “guarantee” the independence of Sky News in order to overcome concerns of the UK competition watchdog that the deal could concentrate too much power with the media mogul.Mr Roberts said Comcast planned to use Sky as a launch pad to expand its European presence. The company said the deal, if agreed, would boost its international revenues to 25 per cent from 9 per cent.Comcast made several non-binding efforts to reassure the UK about its bid, including a promise to maintain Sky’s headquarters in Osterley, a suburb of west London. “The UK is and will remain a great place to do business,” it said.The company also said it intended to increase Sky’s investment in UK TV and film production and said it would “maintain Sky News’ existing brand and culture, as well as its strong record for high-quality impartial news and adherence to broadcasting standards”.Paul Richards, media analyst at Numis, said the Comcast offer was a “very good outcome for UK shareholders in Sky” as it reflected improvements in the business since Fox agreed in late 2016 to pay £18.5bn for the 61 per cent of the company it did not already own.While the Murdoch takeover has been held up by regulatory issues, Mr Richards said “what looked like a generous offer at the time from 21st Century Fox” had begun to seem less so. This was particularly the case since Sky struck a new deal to screen Premier League football games this month that will cut its annual bill by £200m and came with improved rights.Robey Warshaw, Evercore Partners and Bank of America are advising Comcast.Additional reporting by Naomi Rovnick in London"
114;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-02-27T10:58:26Z;Comcast/Sky: backseat bidder;The question is whether Fox will jump higher;One London cabbie has just earned the right to bore passengers as follows: “I had this American geezer in the back of the cab. Took him to the shops to have a look at getting Sky. Told him how good it is for the football. Stone me if he hasn’t offered £22bn for the whole company!”Bullish taxi drivers are a top-of-the-market phenomena. Comcast’s attempt to trump 21st Century Fox’s bid for the UK media company is on the high side at £12.50 per share in cash. The question is whether Fox — or Disney, which is buying most of that Murdoch-controlled US group — will go higher. A Sky share price of £13 shows the market thinks so.Happy days. Nothing suits stock market investors better than a testosterone-fuelled bid battle for an asset they are weary of. Sky is a good broadcaster and broadband group but too small to thrive independently. Fox’s 2016 bid at a 40 per cent premium for the 61 per cent it does not own looked generous because shares were weak.Fox surely hoped its long-held two-fifths stake in Sky would forestall competing bids. Brian Roberts, boss of Comcast and an atypically attentive taxi passenger, is calling that bluff. His own assumption must be that Fox or Disney would sell the stake if Comcast secures more than 50 per cent of Sky. Shared ownership of Sky would be fraught, particularly if it remained listed.Comcast and Disney are scrambling for content as media and telecoms consolidate. Disney’s agreed $66bn bid for the bulk of Fox is not dependent on inheriting the whole of Sky, though the Mouse would prefer it. Cord-cutting by US consumers makes Comcast, already owner of NBCUniversal, particularly needy. Challenged by structural changes at home, it is weak abroad. Owning Sky would take its foreign revenues from 9 per cent to 25 per cent of the total.The bid approach for Sky from the US cable giant is 16 per cent higher than the Fox offer. An enterprise value for Sky of almost £30bn, according to S&P Global data, is close to 13 times earnings before standard deductions. But Comcast’s net debt should still be below three times earnings.The scenario planning required of bidders and target would defeat even a cabbie skilled in plotting routes across gridlocked London. The outlook for Sky’s independent shareholders is plain. As a taxi driver might put it, they will all be minted.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters.

116;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-02-27T08:19:28Z;Opening Quote: £22bn plot twist in Sky original drama ;;Have you ever been watching a box set of your favourite noir-ish/dystopian/underworld TV drama on Sky Atlantic, when a plot twist so convoluted comes along that you think: “How on earth is this going to pan out?”.Well, that has just happened in real life in the plot of Sky plc’s proposed takeover.With 21st Century Fox’s bid for Sky still being reviewed by the UK Competition and Markets Authority — on concerns that ownership by a Murdoch family company might threaten media plurality, even though 21st Century Fox and its existing Sky TV stake is itself being acquired by Disney — the US cable group Comcast is now proposing a £22.1bn all-cash counter offer for Sky. Got that? No? Well, press pause and go an make a cup of tea. This morning, Comcast - the US media group comprising Comcast cable and NBC Universal - has announced an all-cash offer of £12.50 per share, which is 16 per cent more than he current 21st Century Fox bid.And, in somewhat combative dialogue, given the protracted CMA review of the current deal, Comcast says it is “confident in receiving all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner”. It has also provided reassurances about maintaining Sky’s UK’s operations with “a strong presence in the UK for the combined business” and “support for high broadcasting standards and news impartiality in the UK” - everything politicians and regulators had worried about with the Murdoch-Fox bid.It also suggests the deal would benefit Comcast's free cash flow in its first year.Brian L Roberts, very much the leading man out of central casting, as Comcast’s chairman and chief executive officer, said:“We would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50 per cent of the Sky shares. We are confident that we will be able to receive the necessary regulatory approvals… We already have a strong presence in London and Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for our growth in Europe. We intend to maintain and enhance Sky's business.”Adding Sky to Comcast’s existing businesses would diversify it considerably - taking international revenues from 9 per cent to 25 per cent. So what happens next? Well, Comcast wants to meet with the management and independent directors of Sky to discuss the proposal - and, the US group hopes, recommend it.Watch this space. Melrose Industries’ £7bn hostile bid for FTSE 100 engineer GKN was always going to turn political - given that the latter employs 56,000 people and supplies bits of fighter jets. No matter that 50,000 of those jobs are not in the UK, and those jets are American, Swedish and South African…So, last week, defence secretary Gavin Williamson wrote to business secretary Greg Clark - who has the power to call a public enquiry into such deals - expressing concern over Melrose’s offer. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the bidders of “a history of opportunistic asset-stripping”. And now trade union Unite has weighed in with claims that Melrose’s bosses made political donations in support of support of a Hard Brexit - proving they don’t care about endangering manufacturing jobs. If anything, though, it seems to prove that Godwin’s Law - that the longer an online discussion goes on, the greater the chance of someone mentioning Hitler - needs to be updated. To include Johnson or Farage. So what chance is there that GKN’s full-year results statement this morning is free from spin?Opening Quote offers the following translation “Management sales up 11% (organic sales up 6%), exceeding £10 billion for the first time.”Don’t mention profit or margin upfront.“Excluding £112 million North American Aerospace balance sheet review adjustments… operating profit (management basis) of £774 million (2016: £773 million).”Look, if you ignore the reason why profit is down, profit is technically up!“Reported profit before tax £658 million (2016: £292 million), a rise of 125%”How good is that? Don’t worry about operating profit falling 14 per cent. “Pensions progress - UK defined benefit scheme closed to future accrual, £250 million lump sum paid to reduce the deficit and the level of future deficit recovery payments.”Who knows what Melrose might do to the pension, eh Mr Corbyn? “New product segment strategy and Project Boost announced and being implemented”We’ll get to 11 per cent margins, better than Melrose’s 10 per cent. “Targeting up to £2.5 billion cash return to shareholders over the next three years”This is what’s in it for you, if you reject Melrose. “Aim to formally separate GKN Aerospace and GKN Driveline into two listed companies via a demerger in the middle of 2019.”Anything they can do , we can do better, we can do anything better than them… yes we can (no you can’t), yes we can ( no you can’t), yes we can, yes we can, yes we can!!!!!

And for Associated British Food’s Primark clothing chain, which is currently offering such “feels”, this is potentially a problem.

117;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-02-27T07:23:22Z;Comcast makes £22.1bn proposal to buy Sky;NBC parent says potential offer represents 16% premium to Fox deal;Comcast, the US cable operator and owner of NBC, has swooped in with a £22.1bn proposal for the UK’s Sky, in a move that challenges 21st Century Fox’s planned takeover of the company.The possible all-cash offer would value Sky at £12.50 per share, which would represent a 16 per cent premium to Fox’s offer, according to Comcast.Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, said “we would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50 per cent of the Sky shares.” He added that he is “confident” that the pact would win regulatory approval.Rupert Murdoch’s Fox earlier this month offered to take several steps to “guarantee” the independence of Sky News in order to overcome concerns of the UK competition watchdog that the deal could concentrate too much power with the media mogul.Mr Roberts said Comcast plans to use Sky as a launch pad to expand its European presence. The company said the deal, if agreed, would boost its international revenues to 25 per cent from 9 per cent.The news on Tuesday sent Sky’s shares rallying 18.3 per cent in early London trading to $13.07.“We think Sky is an outstanding company,” Mr Roberts said. “It has 23m customers, leading positions in the UK, Italy and Germany, and is a consistent innovator in its use of technology to deliver its customers a great experience.”Paul Richards, media analyst at Numis, said the Comcast offer was a “very good outcome for UK shareholders in Sky”, as it reflected improvements in the business since Fox agreed in late 2016 to pay £18.5bn for the 61 per cent of the company it did not already own.While the Murdoch takeover of Sky has been held up by regulatory issues, Mr Richards said, “what looked like a generous offer at the time from 21st Century Fox”, has begun to seem more austere. This was particularly the case since Sky struck a new deal to screen Premier League football games this month that will cut its annual bill by £200m and came with improved rights.“There was a feeling there would be sweetening of the deal [from 21st Century Fox],” Mr Richards said, pointing out that Sky’s share price, at £11.05 at the close of trade on Monday, was trading at a premium to the £10.75 price implied by Mr Murdoch’s offer.“With Comcast coming in at £12.50 a share, that’s a very strong competitive offer,” Mr Richards said.
118;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-01-30T20:15:47Z;Jamie Dimon’s longevity at JPMorgan leads to itchy feet below him;Veteran banker is popular with investors and seen as a potential political candidate;"Last week at Davos, Jamie Dimon worked the crowds in a black shirt and jeans, fuelling speculation that the chief executive and chairman of the biggest bank in America was getting tired of the old routine.On Monday, JPMorgan Chase firmly doused rumours that Mr Dimon was considering a run for political office, by announcing that the 61-year-old had committed himself to the top job for another five years or so.If Mr Dimon is still there in 2023, he will have served 17 years at the helm of the biggest American bank by assets. He might even outlast other grizzled veterans such as Lloyd Blankfein, who became Goldman Sachs’ CEO in 2006. Both men have endured treatment for cancer. “They’ll take him out in a coffin,” quips one rival banker. Along the way, Mr Dimon has seen significant churn among the executives beneath him, a problem that could grow worse now that he has signed on for five more years.The long list of leavers who have voted with their feet since he took the helm in 2006 includes Frank Bisignano, Steve Black and Charlie Scharf, who all took big jobs in US financial services. Bill Winters and Jes Staley are now running UK banks Standard Chartered and Barclays, respectively.Mike Cavanagh, who had a lot of clout inside and outside JPMorgan and was once considered the most likely candidate to replace Mr Dimon, left for private equity in 2014 and is now the finance chief of Comcast, the world’s largest cable TV company.Having spent 34 years at JPMorgan, Jes Staley eventually left in 2013 to join a hedge fund after accepting that he would never succeed Mr Dimon. He had already stopped running JPMorgan’s investment bank and moved to a more hands-off role as the division’s chairman. The two are still close and Mr Dimon called to support Mr Staley over a whistleblower controversy in his new job as chief executive of Barclays.Matt Zames, the former hedge fund trader who helped JPMorgan clean up the $6bn London Whale loss, left the bank last June. He claimed he wanted to run his own business, but analysts suggested he had grown tired of waiting for an opportunity for promotion. He has since returned to his alma mater MIT as an “Executive in Residence” at its finance school.Although widely credited with helping JPMorgan to avoid the big losses on US subprime mortgage securities that hit many rivals, Bill Winters was pushed out as head of its investment bank in 2009 after falling out with Jamie Dimon over his boss’s management style and investments made by the bank. His departure still rankles, even after Mr Winters became chief executive of London-listed Standard Chartered in 2015.By now, Mr Dimon has a bit of a history, which may explain the careful choreography of the moves announced on Monday.In addition to confirming that Mr Dimon would stay on for “approximately” five more years, the bank announced that Gordon Smith, 59, and Daniel Pinto, 55, heads of the consumer and investment-banking businesses respectively, would be promoted to co-president and co-chief operating officer. Mr Dimon also paid tribute to the “outstanding work” of three younger executives — CFO Marianne Lake, asset-management head Mary Erdoes and Doug Petno, commercial-banking head. Analysts and insiders say all three could be strong contenders for the top spot by 2023.“He’s elevated the older generation and teed up the next one,” says Jason Goldberg, analyst at Barclays.Mr Dimon is popular with many investors. They say they like his no-nonsense manner, his habit of taking public positions on behalf of the banking industry, and his refusal to be bullied by politicians and regulators. Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, recounted a visit from Mr Dimon to her Capitol Hill office in 2013, in her book, A Fighting Chance. He was there to discuss whether JPMorgan would be among the first targets of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new body born of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. “Hit me with a fine,” he said. “We can afford it.” Michael Cavanagh joined JPMorgan in 2004 and has had an eventful four years since he stepped down as co-head of its corporate and investment bank in 2014. His first destination was private equity group Carlyle. Then, in May 2015, he ditched Wall Street to become chief financial officer of US telecoms group Comcast where he was paid more than $40m for his first eight months. He remains in that role today.Former Citi executive Frank Bisignano was the man Jamie Dimon turned to in 2011 for the unenviable task of fixing the bank’s stricken mortgage division in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He left his post as co-chief operating officer two years later, to become chief executive of payment processor First Data, a role he still holds (along with First Data chairman, which he added in 2014).The 52 year-old New Yorker, now chief executive at BNY Mellon, Charles Scharf was a loyal lieutenant to Mr Dimon before leaving in June 2011 after nine years as head of the retail financial services unit. He began his career as Mr Dimon’s assistant at Commercial Credit in the late 1980s, before rising to CFO of Citi’s corporate and investment banking unit.The bank’s profits have been solid. Mr Dimon likes to boast that his $2.5tn-in-assets bank never lost money, even for a single quarter, in the financial crisis, or during the “London Whale” scandal that saw it drop $6bn on botched trades. Last year the bank’s return on tangible common equity was best among the big US banks at 12 per cent, edging ahead of scandal-stricken Wells Fargo.There is also real fondness for Mr Dimon among some of the bank’s 243,000 employees. One mid-level analyst who quit to join the military remembers getting a call from the CEO on his final day, thanking him for his service and promising him a job if it didn’t work out. “He'd step into an elevator and know the names of 70 per cent of the people in it,” says one former top lieutenant. Some predict that Mr Dimon will be drawn into politics before long. The CEO’s history of political donations — as tracked by opensecrets.org — suggests he leans to Democrats. But he was approached by President Donald Trump’s transition team as a potential Treasury Secretary in the new Republican administration. Mr Dimon said he was “unsuited” to the role, according to a person familiar with discussions. One confidant was not surprised by Mr Dimon’s reluctance, noting that he has not had a boss since Sandy Weill, his old mentor at Citigroup, 20 years ago. (Mr Dimon was pushed out of Citi in 1998 after falling out with Mr Weill, and moved to Bank One, which later was acquired by JPMorgan.) “I think it’s terrific that Jamie has announced that he will continue to lead JPMorgan for the next five years,” says Mr Weill, who stood down from the CEO job at Citi aged 70. “Jamie has done an outstanding job and the financial services industry is lucky to have his leadership.”The unflappable chief financial officer started out at PwC before joining JPMorgan in London, where she rose to chief financial officer of the credit trading business. She had a ringside seat during the financial crisis, as global controller of the investment bank, and came to the group CFO role in 2013 via a stint as finance chief of the consumer bank. Observers say that the 48-year-old seems well placed to mount a strong challenge for the top spot within a few years, but needs exposure to business units before she does so.Most of the 5,200 companies that came together to form JPMorgan are wrapped up in the consumer unit run by Gordon Smith. The 59-year-old British executive, known for his dry delivery at the annual investor day, joined the bank in 2007 after a long career at American Express, latterly as president of the global commercial card business. Along with Mr Pinto, he assumed responsibility for technology across the bank, following the departure last summer of Matt Zames. He is due to take on the roles of co-president and co-chief operating officer.Few JPMorgan executives can compete with Daniel Pinto’s 35-year-legacy at the bank. He began as a 20-year-old financial analyst in Buenos Aires, before going on to bigger jobs in the Latam region, and moving to London in 1996 to oversee key emerging markets. Sharp, incisive and studiously low profile, the 55-year-old Argentine became co-chief executive of the corporate & investment bank in 2012 and then its sole CEO in 2014. He is JPMorgan’s point person on Brexit. He is due to take on the roles of co-president and co-chief operating officer.Publicly, Mr Dimon keeps stressing his patriotism, saying that while he may not see eye-to-eye with Mr Trump on all things, he tries to stay supportive. As he joked in a town hall address to MBA students at JPMorgan last year: “When you get on the aeroplane, you’d better be rooting for the success of the pilot.” Mr Dimon has talked at length about how ""something is wrong"" with America, while pouring scorn on the country’s record of financing big infrastructure projects. Last week, talking to CNBC, he savaged “bureaucracy and corruption and sinecure,” saying he was “ashamed” that it took so long to build a bridge between Bayonne, New Jersey and Staten Island, New York.Don’t rule out Dimon 2024 — and some think he might run on a populist platform.“This idea that the five-year commitment takes him out of running for president is obviously rubbish,” says someone who knows him well. The scruffy look in Davos “showed me he wants to disassociate himself with everything that place represents”."

120;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Comcast tops estimates on growth in cable and broadband;;Comcast’s fourth-quarter revenue and profits topped Wall Street’s estimates thanks to growth in its cable and broadband business and its NBCUniversal media arm and the US’s sweeping tax overhaul.The biggest US cable provider reported net income soared to $15bn, or $3.17 a share, from $2.3bn, or 48 cents a share, a year ago, mostly due to the impact of the corporate tax cut. Excluding adjustments including tax reform, earnings rose from 45 cents to 49 cents a share, ahead of the 48 cents analysts expected, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Revenue rose 4 per cent to $21.9bn, ahead of forecasts of $21.8bn, due to growth at the distribution business, NBC’s television networks, and the company’s theme parks.Comcast said it would funnel some of the windfall from the US tax overhaul to shareholders. It raised its annualised dividend 21 per cent to 76 cents a share this year, higher than 2017’s 11 per cent bump and “more than it otherwise would have been” without the impact of tax reform, said Mike Cavanagh, chief financial officer.The company plans to repurchase at least $5bn in shares this year, in line with last year’s level. Total dividends and share buybacks in 2017 totalled $7.9bn.In the cable and internet business, Comcast’s biggest source of revenue and profits, sales rose 3 per cent in the final three months of the year to $13.3bn. Adjusted earnings were up 4 per cent at $5.4bn. Customer additions slowed to 243,000 from 259,000 a year ago, as losses of video and voice subscribers somewhat offset gains in subscriptions to high-speed internet and security and automation services. But average revenue per customer relationship ticked up 0.7 per cent to $151.49.NBCUniversal revenue rose 4 per cent to $8.8bn and adjusted earnings gained 6 per cent to $1.9bn. Sales rose at cable networks, broadcast television and theme parks, but declined at the Universal Studios film unit.The TV advertising business remained under pressure: broadcast sales were down 7 per cent at $1.9bn. Cable ad sales rose 2 per cent to $878m.For the full year of 2017, Comcast’s revenue rose 5 per cent to $84.5bn, compared with analysts’ forecasts of $84.4bn. Net income jumped to $22.7bn, or $4.75 a share, from $8.7bn, or $1.78 a share, including the tax changes. Stripping that out, earnings of $2.06 beat Wall Street’s estimates of $2.04.
121;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2018-01-11T20:00:09Z;NBC expects $1.4bn in ad sales revenue from Super Bowl, Winter Olympics;;NBC expects to take in $1.4bn from advertisers eager to reach viewers of the Super Bowl and winter Olympics next month, up from its previous estimate of $1.1bn.The Comcast-owned US television network has a rare opportunity: it will air the National Football League championship on February 4 and just five days later will begin Olympics coverage from Pyeongchang, South Korea.“This is the first time in history one media company has had both events so close together,” said Dan Lovinger, who heads advertising sales at NBC’s sports group, in a call with reporters on Thursday.NBC expects Olympics ad sales will exceed $900m over the 18 days of the games, meaning revenue from spots sold during the Super Bowl and its pre and postgame coverage is anticipated to hit about $500m.Mr Lovinger said the network was selling 30 second Super Bowl ads for an average of more than $5m. That is about what advertisers paid during last year’s broadcast on CBS.About a third of the advertisers NBC is working with are buying spots for both events, Mr Lovinger said.
122;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T19:53:04+0000;Hedge fund chief Dalio questions value of tax cuts;Companies welcome reform but doubts remain over long-term impact on growth;After some leading companies promised to invest some of their expected windfall from tax reforms in the US, critics have questioned whether the changes would provide any long-term boost to growth.President Donald Trump said in a statement that the shake-up of the tax system would mean “pouring rocket fuel into the engine of our economy”. But many analysts have suggested it will provide only a temporary boost to growth.Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the hedge fund, wrote in a blog post that the tax plan would “have some minor positive longer-term impacts”. However, he added: “By and large it doesn’t deal with the impediments that are holding back investment and productivity in the US economy”.Within hours of the $1.5tn tax cut passing the Senate and the House of Representatives, several companies — some with an interest in winning support from the administration — had announced plans to pass on some of their gains. Two of the biggest US banks, Wells Fargo and Fifth Third, said they would reward thousands of employees through bonuses and pay rises.AT&T, Boeing and Comcast were among those announcing investments in the US which they attributed to the tax overhaul, following a planned cut in the headline corporate income tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent.The amounts pledged were incremental rather than transformative. AT&T, which is pushing for government approval of its takeover of Time Warner, said it would pay 200,000 US employees $1,000 each, while increasing its budget for capital spending in the US next year by $1bn. That is less than 5 per cent of its budgeted capital spending of $22bn for 2017.The company has also in the past suggested in would increase investment as a result of the end of net neutrality rules, which the Federal Communications Commission voted to scrap earlier this month.Boeing, the defence contractor and aircraft maker involved in one of the White House’s most high profile tariff battles, pledged to spend an extra $100m on charity and another $200m on programmes to improve training and working conditions. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, said the tax changes would help it compete with global rivals while unleashing “economic energy” in the US.Comcast, which is also a beneficiary of the end of net neutrality, said it expected to invest “well in excess” of $50bn over the next five years as a result of the rule change and the tax cut. Depending on its precise decisions on investment, that could mean a step up of about 5 per cent from its expected capital spending of about $9.5bn this year.Often more quietly than the announcements of wage rises, bonuses and investment plans, companies have also been promising share buybacks and dividend payments as other uses for their tax windfalls. Boeing earlier this month raised its dividend by 30 per cent and announced a new $14bn share repurchase authorisation.Pfizer on Monday added a further $10bn share repurchase authorisation to the $6.4bn that remained under its previous programme.By and large [the tax plan] doesn’t deal with the impediments that are holding back investment and productivity in the US economyWells, the third-biggest US bank by assets, said it would hand out restricted stock awards to about 250,000 employees, while boosting its minimum wage from $13.50 to $15 an hour, from March. The bank also said it would target $400m in charity donations next year, up about 40 per cent from this year.Similarly, Fifth Third, a Cincinnati-based bank with $142bn in assets, said it would pay more than 13,500 employees a $1,000 bonus while raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Senior managers and top executives would not receive a special payment, it said.Fifth Third stands to benefit from a bill which would lift the threshold for designating a bank as “systemically important”, a status which puts banks under heightened supervision from the Federal Reserve. The bill, which has been approved by the Senate banking committee, should be taken up by the full Senate in the first couple of months of 2018. While Wells Fargo would be unaffected by that legislation, the bank remains keen to repair its image on Capitol Hill. Last year it paid a record fine to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allowing staff to open millions of accounts that customers may not have authorised, and it has since been rapped by regulators over several other lapses. Wells is set to be the biggest beneficiary of tax reform among the big US retail banks, according to Richard Ramsden, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. He expects the new regime will boost Wells’ earnings per share by 17 per cent next year, compared to 14 per cent for Bank of America, 12 per cent for JPMorgan Chase and 8 per cent for Citigroup. 
123;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-12-21T14:23:45Z;Disney puts Sky shareholders on rollercoaster ride;A bid, regulatory reviews, another bid — have any investors had as many ups and downs this year?;A bid followed by a regulatory review, a government referral, then another regulatory review — and then another bid. Have any investors had as rollercoaster a year as Sky shareholders?This time last year, investors in the television and broadband provider were digesting an £11.7bn offer from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox for shares in Sky not already owned by the company. A year later, that bid has yet to be approved by the UK government despite months of scrutiny by two British regulators, Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority.Then this month, after weeks of speculation, Walt Disney confirmed that it had agreed a $66bn deal for Fox’s entertainment assets — including Fox’s 39 per cent stake in Sky. That is where things get a little confusing for Sky shareholders.First they have to wait for the outcome of the CMA regulatory review sometime in the first half of 2018 to learn whether Fox will be cleared to own 100 per cent of the company. In that case Disney would ultimately end up as the 100 per cent owner of Sky, assuming its own bid for Fox is cleared by US regulators.But the first outcome is not guaranteed. The CMA has received a flood of submissions from opponents of the Fox-Sky takeover. They have pointed to, among other things, Fox’s handling of the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News Channel. If the CMA and Karen Bradley, the UK culture secretary, decide to block the Fox-Sky deal, Sky shareholders face the prospect of being locked out of the Disney-Fox deal.This is because Disney has not committed to mounting a bid for the rest of the Sky shares in the event that Fox’s Sky takeover is blocked.Under UK Takeover Panel rules, a company acquiring a stake of 30 per cent or more in a company would normally be obliged to make a bid for the rest of the shares. Disney is buying Fox’s 39 per cent in Sky so it will cross that threshold.But Disney has told the panel the rule should not apply in this case. The company has declined to comment on its plans for Sky, although it has not ruled out making a full bid. But if the Takeover Panel agrees with Disney, the entertainment company could decide to stick with the 39 per cent Sky stake it will acquire as part of its Fox transaction. Assuming, again, that the Disney-Fox deal is cleared by US regulators, which is not a sure thing.Where does this leave Sky shareholders? Unfortunately it is too early to say. The Takeover Panel may decide to ignore Disney’s request and force it to bid for all of Sky: the watchdog will come to a decision at some point in the new year.If the panel does not force Disney to bid for all the shares and the CMA and Ms Bradley block the Fox-Sky deal, do not rule out another buyer for Sky entering the fray. US cable provider Comcast had a good look at Fox’s entertainment assets after Fox’s talks with Disney became public but backed off when it became clear that Fox and Mr Murdoch were intent on selling to Disney. Comcast may yet return for the 61 per cent stake in Sky not owned by Fox if the Fox-Sky deal hits regulatory buffers.As America’s largest cable operator, Comcast has reached maturity in its domestic market, having snapped up a succession of cable systems. It tried — and failed— to buy Time Warner Cable three years ago, withdrawing its $45bn offer when it became clear US regulators were going to block it. Sky would give it an international footprint and 23m subscribers across seven countries which it could use to promote and distribute content produced by NBCUniversal, which it owns. But there may be too many “what ifs” in this scenario for it to come to pass. Having struck an agreed offer with Fox, Disney is clearly in the driving seat.Disney has plenty of incentives to get its hands on Sky. The US entertainment group is building streaming services that will make its sports and family content available to people all over the world. Sky could carry these services or offer them as part of a bundle to its subscribers, helping Disney build a streaming business that could one day rival Netflix for size.But it is likely to be several months before Sky shareholders receive the clarity they want. Their rollercoaster ride is not over yet.Matthew.Garrahan@ft.comThis article has been amended to clarify Disney’s discussions with the UK Takeover Panel. The company believes the full bid rule does not apply.
124;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-12-17T18:00:13Z;Fund claims Sky investors could lose out in Disney-Fox deal;Tie-up could cost minority shareholders in the UK group a hefty premium, says;A hedge fund with a small stake in Sky has complained that Walt Disney’s takeover of 21st Century Fox could cost minority shareholders in the UK satellite broadcaster a hefty premium unless the regulator intervenes.The Takeover Panel is reviewing a request from Disney that it should be exempt from rules that would force it to make a mandatory bid for Sky if competition regulators decide to block the existing £10.75-a-share offer from Fox for the UK company.UK takeover rules, specifically Rule 9.1 of the Takeover Code, state that a business that acquires more than 30 per cent of shares of a public company is obliged to make an offer for the rest of the business to ensure minority shareholders get a fair price.Disney, which declined to comment, will acquire 100 per cent of Sky if Fox’s attempted purchase of the European media company is cleared by UK regulators.But it is unclear what it will do if the Fox purchase of the shares it does not own in Sky is blocked. Fox at present owns a 39 per cent stake in Sky, which Disney will acquire if its bid for Fox is approved by US regulators.Reade Griffith, co-founder of the Polygon hedge fund which owns less than 1 per cent of Sky, has contacted the Takeover Panel to argue that Disney’s acquisition of the Sky stake represents “a significant purpose” of the overall Fox takeover and that the mandatory obligation to bid for the rest of the shares should apply to protect minority Sky shareholders.He cited comments from Bob Iger, Disney’s chairman and chief executive, about Sky as evidence that the UK business is one of the main drivers for the overall Fox deal. Mr Iger told Bloomberg that Sky was a “crown jewel” in the Fox assets.Mr Griffith argued that Sky investors would be entitled to a higher premium than the Fox offer had Disney bought its 39.1 per cent holding directly but that the two companies have been careful not to put an exact value on the stake directly.“The Fox and the Mouse have been more clever than that. They have included the Sky stake into a box full of other attractive Fox assets and tied it up with a bow and ribbon and told the Takeover Panel [that] Rule 9.1 does not apply and therefore no premium is warranted to minorities,” he said.But a person with knowledge of the regulatory discussions said Disney had to let the Fox-Sky bid play out. Anything else would be “gun-jumping,” the person said.“This is between Fox and the regulator,” said one person briefed on the regulatory discussions. “Disney’s offer for Fox is not conditional on the Sky bid being approved.”They have included the Sky stake into a box full of other attractive Fox assets and tied it up with a bow and ribbon and told the Takeover Panel [that] Rule 9.1 does not apply and therefore no premium is warranted to minoritiesBruno Burki, an analyst with Square Global Markets, said the Disney-Fox deal has been structured so that Disney would not find itself in a position where it was subject to the mandatory offer situation.The Takeover Panel is contacting Sky’s independent directors to seek their views before reaching a final determination on the issue.The fate of Sky has been up in the air as Fox’s offer has been the subject of an extended regulatory review although Disney’s proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s assets, including the 39 per cent stake in Sky, has eased fears of the deal being blocked.Fox still expects to complete the deal by June. Sky’s share price closed at £10.06 last week, below the existing offer. Polygon said that, if Disney loses the argument that it would not be bound by the Takeover Code to make a mandatory offer for Sky, it should be offering “above £13 a share”.The hedge fund’s intervention could be the first signs of a rebellion against the original Fox deal to push for a premium from Disney.Mr Burki said minority investors were “uniquely positioned to exert leverage” for a higher price if regulators clear the Fox deal and it would be no surprise to see “some sort of activism” next year.
125;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-12-11T22:55:34Z;Comcast drops out of the running for 21st Century Fox assets;;Comcast has dropped out of the race for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment and international assets, paving the way for Walt Disney to acquire a significant chunk of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.Comcast said in a statement: “When a set of assets like 21st Century Fox’s becomes available, it’s our responsibility to evaluate if there’s a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders. That’s what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.”Comcast, the US’s largest cable company, expressed interest in Fox’s assets after reports emerged in November that Disney and Fox had engaged in potential sale talks earlier this year. Disney and Fox restarted those talks recently.The transaction would see Disney take over Fox’s movie studio, cable channels, international units — namely Sky in Europe and Star India — and regional US sports networks in a deal expected to carry an enterprise value of more than $60bn.Comcast’s withdrawal was first reported by Reuters.
126;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-12-05T22:56:46Z;Fast Asia Open: Australia Q3 GDP, Malaysia trade data;;James Murdoch has been suggested as a potential successor to Walt Disney chief executive Bob Iger in deal discussions with the US media company over the sale of 21st Century Fox entertainment assets.Disney is leading the race to acquire Fox’s movie studio, cable channels, international units — namely Sky in Europe and Star India — and regional US sports networks in a deal expected to carry an enterprise value of more than $60bn, these people said.Comcast, the US cable operator, and Verizon, the US telecoms group, are also in the hunt for the Fox assets.

127;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-12-04T08:18:55Z;Opening Quote: Sky – the Magic Kingdom of Isleworth?;;Sky’s future ownership looks uncertain (again), as news that 21st Century Fox may yet sell its 39 per cent stake to Disney means Isleworth could still end up as part of the Magic Kingdom.Reports at the weekend suggested that Rupert Murdoch’s Fox had resumed talks over the sale of its entertainment and international assets — including its holding in the UK and European pay-TV company. Although initial discussions between the two sides ended last month, they are now back on, according to people with knowledge of the situation. And, if a deal were agreed for Disney to buy Fox’s entertainment assets, these would include the Sky stake but not preclude the continuation of a Disney-owned Fox’s bid for the rest of the shares.In practical terms though, a UK regulatory decision on the Fox-Sky deal may come before – or overlap with – any US regulatory decision on Disney-Fox.Fox’s attempt to complete a takeover of Sky — the second time in a decade it has tried to buy the company in which it holds that 39 per cent stake — has run into regulatory delays, with the UK Competition and Markets Authority scrutinising the deal following months of review by Ofcom, the UK media watchdog. Sky has since threatened to close its Sky News network if the deal is not cleared.Comcast, the US cable group that owns NBCUniversal, and Verizon, the telecoms operator, have also expressed interest in Fox’s entertainment assets. Fox’s discussions with potential buyers have been driven by an acknowledgment that it lacks the scale or breadth of content to compete with technology groups that have built global digital streaming businesses.Disney’s willingness to talk appeared to have been based on the content it could gain from Fox’s movie studio and cable channels and the direct customer relationships it could gain from Sky’s subscription TV businesses across Europe.Facebook’s expansion of its UK recruitment plans means there is another part of London that may also become a little more, er, like California: Rathbone Square in London’s West End.Apparently, the US social network so beloved of smug narcissists and intelligence agency subversives needs to hire 800 more “high tech” employees than expected – making the UK capital its biggest engineering hub outside the US.This more than doubling of Facebook’s London staffing comes despite some technology executives warning that Brexit is limiting the ability of UK businesses to hire skilled coders and developers.Nicola Mendelsohn, vice-president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said the decision indicated Facebook was “more committed than ever to the UK”.“The UK’s flourishing entrepreneurial ecosystem and international reputation for engineering excellence makes it one of the best places in the world to build a tech company,” she added.Rio Tinto, the London-listed miner, has also finished rearranging the new chairs in its offices: it has ended a nine-month search for a new chairman by appointing Simon Thompson, one of its non-executive directors, to the post.Mr Thompson, a Briton who also chairs UK private equity group 3i, will take up the position in March, when Jan du Plessis steps down.Anglo-Australian group Rio has been looking for a new chairman since March, when Mr du Plessis announced he was stepping down to join BT Group. He had been chairman for almost nine years.Mick Davis, the former boss of Xstrata, looked set to the get the job, until a group of big shareholders blocked his appointment. Those shareholders in Rio told the Financial Times last week that Mr Thompson would be a good choice as chairman, citing his experience of the resources industry and the boardroomMr Thompson ran the base metals division of Anglo American between 2001 and 2004 and was the chairman of Tullow Oil for five years until April.And, finally, some less welcome Anglo-Australian news: it’s the Opening Quote Ashes update – as if you needed it.Second Test, Adelaide: England 219-8 (72 overs), trail Australia by 223 runs with 2 wickets remaining.Prevailing sentiment: Should have taken odds on 5-0 series defeat when they were as long as 7-2.FT Opening Quote, with commentary by Matthew Vincent, is your early Square Mile briefing.

As a result, we’ve decided to terminate his employment.”Mr Lack said it was “the first complaint about Mr Lauer’s behavior in the over twenty years” but added the network was “also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident”.Mr Lauer’s dismissal will be a severe blow for NBC, which is owned by Comcast, the US cable operator. He has been among the network’s most bankable stars, hosting its Olympics coverage as well as being the face of its money spinning breakfast show – one of its most successful franchises – for several years.Image source: Getty
129;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
130;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-11-23T18:13:27Z;Net neutrality rules are worth keeping — for now;Competition and technology have not yet made the regulations obsolete;Fairness and equal treatment are not always the same. It is not fair to pay a star worker the same as an incompetent one, for example. But equality always has a nice ring of justice to it, which creates a problem for Ajit Pai, the chairman of the US Federal Communications Committee and a Donald Trump appointee.Mr Pai wants to roll back the “net neutrality” regulations passed by Mr Trump’s predecessor. The rules require that America’s internet service providers — telcos such as AT&T and Verizon, and cable companies such as Comcast and Charter — treat all types of internet traffic the same. “Fast lanes” for favoured companies (or the ISP’s own content) are forbidden, as is throttling back the unfavoured.The arguments for keeping the rules in place are vivid. Very large companies — Google, Netflix, Facebook, and so on — could afford to pay for blazing-fast service from the ISPs. Smaller competitors could not, putting them at a disadvantage and entrenching the vast incumbents even more.The spending power of big tech companies has already given them superior access to the customer. Their computers are linked directly into the ISP’s networks, giving them a huge speed advantage. Many maintain internet cables of their own. Big tech is already driving in a fast lane. Rolling back net neutrality can only increase this advantage.ISPs could also disadvantage products that competed with their own offerings — most obviously video streaming products that compete with the expensive pay TV bundles offered by all the ISPs. Comcast has stated that it would not block or throttle any lawful content if the rules are lifted. But this is meaningless. For the purposes of competition, there is no difference between speeding up one class of content and slowing down another.Only half of American households have more than one ISP to choose from. Most of the rest are served by lazy duopoliesThe FCC recognises this risk, and argues that customers offered a two-speed internet will defect to other ISPs, and that beefed-up antitrust enforcement will prevent the worst offences. These are not strong arguments. Only half of American households have more than one ISP to choose from. Most of the rest are served by lazy duopolies.Superior wireless internet technology may enrich the competitive environment before long. For now, though, consumers are mostly stuck with what their ISP gives them. Better antitrust enforcement would be welcome, but takes too long to protect many fragile tech start-ups.The FCC is however quite right to point out that the equal treatment mandated by net neutrality creates unfairness. Just two companies, Netflix and YouTube, consume half of internet bandwidth. Yet the ISPs are not allowed to make them pay a toll for hogging the road. If they could, they could use the additional revenue on infrastructure improvements.The service provided by the ISPs has made staggering profits possible for big tech. Why should consumers, and not the tech companies themselves, pay the bill for that service? And if the next innovation — think of driverless cars— requires dedicated superfast connections to be useful and safe, it would surely make sense for the companies that will profit from that innovation to pay for the network that supports it.The dilemma is real. The best scenario is that better technology and increased ISP competition makes net neutrality obsolete. Encouraging such competition should be a policy priority. The US is not there yet, though. A weakly regulated ISP oligopoly could make already dominant tech companies invulnerable. The imperfect net neutrality rules should remain in place a little while longer.
131;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-11-22T18:55:57Z;Partisan passions cloud debate on US net neutrality;Broadband and media markets remain resilient even as FCC moves to scrap 2015 regulations;For an issue that provokes such strong partisan support in Washington and competitive rivalry in the tech, media and communications industries, it is remarkably hard to trace the real-world effects of net neutrality.The arcane rules of network management — how broadband companies handle different types of traffic on their networks — have always been impenetrable to non-engineers. Add in the passions stirred up by grass roots campaigns in Silicon Valley and beyond, the reality has been hard to separate from the ideologically opposed positions.“It’s a wildly popular topic — it has always generated millions of comments,” says Chris Lewis, vice-president of Public Knowledge, one of the advocacy groups that has pushed for rules they say are needed to make sure the internet remains “open”.After the latest outpouring, the Federal Communications Commission moved a step closer this week to a decisive action, with a promise to scrap neutrality regulations that were set in 2015. That would free US broadband companies to favour some bits that flow through their networks over others, provided they are open about their practices and do not breach antitrust rules.More than 22m submissions poured into the agency during a public comment period on the proposal this year. But many, it turns out, were faked.According to FCC officials, some 7.5m comments came in the same standard letter, sent from just 45,000 email addresses. Most of these were anonymised, having been processed through a website called fakemailgenerator.com.In response, the FCC said it had disregarded the tidal wave of submissions, both fake and real, and made “quality rather than quantity” its yardstick.That brought complaints from opponents, who saw this as a convenient way for the agency to disregard a wave of public opposition. Organisations like Public Knowledge have been part of highly successful grassroots campaigns in the past to generate support for neutrality, raising suggestions that the fake comments were designed to neutralise a groundswell of real opposition to the FCC.Eric Schneiderman, New York’s Democratic attorney-general, appeared to hold the same suspicion this week, complaining that his own attempt to get to the bottom of the issue had been blocked by the Republican-controlled FCC. A spokesman for Mr Schneiderman said the fake comments tended to support the FCC’s position.Brushing aside the weight of public commentary, the FCC said it had narrowed in on what it considered the real issue: that the neutrality rules, by preventing network companies from charging for different levels of services, had discouraged investment in broadband networks. According to officials, at least one big cable company, Charter, had scrapped a plan for a new wireless network purely because of net neutrality rules.However, its detailed analysis of the decision, released on Wednesday, provided only slight support for this position. Broadband investment “appears to have declined in 2015”, when neutrality rules were adopted, it said, before falling just 3 per cent the next year.Officials also said that forcing companies to treat all bits flowing over their networks equally had held back innovation. As one example, they said that data flowing in real time to autonomous vehicles will require greater reliability than movies on Netflix.According to critics, allowing companies to charge more for different levels of service like this — setting up what critics call “internet fast lanes” — would lead to an inevitable deterioration for anyone not able to pay the toll. And while rich companies like Netflix and Google might not be affected, new internet upstarts would be hampered. Etsy, the website for craft goods that has been one of the strongest opponents of the FCC’s position, summed up the opposition this week: “Strong net neutrality rules are necessary to preserve an even playing field online, democratising entrepreneurship and allowing internet-enabled microbusinesses from nearly every county across the US to thrive.”The almost theological certainty on both sides, however, is belied by the reaction of Wall Street, which seems to have concluded that the outcome of the net neutrality wars will have little impact on real-world broadband and media markets.In the past three years, the regulatory climate in Washington has swung between extremes — from a court throwing out FCC-backed neutrality rules, to the imposition of a far more stringent set of regulations, and back to a laissez-faire approach. But in that time, the share prices of cable, telecoms and media companies have barely reacted to this whipsawing.The Brookings Institution mapped share prices in the sector against regulatory actions, concluding that only the three big cable companies at the time — Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter — were affected by President Barack Obama’s 2014 promise to regulate the sector more stringently. But telecoms companies were unaffected, leading the researchers to suggest that it was worry about a bar on more consolidation in the cable sector, rather than net neutrality rules themselves, that had unnerved investors.Meanwhile, shares in Netflix, which is often held up as the company most directly at risk from the end of net neutrality, have been on a tear since last year’s presidential election. Netflix agreed to pay Comcast higher traffic costs three years ago. The companies last year buried the hatchet completely, with a deal to make the streaming movie service available directly over Comcast’s set top boxes. Partisan passions aside, that suggests the effects of the FCC’s latest action may be less dramatic than widely expected.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in Washington
132;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-11-21T21:11:58Z;Trump administration plans to scrap net neutrality;Proposal to end Obama-era rules is a victory for cable and telecom companies;The Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission capped more than a decade of wrangling on Tuesday with a plan to sweep away all the rules preventing US broadband companies from favouring some types of internet traffic over others.Ajit Pai, chairman of the agency, said it would vote in December on a proposal to scrap Obama-era regulations that bar network owners from slowing or blocking traffic, or charging more for internet “fast lanes”.Mr Pai had made the reversal of the so-called net neutrality rules, adopted in 2015, the centrepiece of his promise to “fire up the weed whacker” to cut through US communications and media regulations. Republican commissioners hold a three-two majority, paving the way for formal adoption before the end of the year.The expected move marks a significant victory for telecoms and cable companies, led by AT&T, Verizon and Comcast, who have argued for years that US attempts at regulation have unfairly tied their hands and reduced the incentive to invest in new networks. It was widely attacked by big internet companies, internet activists and grassroots organisations.The ending of net neutrality, if completed, will be a highlight of the Trump administration’s promise to roll back what it claims are burdensome and unnecessary regulations. But the news comes in a week when the justice department has taken a more activist stance than it showed under the last administration, filing a lawsuit against AT&T to block the telecom company’s planned purchase of Time Warner.Mr Pai said that broadband companies would still have to disclose whether they block or throttle some types of traffic, or if they create “fast lanes” for some customers — known as paid prioritisation — or give preferential treatment to their in-house services. He added that the information would enable consumers to choose between broadband providers, though only around half of US households have access to two or more high speed internet services.Comcast, the largest US cable company, welcomed the changes and repeated an earlier promise not to “block, throttle or discriminate against lawful content”. That appeared to leave the door open to charging other companies more for guaranteeing delivery of their traffic.FCC officials said that “fast lanes” on the internet would lead to more innovation, for instance by making sure that critical data from autonomous cars or home health monitoring systems had priority over films from Netflix. But critics have argued that charging for guaranteed service levels like this will lead to higher prices for consumers and a deterioration in service for companies not prepared to pay more.Mr Pai also said that the Federal Trade Commission would resume a role it lost in 2015 overseeing broadband companies, to make sure that they did not use their new freedoms to hurt competitors.The FCC chairman stressed the bipartisan approach that had given rise to a lightly regulated internet in its early years, highlighting that the Clinton administration and a Republican Congress had stood back from imposing neutrality rules.Regulators only sent a first shot across the bow of broadband companies in 2005, when the FCC laid out general principles about how they handle traffic. A subsequent action against Comcast for blocking traffic on file-sharing network BitTorrent was overthrown by an appeals court.More formal rules, adopted in 2010, were also thrown out by a federal court after a challenge from Verizon. That led the FCC to turn back to an older and more stringent regulatory framework, which was first developed to govern monopoly telephone companies, though it promised to apply a light touch.Mr Pai condemned the rules as “heavy-handed, utility-style regulations upon the internet”, and said they had “depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation”.Comments from companies and interest groups on both sides of the debate on Tuesday suggested that Mr Pai’s action would not be the last word on the issue.Reddit, the online forum that played a central role in stirring up opposition to an earlier proposal to end net neutrality, said it would continue to push for regulations, adding: “It is crucial to innovation and the health of our economy that small businesses have equal access to the internet, with winners and losers chosen by consumers, not ISPs.”Scrapping the 2015 regulations was the only option “given the lack of net neutrality harms to date, the virtually null chance of disruptions to business as usual and the limited options afforded under the statute”, said Doug Brake, a telecom analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. But he also said that Congress should “end this unnecessarily acrimonious debate once and for all”.

It had appeared that the DoJ would be content with demanding a divestiture or two before waving the deal through. Now it says that mere remedies will not be sufficient. Proving that the merger would harm competition and consumers will not be easy — but might be the lightest burden the DoJ will have to carry.AT&T is a media distributor; Time Warner makes media content. The DoJ will have to argue its case in the shadow of the 2011 Comcast-NBCUniversal merger, a distribution-content deal that was allowed to go through. Is Comcast’s business model unlawful, too? Does the DoJ intend to block other distribution platforms — in particular digital ones — from owning content?The DoJ looks like it is fighting the last war. Increasingly it is the digital giants — Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple — that dominate the media industry. The DoJ has decided that content producers and distributors are a threat to competition at the very moment those companies’ grip on the consumer is finally loosening.The DoJ complaint suggests that the combined company could price Time Warner’s content at a level that would force other distributors — either owners of fibre cables or online video companies such as Netflix — to walk away. Time Warner would lose revenue of course, but AT&T might gain new subscribers frustrated with rival distributors’ thinner offering. This could conceivably be an effective strategy, and there is plenty of precedent in antitrust law that could be used to block a deal that made such a strategy possible. Stopping companies from leveraging dominance in one market into dominance in another is exactly the sort of thing that antitrust enforcers are supposed to do.The existence of the merged Comcast-NBC Universal raises problems, though. Can it be demonstrated that Comcast has leveraged its content in the way it is alleged that AT&T would? There have been a few complaints against Comcast, but they have not gone far. Comcasts’ margins in its cable business do not look much different from, for example, those of Charter, a competitor which owns no content. The DoJ could argue that Time Warner’s content offering is bigger and better than NBCUniversal’s. If that were the problem, though, divestments could solve the problem.If the DoJ’s position on vertical media mergers does not extend to Comcast, it will look as if AT&T/Time Warner is being singled out. Because President Donald Trump has missed few opportunities to express his animosity towards CNN, a news network owned by Time Warner, this perception is a serious threat to the DoJ’s case — as well as to freedom of speech.Many pay-TV and broadband distributors in the US are regional monopolies or quasi-monopolies. They therefore deserve hard scrutiny from antitrust authorities. But the DoJ should recognise that media distribution is changing. Amazon does not own the cables that run into homes. But its huge customer base, and stores of customer data and payment information, give it significant monopoly power as a distributor. Facebook, with over a billion users, is the greatest digital distribution platform the world has ever seen. The power of the physical distributors, on the other hand, is in decline.It is possible, though not obvious, that the AT&T Time Warner deal would hurt competition. It is indisputably odd, however, that the antitrust authorities are suddenly interested in going after the second-most powerful set of companies in the media market."

Earlier this month, Mr Ebeling came under criticism for comments to financial analysts describing ProSieben’s core audience as “slightly obese, slightly poor” people “who still like to sit on the couch and lean back and really like to get entertained”, Reuters reported.Shares in the cable group, which operates both free-to-air and pay TV channels in German, had fallen close to 30 per cent before Sunday’s announcement, after the group repeatedly cut its financial guidance. Shares are now down around 25 per cent so far this year, to €26.04 a share.Analyst Annick Maas at Liberum said she believed that the share price drop could revive interest from NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast.“NBC has previously expressed interest for ProSieben, it knows the German TV ad market and could offer significant cost synergies for ProSieben’s US-heavy programming grid. ProSieben’s announcement last night that the current CEO Thomas Ebeling will step down in February 2018 (ahead of his contract end) might additionally trigger such as deal”, she said.ProSieben said Mr Ebeling had already informed he would not seek a further term as chair during the last round of his contract negotiations, and the board had “initiated the search for a successor some time ago” with a successor to be appointed “in due course”.In the meantime, it has appointed executive board member Conrad Albert, a 12-year ProSieben veteran as deputy chairman with immediate effect.“In particular, the purpose of this appointment is to ensure continuity in the Company and to guarantee the further implementation of the strategy if the successor should not be able to take up his office promptly”, ProSieben said.

Fox’s 30 per cent stake in Hulu, the digital streaming service, is also expected to be included in any sale.Comcast’s NBCUniversal owns the NBC broadcast network, as well as portfolio of cable channels and the Universal film studio and it is also an investor in Hulu. Verizon’s interest in Fox comes as rival telecoms group AT&T’s agreed deal to buy Time Warner has run into regulatory difficulty.The Fox talks come at a tumultuous time for the media industry, which is under pressure from technological upheaval, changes in viewing habits and the global rise of streaming services from Netflix and Amazon.“The situation brewing around Fox is reflective of an important market reality: the strategic pressures on the financials of traditional TV businesses are accelerating,” said Christopher Vollmer, global entertainment and media advisory leader at PwC, the professional services firm. “Advertising competition is increasing. Content costs in TV and film are increasing. And alternatives to pay-TV are increasing.”The global scale and heft of new, deep-pocketed rivals is a key factor in the deal talks, he added. “Different players are recognising that they need to be bigger or part of a larger entity to compete with the likes of Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Facebook and Google who are all stepping up their [investment] in video content.”Different players are recognising they need to be bigger or part of a larger entity to compete with the likes of Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Facebook and Google who are all stepping up their [investment] in video contentIf Mr Murdoch goes ahead with a sale of the entertainment assets he would be left with the Fox broadcast network, the Fox News Channel, sports rights and the newspaper assets held within News Corp, which he also controls. People close to the Murdoch camp have speculated that he and his family might then seek to combine the remaining Fox news and sports assets with the newspapers — and take the company private.This week, the 86-year-old mogul acknowledged the impact of the internet on his newspaper portfolio while speaking to investors at the company’s annual meeting.“So far I think we have done pretty well in replacing lost advertising revenue in the major papers, but it continues to be a big problem,” he said. “I think the big three successes we have are the three big national papers: The Wall Street Journal, The Times in London and The Australian. The other papers, a lot of them are still very viable, but they are struggling.”As investors consider possible business combinations in the media sector, they are keeping a watchful eye on the outcome of AT&T’s $85.4bn attempt to buy Time Warner, the owner of CNN, HBO and the Warner Brother movie studio.The US Department of Justice has asked AT&T to sell either the media company’s cable networks, including CNN, or DirecTV, which is AT&T’s satellite broadcaster, to win approval for the deal. AT&T has said it would not sell CNN and has vowed to take the DoJ to court if a settlement cannot be reached.Additional reporting by Shannon Bond and James Fontanella-Khan in New York

Disney shares were little changed at $103.57.Comcast, America’s largest cable operator, owns NBCUniversal — the owner of the NBC broadcast network, a portfolio of cable channels and the Universal film studio. Fox has a similar portfolio of assets but lacks Comcast’s distribution infrastructure.The interest of Verizon, the US telecoms group, in Fox follows rival telecoms group AT&T’s agreed deal to buy Time Warner, which has run into regulatory difficulty.The talks come at a tumultuous time for the media industry, which is under pressure from technological upheaval, changes in viewing habits and the global rise of digital streaming video. Content owners, distributors and disruptive technology companies are jockeying for control as they prepare for an expected round of consolidation.One person said Comcast’s decision to initiate talks came after reports that Disney had held talks with Fox about buying its movie studio, cable channels and international business. That combination would exclude Fox’s broadcast network and Fox News Channel, as well as its sports rights.The talks between Comcast and Fox were described as “exploration” and “early” by two separate people briefed on the discussions. The two sides are aware that any combination would face serious regulatory hurdles, potentially requiring big carveouts, those people added.If Mr Murdoch goes ahead with a sale of the entertainment assets he would be left with the Fox broadcast network, the Fox News cable channel, sports rights and the newspaper assets held within News Corp, which he also controls.People close to the Murdoch camp have speculated that he and his family might then seek to combine the remaining Fox news and sports assets with the newspapers — and take the company private.This week the 86-year-old mogul acknowledged the impact of the internet on his newspaper portfolio.“So far I think we have done pretty well in replacing lost advertising revenue in the major papers, but it continues to be a big problem,” he told News Corp investors at the company’s annual meeting.“I think the big three successes we have are the three big national papers: The Wall Street Journal, The Times in London and The Australian.

AT&T has said it would not sell CNN and has vowed to take the DoJ to court if a settlement cannot be reached.Makan Delrahim, the head of the DoJ’s antitrust unit, has made it clear several times in recent weeks that he is opposed to deals where distributors of media and news also control content producers.The competition watchdog has also singled out Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal as a case study of why so-called behavioural remedies — where the owner of a combined company vows not to act in an anti-competitive manner — do not protect consumers’ interests.Analysts have speculated that if AT&T was unable to buy Time Warner, Mr Murdoch might make a bid for the company, which he unsuccessfully tried to buy in 2014. However, one person with knowledge of the situation said Mr Murdoch no longer harboured ambitions to acquire Time Warner.Mr Murdoch has called Randall Stephenson, chief executive of AT&T, in recent months, asking if he would consider selling CNN, said a person familiar with the matter.Meanwhile, Fox continues to try to complete its takeover of Sky, which it has been pursuing for close to a decade.Shares in Sky, in which Fox has a 39 per cent stake, were up almost 4 per cent in London at £9.36p. The European pay-television operator has been trading at a discount to the £10.75 price per share that Fox agreed to pay in December 2016 in a sign that investors have doubts of Fox’s ability to close the deal.Sky has threatened to close Sky News if its ownership of the channel becomes a regulatory impediment to the proposed £11.7bn takeover.Sky warned last week in a submission to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority, which is scrutinising the deal, that the continued operation of Sky News should not be assumed in light of concerns that the Fox takeover could harm media plurality in the UK.

Its founder, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Trump-irritating Washington Post.No wonder then that the question of improper interference arises when the Department of Justice intervenes in AT&T’s proposed $85bn acquisition of Time Warner, owner of CNN, another Trump irritant. More glaring still, the DoJ’s alleged proposed remedy: ditch the news channel and its sister cable channels. Shares in Time Warner fell 7 per cent, to their lowest level since Mr Trump’s election victory a year ago.Vertical mergers of companies in the same ecosystem but which do not compete directly seldom encounter antitrust trouble. In addition, before he was appointed anti-monopoly chief, Makan Delrahim saw no “major antitrust problem” with the deal.Yet for all the understandable suspicion, there are appropriate reasons to oppose the deal. Under the Obama administration, regulators worried about the proposed merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable, since the combined company would have had 60 per cent of the broadband market, potentially shutting out emerging online video rivals. The deal was withdrawn.In this case, Starz, a pay TV channel that depends on AT&T for distribution, has complained the telecoms group would be incentivised to push its viewers to HBO.If it were simply about jettisoning CNN the DoJ’s behaviour would seem egregious and AT&T would be hard-pressed not to comply.But in asking AT&T to dispose of the entire Turner division, which includes comedy and sports channels, the DoJ is not asking for a trivial scalp. Turner accounts for a third of revenues, much bigger than Time Warner’s premium channel HBO and not much smaller than its Warner Bros movie studio. Such a sweeping demand would sink the deal, which means it could all end up in the hands of a judge. Whether this enforcement action is motivated by good reasons or not, there is at least a backstop.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

141;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-11-06T18:55:35Z;SoftBank forced to rethink after failed Sprint-T-Mobile deal;Second attempted merger falls short over management control;The failed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile US, the US’s third and fourth largest mobile companies, has once again clouded the American dream of Masayoshi Son, the Japanese billionaire behind the SoftBank conglomerate.Few were surprised when SoftBank-controlled Sprint and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom, opened talks over a merger in the summer. The companies had attempted a deal three years ago only for it to be scuppered by regulators.Nonetheless, both groups need to invest heavily to build next generation 5G telecoms networks and with $32bn-$40bn of estimated synergies, the logic of combining was clear.Yet the two sides walked away from the negotiating table having been unable to “find mutually agreeable terms”. Mr Son and Deutsche Telekom, which derives more than half its value from the US market, each wanted full control of the merged business. Both refused to blink and the talks were called off.Shares in Sprint on Monday crashed as much as 12 per cent to hit their lowest level since early 2016 while T-Mobile US fell almost 6 per cent.Sprint has struggled since the original plan to merge with smaller rival T-Mobile fell apart. By contrast, T-Mobile has thrived and has a stock market valuation twice that of its putative partner. That, however, did not stop Mr Son trying to wrest control of the combined group during talks over the deal.“Joint management is one thing, but we couldn’t relinquish our hold on the crucial US market,” he told a press conference in Tokyo where the company announced second-quarter results that were at the top end of analysts’ expectations. “There were some conditions we just couldn’t agree to.”SoftBank had agreed to moves including a rebranding of Sprint under the magenta T-Mobile logo, according to a person familiar with the Japanese’s company’s thinking. But there “was a massive disconnect between the two sides. They were focused on the fact that the deal makes sense, there are a ton of synergies, so let’s get it done at the cheapest price. But we had to find a way to make this as close to a merger of equals.”Mr Son also believes that control is essential to putting SoftBank companies, including OneWeb, the satellite technology group, and chip designer Arm, at the heart of the new era of connected devices known as the internet of things.“I think Masa feels Sprint is turning a corner and while he sees the opportunity for scale and synergies via a merger, he also doesn’t want to give up control at this point,” says Chris Lane, an analyst with Bernstein. “He believes Sprint + Arm + OneWeb gives him an advantage in both convergence and IoT. No doubt investors will be disappointed but he is playing a longer game.”Others do not share that confidence.Annual revenues at Sprint have been stagnant at $8bn for the past three years and it has reported a loss in almost every quarter since 2011. It only returned to profit this year after cutting capital expenditure repeatedly from $4.5bn to $3bn to as low as $2bn at the start of 2017.By contrast, T-Mobile has added more than 1m customers every quarter since 2014 and under John Legere, its chief executive, has become a growth juggernaut.Walt Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG, says Sprint could “finally” invest in improving its network but that would burn more cash just as it faces the prospect of its debt maturing. Half of its $38bn of borrowings are due within the next four years.“Either somebody capitalises that business or they continue to lose market share,” says another analyst, who pointed to looming network capacity issues just as Sprint has cut back on investment. “I do not see how they can survive given the $3.5bn in cash they burnt through last year.”Mr Son acknowledged that fourth-placed Sprint is “not in a strong position at the moment” but argued that it is more advanced in its plans for supporting internet of things technology.Sprint was also quick to detail a “Plan B”. A day after revealing that the T-Mobile talks had broken down, it said it had struck a partnership with Altice, the French telecoms company, to use its network to launch a new mobile phone service.Marcelo Claure, chief executive of Sprint, calls the deal a “first of its kind” agreement that would act as a model for similar contracts. It also started buying up more shares in Sprint to take its stake to the 85 per cent threshold.Mr Son has also hinted that he could look for a new partner. One potential company is Charter Communications, the US cable and communications group with which it held initial discussions earlier this year.Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst with Barclays, says it is “tough to believe” that investors would back such a move. “If Charter does look at selling itself to Sprint, it would imply that Charter shareholders would implicitly be swapping out of Charter stock into Sprint stock,” he says. “It is not clear to us why major shareholders at Charter like Mr John Malone would consider that to be a better outcome.”Mr Venkateshwar says the main “lateral beneficiary” of the failed T-Mobile-Sprint talks was Dish, the satellite group, which could be a good fit with the German-owned company.

Including foreign exchange effects, the increase was 1.8 per cent.Revenue on a constant currency basis was up 0.3 per cent to €5.76bn, below analysts’ estimates of €5.85bn. Including the impact of the weaker dollar, revenue fell 1.8 per cent.The group’s adjusted ebidta margin rose 1.5 percentage points from 2016 to 41 per cent, led by the US with expansion of 6.1 percentage points to 44.9 per cent. The margin in France dropped 0.7 percentage points to 36.6 per cent.Performance continued to diverge between Europe and the US. At SFR, the second-largest telecoms operator in France, adjusted earnings fell 3.2 per cent to €1bn and revenue was down 1.3 per cent to €2.76bn. SFR added a net 16,000 mobile subscribers in the quarter.In Portugal, adjusted earnings were down 1.3 per cent to €265m on a 3.1 per cent drop in revenue to €566m.Altice USA adjusted earnings surged 18.9 per cent to $1.04bn, or €885m, as revenue rose 3.2 per cent to $2.33bn, or €1.97bn.US pay-television operators are being squeezed by the growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter have all reported subscriber losses in the third quarter. Altice USA shed a net 33,000 pay-TV subscribers, but that was fewer than the 40,000 it lost a year ago. It added 16,000 broadband customers.The company said it will begin rolling out a new “home entertainment hub” in the US next week, replacing traditional cable boxes, modems and routers with a cloud-based service that combines its video, broadband and phone offerings.

Adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share came in ahead of analysts’ expectations of 49 cents, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Revenue fell 1.6 per cent to $20.98bn, but excluding the impact of the 2016 Olympics, which lifted results in the third quarter of last year, revenue rose 5.8 per cent. Wall Street had expected revenue of $21.05bn.In Comcast’s biggest business, cable and internet, revenue rose 5.1 per cent to $13.2bn and adjusted earnings grew 5.2 per cent to $5.24bn.The company gained a net 115,000 customers across all its products, compared with 217,000 in the same period a year ago. It said the impact of tropical storms and hurricanes that hit the southern US in the quarter had depressed subscriber additions by 35,000.Comcast lost 125,000 video subscribers, compared with 32,000 added in the same quarter a year ago. However, that decline was less steep than the 150,000 executives had warned might drop their cable television packages. Higher pricing boosted video revenues 4.2 per cent to $5.83bn.The growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon are weighing on traditional pay-TV operators, leading to declines at companies such as AT&T and Verizon. Comcast now counts more internet subscribers than video customers, however, which executives say positions it to weather increased cord-cutting.The company added 214,000 broadband subscribers, down from 330,000 last year, with revenue up 8.9 per cent to $3.71bn. Business services also contributed to revenue growth, up 12.6 per cent to $1.58bn.At NBCUniversal, revenue dropped 12.7 per cent to $8bn from the third quarter of 2016, which included the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue rose 6 per cent. Adjusted earnings rose 6 per cent, or 20 per cent excluding the Olympics, to $2.27bn.Revenues at NBC’s cable networks fell 11.5 per cent, but rose 3.7 per cent excluding the Olympics, to $2.6bn. Broadcast revenues dropped 31 per cent, but rose 12.3 per cent excluding the Olympics, to $2.1bn.

144;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;AT&T falls after sales drop more than expected;;AT&T reported third quarter sales that missed expectations on Tuesday as a series of natural disasters in the US and Mexico hurt its results.For the three months to end of September, revenue fell 2.9 per cent to $39.7bn amid continued decline in its traditional landline business while hurricanes and the US and earthquakes in Mexico damaged network infrastructures and disrupted services.Analysts had expected revenue of $40.1bn. Although AT&T reiterated its full-year guidance, shares in the group fell 1.3 per cent in after market trading.Net income was 9 per cent lower at $3bn, or 49 cents a share, during the quarter compared to the prior year period. Stripping out one off items, adjusted earnings per diluted share was 74 cents, in line with consensus estimates and the same as in the year-ago quarter.The rise of online video services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon are weighing on traditional pay-television operators. AT&T warned earlier this month that it lost 390,000 video subscribers in the quarter, reviving investors’ fears over the health of the pay-TV market. That was somewhat offset by 300,000 new subscribers to its less expensive DirecTV Now streaming service.The company’s announcement sparked a sell-off in its shares and those of competitors including Comcast, Charter, Dish and Altice USA. Comcast, which reports earnings on Thursday, has said it could lose 150,000 subscribers this quarter.AT&T is seeking to offset the pressures on its legacy video and wireless businesses with an $85bn bid to buy Time Warner, the owner of HBO and the Warner Bros film studio – a move that will turn AT&T into a media and entertainment juggernaut.AT&T said on Monday it had extended the deadline to close the deal “for a short period of time” to get final regulatory approval from the US Department of Justice. The deal, announced a year ago, originally had a termination date of October 22. Last week, the transaction was approved by Brazil’s antitrust authority.

Bad for country!,” Mr Trump wrote on Twitter.The comment appeared to be in response to a story that NBC published earlier this morning saying the president had sough a 10-fold increase in US nuclear arsenal. Mr Trump denied the story, calling it in another tweet “Pure fiction, made up to demean”.Comcast, which owns the NBC, fell as much as 0.8 per cent following Mr Trump’s tweet even though networks themselves do not have licences. The Federal Communications Commission only license individual radio and television stations.Still, the prospect that Trump could ask the government to take a closer scrutiny of media networks weighed on shares of major news operators. CBS was down 1.8 per cent, while Twenty-First Century Fox shed 3.3 per cent. Time Warner, which owns CNN, was the main outlier, with the stock up 0.2 per cent.
146;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-10-10T20:02:45Z;Apple set to produce big-budget Spielberg TV show;Push into Hollywood likely to start with reboot of 1980s sci-fi series;Apple is on the verge of landing a big-budget TV show produced by Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, in its first deal since the iPhone maker rebooted its entertainment push earlier this year.In June, Apple hired two top Sony Pictures Television producers, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to spearhead a fresh drive into Hollywood. Their first commission is set to be a 10-episode series of Amazing Stories, a science-fiction fantasy show created by Mr Spielberg that originally aired on NBC in the mid-1980s, according to people familiar with the deal. Although negotiations are still underway, the deal is expected to be finalised soon, these people said. Apple declined to comment on the deal, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Amblin referred requests for comment to Apple. “It’s wonderful to be reunited with our colleagues Zack and Jamie in their new capacity at Apple,” said Jennifer Salke, president of NBC Entertainment. “We love being at the forefront of Apple’s investment in scripted programming, and can't think of a better property than Spielberg’s beloved Amazing Stories franchise with the genius of Bryan Fuller at the helm and more exciting creative partnerships to come.”Mr Fuller, who is known for TV shows including Hannibal, Pushing Daisies and the recently released Star Trek: Discovery, is expected to be Amazing Stories’ executive producer. The original Amazing Stories won a handful of Emmy awards but attracted relatively meagre ratings. Mr Spielberg turned one idea from the TV series into his 1987 sci-fi movie Batteries Not Included. Apple has budgeted as much as $50m in total for the revived series as part of what Hollywood insiders have pegged as an investment of more than $1bn in original content over the next year. Securing a big name like Mr Spielberg — the creative force behind ET, Jurassic Park, Gremlins and Indiana Jones — will help to set the tone for what Apple is trying to achieve with its latest attempt to push deeper into Hollywood and the TV industry. The Silicon Valley company is vying with the likes of Hulu and Netflix for heavyweight shows, including a high-profile new drama starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon set on a morning TV chat show, people familiar with the matter have said. At the same time, Apple is expanding the team at its Los Angeles headquarters in Culver City, where it has considered expanding into a new base at the iconic Culver Studios, the FT reported last month. At Sony, Mr Erlicht and Mr Amburg oversaw the production of hit dramas such as Breaking Bad and The Crown, which means they are already well-connected in Hollywood. However, Apple’s budget remains well below the $7bn that Netflix has pledged to spend next year, as it faces growing competition for shows from both traditional broadcasters and Silicon Valley rivals including Facebook and Alphabet’s YouTube. Showrunners and agents are still unclear on where exactly Apple’s planned slate of TV series will appear. Today, Apple’s video content is spread between its iTunes download store and Apple Music, which has already shown some music-centric programming such as Carpool Karaoke. One potential venue could be its new “TV” app, which aggregates content into an interactive guide from a range of streaming services, broadcasters and pay-TV operators. However, big hitters such as Comcast (NBC’s parent company) and Netflix are yet to integrate their services into Apple’s TV app, which is only available in the US, Canada and Australia at the moment. A strong slate of original shows that are only available on the TV app might bolster Apple’s negotiating position with holdouts, by bringing a larger audience to the platform.
147;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-09-18T11:00:41Z;Hulu’s ‘Handmaid’s Tale’ Emmy awards show power of streaming;Shift in viewing habits from traditional broadcast television highlighted by awards;The digital earthquake that has shaken broadcast television has given the Emmys its first streaming drama winner, with Hulu, a service owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner, winning for The Handmaid’s Tale.Hulu’s victory on television’s biggest awards night, winning the coveted Outstanding Drama Series category, reflects the sweeping changes in consumer behaviour, with viewers moving away from watching broadcast television at scheduled times, in favour of on-demand viewing on digital platforms.The popularity of streaming services is fuelling concerns about “cord-cutting”, the cancellation of expensive pay-TV subscriptions in favour of cheaper online alternatives. This has had a corresponding impact on television advertising: eMarketer, the media research firm, has cut its estimate for ad spending in the US and is forecasting growth in 2017 of just 0.5 per cent to $71.65bn — $1bn less than its forecast at the beginning of the year. Television’s share of total media ad spending in the US will drop to 34.9 per cent this year from 36.6 per cent in 2016, and is forecast to slip below 30 per cent by 2021, the firm estimates.Hulu’s victory comes amid intensifying competition for audiences and the money consumers are willing to spend on entertainment. Amazon won two Oscars for Manchester by the Sea at this year’s Academy Awards while Disney recently announced plans to launch a pair of streaming services in 2019 that would deliver its content direct to consumers, bundling its Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars movies in an entertainment streaming service. This could lead to competition with Hulu although Disney told the FT its own service would be pitched at a more family centric audience.Netflix and Amazon now regularly compete for the biggest projects with HBO, the Time Warner-owned channel that led the primetime Emmys winners evening with 10 awards, including acting ones for Riz Ahmed in The Night Of, and Nicole Kidman in Big Little Lies.Apple also hopes to join the fray, with plans to spend more than $1bn a year on original content. It is eyeing The Culver Studios, a historic production space in Los Angeles, and is among the bidders for a high-profile drama starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, set on a morning TV chat show.Rich Greenfield, analyst with BTIG Research, said Hulu’s Emmys success signalled that there was increasing pressure on the traditional “bundle” of channels sold by cable and satellite providers.“It illustrates how great content has never been cheaper and easier to access,” he said, pointing to new standalone streaming services such as HBO Now, and the bundling of streaming services with telco packages. “You do not need the bundle to watch The Handmaid’s Tale, Big Little Lies, The Crown, Veep [or] The Night Of. Hulu is only $7.99 a month, HBO is now a free giveaway via AT&T and Netflix is free via T-Mobile.”Hulu was created a decade ago by its media company owners in response to the rise of YouTube and a fear that advertising dollars would follow viewers away from broadcast television.The company was slower out of the blocks than rivals, such as Netflix and Amazon, which have a longer record in original programming. But its win on television’s biggest night will enhance its standing in Hollywood’s creative community, where top talent tends to gravitate towards the channels and platforms that can offer the most potential for awards recognition.The Handmaid’s Tale won in other categories, with Elisabeth Moss winning a best actress one and Ann Dowd one for supporting actress, as well as awards for writing and directing.Speaking when the Emmy nominations were announced this summer, Warren Littlefield, the executive producer of The Handmaid’s Tale, said its recognition was “an acknowledgment of where streaming content is in the world”.“We no longer say ‘networks’, we talk about ‘platforms’,” he told Vanity Fair magazine. “Hulu gets to stand tall with not only offering classic television, but they’ve stood up to say: ‘We’re power players in original content.’”

General Electric also registered a 3.6 per cent drop after JPMorgan earlier reiterated its underweight rating on its shares.The S&P 500 finished the day nearly flat at 2,465, with the telecoms sector dropping more than 2 per cent to offset a 1 per cent rise in healthcare stocks.Media shares were rattled by a Comcast executive’s pronouncement that it expects to shed as many as 150,000 subscribers this quarter, which sent the cable giant’s shares down 6.24 per cent, its biggest one-day drop since August 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P 500′s media index ended the day with a 3.6 per cent loss.The tech-heavy Nasdaq, meanwhile, got a boost from the likes of Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, ending the day with a small 0.07 per cent gain.The dollar index — measuring the buck against a basket of peers — extended its slide to end the day down 0.84 per cent at 91.51, while the yield on the 10-year US Treasury held lower at 2.05 per cent.

150;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Comcast/Sunrun: raising the roof;Small deals could be as important as big ones for the smart home;Plagued by earthbound woes from cord cutting, cable groups should look to the sky. Comcast Corp, the pay-TV, broadband, and entertainment colossus has done just that. On Thursday, it extended an existing partnership with Sunrun, one of the leaders in the emerging US rooftop solar industry. In exchange for convincing its users to become Sunrun customers, Comcast will earn a fee. Convert enough customers in the next four years, and it can buy a stake in Sunrun. The telecom sector has been caught up in megadeal fever. This small transaction is part of a battle to control all aspects of the home of the future.Rooftop solar companies install panels on homes for free, then enter into 20-year agreements with the homeowner, who pays for the power they use. Sunrun’s model hardly looks great so far. Even after collecting solar subsidies and tax credits, the group’s operating loss in 2016 was more than $200m on revenue of less than $500m. It carries more than $1bn in total debt against a market value of just $700m.Sunrun hopes for mass adoption and thus volume. It says 61m US households are possible adopters. But only around 1m have installed a solar unit. Sunrun hopes to reach nearly 200,000 customers by the end of this year. The agreement with Comcast states that if the telco — with 29m customers across America — brings in 60,000 customers over the next 40 months, it will receive a warrant to buy a tenth of Sunrun essentially for free. Customer acquisitions costs are steep, so targeting Comcast’s massive installed base is a savvy move.Comcast, AT&T and Verizon are battling Apple, Google and Amazon to act as the control centres of connected homes. The warrant, if converted, could be a precursor for a full takeover later. Telecom megamergers grab most of the attention. Incremental investments such as this one may be just as important in determining winners and losers down the road.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

151;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-08-24T17:22:06Z;Comcast and Sunrun strike solar panel sales deal;Industry’s latest marketing alliance comes despite fall-off in rate of installations;Sunrun, the largest independent residential solar company in the US, has agreed a marketing and investment deal with Comcast, the largest US cable group, to sell rooftop systems to American homes.The deal is the latest example of a big-name company from outside the industry forging an alliance with a US solar provider, reflecting continuing interest in the prospects for solar power despite a drop-off in the rate of installations this year and the financial strain on many companies.The tie-up follows the alliance between Daimler of Germany and Vivint Solar to provide power storage for American homes, which was announced in March. SolarCity, which was the largest residential solar company in the US last year, was acquired by Tesla, which now offers its customers batteries for home power storage. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, was SolarCity’s chairman.Comcast has agreed to market Sunrun’s rooftop solar systems in return for fees for new customers that it brings in, and warrants for up to 9.99 per cent of Sunrun’s shares.Lynn Jurich, Sunrun’s chief executive, said the agreement was “a cost-effective way of scaling up our infrastructure”, cutting the cost of acquiring new customers.Comcast has 29m customers in the US, more than half of them in the 22 states where Sunrun operates, Ms Jurich said. Sunrun has about 150,000 customers and expects to add about 45,000 more this year.News of the agreement sent Sunrun’s shares up 9 per cent to $7.52 in early afternoon trading in New York.The maximum equity warrant will be triggered if Sunrun installs systems for 60,000 or more customers who come to it via Comcast. If achieved, that would increase its customer base by 40 per cent from today’s level.The agreement follows a pilot programme that both companies described as successful, without giving details of how many more customers Sunrun had signed, or at what cost.Sunrun’s sales and marketing costs were 54 cents per watt in the second quarter, the company said when reporting earnings earlier this month. That equates to about 16 per cent of the total cost of an installed system.Comcast already offers systems for households to manage their electricity use through “home automation”, and although the systems installed by Sunrun would be run separately, the agreement reflects growing interest from customers in managing their own energy resources.Jon Kaplowitz, managing director of Comcast Cable, said in a statement the company expected the US residential solar market to continue to grow.He added: “By working with Sunrun, Comcast can help customers take more control of the price they pay for energy, save them money and help contribute to cleaner communities.”Sunrun also has other deals with National Grid of the UK and Engie of France.
152;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-08-10T18:51:11Z;Drahi stretches cable ambitions to limit with Charter interest;Billionaire’s Altice is lining up bid it may struggle to fund for US cable operator;Patrick Drahi was running a small French cable company in 1999 when his business came to the attention of John Malone, the world’s most famous cable industry investor, who was in the process of gobbling up European assets.Mr Malone acquired Mr Drahi’s business that year, bringing on the Franco-Israeli upstart as an executive at UPC — now part of Liberty Global — where the entrepreneur got a first-hand glimpse of the wrangling methods and manoeuvres that earned the American mogul the nickname of “cable cowboy”.Little could Mr Malone have known at the time that, less than two decades later, Mr Drahi would be constantly nipping at his mentor’s heels in his own backyard, to climb the ranks of the most influential cable owners in the US.Mr Drahi’s Altice, the sprawling global telecoms group that has turned him into a billionaire, is lining up a bid that would be worth more than $185bn, including $62.5bn in debt, to acquire Charter Communications, the second-biggest US cable provider, where Mr Malone is the largest shareholder with nearly 21 per cent.Altice’s desire to buy Charter is a response to technological and consumer changes that are forcing the leading US telecoms and media companies to consider consolidation, in order to stay ahead in the race to offer internet, television and online video.Altice, which had focused mainly on Europe, moved into the US by acquiring a pair of regional US cable companies over the past two years. The group remains a sub-scale rival to Comcast and Charter, having lost out to the latter in the $78.7bn battle for Time Warner Cable in 2015.Charter’s emergence as a provider that can reach 26m customers across 41 states has made it an attractive target for wireless companies Verizon and Sprint, which is controlled by Japan’s SoftBank and whose billionaire founder Masayoshi Son is eager to consolidate US telecoms.Missing out on the Charter deal is an opportunity that Altice cannot afford, according to bankers and analysts, leaving the company with little room to acquire new customers in the US, where there are few alternative prospects.“It would be a big mistake to underestimate Drahi’s determination to carry out a deal,” said one person who worked closely with Altice on its previous dealmaking. “He didn’t expect SoftBank to go after a Charter merger, but once that [news] came out Altice had to work on a counter proposal.”The Altice plan is not without serious complications, testing to what extent Mr Drahi has truly mastered the complex financing structures that Mr Malone has utilised to fuel his expansion.Charter is now valued at $122bn after its shares climbed nearly 20 per cent in the past month on speculation. Adding in net debt, the company has an enterprise value of about $185bn, which Altice would presumably need to top with any offer.In comparison, Altice’s Dutch-listed parent company is worth just €31bn, even though it holds controlling stakes in a number of subsidiaries, including two listed vehicles: Altice USA and France’s SFR Group. The Altice Group has around €50bn of debt overall, split across these already highly leveraged funding entities, or “silos” as the company dubs them.The strategy has worked so far, allowing the group to expand in places including France, Israel, Portugal and most recently the US. It is a model cribbed directly from Mr Malone’s Liberty Global, and Altice’s chief financial officer was even brought over from Liberty to mimic the model.Multiple bankers told the FT that they had questioned Mr Drahi’s ability to fund a bid for Charter. “The guys at Altice are brilliant financial engineers but this one would be a stretch to complete,” said one adviser not directly involved in the bid planning.Others expressed scepticism at the high-yield bond market’s capacity to fund such a large acquisition, given Charter’s size. “It seems very big,” said one senior corporate finance banker. “The Verizon deal was $50bn and that was investment grade,” referring to the largest corporate bond that was used to back a deal for Verizon to buy full control of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone.Even if Altice can find a structure to fund a bid, another obstacle will be winning over Mr Malone, who is known for a stark preference for tax-efficient proposals to gain his backing. Greg Maffei, one of Mr Malone’s lieutenants and chief executive of Liberty Media, seemingly poured cold water on hopes that Charter would be open to accepting a deal that included a large portion in shares.He said: “The idea that we would take equities that we don’t want is probably unlikely. A lot of it seems like levering up Charter, and if we want to lever up Charter, we have that opportunity, so any deal that would be appealing for us and other Charter shareholders I think would have to add real value and show real capabilities that are beyond what we think is a very well-positioned company.”Moreover, Charter chief executive Tom Rutledge has a large chunk of stock options that vest if the company’s stock reaches $564 a share, a steep premium to the $400 level where it currently sits.Track trends in tech, media and telecomsBut this would not be the first time Mr Drahi has defied the odds. When Altice first entered the US market with pricey deals for regional groups, incumbents saw him as an unknown quantity, whose plan to slash costs rapidly could disrupt the market by damaging service levels.“Drahi’s modus operandi is to go into a duopoly market and run lean,” said Paul Moran, head of research at Northern Trust Securities.“Their experience in the US has given them confidence. Larger cable companies face the same challenges and they can apply their formula to a bigger footprint, which ultimately would make more money. That’s what motivates billionaires after all.”By Arash Massoudi, James Fontanella-Khan, Robert Smith, Shannon Bond, Nic Fildes and Harriet AgnewCharter Communications’ rise from regional operator to the US’s second-largest provider of cable and broadband dates back to 1998, when Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen paid $4.5bn including debt for the company, which had been founded five years earlier in St Louis, writes Shannon Bond.At the time, Mr Allen was rolling up a number of cable and media assets in what he called his “Wired World” strategy. Charter quickly made 10 acquisitions of smaller cable companies and, in November 1999, listed on the Nasdaq. However, it took on heavy debt to fund its deals and was unable to turn a profit as a public company.Charter filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, eliminating $8bn of its $21bn debt load. In its reorganisation, private equity firms Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners took control by swapping debt for equity.John Malone entered the picture in 2013 when his Liberty Media bought out Apollo and most of the other private equity stakes to become the largest shareholder.Charter has since followed Mr Malone’s acquisition playbook, edging out Altice in the race to buy Time Warner Cable in 2015. The deal was a typically complex, tax-driven structure that saw Charter take over not only Time Warner Cable, but also Bright House, a smaller operator, and transforming Charter overnight into a legitimate rival to Comcast.Charter now serves about 26m subscribers in big markets including New York and Los Angeles, and has been eyeing a move into the wireless business as it looks to build new revenue streams to offset declining appetite for cable television.Analysts say that for companies looking to expand in cable in the US, there are few other promising deal partners with significant scale. The third-largest provider, Cox Communications, is privately held. Comcast, with a market cap near $200bn, is simply too large.Among the companies tipped to participate in the newest round of industry consolidation, “Charter has the brightest fundamentals and M&A prospects”, wrote Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Capital, this week.
153;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-08-01T15:23:10Z;Sprint expects deal in ‘near future’ as carrier swings to profit;Chief executive says mobile network has choices in US telecom consolidation round;Sprint’s chief executive said he expected a deal involving the US wireless phone company to be announced “in the near future”, as it posted a quarterly profit for the first time in three years, thanks to cost-cutting and revenue growth.“We are speaking to everybody and we have choices and when the time is right we are going to strike a deal,” Marcelo Claure said.Shares rose more than 10 per cent in morning trading in New York.The wireless carrier controlled by SoftBank, the telecoms empire of Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, has been at the centre of speculation about consolidation in the US telecoms and cable industries. Among the options Mr Son has proposed is combining Sprint with Charter Communications, the US’s second-largest cable provider, whereby SoftBank would become the largest shareholder. However, Charter has said it is not interested in a deal. This week, news reports linked SoftBank to plans for a direct bid for Charter, which has a market capitalisation of $120bn.Sprint earlier this year held exclusive talks with Charter and with Comcast, the largest cable and broadband operator in the US, about possible deals that included launching wireless service on their networks. Sprint has also held talks with T-Mobile USA, which is controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom.“The potential synergies of any of the transactions we are looking at are substantially better than remaining alone. I share that vision with Masa. We hope that in the future we are going to announce something that is good for consumers and for shareholders,” Mr Claure said.Sprint swung to net income of $206m, or 5 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter, from a net loss of $302m, or 8 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 1.8 per cent to $8.16bn.Analysts expected a loss of 1 cent a share on revenue of $8.14bn, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. “This represents the progress of a turnround journey that has delivered improvements in postpaid phone and prepaid customer growth, a return to top-line growth, and a significantly transformed cost structure,” Mr Claure said.Sprint has been cutting expenses to improve its business. It trimmed $370m in costs from a year ago, for a total of nearly $4bn in the last nine quarters. It is targeting an additional $1.3bn to $1.5bn in cost reductions this fiscal year.The company lost a net 39,000 “postpaid” subscribers, viewed as the most lucrative customers. It gained 88,000 net postpaid phone customers, fewer than the 173,000 added a year ago. Rivals Verizon and T-Mobile also added postpaid phone customers in the April to June quarter — 358,000 and 786,000 respectively — while AT&T shed 89,000.Wireless providers have been stepped up competition for customers. In June, Sprint rolled out a promotion offering a free year of unlimited data to customers who switched from Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile. Mr Claure said the offer contributed to 1 per cent of postpaid phone subscriber growth in the quarter.
154;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-07-27T19:21:44Z;US cable TV: discordant;Mid-tier network companies need to find a survival strategy;Look no further than Thursday’s strong results at Charter Communications and Comcast Corp to understand why the Scripps family might feel threatened and want out. The pay TV network business the family controls, Scripps Networks Interactive, supplies them with such lifestyle stations as the Food Network and HGTV. A bidding war for Scripps is reaching its climax with rival Discovery Communications close to prevailing over Viacom.For years, Scripps and Discovery could bully cable groups such as Charter and Comcast into paying more and more to carry shows such as Cupcake Wars. But Americans are happy to watch their programmes on mobile devices. It is increasingly profitable for distributors to facilitate that shift.Collectively, Charter and Comcast shed nearly 150,000 residential video subscribers in the past quarter. No matter, revenues at the pair jumped 4 and 10 per cent, respectively. Revenues at Comcast’s film studio division, including NBCUniversal, rose nearly a fifth following the latest in its interminable Fast and Furious series.Both companies are prospering from the demand for high-speed internet for which they are steadily increasing prices. And the slate for internet customers has a lot of blanks. Charter has noted that it “passes” 50m households but so far only 26m are subscribing to Charter’s service. Comcast said on Thursday that its penetration is just 45 per cent.With the minds of distributors focused on selling broadband, the mid-tier network groups like Scripps, Discovery, Viacom and AMC Networks need to join forces quickly. One survival strategy would be to create a so-called skinny bundle of 20 or less channels, without sports, that can be subscribed to over broadband.Scripps, by selling first, looks like it will get at least a 30 per cent premium. More importantly, it leaves the tricky job of figuring out how the broadband-first world works to others.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think in the comments section below. Have you cut the cord on pay-TV and simply switched to internet service only?
155;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Box-office hits help Comcast beat earnings expectations;;Comcast beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue expectations in the second quarter, as higher cable pricing and global box office hits offset a decline in pay-television subscribers.Net income at the largest US cable group, which owns the NBC TV networks and the Universal Pictures film studio, rose 24 per cent to $2.5bn, or 52 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $2.03bn, or 41 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 9.8 per cent to $21.2bn.Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 49 cents and revenue of $20.85bn, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.In Comcast’s biggest business, cable and internet, revenue rose 5.5 per cent to $13.1bn and adjusted earnings grew 5.4 per cent to $5.3bn.The company shed 34,000 video subscribers, more than the 24,000 analysts expected and a steeper loss than the 4,000 decline a year ago. Still, Comcast brought in more money from residential video customers, helping boost video revenues 4 per cent to $5.8bn.The second quarter is typically weak for pay-TV providers, due to seasonal factors like college students leaving campus and “snowbirds” moving to their summer homes.But analysts expect this year to be particularly tough, following steep pay-TV subscriber losses in the first quarter, as competition increases from new online TV services such as Dish’s Sling TV, Google’s YouTube TV, and AT&T’s DirecTV Now.At NBCUniversal, revenue grew 17.3 per cent to $8.3bn and adjusted earnings jumped 22.6 per cent to $2.07bn. Filmed entertainment revenue surged almost 60 per cent to $2.2bn, and adjusted earnings rose more than five-fold to $285m, boosted by hits including the Fast and Furious sequel The Fate of the Furious.Revenues at NBC’s cable networks increased 5.1 per cent to $2.7bn, while broadcast revenues rose 5.3 per cent to $2.2bn, lifted by affiliate and retransmission fees. However, advertising sales dipped 1.2 per cent in broadcast and 0.9 per cent in cable.
156;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Telecoms is the poor stepsister sector in TMT;Investors put a low valuation on the pipes that connect us to the internet;Twenty years ago, when the internet was in its adolescence, some smart market pundit came up with the TMT acronym to label this “new economy” investment theme. Technology, media and telecommunications captured the gamut of users interconnected at the speed of light.One reason the first tech bubble deflated at the beginning of the last decade — Datastream’s TMT index fell by 80 per cent — was that telecoms operators could not provide the speeds necessary to support the promise of streaming and other dotcom dreams. Excess capacity appeared and profits eventually fell well short of expectations. Later in the decade these operators were prized for their utility-like cash flows.Since the global financial crisis, technology companies have exploded in value. Disaggregate the old TMT indices and one can clearly see the divergence in performance. Technology has roughly provided a 300 per cent return since early 2009, with media a bit further back. Telecoms, though, has trailed by a long way, not even doubling.This looks odd. As Neil Campling at Northern Trust Capital Markets points out, “Netflix’s subscriber growth depends on streaming speed”. Where would Facebook be if data download speeds had remained at 2011 levels? US median download speeds quadrupled to 40 megabits per second by September 2015, according to the Federal Communications Commission.Even the older tech names, such as Apple and Microsoft, have soared by more than a quarter in the past year. Meanwhile telecoms such as Verizon, BT Group and Telstra, bring up the rear, their shares all down by double digits.While there are exceptions — Comcast and Altice NV — come to mind, investors do not put high values on the infrastructure over which all the data travels. Telecoms operators, which often control the backbone of their local broadband networks, mostly trade at enterprise values of about six times their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Data, for them at least, does not pay. Tech trades on at least double that ratio. While no one expects to see the valuations of telecoms operators roaring back soon to their highs of the early millennium, the infrastructure of the internet deserves a higher rating.alan.livsey@ft.comThis article was amended to correct the reference to download speeds as megabits, rather than megabytes.
157;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-07-19T10:03:08Z;NBCUniversal launches first Snapchat news programme;Television group hopes to reach younger viewers on messaging app;NBCUniversal is betting that Snapchat users will tune in to hard news in between sending disappearing photos and taking puppy ear-filtered selfies.The US television company is on Wednesday launching Stay Tuned, a two to three minute-long news show delivered twice a day on Snapchat. It is the messaging app’s first daily news programme as it tries to reinvent TV on the smartphone.Stay Tuned joins a growing roster of Snapchat Shows — short, professionally produced programmes produced in house and by media partners including the BBC, CBS and ESPN.Media companies such as Comcast-owned NBCU, which is an investor in Snapchat, hope to reach a younger group of viewers who have turned off traditional TV. Snapchat says 87 per cent of its US daily active users aged 18-34 do not regularly watch any of the top 15 TV networks.Approaching digital and mobile as an afterthought, as promotional, is not how you should think of this. It’s not how the audience thinks of it — for them it’s the first screen“We want to bring NBC News journalism to a new audience. All the evidence suggests that they are in many cases ‘cord nevers’ or ‘cord cutters’. How do we get them to find our news?” said Nick Ascheim, NBC News head of digital, referring to consumers who have never subscribed to pay-television or who have cancelled their subscriptions. NBC News is also in talks with Amazon and Apple about creating original video content for their platforms and products.“We are obviously interested in trying to figure out if this is a platform that can generate a financial return,” Mr Ascheim said. NBC News is handling advertising sales for the show — its first sponsor is Hollywood studio STX Entertainment — and will share revenue with Snapchat. Shows typically carry three ads per episode, but Mr Ascheim said Stay Tuned will carry fewer “in deference to the fact that it’s news”.Some Snapchat shows attract relatively large audiences: The Rundown, from NBC’s E! entertainment channel, averages more than 7m viewers an episode. Unlike TV ratings, however, Snapchat counts as a viewer anyone who watched for as little as one second.For Snapchat, a daily news show rounds out an offering it touts as “mobile TV”.“The range of programming should be similar to what you see on television,” said Sean Mills, Snapchat’s head of original content. “Our ambition is that when something happens in the world, that Snapchatters can turn to Snapchat. The notion of building that daily engagement was really important to us.”Snapchat aims to increase the number of shows it runs from one per day to three by the end of the year.The company is not alone in its ambitions to reimagine television. Facebook, which looms as Snapchat’s biggest competitor in the race to capture users’ time and advertisers’ money, is also investing in original videos. YouTube has launched a live TV service. Twitter is teaming up with Bloomberg on a round-the-clock streaming video news network. Amazon paid $50m for the rights to show National Football League games.“Adding more premium content on to Snapchat will get them more premium eyeballs and that’s appealing to our clients,” said Alex Marsh, director of platform innovation at advertising agency BBDO. “Clients are becoming more and more willing to spend production dollars on vertical video as more eyeballs are accessing vertical video.”Track trends in tech, media and telecomsMr Mills said the move into professionally produced content reflected a commitment to creating “an economically sustainable and attractive business opportunity” for partners.“The content should look as good in terms of the quality of storytelling as anything you see on television. Approaching digital and mobile as an afterthought, as promotional, is not how you should think of this. It’s not how the audience thinks of it — for them it’s the first screen,” he said.
158;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-07-13T04:01:34Z;HBO battles ‘Game of Thrones’ chill with subscriber growth;New distribution deals help Time Warner-owned channel weather the digital storm;Winter is coming to Westeros, bringing terrifying “white walkers” to the fantastical setting of Game of Thrones — bad news for the Starks, Lannisters and other feuding dynasties yet to meet a grisly end in the blockbuster series.For HBO, the Time Warner-owned channel that broadcasts the hit show, the outlook is rather sunnier. Game of Thrones begins its seventh and penultimate series this weekend, its return coinciding with a string of new distribution deals that are driving HBO subscriber growth, at a time when technology is disrupting the television industry.Cable television is under pressure like never before, with many viewers “cutting the cord” to go with digital players such as Netflix and Amazon. Yet HBO has continued to add subscribers, increasing revenues from them by 5 per cent in its most recent quarter.As an à la carte “premium” network, HBO is less susceptible to cord-cutting, because it is not part of the main US cable and satellite channel “bundle” that viewers are increasingly rejecting.But the network behind hits such as Westworld, Silicon Valley and Veep has also targeted cord-cutters with HBO Now, its standalone streaming product.The move ruffled the feathers of traditional cable distributors when Richard Plepler, HBO’s chairman, launched the service at an Apple event two years ago.“Incumbents can get worried and not like change,” Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice-president of internet software and services, told the Financial Times. “I thought it was going to be good for everybody.”So far, there is no sign that HBO Now, or the availability of HBO programming on digital platforms such as Amazon, has hurt its distribution among traditional cable and satellite providers.The company says it is approaching 3.5m broadband-delivered subscribers, part of a total global subscriber base of more than 131m. Netflix, by way of contrast, recently hit 100m subscribers around the world.Mr Plepler says HBO has embraced a “multilateral” distribution model, whereby HBO is available as a standalone digital service, as part of an add-on to a bundled package sold by a cable, satellite or telecoms provider, or in licensed form, as its programming is taken internationally by distributors such as Sky.In the US, still its biggest market, HBO typically negotiates distribution deals with cable and satellite operators every few years, but in 2016 found itself needing to strike three new agreements at the same time.Media sector consolidation was a factor in the timing shift, with the acquisition by Charter Communications of Time Warner Cable and the purchase of DirecTV, the satellite group, by AT&T bringing forward the timing of the new deals. HBO’s distribution deal with Comcast, America’s largest cable operator and the owner of NBCUniversal, was also up for renewal.“Normally these deals are staggered, but we had 80 per cent of our revenues up for renegotiation in an 18-month period,” Mr Plepler said. “That’s anomalous, but was largely the result of the Charter and AT&T mergers.”The deals were structured differently to previous renewals, which tended to be characterised by fee increases, effectively making HBO more expensive for consumers.“The number that kept me up at night had to do with increasing the wholesale price that we knew was being passed on to our consumers via distributors. What we needed to do was build volume-based incentives, which motivated our partners to grow with us.”So, this time round, HBO moved from a standard annual rate increase to a revenue-sharing model, with the distributors getting a larger share of subscriber fees the more HBO subscriptions they sell.“There are incentives for us to grow the business together so both companies benefit,” said Tom Rutledge, chief executive of Charter, which is backed by cable billionaire John Malone. “It’s slightly different from the way the legacy Charter businesses worked with HBO.”The shift in approach was partly driven by the performance of the players in the round of consolidation that swept the sector two years ago, with Charter and AT&T having much higher HBO penetration among their customers than Time Warner Cable and DirecTV, according to Mr Plepler.“Our performance with the acquiring companies was substantially better than with the distributors they acquired. Logic would tell you there’s an opportunity in that,” he said.With the deals done, HBO is expecting a hefty uptick in new subscribers: typically distributors put channel marketing efforts on ice during negotiations but with agreements in place they are aggressively pushing the service.Some analysts have urged HBO to go direct to consumers with its programming all over the world, rather than sell its channel through cable or satellite distributors.“It would be the right move long term and would mean they get to keep all the data and own the customer relationships,” says Richard Greenfield, analyst with BTIG Research. “But it would take a lot of capital and a lot of effort.”It would also mean turning down the hefty fees the company gets from distributors that pay it hundreds of millions of dollars each year to carry HBO.While the HBO Now service is available in the US, its international distribution is more limited: in the UK, for example, HBO programming is distributed by Sky via its Sky Atlantic channel.Keep up to date on M&A with the day’s top stories and analysis of global deals and dealmakersCould the strategy change again? Time Warner, HBO’s parent company, is in the midst of being acquired by AT&T for $85.4bn and Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, has been vocal about the value of HBO content in driving adoption of new mobile telephony services.HBO generated $1.9bn of operating income in 2016, equivalent to 25 per cent of Time Warner’s annual profits — but only about 6 per cent of the operating income of a combined AT&T-Time Warner.“I wonder if Richard will reconsider things when he is in a bigger company and there is less reliance on him and HBO,” says Michael Nathanson, analyst with MoffettNathanson. “Will they get more aggressive by going direct to consumers around the world? That’s what I would consider.”Mr Plepler declined to comment on anything related to the AT&T takeover, citing regulatory restrictions.But he said the multilateral model was working, leaving HBO free to concentrate on what it does best — programming.The company has a new series of Westworld in the pipeline — the first broke audience records for a debut HBO season — and has cast Oscar winner Mahershala Ali in a third series of True Detective. It is also working on Succession, a new drama about a fictional American media family.“We have to keep the heat on the brand,” said Mr Plepler. “We curate excellence and we create great quality . . . we have to keep delivering that.”
159;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-06-27T20:33:33Z;Sprint jumps on hopes of a cable company deal;Mobile rivals sink in response, weighing on the S&P 500;Mobile phone provider Sprint saw its stock price jump on Tuesday after reports that it has entered talks with cable companies Comcast and Charter Communications over a possible wireless deal.Sprint shares rose 2.1 per cent to $8.18 after it emerged that the cable companies are looking to resell services on Sprint’s network, according to a person briefed on the conversations. Comcast dipped 0.9 per cent to $39.25 and Charter fell 0.8 per cent to $329.87.Sprint’s rivals also sunk with Verizon down 2 per cent to $44.84 and AT&T shares 1.2 per cent lower at $37.70.T-Mobile, which has long been linked with a merger with Sprint, fell 3.4 per cent to $61.01 as any deal between Sprint and the cable companies is expected to delay merger discussions.“In our view, this likely suggests major hurdles in any Sprint/T-Mobile discussions,” said Mike McCormack, an analyst at Jefferies, in a research note.It helped drag the S&P 500 telecoms sector down 1.4 per cent, trailing the broader index that edged 0.8 per cent lower to 2,419.38. The telecoms sector of the index is small, including just four companies: Verizon, Level 3 Communications, AT&T and CenturyLink.Sprint’s rise followed reports from Reuters that it had entered talks with Charter and Comcast with the Wall Street Journal first adding that it could also include the cable companies taking an equity stake in Sprint, which is majority owned by Japan’s SoftBank — something analysts believe is unlikely.A deal with Sprint may offer Charter and Comcast more favourable terms on wireless services than they already receive through a tie-up with Verizon Communications. A reseller agreement would not preclude a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile.Sprint and T-Mobile have both aggressively pursued larger rivals Verizon and AT&T’s client base through price promotions and unlimited data offerings.“For weeks, press and investor speculation has largely cantered on a tie-up between the number three and number four wireless carriers, with management from both companies even discussing the magnitude of potential synergies,” added Mr McCormack. “The report of exclusive talks between Sprint and Cable likely provide an indication of just how far apart Sprint and T-Mobile may be in any discussions.”Elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 0.5 per cent lower to 21,310.66 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite extended Monday’s losses, dropping 1.6 per cent to 6,146.62.Darden Restaurants rose 2.9 per cent to $92.69 after positive earnings on Tuesday morning fuelled by sales at the company’s largest restaurant chain, Olive Garden.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningThe company reported $1.14 adjusted earnings per share, up from $1.10 for the same period last year and surpassing analyst estimates by 2.25 per cent. Revenues also beat expectations.Chief executive Gene Lee emphasised the importance of younger diners to the company.“Millennials still want to come to restaurants,” he said. “I know you don’t think millennials go to casual dining restaurants but 30 per cent of all our guests are millennials.”
160;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Sprint: Not pocket change;Assets go from cheap to expensive in no time;Has Masayoshi Son overplayed his hand? The Softbank founder’s bet on the US mobile phone market was deemed a disaster ever since the Barack Obama justice department vetoed a merger between Sprint, in which it owns a majority stake, and its nemesis T-Mobile three years ago. Burdened by a $40bn pile of debt, Sprint appeared to be hurtling towards bankruptcy. But Mr Obama has left Washington.A merger is back on the table. And perhaps more importantly, content distribution via mobile and wireless is suddenly the Next Big Thing. On Monday, it was reported that broadband/TV hegemons Comcast and Charter Communications were looking to partner or even acquire Sprint. Even though it continues to bleed red ink, Sprint shares have more than tripled since early last year.Sprint may re-sell its wireless service through Comcast and Charter who are both eager to give their customers a seamless, one-stop shop for all their communication needs. Comcast has already launched a basic wireless service using WiFi. A full-on acquisition of Sprint would cost something like $70bn in aggregate. Comcast and Charter together have an aggregate value greater than $400bn.But the puzzle of Sprint is exactly how to value it. In 2016, its operating income was under $2bn. But it also holds a bounty of network capability and operating losses of $19bn that can be used to offset taxes. Sprint’s stock price is a mishmash of takeover premium and sum-of-the-parts arithmetic.With such an inflated stock price relative to real earnings, an acquirer would face immediate dilution. This is most pronounced for T-Mobile, with which Sprint is still most likely to combine. Analysts at BTIG Research even suggest that a tie-up with Sprint at current relative valuation would result in a dreaded “takeunder” of T-Mobile. Perhaps the leak of Comcast/Charter discussions was intended to create a bigger frenzy around Sprint. But even deep pockets are not bottomless.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

That is the sensibility Patrick Drahi presented in Wednesday’s listing of Altice USA.The European telecoms tycoon spent nearly $30bn in recent years to acquire small cable television operators Cablevision and Suddenlink, combining them to form Altice USA. With 5m subscribers, it is dwarfed by rivals Comcast and Charter. But Mr Drahi contends that there is an “Altice Way” — a group-wide management approach to drive scale benefits.He points to the interesting economics on either side of the Atlantic for pay TV and broadband. In the US, the all-important average revenue per user approaches a whopping $150. And in Europe, the similar monthly operating cost per user is just $49. Combine those across the Altice system and you have a good business.On its preferred metrics, Altice USA says that its adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of 2017 was 41 per cent, up from 33 per cent in the same quarter a year ago. Average revenue per user had inched up, combined with several hundred millions of the $1bn of annual cost savings Mr Drahi had promised to investors.One reason to be sceptical: Mr Drahi’s acquisition spree has not been cheap. Even after paying off some debt in the listing, Altice USA will have a juicy $21bn in net debt (its enterprise value is $43bn) with an implied debt to ebitda ratio of 5.5 times.US cable stocks have been among the most resilient in the broader media sector. Comcast and Charter have been rewarded as consolidators who have cannily managed to cope with the cord-cutting phenomenon. But this week, influential equity analyst Craig Moffett took down his longtime buy rating on the sector. He believes that returns will now moderate.Two Altice backers, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and BC Partners, are selling the bulk of the shares in the $1.9bn offering.

162;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-05-02T18:06:03Z;America’s failure on internet competition;Scrapping ‘net neutrality’ will not help digital consumers in the US;"With a speed many American internet users can only envy, the Trump administration is re-writing the rules for US internet providers. The administration is quite right that the industry has a serious problem: lack of competition. But a regulatory rollback, paired with the administration’s apparently sanguine attitude towards industry consolidation, will do nothing to solve it, and could make matters worse.US consumers suffer from some of the lowest internet speeds and highest prices among the world’s wealthy countries. Consumers in Japan, South Korea and Scandinavia pay far less for considerably faster connections. The Federal Communications Commission, now headed by Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, has unveiled plans to abolish the net neutrality rules. Mr Pai says that the decades-old “common carriage” rules, which were applied to telephone carriers before they were extended to cover internet providers under the Obama administration, restrict competition and discourage investment.These rules forbid, among other things, internet providers from charging content providers such as Google and Netflix for faster delivery of their product — so called “fast lanes.”Common carriage rules were designed to restrain monopoly carriers. A more modern, lighter-touch rule might make more sense if the political barriers to adopting one were not high. And it is true that the current regime favours the content companies at the expense of network providers such as Comcast and Verizon. The latter companies supply Google, for example, with a service — they deliver its product. If the market was fully competitive, it would be fine for them to charge Google for doing so, while also charging consumers a monthly fee as well. Unhappy customers or content providers could switch to another network. The market is not, however, optimally competitive. Most Americans have only two internet providers available to them. Some have only one. If the providers find there is more to be made by helping Google and Netflix than by providing customers with excellent access to everything
the internet offers, the customers are stuck.Restricting fast lanes is, in short, an imperfect way to protect customers and smaller content providers where competition, for now, cannot.Mr Pai argues that there has been a fall in capital investment in networks since the common carriage rules were extended in 2015. Given long planning cycles and normal variation in spending, however, the argument is inconclusive at best. In fact, consumer internet speeds rose sharply in 2016. It is hard to see what the rules have done that justifies repeal.The administration is also signalling that it does not intend to block further mergers in the industry — specifically the $85bn AT&T merger with Time Warner (Mr Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop the merger). In a market where consumers are paying more for less, and where a few companies dominate, a high bar to deals should be the default position.The root problem is lack of competition in network construction and improvement. If consumers had more options, fewer rules would be required. Mr Trump likes to talk about infrastructure investment. Encouraging investment in digital infrastructure — a natural area for private-public partnership — should be part of that agenda. That would do much more good than rolling back sensible if imperfect rules and waving through deals in an industry that already has the upper hand on the consumer."
163;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;US media readies for deals sparked by new FCC rules;Recent regulatory move lifts barrier to Murdochs and others owning more TV stations;A regulator’s reversal of arcane channel ownership rules has left US media companies jostling to consolidate America’s local television networks, setting the stage for a wave of deals.Talks have been under way for weeks between Sinclair Broadcast Group, America’s largest owner of local stations, and Tribune Media, a television group which three years ago was spun out of the group that owns newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times.On Sunday, 10 days after the Federal Communications Commission restored a media ownership rule the Obama administration had scrapped, Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox crashed the party with its own plans for Tribune: it has formed a joint venture with Blackstone to mount a rival bid for the station owner with the aim of combining it with its own local channel portfolio.For the last few years local television stations have faced dual pressures from a worsening advertising environment and increasingly powerful broadcast networks, which have the scale and muscle to charge station owners big fees to carry their programming.But the recent FCC moves have changed the picture. The regulator voted to reinstate the so-called “UHF discount”, which had been eliminated last year: reinstating it means that station owners will not have to include channels broadcast over UHF waves in calculating how many markets they reach. A barrier to owning more stations has been lifted.Media executives expect the FCC to take other steps towards allowing companies to own more stations. Aside from Tribune there are several possible consolidation candidates — companies with large station portfolios that could combine with rivals. These include CBS, Walt Disney, Univision and Comcast.“Local stations won’t be able to survive unless the cap is lifted further,” one senior television executive told the FT. Potential tie-ups between broadcast networks — such as Fox and CBS — would create scale, synergies and, more importantly, allow the combined companies to better exploit expensive sports rights, possibly by owning multiple channels in big metropolitan markets, he added. “If you own NFL rights and can offer advertisers the demographic that watches one network with the demographic that owns another that becomes very powerful.”This may have occurred to Mr Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, who run 21st Century Fox in their discussions with Tribune. But their plans are also partly defensive.Fox has 28 owned and operated stations in the US but its broadcast network is carried by dozens of other stations — some of which are owned by Tribune. If Sinclair succeeds in buying Tribune it will own these stations and be better placed to drive a harder bargain in carriage negotiations with Fox.Fox has other reasons to want Tribune, says Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. “Fox would get more out of owning the Tribune stations because it has expensive rights whose costs it needs to spread over lots of stations,” he said.Fox and Blackstone declined to comment on their discussions or their plans for Tribune. However, two people close to the talks said that under the proposal being discussed Blackstone would provide the cash and Fox would put its portfolio of owned and operated television stations into a new joint venture company. With Tribune having a market capitalisation of $3.3bn, the interest from Fox and Blackstone should drive up any offer price that had been privately discussed between Sinclair and Tribune.Fox’s interest in Tribune comes as it awaits regulatory clearance for its £11.7bn bid for the shares it does not already own in Sky, the European pay-TV group. It has a few weeks to wait: Ofcom, the UK communications watchdog, recently put back a decision on the deal until after the UK general election.The company has also been dealing with the fallout from claims of sexual harassment at Fox News Channel, its lucrative cable news network. On Monday it parted company with Bill Shine, the channel’s co-president, who followed Bill O’Reilly, arguably its biggest star, and Roger Ailes, its former chairman, in leaving in the wake of the scandal.For now, Mr Murdoch’s company has turned its attention to a sector that has in recent years lacked the glamour or prestige of digital media. With more deregulation likely under the Trump administration’s FCC, it will not be alone in eyeing its potential.

166;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-04-06T13:34:13Z;Comcast launches Xfinity Mobile telecom operator;Wireless service will piggyback on infrastructure operated by Verizon;Comcast launched a new mobile telecom operator on Thursday, as the largest cable group in the US seeks to boost customer loyalty by offering its subscribers wireless services in addition to television, internet and a landline phone.The offering, called Xfinity Mobile, will piggyback on mobile infrastructure operated by Verizon, the wireless telecoms group that is credited with having one of the largest and more reliable networks in the US. Executives at Comcast said they planned to market the wireless product to the company’s almost 30m cable customers, offering significant savings over rival networks that would run to hundreds of dollars a year for some subscribers. Comcast hopes that the addition of a mobile phone product will make its existing customers less likely to switch and reduce the company’s “churn”, the industry term for the rate at which people cancel their services. “If we can improve loyalty by offering packages with great value, then it’s good for the customer, but it’s also a good business decision for us,” said Greg Butz, president of Comcast Mobile. The company is hoping to succeed where other new entrants in the fiercely competitive US wireless market have struggled. In June last year, Cablevision closed its mobile network Freewheel, which operated exclusively over WiFi hotspots, after it failed to lure enough customers.Comcast’s product, which is known as a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, because it operates over a rival company’s towers, will also rely on its own WiFi hotspots for most data transfer. But customers will be automatically switched to Verizon’s network for voice calls or when they are out of range. If you’re my dad, then paying $70 for an unlimited plan is crazy. Most customers will save moneyXfinity Mobile will offer best-selling smartphones from Apple, Samsung and LG, rather than a less-popular suite of specially adapted devices, as Google does to customers who sign up to its MVNO, Project Fi. Mr Butz said he believed the company would be able to attract new users with a pricing plan that undercuts its competitors. Unlimited plans will be $45 a month for customers already subscribing to Comcast’s premium TV packages, and $65 a month for those who take its internet product. There will also be a free plan where data usage is charged at $12 per gigabyte, which is aimed at customers who tend not to browse the internet, watch video, or listen to audio when they are out of their home. “If you’re my dad, then paying $70 for an unlimited plan is crazy,” said Sam Schwartz, chief business developer at Comcast, referring to the typical cost of rival products that offer uncapped data for a set price. “Most customers will save money,” he added. Comcast said it would be able to use its existing stores, call centres and website to attract new subscribers and offer them customer support, allowing it to sell mobile products at a lower price point than its rivals. The cable giant has been regularly touted by analysts as a buyer for T-Mobile USA, the country’s fastest-growing mobile phone network, but Mr Schwartz said the group did not “intend to get into a wireless fight” with incumbent operators such as AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. “We are interested in this for what it does for our core business,” he added. “We don’t need to make lots of money on this, but we won’t lose money either.
167;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-03-29T18:27:25Z;US privacy vote is foretaste of net neutrality battle;Republicans have launched an effort to deregulate the internet and media worlds;The wait for Washington’s new Republican political establishment to take on the regulations that hold the country’s media, internet and communications industries in delicate balance is over.Both chambers of Congress have lined up over the past week to slash the power of regulators to limit the freedom of the country’s cable and telecoms giants.The opening shot came on Tuesday, as the House of Representatives voted to override a Federal Communications Commission regulation limiting the freedom of cable and telecoms companies to trade personal data about their customers to advertisers. That matched a vote by the Senate the week before.If signed into law, this would remove the FCC’s authority over privacy regulations that relate to networking giants such as Comcast and Verizon. The move is the boldest sign yet of a broader change in policy direction in Washington since the November elections that promises to take the shackles off the cable and mobile industries.According to lobbyists and consumer advocates, that makes it a forerunner to a pair of bigger fights that will shape the US internet and media industries for years to come: the net neutrality regime that sets the ground rules for access to digital communications and media, and approval of AT&T’s $109bn bid for Time Warner.[The battle] to dismantle the regulatory state has begunIn the internet and media worlds, the battle “to dismantle the regulatory state has begun”, said Jeff Chester, a privacy advocate in Washington. For the White House, he added, the advertising battle has been a test case for a broader regulatory rollback: “High on the list is net neutrality. They really wanted to see what the opposition is going to be like.”The severe retrenchment of FCC power fits with the agenda of Ajit Pai, the Republican-appointed commissioner who took over as chairman of the agency after the election. Mr Pai has been a vociferous opponent of net neutrality, and has already taken snips out of the regime put in place by the Obama-era FCC to limit the powers of cable and telecoms companies to exert more control over the data flowing through their networks.The Republican congress’ action in recent days would also leave the remit for privacy regulation in the US completely with the Federal Trade Commission, which has taken a largely hands-off approach. While bringing the ISPs more into line with internet companies, that has not pleased privacy advocates.The shift in direction to unshackle the network companies threatens to reset the competitive landscape, and is shaping up to be a mixed blessing for internet giants like Google and Facebook.On the one hand, it promises to free cable and mobile companies to become more aggressive participants in the data economy. Critics argue that they have access to some types of personal data that are even more sensitive — and potentially valuable — than the information that underpins the Google and Facebook fortunes. ISPs, for instance, have ready access to location data, information about all the websites and apps a customer uses, and an insight into who they communicate with. If they can turn that into valuable insights for advertisers, it could change the competitive dynamics in online advertising — one reason why groups representing advertisers have been strong supporters of this week’s moves.On the other hand, by cementing a light regulatory approach to privacy, the action on Capitol Hill stands to benefit all companies that depend on internet advertising. Had the FCC’s broadband privacy rules — adopted only last October — stayed in place, they could have set up future regulatory efforts to extend stronger privacy rules into more corners of the industry.“Google and Facebook and others in the [internet] industry saw this as a threat — today it’s the ISPs, tomorrow it’s them,” said Mr Chester.For consumer advocates who warn of a broad retreat from Obama-era protections of the internet, meanwhile, there was at least one encouraging sign this week. Fifteen Republicans voted against the rollback of FCC powers on Tuesday, resulting in a 215-205 majority in the House for the measure. Critics of the new policy direction in Washington say this points to a groundswell of unease over internet policies that would entrench corporate power but harm millions of consumers.The last battle over net neutrality brought a rowdy grass roots rebellion over ceding power to network companies. For a White House that likes to pride itself on its populist credentials, this week’s move points to a difficult balancing act ahead.

With shares jumping 44 per cent in their first day of trading on Thursday, and rising a further 14 per cent on Friday, NBCU’s stake is now worth more than $820m.The stake is the latest move by the network to capture a slice of digital platforms and the younger audiences they attract, as online streaming video has pulled some viewers away from traditional TV.Including the Snap stake, NBCU has invested more than $1.5bn in “promising digital businesses” in the past 18 months, said Steve Burke, NBCU chief executive, in a memo to employees. “We will continue to be aggressive as digital content consumption increases.”NBCU has also invested $400m in BuzzFeed, $200m in Vox Media and acquired SportsEngine, an app for youth sports leagues.It became a majority owner of AwesomenessTV, which makes YouTube videos, through its purchase of DreamWorks Animation last year, and owns part of Hulu, the streaming video service.The digital expansion comes as the owner of NBC, CNBC and Bravo has trimmed its roster of TV networks. It shut its crime-themed channel Cloo last month and in January turned the Esquire Network, a joint venture with Hearst, into a digital-only offering.NBCU has partnered with Snapchat before. Last year the companies struck a deal to show video from the Rio Olympics in a BuzzFeed-branded Snapchat channel that generated more than 2bn views. NBCU and Snap are planning an “expanded partnership” for the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea in February.The companies also plan to launch more shows on Snapchat using NBC brands, following successful short-form video series from its hit TV programmes including The Voice and Saturday Night Live.We will continue to be aggressive as digital content consumption increasesMedia companies have been eager to reach Snapchat’s audience of young viewers, who are spending more time watching online video on various internet-connected devices and less time with traditional “linear” television.A recent report from Nielsen, the research company, found that 18 to 34 year olds spend 27 per cent less time watching traditional TV than people aged 35 and older.For Snap, the partnership with NBCU comes as it, and other digital companies focused on video such as Facebook, hopes to capture some of the $70bn spent annually on TV ads.Snap’s current business model depends on persuading advertisers to direct their marketing dollars to its offerings, which include branded “lens” filters and short video ads.Thus far, however, the advertising world considers Snapchat an experimental format. WPP, the world’s biggest advertising group, invested $90m in advertising on Snapchat last year, compared with $5bn with Google and $1.5bn with Facebook.
169;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-02-25T08:01:17Z;Trump proves comedy gold for US networks’ late-night satire;Ratings and advertising rise for shows that deliver sharpest criticisms of president;Donald Trump is turning out to be a gold mine for his comic foes on late-night television, lifting ratings and advertising revenues for shows that deliver the sharpest criticism of the new US president.On CBS’s Late Show, Stephen Colbert has homed in on politics, helping him unseat NBC’s Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon as the most-watched nightly chat show for three straight weeks.Late-night television is an important source of profit and cultural cachet for US broadcasters. NBC has long dominated the networks’ rivalry, but Mr Colbert has widened his lead to nearly 300,000 viewers in the week ending February 17, the most since he debuted on CBS in 2015.Across the TV dial, audiences are flocking to a brand of biting political satire that largely originated with Jon Stewart at Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, but which has now spread to the television mainstream. Daily Show alumni include Mr Colbert on CBS, John Oliver on HBO and Samantha Bee on TBS.Mr Colbert had suffered declining ratings at CBS since he succeeded David Letterman at the Late Show desk. He struggled to win over viewers after dropping the blustery rightwing pundit character that made him a star on Comedy Central. In August 2016, his audience dipped below 2m for the first time.But Mr Trump’s ascendancy appears to have sharpened the focus of Mr Colbert and his writers on the frenetic Washington news cycle, and the ratings trend is now in reverse. Viewership grew 3 per cent in January from a year ago, and has now reached 3m, 30 per cent above last summer’s lows, according to Nielsen figures.On CBS’s earnings call last week, Les Moonves, chief executive, talked up Mr Colbert’s contribution to the network’s “great story in late night”. CBS said advertising revenue for the network’s nightly line-up, which also includes Britain’s James Corden, increased 10 per cent in 2016 and was on pace to grow again this year.“Colbert’s show has become more aggressively political. That’s probably responsible for his numbers going up. He’s found a comedic strategy similar to that which made him popular before,” said Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University’s Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture.In contrast, The Tonight Show’s ratings have slipped 14 per cent since January 2016, as Mr Fallon has taken a softer approach to political subjects. He drew criticism for a September interview with Mr Trump in which he mussed the then-Republican nominee’s hair and asked a series of unchallenging questions.Mr Fallon still leads in the 18- to 49-year-old age group most desired by advertisers, but Mr Colbert is closing in.Other shows are already reaping financial rewards from presidential parody.NBC’s Saturday Night Live is drawing its biggest average audiences in 24 years, with total viewership up 26 per cent this season from a year ago, according to Nielsen figures cited by the network.The variety show’s February 11 edition was the most-watched episode in eight years as viewers tuned in to watch Alec Baldwin reprise the role of the president, Melissa McCarthy skewer the White House press secretary Sean Spicer, and Kate McKinnon lampoon both Jeff Sessions, the attorney-general, and Kellyanne Conway, Mr Trump’s adviser.The ratings bump has allowed NBC, owned by Comcast, to charge advertisers more money. The average cost of a half-minute spot on SNL increased 86 per cent in January from a year ago, according to Standard Media Index, which tracks ad agency spending.The trade magazine Adweek estimated that SNL’s ad revenue rose 34 per cent to $2.1m for its January 14 episode and 22 per cent to $2m for January 21. Overall, NBC saw a 9.8 per cent gain in ad spending for the month.“The attention on SNL since the Trump administration took office is paying off well for NBC,” SMI said.
170;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-02-10T23:19:28Z;Chinese investor charged over DreamWorks shares purchase;SEC claims inside information led to $29m in quick profits on $3.8bn Comcast deal;"As Comcast last year conducted secret talks about a potential acquisition of DreamWorks Animation, five Chinese investors — including an elderly couple in Beijing — acquired an enormous stake in the storytelling studio.Over a three-week period ending on April 25, those five accounts purchased more than 2.1m DreamWorks shares, amounting to nearly 17 per cent of all trading in the stock, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. When news of Comcast’s $3.8bn purchase of DreamWorks broke on April 26, the Chinese investors reaped $29m in quick profits, the SEC says. It was not just good luck. The accounts were controlled by Shaohua “Michael” Yin, a managing director at Hong Kong-based Summitview Capital Management, who co-ordinated their trading using inside information he had gained about the DreamWorks sale, according to the SEC complaint. “The precision with which these trades were timed, combined with the sheer scale in which they occurred, could not be the product of chance,” the commission said in a civil complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan. “ . . . They proved to be massively profitable.” The complaint charges Mr Yin, a 2005 graduate of the Wharton School of Finance, with securities fraud and names as relief defendants the account holders: Lizhao Su, 78, Mr Yin’s mother; Zhiqing Yin, 79, the defendant’s father; Jun Qin, 45, a quality manager at Legrand Electrical Co in Beijing; Yan Zhou, 33, a Beijing schoolteacher; and Bei Xie, 29, an employee of PetroChina Coalbed Methane Co. Mr Yin, who splits his time between Beijing and Palo Alto, did not reply on Friday to an email requesting comment. Before joining Summitview, a private equity firm, he worked for UBS Investment Bank and Warburg Pincus Asia. According to his LinkedIn profile, he earlier worked at Microsoft as a software design engineer. On February 3, as Mr Yin prepared to board a flight to China at San José International Airport, FBI agents confronted him with a warrant authorising a search of his mobile phone “for evidence of insider trading,” the complaint says. The precision with which these trades were timed, combined with the sheer scale in which they occurred, could not be the product of chanceMr Yin asked the agent if his accounts would be frozen. Over the next few days, Mr Yin and the others named in the court action tried to withdraw more than $22m from the accounts, it is alleged.On Friday, the SEC said it had obtained a court order freezing $29m in the accounts, representing the illegal profits from Mr Yin’s alleged insider trading. The commission tied Mr Yin to the suspicious trading through a review of internet addresses used to place trades through the Chinese investors’ Interactive Brokers accounts, the complaint said. The five accounts, which previously had never traded in DreamWorks, began acquiring shares immediately after PAG Asia Capital on April 4 offered privately to buy the company. The accounts bought DreamWorks shares on every trading day between April 4 and April 25, when rumours of a more lucrative Comcast deal went public, eventually emerging as one of the company’s 10 largest shareholders. The SEC complaint says Mr Yin’s five accounts also profited from suspicious trading ahead of market-moving news in another US company, Lattice Semiconductor Corp, and three Chinese companies, 58.com, Ctrip.com and Giant Interactive Group. “Despite the defendant’s alleged attempts to hide his control over these accounts, the SEC’s data analytic investigative tools enabled us to determine who was behind the suspicious trading,” said Michele Wein Layne, director of the SEC’s Los Angeles regional office, which led the probe. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against Mr Yin along with disgorgement of his alleged insider trading gains and civil penalties. The commission wants the relief defendants, who are not accused of wrongdoing, to surrender profits from Mr Yin’s trading along with interest."
171;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-01-26T18:23:29Z;Verizon and Charter hire advisers to pursue talks;Preliminary discussions could create the world’s largest communications company;Verizon and Charter have hired advisers to explore a deal that could create the world’s largest telecoms and cable company, according to people briefed on the talks, as the US groups prepare for a radical regulatory overhaul under the Trump administration.Talks between executives are at a very preliminary stage and no proposal is on the table yet, these people said. Yet both sides are seriously studying how to create what would be the world’s largest provider of wireless and fixed line internet access.At current stock prices, the combined company would have an equity value of $282bn, topping AT&T’s $255bn market capitalisation.Free Press, a non-profit group that campaigns for an open internet, said the prospect of the two companies combining was “unthinkable”.“A deal like this might excite Wall Street bankers and industry lobbyists, but anyone else can see that it would be a disaster for competition, innovation and the public interest,” said Craig Aaron, chief executive of Free Press.The hiring of bankers comes as Donald Trump’s planned change of leadership at the Federal Communications Commission is expected to usher in greater consolidation between telecom, media and technology companies, according to a person advising the US president. Mr Trump’s appointment of the Republican leaning Ajit Pai to chair the FCC has given telecom companies confidence that US regulators will be less resistant to big mergers.Mr Pai believes that telecom companies’ business models are under pressure from tech rivals in Silicon Valley such as Alphabet and Netflix, which increasingly provide similar services, and therefore should be allowed to merge to compete more evenly, said a person close to him. Under the Obama administration the FCC took a dimmer view of combinations between big providers of cable television and internet access. Comcast scrapped a $45bn purchase of Time Warner Cable in 2015 after failing to convince the regulator that a deal would be in the public interest. Charter, which is partly owned by John Malone, the so-called “cable cowboy”, then acquired Time Warner Cable. The new FCC leadership has privately signalled that it is more open to consolidation and mergers between operators. Roslyn Layton, FCC adviser to Mr Trump's transition team, said the regulatory framework was completely out of date. She said network operators were being squeezed by tech competitors, so mergers were the only way for telecom and cable companies to survive. “While I have not studied the specifics of the deal, a merger between Verizon and Charter seems entirely logical and consistent with convergence and consumers’ desires,” said Ms Layton, now a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.“While I expect that such a transaction would fall squarely into the domain of the Department of Justice, not the FCC, the FCC regulatory framework based upon network silos from the 1930s is utterly inappropriate for the modern, converged digital world . . . [and] needs to be modernised,” she added. Antitrust critics of this approach argue that allowing large companies to merge will concentrate too much power in the hands of too few players, giving them the ability to increase the price of services. The talks between Verizon and Charter come as the FCC and Department of Justice begin scrutinising AT&T’s proposed $85.4bn takeover of Time Warner, a deal that would unite America’s biggest telecoms group by market value with the owner of HBO, CNN and Warner Brothers. President Trump said during his campaign that he would block the AT&T-Time Warner deal as it would concentrate too much power in one company’s hands. However, since winning the election he has hired as advisers antitrust lawyers who have expressed support for large deals as long as consumers’ interests are heeded and prices are kept in check. Verizon has separately sought to expand in media and advertising through a $4.8bn bid for Yahoo, but that transaction has yet to be completed.After a decades-long roll-up of local cable operators, Charter and Comcast have become dominant operators in the industry. Last year, Mr Malone successfully completed a $90bn three-way deal where Charter acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House. Charter’s shares rose more than 6 per cent to $329.07 after the Wall Street Journal first reported the story. Verizon shares fell 1.3 per cent to $49.12.
172;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2017-01-26T17:51:26Z;Comcast pulls in first full-year gain in TV customers in a decade;US cable provider defies fears over threat of online streaming;"Comcast defied industry fears of viewers ditching cable services in favour of online streaming, reporting its first full-year gain in television customers in a decade. The largest US cable provider, which owns NBC TV networks and the Universal film studio, signed up 80,000 video subscribers in the three months to the end of December and 161,000 for the year.The end of the year is usually strong for the pay-TV industry thanks to holiday promotions. For the fourth quarter, rival Verizon added 21,000 customers although AT&T lost 27,000 pay-TV subscribers. The resilience in Comcast’s cable business helped power a 16 per cent rise in net income to $2.3bn in the fourth quarter, or 89 cents a share — beating Wall Street estimates for 87 cents a share. Comcast’s revival in pay-TV, after years of decline, comes as the media industry battles the proliferation of new ways to watch TV and films online. The company’s executives credit the turnround to its high-tech cable box called the X1 — a robot-esque TV guide that Comcast compares to Amazon’s digital assistant, Alexa.In another sign of optimism, Comcast said it would raise its dividend payment by 15 per cent and buy back $5bn worth of shares this year. Revenues at NBCUniversal rose 13 per cent to $8.5bn during the quarter while total Comcast revenues jumped 9 per cent to $21bn, topping analyst forecasts. NBCU’s growth was “fuelled by the tremendous success of the Olympics” as well as new theme park attractions and the strong box office performance of animated films, said chief executive Brian Roberts. The swell in political advertising at the climax of the US election also helped NBCU’s broadcast advertising sales grow 12 per cent in the fourth quarter, and 19 per cent for the year. Total revenues from broadcast television rose 14 per cent to $2.85bn in the quarter. Filmed entertainment increased 13 per cent thanks to hits such as Sing, an animated musical comedy. However, for the year, film revenues were down 13 per cent compared with an especially strong slate in 2015, which saw the release of blockbusters such as Jurassic World. Overall revenues at Comcast’s cable and internet business grew 7 per cent to $12.8bn, with the company adding 385,000 customers to its high-speed internet service — its best quarter in nine years. Comcast shares rose 3.4 per cent in morning trading, extending a gain of 17 per cent since the election, as investors have piled into cable stocks as a potential winner from the Trump administration.“All the broad themes of the Trump rally — deregulation; infrastructure; tax reform; domestic v international — seem almost tailor-made to trigger a cable rally,” wrote analysts at Moffett Nathanson."

Comcast has aimed to combat “cord-cutting” by promoting its high-tech cable box called the X1 — a robot-esque TV guide that Comcast compares to Amazon’s digital assistant, Alexa.In another sign of optimism, Comcast on Thursday said it would raise its dividend payment by 15 per cent and buy back $5bn in shares in 2017.

The pricetag represents a premium to last August when NBCU invested $200m in BuzzFeed, valuing the site at $1.5bn.The move is the latest example of traditional media betting on digital upstarts to gain access to younger viewers and readers. Last year Disney doubled its stake in Vice Media to $400m while NBCU invested $200m in Vox Media. This summer Univision bought Gawker Media for $135m.Partnering with BuzzFeed has “helped us engage millennial audiences with our content”, said Maggie Suniewick, president of NBCU’s digital arm.BuzzFeed pointed to Tasty, its online food video channel, as well as journalism, online video and data science as priorities for investing the new cash.The investment “allows us to remain a fully independent company but have access to and resources from the strongest and best media company there is”, said Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed chief executive.[The investment] allows us to remain a fully independent company but have access to and resources from the strongest and best media company there isBuzzFeed has ramped up video programming and looked more seriously at television, where there are advertising dollars available. The site, known for making snappy quizzes and listicles widely shared online, this summer formally split its news and entertainment businesses as it aims to double down on digital video.Mr Peretti has moved from New York to Los Angeles, the heart of the entertainment industry, where BuzzFeed has built an office of 300 employees.This year the Financial Times reported that BuzzFeed had missed its 2015 revenue target and slashed projections for 2016. In a subsequent interview on Recode, Ken Lerer, BuzzFeed chairman, denied that the company had cut 2016 projections but declined to give other figures.The investment would also deepen the advertising partnership between NBCU, which is owned by Comcast, the largest US cable provider, and BuzzFeed, the companies said.BuzzFeed will help create and distribute NBCU’s branded content — a growth area for digital news operations — while NBCU will sell advertising inventory for BuzzFeed.The companies previously teamed up during the Rio Olympics when NBCU worked with BuzzFeed journalists to produce daily snippets for Snapchat’s Discover platform.

Combined with the Republican party platform, that bodes well for the deal environment generally,” said Eric Siegel, a corporate lawyer at Dechert.Mr Trump’s book, The Art of the Deal, is back in vogue among New York’s rainmakers and the new wisdom is that he will be a pragmatist. While Mr Trump may be sceptical of overseas takeovers of US companies, they believe he will favour deals that line up with his campaign goals of boosting domestic capability in infrastructure, energy and defence as well as supporting manufacturing jobs in the US.“Trump the president may not be as abrasive as Trump the candidate,” said Simon Marchant, head of corporate at Freshfields. “His instincts, one would think, would be to support business and jobs.”The US Department of Justice leads the process of scrutinising many US large takeovers and Republican administrations have traditionally been more lenient about allowing mergers.George W Bush challenged an average 14 deals a year during his tenure, compared with the 32 a year challenged by Democrat Bill Clinton. In the first six years of the Obama administration, the DoJ publicly challenged on average 17 deals a year. Most advisers expect Mr Trump to follow his Republican predecessors.Consumer advocates and other proponents of tough antitrust enforcement fear that Mr Trump might undo some of the decisions taken by the Obama administration.—————-More corporate reaction to Trump winTrump victory: corporate winners and losers

Clinton defeat provides antidote for US drugmakers—————–The DoJ has blocked a series of megadeals in recent years including Comcast’s $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable, Sprint’s 2014 bid to buy T-Mobile and Halliburton’s $30bn acquisition of Baker Hughes. It is now reviewing two health insurance deals worth a combined $85bn.“Promoting continuity at the DoJ is key,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute. “We have very high levels of concentration in key industries . . . which create enormous competitive concerns.” She added: “Disruption would send a signal to investors that it will be easier getting their deals through.”However, some academics noted that Mr Trump’s policy agenda was more populist and interventionist than prior Republican candidates. As a result, his administration’s reaction to deals is harder to predict.During the campaign Mr Trump said that his administration would kill AT&T’s proposed $85bn acquisition of Time Warner, as he argued that the concentration of power would be harmful for consumers. He also mentioned that he favoured breaking up Comcast and NBCUniversal, which merged in 2013.“He isn’t particularly happy with media concentration given his treatment at the hands of the media,” said Erik Gordon, professor at University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.Mr Trump’s protectionist rhetoric on the stump may also translate into tougher scrutiny of foreign-led takeovers of US assets. Several bankers and lawyers predicted that the proposed acquisition of Monsanto, the US seeds giant, by Germany’s Bayer would come under intense scrutiny as would any major acquisition conducted by Chinese buyers.Trump’s instincts, one would think, would be to support business and jobs“He’ll do anything to protect US companies and jobs,” said a banker. “And forget about Chinese companies buying US assets; that was hard under Obama, it will be even tougher under Trump.”However, analysts predict that Mr Trump will look more favourably on domestic groups that help US companies grow and compete internationally, such as the pending $130bn Dow Chemical-DuPont merger.“Trump is likely to be more European . . . favouring the creation of national champions so if the argument is that DowDuPont is a company that will help America by being a better global competitor I think he will be happy with the deal,” Mr Gordon said.M&A specialists have also been reassured by Wednesday’s relatively benign market reaction to Mr Trump’s victory, as volatile markets make it more difficult to push through transactions. If economic growth remains moderate and credit remains cheap, US companies are likely to continue to do deals, they said.“As with Brexit, the US election result has already created some uncertainty and volatility. This will open up M&A opportunities for some while putting off others in the short term,” said Charlie Jacobs, senior partner at Linklaters.——————–Further readingBayer targets one-stop shop with Monsanto

176;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-10-26T12:39:29Z;Comcast strikes gold with Rio Olympics;Sports coverage and election drama lift Q3 revenues at largest US cable operator;The Rio Olympics and a dramatic US election helped lift Comcast, the largest US cable operator, to better than forecast revenues in the third quarter.The owner of the NBC TV networks and Universal Pictures film studio added 32,000 video customers in the three months to the end of September — marking its best third-quarter result in a decade. So far this quarter rival Verizon reported 36,000 new pay-TV customers, while AT&T lost 3,000.Revenues at NBCUniversal rose more than 20 per cent to $9.2bn during the quarter while total Comcast revenues jumped 14 per cent to $21.3bn, slightly higher than forecasts.The strong showing comes as the media sector digests AT&T’s agreement to buy Time Warner for $85.4bn, with observers pointing to Comcast’s purchase of NBCU as a template for merging distribution with content. On the earnings call Brian Roberts, chief executive, declined to comment on the AT&T-Time Warner combination, but noted that Comcast and NBCU’s assets “work so well together”.Steve Burke, chief executive of NBCU, said being part of Comcast had been a “great stimulus”, noting investments from the parent company. “We have more than doubled operating cash flow [since the merger],” he said. “The results speak for themselves.” Advertising sales for NBC’s broadcasting unit soared more than 90 per cent in the quarter thanks to demand for Olympics TV spots and political campaign spending — more than doubling TV revenues to $3.1bn. The Rio games were “the most profitable and successful games in our history”, said Mr Roberts.Comcast said high-margin political revenue from the US election lifted its local stations’ advertising by 7.7 per cent to $634m in the quarter. Meanwhile, the raucous White House race has continued to boost audiences at MSNBC, where ratings were up 95 per cent in the quarter. Total net income for the Philadelphia-based group rose 12 per cent to $2.24bn, or 92 cents a share — roughly in line with Wall Street estimates.NBCU’s film studio was a weak spot. Revenues slipped 8 per cent compared with this time last year, when the studio enjoyed box office smashes such as Jurassic World and Minions.Comcast, along with cable rivals, satellite companies and telecoms groups, has looked to adapt as Americans ditch their monthly cable TV bill in favour of digital streaming options. The 53-year-old company, which lost 48,000 video customers this time a year ago, has aimed to combat “cord-cutting” with a high-tech cable box called the X1 — a robot-esque TV guide that Comcast compares to Amazon’s digital assistant, Alexa. The strategy has helped Comcast add 170,000 video customers in the past 12 months, marking a turnround after the industry as a whole shed a combined 383,000 customers last year, according to Leichtman Research Group.The X1, which has been rolled out to nearly 45 per cent of Comcast’s 22m video subscribers, is set to include Netflix shows later this year.
177;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-10-26T11:52:25Z;Comcast deal a prequel to AT&T-Time Warner;NBCUniversal takeover offers lessons on what could lie ahead if regulators approve buyout;"A multibillion-dollar bid for a company in a deal that could reshape the media sector faces months of regulatory scrutiny: Brian Roberts probably knows how Randall Stephenson, his opposite number at AT&T, feels this week. Seven years ago the Comcast chief executive agreed to buy 51 per cent of NBCUniversal from GE, in a complex deal that valued the media company at about $30bn. Regulators approved the purchase in 2011; two years later, Comcast acquired the rest of the shares it did not own. It is unclear if the Comcast-NBCU purchase inspired AT&T to target Time Warner with an $85.4bn deal. But Comcast’s integration with NBCU over the past seven years should give Mr Stephenson an indication of what could lie ahead if his deal is cleared by regulators. Comcast’s timing was impeccable. It struck the deal to buy NBCU in October 2009, at a low point in the economic cycle, when the NBC broadcast network and other businesses were underperforming. Time Warner shares at the time were trading around $28 — rather less than the $107.50 AT&T has agreed to pay. Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson estimates the NBCU deal was struck at less than nine times earnings. AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner, by contrast, was struck at 12 times earnings. “The lesson is that timing is everything,” he says. “If diversification strategy requires you to buy low and sell high, AT&T have bought high. Comcast bought low.” There were few obvious synergies between Comcast and NBCU when the deal was struck and Mr Moffett says that remains true today. Comcast is not allowed to distribute NBCUniversal content exclusively to sell cable or broadband subscriptions, because antitrust rules require it to make the programming available to other distributors under licence. Still, Comcast has learnt that owning a media company can yield other benefits. Investments by Comcast have revived the NBC broadcast network, which in 2009 was languishing in fourth place behind CBS, ABC and Fox. The Universal movie studio was struggling when Comcast bought the company, but it too has been turned around: 2015 was its best ever year, with hits such as Jurassic World and Fast and Furious 7 both hitting $1.5bn at the global box office. The biggest turnround was at Universal’s theme parks in Orlando and Los Angeles, which in 2009 were languishing after years of under-investment. As the US economy began to recover, the parks bounced back, propelled by the opening of a Harry Potter attraction in Orlando six years ago, which broke new records for attendance. NBC’s own divisions have been integrated more efficiently under Comcast’s ownership. New attractions based on Universal intellectual property, such as the Minions, have been added to the parks. Films have also been better promoted across the broadcast network and cable channels. Owning NBC has helped Comcast “innovate a lot faster than some of their peers”, says Amy Yong, an analyst with Macquarie Securities. NBC collects its own data, which Comcast has been able to use to its advantage, she says — pointing to falling rates of customer churn. “They have the data that tells them what people want. They have reduced churn for several consecutive quarters.” NBC’s rights to the Olympic Games have also boosted Comcast’s cable and broadband services. Comcast customers were able to choose from 6,000 hours of live television and online streaming coverage, searchable through a voice remote. NBC content has also helped Comcast launch new services, without having to wait for comprehensive sets of licences from other providers. When it began selling films to own, over its X1 cable platform, it initially used Universal titles and, with other studios added quickly, it became one of America’s biggest film retailers. Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, told the FT this week that AT&T would be able to create new services using Time Warner content as an “anchor tenant”. Still, AT&T should not expect to generate big synergies between Time Warner’s content and its mobile or broadband distribution, according to Mr Moffett. “Comcast’s strategy from the beginning wasn’t: let’s maximise synergies,” says Mr Moffett. “It was: let’s buy an attractive asset and run it better.” The synergies between content and theme parks have been “real”, he says. “The synergies between content and physical distribution, outside of some modest cross promotion — which could easily be acquired at arm’s length — haven’t”. He believes the AT&T-Time Warner deal should be seen as a diversification play: the acquisition of what he says are “inarguably wonderful assets”. Diversification depends on whether an attractive price was paid “and we won’t know for years whether it was good or bad”. Regulators approved the Comcast-NBCU deal in 2011. The management teams of AT&T and Time Warner are banking on its clearance then smoothing the path for their own transaction. But not everyone thinks the approval of Comcast-NBCU is necessarily good news for the AT&T-Time Warner acquisition. The first deal “often makes it through the door because it doesn't necessarily herald widespread consolidation,” says Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. “Later deals that look like a consolidation trend have tougher times.” Mark Patterson, a professor at Fordham Law School, says it is “hard to draw any conclusions today about the likely treatment of media mergers based on the past”. He points to the rapid evolution of media markets and the emergence of digital services that have reduced the power of companies that control access to the internet. “It is not very clear any longer how market power should be measured,” he said. “We may need new methods to evaluate mergers like this one.”"
178;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

180;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-10-25T17:18:13Z;Comcast offers a model for AT&T-Time Warner deal scrutiny;Antitrust enforcers could look to lessons from cable group’s 2011 NBCUniversal deal;If US regulators impose conditions on an eventual approval of the proposed $85bn AT&T-Time Warner tie-up, they are likely to start with the more than 150 provisions they required for a similar transaction five years ago.In its most significant orders, the US Department of Justice in January 2011 forced a merger between Comcast and NBCUniversal to license programming to other distributors, refrain from retaliating against content providers who supply rival cable companies and give equal treatment to competing online products on its internet network.The head of DoJ’s antitrust division at the time applauded the compromise. “The conditions imposed will maintain an open and fair marketplace while at the same time allow the innovative aspects of the transaction to go forward,” says Christine Varney, now head of the antitrust practice at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, which is representing Time Warner in the AT&T deal.But technology, markets and politics have all changed since 2011, potentially complicating the AT&T-Time Warner union, according to antitrust specialists in Washington. “It’s natural that the antitrust division would look to NBCU as the starting point. But it’s just going to be a starting point,” says Amanda Wait, a partner at Hunton & Williams.The deal, a surprising move so close to the conclusion of the 2016 election, will be evaluated amid a populist climate in which partisans on both sides of the political divide see “big” as “bad”.Already, Bernie Sanders, a senator and socialist former presidential hopeful, and Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, have opposed the merger. On Monday, Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican and Senate judiciary chairman, called for a “robust review” of the proposed merger and promised to hold a hearing on it.The need for more aggressive antitrust enforcement was written into the Democratic party platform this summer, reflecting the influence of Elizabeth Warren, a senator and effective leader of the party’s leftwing. Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner to become the nation’s 45th president, this month assailed growing industrial consolidation.Meanwhile, the marketplace has changed. Video services from companies such as Netflix, Amazon and Sling TV have emerged since the Comcast deal was agreed. Likewise, the emergence of broadband and mobile technologies — available over nationwide distribution networks — complicates the landscape for regulators.New digital services have reduced the power of internet gatekeepers among the national broadband networks, according to Mark Patterson, a Fordham University law professor. “It is not very clear any longer how market power should be measured,” he says. “We may need new methods to evaluate mergers like this one.”AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner is a “vertical” marriage uniting players that fill different roles in the supply chain. Such deals typically draw less regulatory opposition than “horizontal” partnerships between direct competitors that reduce customer choice. But regulators often approve vertical deals only after requiring the parties to change the structure of the merged entity through sales or divestitures or by securing promises about future conduct.“Generally, people like structural remedies over conduct remedies because conduct remedies are difficult to enforce,” says Alicia Batts, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs, a law firm. “But what would the structural remedy be?”The remedies required in the Comcast takeover of NBCUniversal have had mixed results. In 2013, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) sided with Bloomberg in its complaint that Comcast was discriminating against its business news network by not moving it to a more attractive spot on its cable channel line-up, alongside similar services such as NBC’s own business network, CNBC.“Looking to Comcast-NBCU as a model — which involved a complicated and difficult-to-enforce remedy — would be ill-advised,” says Diana Moss, president of the non-partisan American Antitrust Institute, which has argued against conduct remedies in other deals.Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business, says the approval of Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal made it less likely regulators would approve AT&T’s Time Warner deal, however.“The Time Warner deal signals that Comcast was not a one-time event,” he says. “Comcast-NBCU wasn’t a court case and didn’t set a precedent . . . it set the table for all who follow to have a more difficult time. It makes it more important for regulators to protect against the potential anti-competitive effects of further vertical integration that could leave other players out of important markets.”Gene Kimmelman, a former DoJ antitrust official and now president of Public Knowledge, says it is not clear which regulatory agency would be best positioned to police any eventual agreement. Depending how the AT&T-Time Warner deal is implemented, the FCC, which historically has the most experience governing consumer markets, may not even be involved.Providing continual monitoring of consumer contracts, including service offerings and prices, is also not DoJ antitrust officials’ traditional role. “The biggest issue is who has the authority and tools for effective oversight,” Mr Kimmelman says.

The 50 year-old executive is filling a souped-up version of the role vacated by Tom King, who clashed with former chief executive Anthony Jenkins over the future of the investment bank.“Mark and Jason’s careers at JP Morgan underscore once again the deep bench of talent we have in the CIB,” wrote Daniel Pinto, London-based head of the corporate and investment banking unit, in a memo to staff.JPMorgan, where Jamie Dimon is in his eleventh year as chairman and chief executive, has been a rich source of talent for other banks seeking to boost their leadership teams in recent years.Former JPMorgan executives now in prominent roles elsewhere include Frank Bisignano at First Data, Mike Cavanagh at Comcast, Charlie Scharf at Visa, Bill Winters at Standard Chartered and Scott Powell at Santander Holdings USA. Mr’s Throsby’s new boss at Barclays, Jes Staley, is another JPMorgan alumnus.JPMorgan, long ranked as the top bank in fixed-income sales and trading, has been on a drive to bolster its position in equities, where it ranked as low as eighth in 2010.

Entertainment companies are waging a brutal war for consumer eyeballs and dollars. The companies that operate the pipes, meanwhile, can sit back. Whatever content is most popular, they will get paid to deliver it. A market once obsessed with the threat of cord-cutting by pay-TV subscribers now looks at the likes of Charter Communications and Comcast and sees big gains in high-speed internet users. This year those two and a smaller provider, Cable One, have seen their shares jump.On Monday, private equity gave its mark of approval. TPG Capital acquired two small, regional cable and broadband providers RCN Telecom and Grande Communications for $2.25bn, collectively.The regional monopolies that rule US TV and internet delivery are not quite as dominant as they seem. RCN and Grande are “overbuilders” that install their own service to compete against incumbents*. Customers can pick a fringe provider if they do not want 500 channels, preferring fast internet and streaming video from Netflix and its growing list of rivals.RCN and Grande together have less than 1m subscribers, making them a minnow (whales Charter and Comcast have 44m broadband subscribers all told). Altice, the French telecom upstart, has made an expensive splash in the US by buying up marginal providers Suddenlink and Cablevision for $27bn in recent years. The heavy debt it has absorbed in doing so will remain a burden for some years; it could, however, become a logical acquirer of the TPG assets in time.Until then, other overbuilders make for nice targets. Google’s venture capital arm is a minority investor in Monday’s deals and, with its existing effort in rolling out fibre networks, perhaps Google and TPG have grand plans.

183;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-08-15T17:16:18Z;Google Fiber project changes to wireless channel;High-speed internet scheme opting for less expensive wireless in change of strategy;Alphabet is switching the focus of its high-speed internet plans to wireless technology, in order to accelerate a project to improve connections across the US that has taken six years to reach just six cities.Google Fiber is turning its attention to wireless, which requires less expensive and time-consuming construction work, and putting fibre projects on pause in Portland, Oregon, and San Jose in Silicon Valley. It is also changing its broadband strategy in the newest cities to join the programme. The move comes after the company in June acquired Webpass, a wireless provider that operates in five major markets in the US including the Bay Area and Chicago. The deal, for an undisclosed sum, was designed to help Google reach more cities more quickly. Charles Barr, president of Webpass, said at the time of the acquisition that the company would remain focused “primarily on point-to-point wireless”, a simple network architecture that can range from connecting two locations just a few hundred metres apart to up to tens of miles away from each other. Google said: “We're continuing to work with city leaders to explore the possibility of bringing Google Fiber to many cities. This means deploying the latest technologies in alignment with our product road map, while understanding local considerations and challenges, which takes time.” The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.FCC filings also show that Google is applying for an experimental radio service licence.Google added: “We are working to test the viability of a wireless network that relies on newly available spectrum. The project is in early stages today, but we hope this technology can one day help deliver more abundant internet access to consumers.”Alphabet, now Google’s parent company, started Google Fiber to offer connection speeds up to 100 times faster than the average broadband connection, allowing both uploads and downloads of a gigabit of data a second.When it was first announced in 2010, smaller cities across the US were eager to work with the company to bring the kind of connection speeds that could spur new small businesses and help create local technology hubs. The plan was for Google to profit both from the sale of the connections, to businesses and homes, and from the extra use of its sites, from search to YouTube. Google also hoped to encourage telecoms providers to offer similar speeds by creating a new rival in the market. Technology companies, which rely on telecoms services, have been frustrated by their pace of change.The US does not make the top-10 countries in the world for connection speeds, according to Akamai’s State of the Internet report for the first quarter of 2016. Since Google Fiber launched, Comcast, AT&T and Centurylink have all begun to offer superfast broadband speeds in certain markets, including AT&T offering its U-Verse Gigapower service in Kansas City and Austin, Texas, where Google Fiber operates. But the project has struggled as the company discovered how hard it can be to work with local government.Last year, Dennis Kish, vice-president of Google Fiber, told the Financial Times that local authorities could make it easier for the company to access utility poles and conduits in the ground to expand the infrastructure of the internet.He said that Google had gained “lessons and some scars” on its journey to provide faster connection speeds.
184;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Rio Olympics 2016: NBC bets big on blockbuster  ;Network sells record $1.2bn in advertising, 20% more than London games;When Brazilian marathon runner Vanderlei de Lima lit the torch in Rio on Friday, it marked the latest chapter in NBC’s decades-long bet on the commercial success of the Olympic Games. The media group, which is owned by Comcast, paid $7.8bn to extend its deal to broadcast the Olympics until 2032, having started airing the games in 1964. For television companies like NBC, keen to dismiss pessimism over their future, the stakes for blockbuster events such as the Olympics have scarcely been higher. As audiences scatter across a growing choice of screens and stream their favourite shows days or weeks after they air, live sports are viewed as a rare safe bet for traditional television. Steve Burke, NBC chief executive, predicted Rio would be the most profitable Olympics in history.The network says it has already sold a record $1.2bn in advertising — 20 per cent more than final revenues from the London games in 2012, even as television audiences have shrunk by a third since then. In comparison, yearly television advertising sales have grown less than 6 per cent since 2012, according to Nielsen.More than three-quarters of sales for Rio came from primetime television buys, which had “gone up a bit” versus London thanks to expectations for higher ratings, said Seth Winter, vice-president of ad sales at NBC. Big cultural moments where groups of people sit down to watch the TV have become more scarce in recent years, prompting the spike in interest from advertisers, said Colleen Leddy of Droga5, an agency that made an Olympics ad featuring swimmer Michael Phelps for Under Armour. “Brands don't think about TV in the way they used to, because it’s not the only medium any more, but events like the Olympics prove that TV is still king.” “The value to ad buyers is much higher than it was four years ago,” says Bill Day of Frank N Magid associates, which consults to broadcasters. “It’s hard to find those massive bulks of consumers anywhere, let alone in a dedicated time-defined space.”NBC is set to air a whopping 6,700 hours of live coverage from Rio across 11 channels and dozens of live streams. It is the equivalent of watching every NFL game since 2008, according to Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive. This is expected to lift viewership after much of the London coverage was broadcast on delayed tapes, prompting outcry from audiences when results emerged on social media first. However, analysts are sceptical that the boosts from events like the Olympics can thwart the tide of cord-cutting, falling cable audiences and declining advertising revenues.Television owners have had reason to be optimistic so far this summer. This year’s so-called upfronts, at which television networks lure a large chunk of advertising commitments from buyers, saw bookings rise across the large broadcasters — ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox — after three years of declines. Networks have also seen ratings inflated by coverage of the US presidential race. But the question looming over media owners is whether these larger audiences can be sustained once the fanfare has ended. “The stage is set for a dramatic decline (in TV advertising) in 2017, when both political spending and Olympics-spend disappear,” said Rich Greenfield of BTIG. “Ratings are still pretty horrible. The media industry’s problem is there isn’t an Olympics every week.” There is little sign that the cord-cutting trend is waning. In the second quarter of this year, some of the largest cable and satellite providers — Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Dish — shed a combined 375,000 TV customers.Meanwhile, digital advertising is projected to outpace television advertising for the first time next year, as brands look to reach a younger generation that has eschewed cable boxes in favour of streaming video. Nearly 8 in 10 millennials said they would stream the Olympics live online, and 7 in 10 would do so on a mobile phone, according to a survey by the Rubicon Project. NBC has acknowledged the need to appeal to cord-cutters, even as it holds a tight grip over Olympics coverage. The network has for the first time allowed some social media companies, such as Snapchat and Facebook, rights to distribute highlights and clips of athlete interviews to drum up interest for the games. Meanwhile, Comcast is focused on capitalising on the Olympics frenzy to convince its customers of the value of their monthly cable TV bill. The largest US cable-TV provider is pumping out Olympics coverage through its new high-tech cable box, called the X1 — a robot-esque TV guide that Comcast compares to Amazon’s digital assistant, Alexa. The X1 will provide “one integrated Olympics dashboard”, through which viewers can speak commands into a remote to search between live cable programmes, digitally streamed highlight reels and videos, and real-time scoreboards. The box has been rolled out to about 40 per cent of Comcast’s 22m video subscribers. Comcast’s chief has called the X1’s Olympics platform a “laboratory” for the “future of television”. The 53-year-old company, which lost 4,000 TV customers last quarter, has placed a $7.8bn gamble that he will be proven right. 
185;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-08-03T15:49:50Z;Hulu valued at $5.8bn on Time Warner stake;Owner of HBO and CNN looks to appeal to ‘cord-cutters’ as it counters revenue slide;Time Warner has paid $583m for a 10 per cent stake in Hulu, valuing the video streaming company at $5.8bn, as the owner of HBO and CNN looks to appeal to a generation of “cord-cutting” consumers who are eschewing traditional television in favour of streaming. Hulu, the streaming site known for making episodes of TV shows available the day after they air, said in May that it would launch a live-TV service to directly compete with cable television providers.As part of the agreement with Time Warner, programmes from Turner’s TV channels, including TBS, CNN and Cartoon Network, will be included in Hulu’s live-streaming service which is expected to launch next year.The Hulu deal comes as Time Warner delivered a drop in second-quarter sales amid another weak performance from its Warner Bros film studio unit.Net sales for the June quarter fell 5 per cent to $7bn, although profits beat analyst expectations. Net income was down 2 per cent to $952m, or $1.20 a share, higher than the $1.16 a share projected by analysts.The company accordingly raised its full-year outlook. It expects 2016 adjusted diluted income per common share from continuing operations between $5.35 and $5.45, compared with $5.30-$5.40 previously.Time Warner’s investment “marks a major step for Hulu as we continue to redefine television for both consumers and advertisers”, said Mike Hopkins, Hulu’s chief executive.The $5.8bn price tag for Hulu is “slightly higher, but consistent” with valuation estimates, analysts at Bernstein said.The deal makes Time Warner the latest media conglomerate to take an interest in Hulu. The service was launched in 2008 as a joint project of NBCUniversal, now owned by Comcast, and News Corp, then-owner of Fox, with Disney taking a stake in 2009. Rocketing demand for online video is reshaping the US TV industry, as viewers look to watch shows over the internet on a screen of their choosing, rather than on a TV set.Time Warner’s investment in Hulu reflected a commitment to “allowing consumers to access high-quality content however they want it across a variety of platforms”, the company said.Netflix has dominated the race to capture digital audiences, counting 47m subscribers in the US and another 30m in the rest of the world, although its subscriber growth has slowed and led to an 18 per cent slide in its share price this year.At the same time, Hulu has rapidly reached 12m subscribers after adding quality content, including the hit Fox drama Empire and Seinfeld, the classic US sitcom, to its offerings. It has also signed agreements to make Hulu available through cable operators’ set-top boxes.As streaming gains in popularity, media owners have questioned whether they are getting fair payment for licensing content to digital platforms such as Hulu and Netflix. Hulu’s owners also face a conundrum in expanding the lossmaking company while maintaining lucrative relationships with cable providers.Fees to carry their channels in pay-TV packages make up a significant proportion of media owners’ revenues, and they also make millions of dollars in advertising sales from traditional television broadcasting. Both of those revenue streams will come under pressure if more consumers shed their cable subscriptions.Last year, Time Warner moved into digital streaming with HBO Now, a standalone streaming service which allows subscribers to watch HBO programmes and Hollywood films without a pay-television subscription. Shares in Time Warner were up 3.5 per cent in New York early trading, building on gains of nearly 20 per cent this year.
186;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-08-03T11:18:10Z;Time Warner takes 10% stake in Hulu;;Time Warner is stepping up its battle against Netflix by taking a stake in rival video streaming service Hulu.The owner of HBO and CNN announced on Wednesday that it will become a 10 per cent owner of Hulu, the streaming site best known for making new episodes of many TV shows available the day after they air.The terms of the deal were not disclosed. But as part of the agreement, programmes from Time Warner’s various networks – including TNT, TBS, CNN, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, truTV, Boomerang and Turner Classic Movies – will be made available live and on-demand on Hulu beginning next year.The investment will make Time Warner the latest media giant to take an interest in Hulu. Current investors already include The Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, and Comcast.“The investment in Hulu reflects Time Warner’s continued commitment to supporting innovative digital services that allow consumers to access high-quality content however they want it across a variety of platforms,” the company said in a statement.Rocketing demand for online video is reshaping the US TV industry and one of the biggest conundrums facing cable operators is how to appeal to a generation of “cord-cutting” consumers who are eschewing traditional pay-television packages.Last year Time Warner moved into internet streaming with HBO Now, a standalone streaming service which allows subscribers to watch HBO programmes and Hollywood films without a pay-television subscription.News of the Hulu deal comes as Time Warner delivered a drop in second quarter sales and profits amid another weak performance from its Warner Bros film studio unit.Net sales for the June quarter fell 5 per cent to $7bn while net income dropped 2 per cent to $952m. Nonetheless, the company is raising its full year outlook. It now expects 2016 adjusted diluted income per common share from continuing operations to come in between $5.35-$5.45, compared to its previous guidance of $5.30 to $5.40.Shares in Time Warner were up more than 3 per cent in pre-market trading.
187;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-07-31T15:09:13Z;The American consumer’s impotent rage;People sense that service providers pay more attention to regulators than to disaffected customers;Ask any American if they have lost their temper recently and there is a good chance it was on the phone to one of their service providers. Whether they were venting their spleen at a cable service company, a cell-phone operator, an airline or a health insurer hardly matters. What unites them is the impotent rage that comes from knowing how little you can do to punish the company in question.There was a time when the US consumer was still king. In most service markets, however, those days are over. If you are looking for a key to the American voter’s rage, keep in mind that the consumer is the same person. Most consumers — a steadily rising share according to surveys — are prone to moments of Trumpian rage nowadays. Lashing out usually makes things worse. But that is what people who feel powerless are liable to do.Many people’s instinct is to blame free markets for their sense of consumer impotence. In fact, the problem stems from lack of competition. Much like in politics, where congressional boundaries are rigged in favour of incumbents, most large US service sectors are dominated by a shrinking handful of players.Sectors where the top four companies have markedly increased their market share in the past decade — and thus their scope to treat consumers with impunity — include telecoms, information technology, transport, retail services and banking, according to a survey by The Economist. If you are still wondering why Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump did so well — taking more than 40 per cent of the two parties’ primary votes between them — both talked of how US politics is rigged. It is no accident that most Americans think the same about their economy.They have sound reasons to do so. The last people to grasp that things have gone wrong are the wealthy, the well-connected and the cognitive elites, which includes half the denizens of Washington. The wealthy’s share of the economy has risen sharply since the start of the century. The share of corporate profits in the economy has also soared.If you are rich you can afford what used to be normal for everyone — the privilege of interacting with human beings. Thus, high net worth individuals receive personalised banking, where your bank manager knows your name and needs. The wealthy also benefit from so-called concierge health services, which come with a human face. Many oligopolistic service providers keep clandestine lists of VIP customers who need not wade through robotic software before reaching a customer service agent. When they pick up the phone, a human answers.Ordinary consumers, much like most voters, know there are different rules for them. They also sense that the big service providers pay more attention to Washington regulators than to their disaffected customers. It is a perfectly rational thing to do. America’s capital is where the markets are rigged, after all.Politicians rank their priorities in much the same order. Voters come low on their list. Lawmakers devote chunks of their schedules to raising money from donors. In most districts, the voter barely matters since gerrymandering has rigged the election in favour of one or other party. Politicians with large war chests are far less likely to be challenged for their party’s nomination. The same logic leads companies to keep a strong lobbying presence in Washington.So what can people do? As consumers very little. If United Airlines keeps bumping you off flights, you might shift your mileage account to Delta or American. But your chances of mistreatment will not fall. Ditto for those who switch their health insurance from Cigna to Aetna, or their broadband from Comcast to Verizon. Perhaps you can start a new company? Alas, what goes in Silicon Valley for people seeking funding for social media start-ups does not apply to markets with high barriers to entry. America’s big four airlines might provide dismal service to most customers. But they are Olympic champions at stopping “open skies” competition.Maybe you should just shout at customer representatives? That is what many people do. But it usually backfires. Besides, on the rare occasions you reach a human, they are the last people you should berate. America’s mostly outsourced contact services industry is staffed by people reading instructions from a software manual. Every minute of their time is monitored. Consumers are not just voters — they are employees too.There are no easy ways to reduce market concentration, just as there are no easy fixes for corporate America’s grip on politics. But there are two simple ones. The first is to metastasise your consumer rage by voting for Mr Trump. This is the man who is best known to most Americans for saying “you’re fired” on television. For every problem America faces, he has a solution that is clear, simple and wrong. The second is to support aggressive antitrust action. Since Theodore Roosevelt’s presidency, trustbusting has a great history. It could also have a great future.Alas, no presidential nominee has yet found the conviction to champion breaking up the monopolies. The more is the pity. Taking on the titans would not just be great populism. It would also be smart policy.edward.luce@ft.com

The quarter’s year-over-year film revenues compared with a strong slate in the comparable period of 2015, which saw the release of Jurassic World.Weakness in film was somewhat offset by growth in the entertainment arm’s cable channels, where revenues rose 5 per cent to $2.6bn. NBCUniversal’s total revenues slipped 1.8 per cent to $7.1bn.Steve Burke, NBCUniversal’s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call that it had seen a 12.5 per cent price increase for its advertising sales during this summer’s so-called “upfront” selling season, citing strong demand for its cable channels and a healthy ad market.

190;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-07-19T15:23:20Z;Health insurers sink as DoJ said to prepare suits;;Shares in healthcare insurers were sinking fast on Tuesday after reports emerged that US anti-trust officials were preparing to file lawsuits to block two major deals in the sector.Anthem’s proposed $48.4bn takeover of rival Cigna and Aetna’s proposed $37bn tie-up with Humana are both in trouble after a Bloomberg report said the Justice Department is set to block the deals.The news sent shares in Anthem and Cigna down more than 3 per cent. Humana dropped 5.2 per cent while Aetna fell 4.3 per cent.Other smaller health insurers were also caught up in the sell-off. WellCare Health fell 2.5 per cent and Centene and Molina Healthcare were both down around 1.5 per cent.If the two deals do get blocked, it would add to the long list of big ticket mergers that have been thwarted since President Barack Obama came into power in 2009.According to an FT analysis of abandoned deals worth more than $10bn, more large M&A deals have been blocked by branches of the Obama administration than during the Clinton and Bush eras put together.In the past two years alone, the US government has blocked the $28bn tie up between Halliburton and Barker Hughes, torpedoed a $6.3bn merger between Staples and Office Depot, thwarted a $45bn deal between media giants Comcast and Time Warner Cable, crashed the $8.2bn marriage between food distributors Sysco and US Foods and derailed the proposed $200bn mega-merger of drug-making giants Pfizer and Allergan.
191;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Netflix: laying cable;A deal with Comcast helps, a little;The mic drop came six months ago: Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings announced the video-on-demand service was going live, immediately, in 130 new countries.Empire builders can be undone by the war at home. In the US, Netflix has a goal of 60-90m subscribers, up from 47m today. At the current growth rate it would hit 60m in 2020. That looks optimistic. There are only about 100m broadband-equipped households to play for and growth has been slowing, from 20 per cent year on year in 2014 to 13 per cent last quarter. At that rate of deceleration, US subscribers would plateau at about 54m.Still, a few million people here, a few million there and soon you’re talking real money. Jefferies models an additional $1bn in profit in 2020 if Netflix managed to hit 70m subscribers. That is important: in the past 12 months Netflix made just $320m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That little slice of profit must support an enterprise value of more than $40bn.US subscribers are profitable — Netflix’s new foreign customers are not — so it must push harder into the remaining US living rooms. Good news, then, that Netflix this week agreed a distribution deal with Comcast that will make Netflix available through its set-top boxes. Details are scant, but similar efforts including with Virgin Media in the UK have involved Netflix sacrificing some subscription revenue.In any case, the deal won’t get Netflix very far towards its target. Comcast has 23m video customers, but only a third have the required type of set-top box, and many of them are Netflix subscribers already. The deal may be defensive, though, making it easier for customers to watch Netflix rather than switch to rivals such as Amazon. Even with the deal it is hard to see Netflix achieving total US saturation — and thus pulling in the cash required for its overseas campaigns.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

193;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-06-30T14:16:18Z;Media groups must succeed at succession;Viacom battle is a lesson for Fox, Disney and New York Times;"Back when Sumner Redstone was a spry 85-year-old, he was asked how long he planned to continue working at Viacom and CBS. “I have no intention of ever retiring, or of dying,” was his emphatic, if optimistic, reply.Seven years later, age has sadly caught up with Mr Redstone, who no longer has an executive role at the two media groups he still controls.At Viacom, a carefully laid succession plan has unravelled: former advisers and confidants have been cast aside by Mr Redstone, who is housebound, while his daughter, Shari, has been accused by the Viacom board of manipulating her infirm father. A battle for management roles has made its way to the courts — and become very, very nasty.Other media companies would do well to look at the Viacom mess and think about their own plans. Succession is a challenge for all companies but, at media groups in particular, charismatic founders, chief executives or family owners tend to stick around longer than most.Some companies have handled it better than others. At Comcast, the US cable group that owns NBCUniversal, Ralph Roberts, its late founder, groomed his son, Brian to take over. Mr Roberts junior started at the bottom, working in sales, marketing and even “climbing poles” to install cable systems. When he succeeded his father in 1990, Comcast was generating annual revenues of $657m. It has since grown to become the world’s largest cable group with revenues close to $75bn last year.Rupert Murdoch recently turned 85 and continues to call the shots at News Corp and 21st Century Fox. For several years, all the talk around his print, television and satellite empire was about which of his children would win the race to become his anointed successor. Then, last year, his two sons, James and Lachlan, were given weighty new roles at Fox after the departure of Chase Carey, his long term lieutenant. James is now chief executive of Fox while Lachlan is executive chairman, alongside his father. Lachlan is also co-chairman of News Corp.So far, the transition has been smooth and successful, leaving Mr Murdoch more time to focus on other things — such as his new wife Jerry Hall.But other companies are still grappling with succession issues. Walt Disney has yet to find a successor to Bob Iger, who has led the company through a decade of growth, acquisitions — such as the purchases of Lucasfilm and Marvel — and international expansion.Jay Rasulo and Tom Staggs were the most likely candidates to succeed him when he retires in 2018 but that plan was upended recently when Disney parted company with Mr Staggs — apparently over his seeking early assurances that he would get the top job. With the clock ticking on Mr Iger’s departure, the Disney board must either find a new internal candidate, look elsewhere or, as is most likely, ask Mr Iger to postpone his retirement a third time.However, the most interesting succession race in media this year will take place at the New York Times, which is looking for a new publisher. For the past 24 years, the role has been held by Arthur Sulzberger Jr, a member of the family that has controlled the newspaper since 1896. Last month, though, the 64-year-old Mr Sulzberger told the company’s annual meeting he planned to appoint a deputy by next May.*This has started a race for the job and, while there is nothing technically to stop a non-Sulzberger from getting it, the unwritten rule at the newspaper — and the tradition over the last 120 years — is that it should be someone from the family.

Shares in in Twitter rose by the most in two months on Monday after Microsoft agreed to buy LinkedIn for $26.2bn. The deal has renewed speculations that the struggling messaging platform could be next in line to be swallowed up by one of the established tech majors.The company, best known for its 140-character tweets, saw its shares jump by as much as 9.1 per cent before paring back its gains to trade 6 per cent higher at $14.88.A takeover bid would come as welcome news to Twitter’s long suffering shareholders. The stock, having peaked shortly after its IPO in 2013 at $74.73 has fallen 60 per cent over the past year to a record low of $13.72 last month.Despite the return of Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder, at the helm last year, the company has struggled with sluggish user growth, which has been running below that at rival social platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.Few signs of a turnaround are fueling talks that the company might be better off being in the hands of a big tech company like Google or Facebook or even a media company like Comcast. With shares still trading near all-time lows despite Monday’s bounce, the stock is certainly getting cheap enough for someone to take a look.
195;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-06-06T22:01:59Z;China’s richest man battles Disney for hearts and wallets;Dalian Wanda and US group fight for Chinese theme park visitors;As Disney’s Magic Kingdom prepares to enter the Middle Kingdom, China’s richest man has geared up to do battle with Mickey Mouse for the hearts of the country’s children — and their parents’ wallets.Wang Jianlin, billionaire real estate tycoon and chairman of the property and entertainment conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, is wagering that his $3bn investment in a new children’s theme park will draw a newly flush middle class through its gates in big numbers.Wanda City, a leisure resort that opened late last month in Nanchang, southern China, is banking on its ability to satisfy local tastes. It opened to a ceremony of dancing lions and obligatory speeches from local party chiefs. Attractions include China’s tallest and longest rollercoasters, and a mall designed to evoke a Chinese tea-set.Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company, meanwhile is also betting on the new thirst in China for leisure activities. The US company’s first Disneyland resort in mainland China opens in Shanghai on June 16 — a Rmb55bn ($8bn) joint venture with three government-owned companies.The US media conglomerate is banking on its international movie hits to attract impressionable youngsters and obliging parents. Its new park features attractions based on Pirates of the Caribbean and superhero pictures such as Iron Man and Avengers Assemble.The US company is deploying its globally recognised characters, including Elsa and Anna from the 2013 hit Frozen, to draw visitors from across China, where per capita income has grown 20-fold in a generation.But Mr Wang — with a fortune estimated by Forbes of $34bn — says he does not fear Disney’s formidable advantage in name-recognition and cartoon icons. His company plans to create a plethora of cheaper venues across the country to woo urban white-collar workers looking for a quick weekend day out rather than a blowout holiday.“The days of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck creating a frenzy are over,” he told China Central Television last month. “One tiger is no match for a pack of wolves — Shanghai has one Disney, while Wanda, across the nation, will open 15 to 20 Wanda Cities.”Tiger Hou, a partner at Ent Group, the Chinese entertainment consulting firm, says Disney has “a real edge” against local theme parks because of its famous characters.“Disney parks are special enough for Chinese consumers to be willing to pay a premium price to see their and their children's favourite characters. Local theme parks can provide only a lesser experience, and many are homogeneous,” he addsHistorically theme-park chains have been the reserve of companies with the deep coffers needed to pour billions into upkeep of existing attractions, as well as regularly opening new rides to draw customers back year after year.In the US, Disney and Comcast, the US cable company that owns the Universal chain of theme parks, are among the big players. But Disney has been raising overall ticket prices above the rate of inflation for several years running, a pattern that could become unsustainable if it pushes the parks out of the reach of middle-class parents. The company is now considering offering cheaper “off-peak” prices at slower times of the year to increase overall attendance and counteract seasonal crowding.In China, Disney’s ticket prices are double those of Mr Wang’s Wanda Park: a weekend day admission is a steep Rmb499, compared with Rmb248 for Wanda Park.As well as being more affordable, Mr Wang’s parks rely on their ability to adapt to the local culture and climate — although a recent walk through a Wanda City park showed revellers taking photos next to storm trooper characters from the Star Wars movies. Disney said it would take legal action after a woman in a Snow White costume was spotted in the Wanda Mall recently.But Wanda City is also seeking to create a uniquely Chinese experience. Revellers can fly over Jiangxi province in a flight simulator in the Wanda Mall, dragon-boat across the water park, or follow a path through a 10m-high bamboo forest to reach China's longest rollercoaster, made of wood.On a recent visit, resort attendants, always in groups of threes, beamed around every corner, staffing small cafés and buffet restaurants. “Wanda reflects my principles — to bring happiness to families across China,” said a young tour guide, Zou Jiali, with a steady smile.Analysts say the competition between the two entertainment giants should be positive for both companies if it energises the country’s cash-starved theme-park industry. Up to now, Chinese consumers have been reluctant to splash out on attractions. They spend a mere $3 per person annually on theme parks, compared with $58 in the US, according to Richard Huang, who analyses China’s entertainment industry for Nomura investment bank in Hong Kong.Both Disney and Wanda should also benefit from the government’s plans to create more national holidays and high-speed rail lines, says Reto Wilhelm, general manager for the Chinese arm of the Thomas Cook tourism company.Liu Zhaohui, who does consulting for theme parks in China, estimates that 70 per cent of China’s theme parks lose money, mainly because of poor management. “Disney’s advantage is that it would bring proper management to the sector,” he says.“It’s going to be a whole different landscape when you have quality theme parks, because the supply will create the demand,” says Mr Huang. He noted that when Disney opened a Hong Kong theme park, the nearby attraction Ocean Park feared losing customers but actually gained attendance.That could happen again on the mainland, if one Nanchang family visiting Wanda City is representative. The mother said their day out at the new theme park was just the beginning. “We’ll try to see all the major parks,” she said.Additional reporting by Ma Fangjing——The international battle over theme parksIn the US, Disney’s main challenger in the theme park industry is also a company in the entertainment business: Comcast, the cable company.Comcast acquired NBCUniversal in 2010 and has surprised analysts by pouring billions in capital expenditure at its Universal theme parks in Florida and California.Much of the spending has focused on building Harry Potter-themed locations within its Universal resorts, include a Hogwarts Castle within its Los Angeles resort. In 2007, Universal gained a theme-park licence for the wizard franchise from Warner Brothers, makers of the Harry Potter movies, and J.K. Rowling, author of the books. Between 2009 and 2015, attendance at Universal’s parks doubled to 43m, with the growth credited to the fascination with the boy wizard.Other thematic tie-ups between movies and theme parks are on their way. US film studio Lionsgate is working with property developers to create resorts in Atlanta and Macau based on The Hunger Games books and movies.British attractions operator Merlin has benefited from having the worldwide licensing rights to the Legoland brand and attractions based on the plastic toy bricks. Kirkbi, the Danish holding company for the family of billionaire Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, are the majority shareholders in the Lego group and also own 30 per cent of Merlin.The partnership may prove crucial, with three Lego animated films scheduled before 2018. Following the release of The Lego Movie in 2014, a feature that grossed an estimated $460m worldwide, Merlin saw operating profits from its Legoland parks grow by 21.1 per cent once currency movements were stripped out.The company plans to add to its six Legoland parks worldwide, with work under way in Dubai, Japan and South Korea, by 2018. The company is also in talks to open more Legoland resorts in China and the US. Merlin has said its growth will be pinned on the “rapid growth of the middle classes, notably China, who have an appetite to consume high-quality, branded entertainment options and to travel”.
196;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-05-11T08:54:16Z;Disney: winter soldier;The group is in a fight. Bet on it to win;"“Civil War” is the subtitle of Walt Disney’s latest Captain America blockbuster. Inside Disney itself, the situation is not that bad, but the abrupt departure of the heir apparent to boss Bob Iger, added to patchy business performance, is not a recipe for harmony. Disney is indeed in a sort of battle. It is fortunate to be so well armed.Shares in Disney fell 5 per cent after-hours on Tuesday after quarterly earnings missed estimates for the first time in five years. Growth was anaemic in theme parks and hotels; it was non-existent in media networks and consumer products. On the earnings call, Mr Iger refused to explain the departure of his presumed successor Tom Staggs.After the decline in share price Disney trades at a less-than-fairytale 17 times earnings. It deserves a fatter premium to peers because of the studio division, which Mr Iger proclaimed was “firing on more than all cylinders”. It is: revenues rose 22 per cent year-on-year operating income was up 27 per cent. You have to go back to 2003 to find a six-month period when Disney made so much movie revenue. The $1.5bn in operating income in the first half has never been matched. The acquisitions of Marvel and Pixar have brought a consistency that is rare in the boom-and-bust film world.This is not an immediate answer to the loss of pay TV subscribers that has hit Disney’s ESPN sports network, formerly the profit engine for the entire company. But it is certainly the right long-term response. Movies beget steadier streams of revenue, from theme parks to merchandise. All this provides a cushion while Disney negotiates the new world of video distribution.Supposedly, Disney should be worried about angering the cable and telecom companies that controlled video distribution for so long. Mr Iger, wisely, shows complete insouciance. He will negotiate deals with new entrants, invest in Hulu, the video site backed by Comcast, 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney. He noted that Comcast moved on to his turf by getting in the content business with the acquisition of NBCUniversal. Better to have the cards in the form of content that consumers want and work out how to deliver it than be CBS or Viacom, with their sagging ratings, or the cable companies, whose customers are slipping away. This is a cold war, and one that Disney should win.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
197;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-05-05T18:27:28Z;US election ad spending boon a welcome respite for TV groups;Surging campaign advertising revenues help ease anxiety over broadcasters’ challenges;It was as if the past nine months never happened. The anxiety that has swept the US media sector since last summer, driven by concerns about cord-cutting, falling cable television audiences and declining advertising revenues, dissipated this week as some of its biggest companies reported healthy rebounds in ratings and spending by brands.US media is not out of the woods yet, judging by the tepid welcome investors gave to stronger first-quarter results from Time Warner and 21st Century Fox. But as the companies acknowledged on earnings calls, the profit rebound has been partly driven by bigger audiences at their cable news networks, CNN and Fox News Channel — and for that, they have Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and a remarkable presidential election campaign to thank.The raucous spectacle of the race for the White House has been a boon for news networks. Fox News Channel was the most-watched basic cable network for the first time on the back of soaring primetime ratings, which rose 35 per cent in the first quarter, while primetime ratings at both CNN and the Comcast-owned MSNBC are up more than 100 per cent.The question for network owners is whether these larger audiences can be sustained beyond November — or whether they are indicative of a one-off, election-related blip.“We don’t view the underlying driver [of Time Warner’s quarterly results] — political-driven growth at CNN — as strong evidence that cable network advertising is the picture of health,” said Doug Creutz, analyst at Cowen and Company. “We continue to suspect that the TV ad market is currently seeing a strong patch rather than a real, lasting improvement.”The macro picture for channel owners, and for the cable and satellite owners that distribute them, is similarly discouraging because there is little sign that the cord-cutting trend— the cancellation of pay television services in favour of cheaper, online alternatives — is waning.The 13 biggest US pay-TV providers shed a combined 383,000 video subscribers last year, according to Leichtman Research Group.MoffettNathanson, the research firm, does not expect any rebound in cable or satellite subscriber numbers. In fact, it expects the picture to get worse. “It’s hard not to see this as the calm before the storm,” they wrote in a note to clients this week.Still, US media companies are determined to take advantage of this year’s political windfall as candidates, from the presidential contenders to those running for local office, and the deep-pocketed political action committees that support and oppose them, pour money into television. An estimated $4.4bn will be spent on TV ads for the 2016 election, up from $3.8bn in 2012, according to projections from Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group.At CBS, which operates a broadcast network and a portfolio of stations in local markets, political advertising is “the strongest we’ve seen in several election cycles”, said Les Moonves, chief executive.Mr Trump’s campaign has relied on a barrage of free coverage, his large social media following and his willingness to be interviewed in person or by phone, rather than promoting its message with paid advertising. However, this has not dented Mr Moonves’ enthusiasm for the next six months until November’s election.We continue to suspect that the TV ad market is currently seeing a strong patch rather than a real, lasting improvement“Clearly, there are a lot of fireworks yet to come, and with those fireworks will come more revenue,” Mr Moonves told investors this week. When spending by candidates in local races is also factored in, he said CBS would “set a new record . . . for political revenue in a presidential election year”.Comcast similarly said high-margin political revenue had already boosted its local stations’ advertising growth from 7.6 per cent to 12.1 per cent in the first quarter and would provide “more significant” support to profits in the second half of the year.At Time Warner, the twin ratings bonanzas of the US election and the March Madness college basketball tournament drove a 5 per cent surge in first-quarter advertising sales, helping the company top earnings expectations.“Most of the growth did come from both news and sports,” Howard Averill, chief financial officer, said on Time Warner’s earnings call. But he acknowledged that on its entertainment networks, “the audience levels were down a bit”.For TV networks lacking news and sports content, the picture is more mixed. At Viacom, whose cable channels include MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, domestic advertising sales fell 5 per cent because of weaker ratings.While cord-cutting concerns loom over the sector, US media companies are exploring new ways to deliver their programming to audiences. This week Hulu, the online streaming service jointly owned by Walt Disney, Fox, and Comcast’s NBCUniversal, revealed it was moving into live television, with plans to launch a lower-cost bundle of cable and broadcast networks that would rival offerings from cable and satellite providers. YouTube and other digital providers are working on similar services.As viewers drift away from traditional television, media companies know they have work to do to make sure their content can be found on other platforms. “I think our view is that we’d like to make our programming more available, not less,” James Murdoch, Fox’s chief executive, told investors this week.For now, though, political spending is masking the structural challenges facing owners of television and cable networks. Much could change before November but if six months is a long time in politics, it could feel desperately short to media companies anxious about the future.Digital video rivals take aim at TV dollarsIn the same week that TV executives were toasting the resurgence of their advertising sales, digital media groups were making their own pitches for marketers’ dollars at the annual “newfronts” presentations in New York.Clearly, there are a lot of fireworks yet to come, and with those fireworks will come more revenueThe newfronts are the online video world’s answer to TV’s “upfronts”, when big network owners sell the majority of their commercial inventory ahead of their new broadcasting season.Hulu trotted out the stars of Comedy Central’s Broad City to host its presentation while Hearst’s show included a live dance performance from actor Channing Tatum.But this year’s flashy parties are taking place amid concerns about whether there is too much digital inventory to sustain the sector’s growth.Some of the biggest digital players, including BuzzFeed, Vice Media and Vox Media have set their sights on traditional television which, despite pressure on ratings, remains more profitable than online video.Vox, which like BuzzFeed is part-owned by NBCUniversal, said this week it would produce a new property programme for A&E Networks, which is part owned by Disney, and make digital content for NBC’s sports division and its Spanish language Telemundo brand.Vice, which has already launched its own cable network and makes programmes for HBO, struck a deal to produce series for ESPN, the Disney-owned sports channel. Whatever the challenges facing television, it offers more growth potential than online video — for the moment, at least.

The deal, worth $4.1bn after including DWA’s debt, has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close by the end of this year.“DreamWorks will help us grow our film, television, theme parks and consumer products businesses for years to come,” said Steve Burke, NBCU chief executive, praising DWA’s “dynamic film brand and a deep library of intellectual property”.Comcast, the largest US cable television provider and owner of the NBC TV networks and Universal Pictures film studio, has been on the hunt for content-focused deals since its planned $45bn acquisition of Time Warner Cable was sunk by regulatory concerns last year.Following the model of Walt Disney, the world’s largest media company, Comcast has ploughed money into theme parks, building a $3.3bn Universal Studios outpost in Beijing and adding Harry Potter attractions in Orlando and Los Angeles. Parks revenue jumped 57.5 per cent to $1bn in the first quarter, boosted by Comcast’s purchase of a majority stake in Universal Studios Japan. NBCU has also scored its own animated hits with Despicable Me and Minions.Adding DWA’s franchises to the mix could help Comcast further expand its parks and fuel merchandise sales — taking another cue from Disney, whose transformational deals for Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm in the last decade have bolstered its roster of brands and characters and propelled earnings to record levels.DWA will also give NBCU new roads into China, which is projected to overtake the US as the world’s largest film market by 2017. In 2012 it launched Oriental DreamWorks, a joint venture with three state-owned media groups.The deal brings to a close DWA’s long-running series of flirtations with buyers. Previous talks with SoftBank, the Japanese technology group founded by Masayoshi Son, Hasbro, the US toymaker, and Dalian Wanda, the property and media group controlled by Wang Jianlin, China’s richest man, all fizzled.Jeffrey Katzenberg, DWA’s chief executive who has been the driving force behind sales talks in recent years, said: “Having spent the past two decades working together with our team to build DreamWorks Animation into one of the world’s most beloved brands, I am proud to say that NBCUniversal is the perfect home for our company; a home that will embrace the legacy of our storytelling and grow our businesses to their fullest potential.”Mr Katzenberg will become chairman of DreamWorks New Media, which includes the company’s stake in AwesomenessTV, the teen-focused digital media network, and serve as a consultant to NBCU.The animation company was spun out of DreamWorks, the studio started by music executive David Geffen, film director Steven Spielberg and Mr Katzenberg, in 2004.DWA has found box office success over the years with children-friendly titles such as the Shrek, Madagascar and How to Train Your Dragon series.But it has also stumbled, taking writedowns on unsuccessful movies including Rise of the Guardians, The Penguins of Madagascar and Mr Peabody & Sherman.

But people close to the matter said the conversations between the companies were serious.DWA declined to comment. Comcast said it would not respond to ""rumours or speculation about any M&A transaction” during its quarterly earnings conference call with analysts on Wednesday. The talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.DWA has flirted with a sale on several occasions in recent years, but previous talks with SoftBank, the Japanese technology group founded by Masayoshi Son, Hasbro, the US toymaker, and Dalian Wanda, the property and media group controlled by Wang Jianlin, China’s richest man, all fizzled.DWA was spun out of DreamWorks, the studio started by David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, in 2004.

Last year DWA axed almost a quarter of its workforce and reshuffled senior management as part of a restructuring of its animated film business following a string of box office disappointments. Mr Katzenberg has been the driving force behind previous sales talks over the years.For Comcast, which is the largest US cable television provider and owns the NBC TV networks, buying DWA would boost both its film business and its desires to expand in China’s booming entertainment market.The company behind the Despicable Me and Minions films is building a $3.3bn Universal Studios theme park in Beijing, scheduled to open in 2019. Earlier this year, Universal Pictures struck a deal for $250m in film financing from China’s Perfect World Pictures, a television and film production and distribution company.Ever since Comcast’s planned $45bn merger with Time Warner Cable was scrapped by regulatory concerns last year, the Philadelphia-based company has been on the hunt for content-focused deals. “Their name has been linked to pretty much every possible studio deal out on the market,” said an entertainment banker who is not directly involved in the talks. DWA’s stock closed at $27.12 on Tuesday, giving it a market value of about $2.3bn.Shares of the California-based animation group gained 18.7 per cent on Wednesday. Comcast was up 0.4 per cent as it reported stronger than expected revenue, profit and subscriber gains in the first quarter of 2016.DWA also holds a controlling stake in AwesomenessTV, the teen-focused digital media network, and recently signed an expanded multiyear deal with Netflix to stream its films and television series globally.“The deal would secure Universal with a well-established animation studio, a burgeoning TV business, and two gems in the portfolio: AwesomenessTV and Oriental DreamWorks [its Chinese joint venture with three state-owned media groups],” Amy Yong, Macquarie analyst, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. “In the hands of Comcast, we expect DreamWorks could significantly expand its IP including Kung Fu Panda into additional outlets beyond consumer products.”1994 Founded as part of DreamWorks, the movie studio set up by director Steven Spielberg, music producer David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the former chairman of Walt Disney Studios1997 Forms partnership with Aardman Animations, the British stop-motion animation studio, co-producing and distributing Chicken Run2004 Spun off as DreamWorks Animation SKG and floated on Nasdaq2012 Buys Classic Media, creator of historical series including Casper the Friendly Ghost, Where’s Waldo? and Lassie for $155m.

201;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast profits top estimates as subscribers grow;;Comcast shrugged off the media industry’s cord-cutting fears, reporting stronger than expected revenue, profit and subscriber gains in the first quarter of 2016.The US’s largest cable television provider, which also owns the NBCUniversal TV and film group, has been investing in technology and customer service since its planned $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable was scrapped by regulatory concerns last year.Aggressive promotions of a new set-top box and operating system appear to be paying off. Comcast added 53,000 cable video subscribers in the quarter, compared with a loss of 8,000 a year ago and well above the 32,000 to 35,000 additions forecast by analysts. It was the company’s best first quarter of video growth in nine years, writes Shannon Bond in New York.First-quarter net income rose 3.6 per cent to $2.13bn, or 87 cents a share, from $2.06bn, or 81 cents a share, a year ago. On an adjusted basis, earnings of 84 cents a share beat Wall Street’s estimate of 79 cents.Revenue also exceeded expectations with a 5.3 per cent increase to $18.8bn from $17.9bn, compared with forecasts of $18.6bn.The resilience of Comcast’s cable distribution business contrasts with growing pessimism in the media industry in recent months. The sector has been rocked by concerns that with a proliferation of new ways to watch TV and films online, more consumers will “cut the cord”, or cancel their pay-TV subscriptions. The 13 biggest US pay-TV providers, including Comcast, its cable rivals, satellite companies and telecoms groups, shed a combined 383,000 video subscribers last year, according to Leichtman Research Group.Comcast also recorded strong growth in the quarter in its high-speed internet service, which accounts for the majority of its subscription business. It added 438,000 customers, ahead of analysts’ consensus estimates of 389,000.In total Comcast gained a net 269,000 subscribers, up from 199,000 customers in the same period a year ago.Revenue from the cable and internet business was up 6.7 per cent to $12.2bn.NBC Universal revenue rose 3.9 per cent to $6.9bn. Sales at the theme parks jumped 57.5 per cent to $1bn, boosted by Comcast’s acquisition of a majority stake in Universal Studios Japan last year.Cable network revenue rose 4 per cent to $2.4bn while broadcast TV slipped 7.3 per cent to $2.1bn. However, excluding the impact of the 2015 Super Bowl, which aired on NBC, broadcast revenue was up 11.4 per cent. Advertising revenue at NBC’s broadcast networks sank 17.2 per cent while cable ad sales were flat.Filmed entertainment revenue dipped 4.3 per cent to $1.4bn from the first quarter of 2015, which saw the release of 50 Shades of Grey.The results come a day after the WSJ reported that Comcast is in talks to buy DreamWorks Animations.
202;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-04-07T16:40:41Z;M&A deals worth $370bn torpedoed by Obama administration;Corporate America dismayed by latest government intervention to block takeovers;"US companies have abandoned $370bn of large deals since President Barack Obama came into power in 2009, after regulators in his administration blocked an unprecedented number of transactions to protect competition, jobs and the US tax base.Corporate America responded with dismay on Tuesday after the US Treasury proposed new rules that torpedoed Pfizer’s takeover of Dublin-based Allergan, worth $160bn, or $190bn including debt, in an attempt to stop the drugmaker moving its headquarters to Ireland so it could avoid billions of dollars in US taxes. It was the latest in a series of interventions by branches of the Obama administration, which has thwarted more big-ticket mergers and acquisitions than were blocked during the Clinton and Bush eras put together, according to an FT analysis of abandoned deals worth more than $10bn.In 2014, AbbVie pulled the plug on its $55bn takeover of Ireland-based Shire — another “inversion” that would have enabled it to slash its US tax bill — following a similar putative rule change by the US Treasury. The administration has also blocked several big telecoms deals in an attempt to protect competition. Comcast withdrew its $71bn takeover of Time Warner Cable last year, after the Department of Justice signalled it would try to stop the deal, which drew widespread opposition from campaigners who said it would create a broadband monopoly and hurt “net neutrality”. AT&T dropped its $39bn bid for T-Mobile US in 2011 after the DoJ sued to block the deal, while Nasdaq’s $11bn attempt to take over the New York Stock Exchange was thwarted by antitrust concerns. In contrast, the George W Bush administration blocked just one large deal — the $27bn takeover of Hughes Electronic by EchoStar, the satellite TV group. Two big M&A transactions were torpedoed under Bill Clinton: the $12bn takeover of military supplier Northrop Grumman by its larger rival Lockheed Martin, and MCI WorldCom’s $125bn bid for Sprint, the mobile phone network. The interventionist posture has provoked anger on Wall Street. One large life sciences investor with holdings in Pfizer, Allergan and AbbVie said the administration was building an “artificial prison for pharmaceutical companies, rather than dealing with the underlying issue” of relatively high taxes for US companies. An investment banker said the deal highlighted how the White House had succumbed to a “leftist rhetoric” that had its roots in the aftermath of the financial crisis and which has since been embodied by Bernie Sanders’ campaign for the presidency.However, administration officials argue that the Obama era has coincided not only with a series of tax inversions, but also with an unprecedented level of dealmaking. They believe some sectors are in danger of becoming uncompetitive after decades of consolidation. In a speech on Wednesday night, Loretta Lynch, US attorney-general, said the DoJ would “not allow management to increase investor value at the expense of the individual consumer"".She added: “Consolidation among major competitors — especially in already concentrated industries — raises serious concerns about higher prices, lower output, diminished quality and flagging innovation.” The US government cited antitrust concerns this week when it filed a lawsuit to block the proposed $25bn takeover by oil services group Halliburton of its rival Baker Hughes.Debbie Feinstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission’s competition bureau, told the Financial Times: “There’s no question that we’re going to be aggressive against conduct or mergers that are going to harm competition or consumers. That’s our job and we take it very seriously and we’re going to do it very carefully. We’re not afraid to litigate.”Additional reporting by James Fontanella-KhanTax inversions are adjustments to competitive reality / From George Nastas III"
203;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-04-06T17:07:46Z;M&A failures: deep breaths;Clever merger contracts are no match for determined regulators;What were they thinking? The largest US cable TV company tried to buy the second largest. The second and third-largest oil services groups aimed to merge. The country’s best-known drugmaker trying to move abroad to lower its tax bill. Those three deals (Comcast/Time Warner Cable, Halliburton/Baker Hughes, and Pfizer/Allergan) ran into regulatory problems and were blocked — all, in retrospect, entirely predictably.These mishaps have marred an otherwise extraordinary bull market in dealmaking. This post-crisis boom was supposed to be about renewed confidence among chief executives and boards. The confidence turned out to be based on having shareholder money to spend, not the health of their underlying businesses.In the wake of the financial crisis, companies hunkered down and slashed costs. Margins eventually rallied even if global economic growth was uneven. The GAAP S&P profit margin peaked in late 2014. But economic slack and deflation combined to stifle organic revenue growth. Even with $450bn of annual buybacks among the S&P 500, earnings per share for the index did not grow in 2015, Deutsche Bank data show. Only modest growth is forecast for 2016.With costs squeezed out and demand weak, acquisitions are all that is left. Companies have been creative in concocting schemes to placate regulators. Comcast and Time Warner offered to create and spin-off a competitor.The Department of Justice described the $7.5bn of asset sales that Halliburton/Baker Hughes proposed as among the most complex ever offered. Rather than accepting these remedies, US antitrust regulators just blocked the deals. On the tax front, regulators wrote new rules to force the companies themselves to rethink their deals.Desperate CEOs and fee-hungry advisers have been a potent mix. It is time they put less effort into outsmarting regulators and more into igniting their top lines.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
204;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
205;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;US television: Trump card;An election year boost in ads is welcome — but heavily discounted;"Make America great again. Donald Trump’s vision for the US may be grotesque for many but its citizens cannot get enough of the gory details. First-quarter ratings data released by Nielsen on Tuesday showed spectacular increases for cable television news. Fox News became the most watched cable network, passing the mighty ESPN. Traditional laggard CNN saw its primetime rating jump 135 per cent, although it still attracts only half the audience of Fox.For pay-TV networks such as Fox, Comcast and Time Warner, this provides a welcome fillip against a background of audience declines in the past two years. The boost from the election is part of a broader stabilisation in advertising revenue. Twenty First Century Fox noted recently that ad pricing was up 20 per cent for a broad range of purchasers, including carmakers and telecommunications companies. Late last year, Wells Fargo estimated that political ad spending in 2016 would hit $6bn, up 16 per cent from the previous presidential race in 2012.Even greater beneficiaries are local station groups in areas where there are competitive races (the US presidential race is contested state by state). Companies such as Sinclair, Nexstar, Tegna and EW Scripps that each own dozens of local stations see wild swings in revenue driven by the election cycle; Sinclair’s first-quarter forecast is running 60-80 per cent higher than 2012. One worry is that Mr Trump, favourite for the Republican nomination, will stick to his existing media strategy: rather than splurge on political ads, this relies on appearances on news programmes, controversy and snarky tweets.Even if Mr Trump and the Republicans wage war on the airwaves through to November, local TV groups should not expect too much credit. Nothing could be more predictably cyclical than the four-yearly parade of presidential candidates. The structural story is still tough.

206;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2016-03-20T16:52:23Z;Valeant is the latest troubled roll-up to unravel;Beware of platform companies that engage in little more than financial engineering;The stunning collapse in the shares of Valeant, until recently a fast-growing Canadian pharmaceuticals company, has been garnering the headlines in recent days. But it isn’t the only so-called platform company to have hit difficulty.The stock market is full of stories about the woes of these financial constructs. Sometimes known less flatteringly as “roll-ups”, they are companies that expand by continually buying rivals in musty and unloved segments of the market, supposedly squeezing out efficiencies as they go along.Investors are belatedly discovering that not all these roll-ups necessarily benefit from scale-economies or other genuine economic forces. Many seem to have simply been going through the motions, propelled by managers and financiers who coin it even if value is destroyed.After a period of strong outperformance, these are now unravelling nastily. Perhaps the highest-profile casualty is Valeant. Following a series of ever-larger acquisitions that culminated in last year’s $11bn purchase of Salix Pharmaceuticals, the company has been hit by selling over concerns about its dependence for sales growth on politically contentious price rises, aggressive accounting practices and its $30bn of net debt. From a high of $257 last July, its shares have fallen to $27, valuing the group at just $9bn.Valeant is just one in a line of limping wounded. Altice, an Amsterdam-listed telecoms stock that once talked bravely of its ambition to buy the US cable giant Comcast, has almost halved from its highs last summer. The chemicals roll-up, Platform Specialty Products, and a consumer products conglomerate, Nomad Foods, are both down by about two-thirds.Platform companies are hardly a new phenomenon, and, of course, not all end in failure. Perhaps the greatest roll-up in history involves Anheuser-Busch InBev, which began as a merger between two obscure Brazilian brewers in 1999 and is now, many deals later, one of the world’s biggest companies.But they do have a tendency to wax and wane more fiercely and quickly than most listed companies. It is a pattern that goes back at least as far as the US conglomerate boom of the late 1960s, when deal-addicted groups such as ITT and Leasco bestrode the stock markets, only to go into sharp decline a few years later. Nor does history suggest that platform companies are exactly reliable moneymakers for investors. A study of the 1990s roll-up boom by Keith Brown, Amy Dittmar and Henri Servaes, concluded that overall investors lost out.While the practice of consolidating obscure sectors, such as waste management or funeral parlours, can unearth genuine synergies, the problem is that many platform companies engage in little more than financial engineering. Gifted a high share price by enthusiastic investors, their main focus is on buying lower-rated companies either for shares (or even better for debt) in order to create the appearance of growth through immediate boosts to earnings per share.The need for continuous and ever larger acquisitions ultimately narrows the field of targets, increasing the chance of overpaying. It doesn’t help when roll-ups cluster around sectors, as the latest boom has encircled drugmakers. Valeant, for instance, ended up going toe to toe with another roll-up, Endo, in the bidding war for Salix.Valeant said on Monday that chief executive Mike Pearson would be stepping down. The FT’s David Crow and Sujeet Indap discuss the company’s future.But most platform companies ultimately unwind because they depend excessively on momentum. Take away any of the components that allow them to continue the stream of acquisitions — the high stock price, permissive regulations or cheap debt — and the whole artful construct crumples. All you are left with is a morass of semi-integrated businesses. Like Valeant, which is struggling even to put out audited numbers, many roll-ups end up wrestling with the sheer complexity of what they have built.Of course just because many roll-ups don’t work doesn’t mean you can’t make money out of them. Wall Street adores platform companies because of the lovely fees they generate.Hedge funds, too, have been big backers of the platform company phenomenon. But that is not so surprising when you think of the way the famed “2 and 20” fee model favours momentum investing. A hedge fund that invested $150m in Valeant shares in 2010 would have banked nearly $400m in non-returnable management and performance fees since then. Deducting those from the stake’s now shrivelled value, the underlying investor would have lost the lot.Ordinary investors should approach roll-ups with great caution. History suggests that what drives their value has less to do with their viability as businesses than whether capital is flowing in or out of them. With the tide now strongly ebbing, holders of platform company stock should beware.jonathan.ford@ft.comValeant investors forgot the first C of credit / From Paul Drexler

Investors waiting for its merger with Charter Communications to close will be hoping not. Share price movements suggest that they have been right to keep the faith.It is more than two years since TWC inked a surprise deal with Comcast Corp to assemble America’s largest cable television and broadband provider. A surprisingly fierce opposition effort sunk that deal last year. Plan B was a back-up deal with John Malone’s Charter Communications, a combination thought to be less controversial. Three months after a targeted closing date, TWC may still need another three months to finish the job.In the rapidly consolidating pay-TV world, Charter/TWC may not even be the most precarious transaction. French operator Altice is trying to crack the American market. After picking up the second-tier operator Suddenlink for $9bn it offered $18bn for New York provider Cablevision last autumn. To get investors on board, it had to pay all cash. That will push its debt to six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation post-completion.Like many a French tourist, Altice got sidetracked in New York. Regulators there are wondering just how much worse customer service will get as Altice attempts to root out $900m in annual cost savings. Those are deep cuts — half of Cablevision’s existing earnings — but it will need them to help meet its interest bills.The most recent concerns for the TWC deal come not from national regulators, but from the California authorities, who must also sign off the combination. The deal should close in early summer, probably in exchange for more concessions to consumers.For merger arbs, closing spreads are narrowing; not so long ago, share prices were at 10 per cent discounts to the deal values. But the gauntlet of approvals show that such trades still require strong stomachs.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
208;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Newly-issued corporate debt dominate trade;;Of the ten most actively traded bonds on Wednesday, nine were sold on Tuesday.Bonds issued by Apple, Comcast and IBM dominated trade in corporate debt markets on Wednesday, as the secondary and primary markets showed renewed signs of life.The iPhone maker, which issued $12bn of the $22bn of US corporate bonds sold on Tuesday, accounted for more than half of the volume of the top ten most traded bonds, US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt reports.Spreads on its new debt that mature in 2021, 2023, 2026, 2036 and 2046, all tightened, data from bond trading platform MarketAxess showed.Apple’s new 30 year paper, which has a coupon of 4.65 per cent and was sold to yield 4.686 per cent, tightened to trade with a yield of 4.65 per cent. Earlier in the day, the yield had hit a low of 4.529 per cent as the bond price rallied to 101.963 cents on the dollar. Yields move inversely to prices.Comcast’s new debt also gained, with the spread on its 3.15 per cent coupon notes that mature in 10 years falling to 130 basis points above the 10-year Treasury. The US media company had sold the debt with a yield 140 basis points above the benchmark Treasury.New paper issued by IBM was also changing hands quickly, but was just barely firmer in comparison to the price the debt was sold at yesterday.The only bond to crack the top ten not issued on Tuesday: Anheuser-Busch InBev debt sold earlier this year as part of its $46bn mega bond deal.

In the junk market, Prestige Brands raised $350m, US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt reports.It had been 12 days since an A minus or higher rated company had completed a bond deal — a drought that had somewhat concerned investors —, according to Dealogic.On Wednesday, US gaming group Electronic Arts, trucking company Ryder Systems and Kimberly-Clark, the maker of personal and healthcare goods, added their names to the list.Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, noted that the offerings on Tuesday came at a price: companies had to pay up. The yield on bonds issued by the group were on average 19 basis points more than on similar dated paper issued by the five companies in the past.While spreads have widened significantly in the investment grade market — the difference between the average issue in the BofA Merrill Lynch US corporate bond index and its respective benchmark Treasury has widened to 219 basis points from 129 basis points last March — Mr Mikkelsen put most of it to the rally in Treasury prices.Yields move inversely to prices.“High grade investors tend to be yield sensitive, and hence when interest rates decline rapidly they tend to sit on the sidelines,” he said. “That ‘buyer strike’ type behaviour leads to ‘sticky’ corporate yields, and thus the big decline in risk free interest rates gets reflected in significant spread widening almost in the relation one-to-one.”Portfolio managers say they are closely watching the performance of new issues after bond sales in January sold off alongside the market move lower. If prices rise or are stable, investors say they could expect a wave of offerings from companies that have waited for volatility to drop.The offerings on Tuesday lifted US marketed high grade bond deals to $156bn, 3.3 per cent below the year ago pace, Dealogic figures show. However, the issuance has been concentrated among fewer issuers. The average deal has eclipsed $1.8bn, more than double the average through the same point in 2015.Eighty-five investment grade companies have sold debt to US investors this year, the fewest since at least 1995.

Apple isn’t the only company tapping the debt markets this week.US media company Comcast and technology giant IBM said they would be selling dollar bonds, while US aerospace-manufacturer Honeywell tapped investors for €4bn.Worldwide debt issuance has flatlined in 2016 as borrowers chose to stay away from testing markets. US dollar-denominated corporate bond issuance has fallen by 25 per cent in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, according to data provider Dealogic. Worldwide sales have fallen by 23 per cent.Apple said the proceeds from the deal would be used for “general corporate purposes” including “repurchases of our common stock and payment of dividends under our program to return capital to shareholders”. In total Apple has raised $55bn of long-term debt since it began the programme.Apple’s share price rose by 1.5 per cent in early trading in New York.

It added 89,000 new video customers in the fourth quarter, compared with six thousand last time, reports Matthew Garrahan in New York.Revenues for the fourth quarter rose from $17.7bn to $19.2bn, while operating income increased from $1.92bn to $1.97bn. After new high speed internet customers had been factored in, Comcast added 281,000 net new customer relationships compared with 178,000 last time.Comcast failed to complete a planned $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable in 2015 after US regulators indicated they would block the deal. However, since the deal was blocked Comcast’s Universal movie studio has enjoyed a bumper year at the box-office, thanks to hits such as Jurassic World and Straight Outta Compton.Revenues from filmed entertainment rose more than 25 per cent to $1.62bn. The performance of NBC’s broadcast and cable networks fared less well, with broadcast rising 7 per cent to $2.49bn and cable increasing 3.4 per cent to $2.4bn.

These companies do not require licences to operate in Kenya, where there is no internet censorship and the media is largely free.A Communication Authority spokesman said: “The KFCB view is important but its decision is not final and the position of Netflix is under review by the whole government, including the KFCB and the CA.”Kenya’s objections to Netflix’s programming are indicative of the possible pitfalls facing digital-streaming platforms that rely heavily on western content.Netflix said it in a statement that it was “an internet television network, not a traditional broadcaster”.“Services delivered over the internet present all sorts of novel questions for policymakers,” the company said, adding that its content was only available via subscription. “We empower consumers to make smart viewing choices by providing details on the titles on Netflix, including ratings and episode synopses. We also provide parental controls.”Netflix is engaged in a “living room” battle in the US, its main market, with Amazon and Hulu, which is owned by 21st Century Fox, Walt Disney and Comcast.However, it has pursued aggressive international expansion this month, switching on its service in 130 new countries, including India, Russia, Indonesia and Turkey.Kenya is one of the first countries to express concerns over Netflix’s content — although such criticisms have not slowed its subscriber growth. Shares in the company rose on Tuesday morning when it reported another 4.04m international sign-ups — more than the 3.5m it had forecast in October. Netflix shares initially fell more than 7 per cent but by afternoon trading had recovered to be down less than 1 per cent.
213;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;ITV: dear viewers;Shareholders are hoping for a buyer;"All dressed up with nowhere to go? Reports that UK-listed broadcaster ITV has suitors circulate regularly. Comcast of the US is the latest buyer to be mooted. The chatter helps explain why ITV’s shares have beaten the MSCI European Media index by 24 percentage points this year.ITV has recovered sharply from its earnings nadir in 2009. Net earnings this year are expected to be just shy of £650m; in 2009 they were £91m. This despite the fact that ITV’s share of viewers has declined steadily since 2012. There remain few alternatives for advertisers keen on the big primetime UK audience. ITV still has the lion’s share of the commercial (that is, non-BBC) broadcast market, with 36 per cent. ITV is also trying to make the big satellite and cable TV companies, Sky and Virgin, pay for the right to air its programmes. These retransmission fees could add £150m a year to ITV’s operating earnings, thinks Liberum.This may not be straightforward. If ITV is paid retransmission fees, the BBC might want some too. And then the whole matter would get caught up in the tortured question of how the BBC is funded. Ofcom, the regulator, has hinted it is not keen to pursue the retransmission fee issue. So ITV might not get that £150m any time soon.Note also that the broadcaster’s production arm — ITV Studios — has acquired much of its growth. Operating profits from ITV Studios, a fifth of the group, have doubled over the past four years, twice the rate of the broadcasting. Without the deals the growth rate is two-thirds lower, notes Bernstein. And the deals bring liabilities with them: performance fees due to the acquired production companies. ITV says these will be around £300m. A change of control could enable these production companies to negotiate for higher or accelerated payments.ITV’s ever-rising shares price in hope that a buyer will pay a premium over the company’s historically high valuation, for a cyclical business whose profits — if the retransmission bonanza never comes — may be peaking. This looks awfully optimistic. Shareholders should not count on a buyout.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
214;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-12-03T12:35:13Z;Foreign media groups stymied by Indian regulations;Country’s liberalisation founders on restrictions for diversified groups;Attempts by Rupert Murdoch's Star India and other global media groups to capitalise on recent moves opening up India’s broadcasting sector to foreign investors are being stymied by regulatory barriers, according to senior industry figures.India last month said foreign companies could now own 100 per cent of cable and direct-to-home satellite operators, up from 74 per cent previously, potentially bringing substantial new funds into the country’s $7bn television sector.The liberalisation was designed in part to attract investment from major global media groups, such as Time Warner, Comcast or Liberty Global. Mr Murdoch’s Star India, an arm of 21st Century Fox, already holds a 20 per cent stake in Tata Sky, a satellite joint venture with India’s Tata group.But separate regulations designed to limit cross-media ownership are in effect stopping diversified media companies — for instance those with both satellite and content production divisions — from taking advantage of the liberalisation.“The government say they want to open it all up, but because of these other rules no big players can come and do anything, not us or any of the other American companies,” says Uday Shankar, chief executive of Star India.India’s regulations stop diversified media groups owning more than 20 per cent of satellite businesses. These limit Star’s ability to take a higher stake in its Tata venture. They could also restrict a company such as Time Warner, which owns Turner International India, a TV programme distribution arm.The rules could also affect US-based cable groups Comcast and Liberty Global, both of whom analysts say have examined entering the Indian market.“We would be very open to being the majority shareholder [in Tata Sky],” Mr Shankar says. “These regulations and limitations are basically booby traps which stop anyone doing what the government says it wants to happen, which is getting more investment into the sector.”Concern over these regulatory restrictions comes amid rising foreign interest in India’s television sector, which is expected to be worth Rs975bn ($15bn) by 2020, up from Rs475bn last year, according to KPMG.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met senior executives from big media groups such as Time Warner and Discovery Communications on a visit to New York in September, at a private meeting brokered by James and Rupert Murdoch. India is already one of the world’s largest broadcasting markets measured by viewership, with 154m TV homes and a total audience of 675m, according to research group BARC.The cable and satellite sectors are fragmented, however. In satellite, Tata Sky competes against local groups like Dish TV, backed by media conglomerate Zee, and Airtel Digital TV, backed by telecoms group Bharti Airtel.Both cable and satellite TV operators need to find fresh capital as they look to invest in expensive new broadband infrastructure and fend off competition from telecoms groups with ambitions to offer entertainment to smartphone users. “This market will consolidate, and badly needs investment,” says Vivek Couto, founder of Media Partners Asia, a Hong Kong-based consultancy. “These big global players like Comcast and Liberty would like to do more in India, but this issue of regulatory barriers is a major problem.”
215;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-11-29T14:38:30Z;Hulu in spotlight as expansion beckons;With viewership up 85%, a sleeping giant in streaming may be preparing to make its move;This has been the year of streaming television. Broadcast channels, cable networks and technology companies are all making the leap into a future where TV refers not to a box in the living room, but to any kind of video delivered over the internet to the screen of the consumer’s choosing.Netflix and Amazon dominate the race to capture consumers’ attention and entertainment budgets, first building big audiences at home in the US and more recently pushing into Europe and Asia.But a sleeping giant may be getting ready to wake up and make its move. Hulu, the digital video service jointly owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast, has been splashing cash on top-quality content including the hit Fox drama Empire and Seinfeld, the classic US sitcom.Viewership is up 85 per cent and subscriptions have risen 60 per cent from a year ago, Fox told shareholders on its third-quarter earnings call. Hulu announced in April it had reached 9m subscribers. The lossmaking company, however, is still being outspent by Netflix, which has 43m US members, and Amazon, which gives its estimated 40m Prime members access to its instant video offering for no additional charge.Now one of Hulu’s owners is talking openly about international expansion — an area from which the service has previously shied away.“Today it’s a very relevant part of the landscape for customers in the US,” said James Murdoch, Fox chief executive, at the Paley Center for Media’s International Council Summit earlier this month. “I think in a number of years we have decisions to make around, do we take it to other countries? Probably more likely than not if it continues to be successful here.”Mike Hopkins, Hulu chief executive, says the company is looking at international opportunities but has no specific plans. “If you look at adoption and broadband penetrations around the world, it’s compelling and something we will take a look at,” he told an industry conference in October.Since taking over executive duties from his father Rupert Murdoch in July, the younger Mr Murdoch has been outspoken about the continuing strength of the TV industry while also calling for better advertising and a re-evaluation of Netflix’s dominance in streaming. He said Fox is licensing more content to Hulu as “the business rules are changing and our thinking is evolving”.Whether Hulu will be able to accelerate its growth and swing from loss to profit depends on whether its trio of owners have the stomach for an investment plan that risks cannibalising their lucrative relationships with cable and satellite companies.Fees to carry their channels in pay-TV packages make up a significant proportion of media owners’ revenues. They also derive millions of dollars in advertising sales from traditional television.Both of those revenue streams will come under pressure if more consumers opt to “cut the cord”, trading pricey cable bundles for streaming options such as Netflix, Time Warner’s HBO Now— and Hulu.Netflix has so far borne the brunt of the industry’s anxieties over cord cutting, with media owners asking if they are getting fair value in return for licensing their content to streaming platforms. In addition to Mr Murdoch suggesting his company might reconsider its deals with Netflix, Jeff Bewkes of Time Warner and David Zaslav of Discovery Communications have also questioned whether the streaming company is friend or foe.Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, has responded that Hulu presents a bigger risk, because it allows viewers to watch episodes of network shows without commercials the day after they air on traditional TV.“Hulu is even more of a cord-cutter’s dream than Netflix is,” he said on the company’s most recent earnings call.Analysts agree, especially in light of reports that Hulu has approached Time Warner to become an investor and bring more of its programmes on to the service.“If Hulu does become a stronger service, we think it only increases pressure on cord-cutting and advertising,” says Todd Juenger of Bernstein Research. “It’s one thing if potential cord-cutters are considering giving up the pay-TV bundle and having Netflix as their primary alternative. It’s different if they have Netflix and a stronger Hulu.”The question of Hulu’s owners’ willingness to unleash the streaming company’s potential is not a new one. The service was launched in 2008 as a joint project of NBCUniversal, now owned by Comcast, and News Corp, then owner of Fox, with Disney taking a stake in 2009. The parent companies have long been seen as unwilling to invest robustly and have put Hulu up for sale more than once.In 2013, it drew interest from bidders including AT&T and the Chernin Group, whose chairman, Peter Chernin, was involved in Hulu’s early development when he was News Corp’s chief operating officer. But Hulu’s parents abandoned the sale and promised a $750m infusion instead.Since then, Hulu has hired more than 300 employees, ramped up marketing, signed advertising partnerships to improve targeting and boosted its content budget.It outbid Netflix for exclusive rights to Empire, beat Amazon and Yahoo to secure Seinfeld and inked a multiyear deal with Epix, an entertainment network, for movies including the Hunger Games franchise and Transformers: Age of Extinction.It has picked up original shows, including the cancelled Fox sitcom The Mindy Project.It has also signed agreements to make Hulu available through cable operators’ set-top boxes and partnered with Showtime to offer the premium network’s online service at a discounted rate to Hulu subscribers.But rising costs have led to Hulu’s owners anticipating that losses will accelerate. Disney said the equity loss from its stake dragged down operating income at its broadcast division in the third quarter.The question is, when are the partners going to put in a substantial amount of capital to fund long-term US expansion as well as international expansion?“The question is, when are the partners going to put in a substantial amount of capital to fund long-term US expansion as well as international expansion?” says Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG Research. “Hulu needs to make money — $750m was fine but now they need $1.5bn.”Hulu has tried for international growth in the past. The company launched a service in Japan in 2011 but sold the business three years later to Nippon TV as it focused on the US.Barriers to international expansion are plentiful. Hulu would have to navigate a complicated array of rights agreements and territorial sales and some of the shows it offers in the US — including those owned by its parent companies — might have been sold to other providers overseas. Disney recently announced plans for its own streaming service in Europe.In the US, Hulu may also find itself increasingly in competition with its owners. Variety has reported that Disney-owned ABC is developing original shows for its own streaming platform — not Hulu. NBC has announced a subscription video service focused on comedy that will show both original and licensed content.“There is room for more than one successful global streaming player,” Mr Greenfield says. “They want somebody to foot the bill.”If Hulu does make an international move, it faces an increasingly active landscape of competitors. US rival Netflix is in the midst of a push to reach 200 markets, including China and India, by the end of next year. But local operators are also getting in on the streaming game.Sky, the pay-television broadcaster, has launched digital service in the UK with plans to expand to other markets.Other rivals include Wuaki.tv, the service owned by Japanese technology group Rakuten, which is active in markets including Germany, Spain, Italy and the UK, and Vivendi’s Canal Plus, which has Canalplay in France.Southeast Asian telecoms groups and entrepreneurs are partnering with Hollywood investors including Warner Brothers and Sony to offer mobile video subscriptions in countries including Malaysia and the Philippines.In India, Rupert Murdoch’s Star TV and Bollywood studio Eros International are racing to head off Netflix— although Eros has seen its share price collapse on worries over financial irregularities and growth rates.Emerging markets may be particularly tough to crack due to high levels of piracy, unreliable internet connections and inconsistent payment systems. China and India both restrict foreign media ownership and investment.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareilTwitter: @FTMedia
216;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-09-28T07:51:20Z;Comcast to buy stake in Universal Studios Japan;US cable company to pay $1.5bn for majority stake in Osaka-based theme park;Comcast, the US’s largest cable company, will pay $1.5bn for a majority stake in the owner of Universal Studios Japan, the Osaka-based theme park whose flagging fortunes were reignited last year by a $400m Harry Potter-themed attraction.The deal is Comcast’s biggest overseas investment on record and follows its recent failure to overcome regulatory hurdles and acquire Time Warner Cable, its domestic competitor.Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, said the deal marked the beginning of his company making “more global investments”.Comcast is buying a 51 per cent stake in USJ from Goldman Sachs, MBK Partners and other members of the consortium that, in 2009, bought the struggling theme park operator for Y111.2bn just two years after it had listed in Tokyo.Universal Studios Japan is one of just a few Japanese theme parks that remain profitable as the demographics of the world’s fastest-ageing nation take their toll on an industry aimed predominantly at the young. Universal’s 14-year battle to draw crowds has been fought in the shadow of Tokyo Disneyland, which attracts roughly three times as many visitors.As well as heralding Comcast’s plans for more overseas dealmaking, Monday’s stake sale hints at the sellers’ concern over the momentum of Tokyo stocks as China fears weigh and the impending Y11.5bn IPO of Japan Post hangs over the market.Goldman and its partners had planned to relist USJ this year, and, according to insiders, remained enthusiastic for that project until mid-August when the benchmark Topix index began a slide that has since seen it shed over 14 per cent of its value.In recent weeks, however, Goldman is understood to have convinced its partners to consider selling a controlling stake to a third party. Via its NBCUniversal business, Comcast already owns the two main Universal Studios theme parks in Hollywood and Orlando.12.7mNumber of people who visited Universal Studios Japan in 2014Monday’s deal gives USJ an enterprise value of Y750bn of which Y400bn is debt, according to Comcast, and leaves Goldman and its partners, who include USJ’s chief executive Glenn Gumpel, with a 49 per cent stake in a business that recently posted record profits on soaring visitor numbers.Against a background boom of both domestic tourism and visitor arrivals from overseas, Universal Studios in Osaka ushered 12.7m people through its turnstiles in the 2014 financial year — up from the 10.5m who visited the previous year.As well as increased numbers of overseas visitors, much of the increase represented the first pay-off from a $400m bet taken by Universal on the appeal in Japan of Harry Potter, the fictional wizard whose exploits are the inspiration for The Wizarding World of Harry Potter — a collection of rides, shops, restaurants and other exhibits that opened last year.
217;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-09-22T20:58:00Z;Intelsat looks to sell assets to cut debt;Satellite operator has approached potential buyers as it seeks to reduce $14bn debt load;Intelsat, the world’s largest commercial satellite operator in revenue terms, is exploring a sale of some strategic assets, as it seeks to pay off a portion of its $14bn debt pile, according to people familiar with the matter.The US-based company, which transmits television signals for broadcasters and images from US military drones, has hired Goldman Sachs to seek potential buyers, said people close to the company.Eutelsat, a rival French satellite operator, and John Malone’s Liberty Media have been approached by Intelsat’s bankers to gauge their interest in taking over some of the company’s assets, these people said. It is unclear whether either is keen to engage with the Luxembourg-domiciled group. Liberty tried to acquire the group in 2007 in a joint bid with Charlie Ergen’s EchoStar Communications.Other plausible buyers include rival operator SES of Luxembourg and Canada’s Telesat, as well as other private equity firms, said another person familiar with the sector.Talks with potential suitors are preliminary and Intelsat, which has revenues of about $2.4bn, could ultimately decide not to sell any of its assets.“We routinely evaluate strategic options to generate value for shareholders, employees and customers. As a matter of company policy, we do not comment on market rumours or speculation,” Intelsat said in an email seeking comment about the potential sale of assets.BC Partners and Silver Lake, the private equity firms which acquired the group in 2007 for $16.5bn, including $11bn in debt, are keen to sell some assets as part of a broader effort to reduce the company’s debt, said those close to the situation.Intelsat, which has an enterprise value of $15bn, is concerned about its debt as its bonds have been trading at high yields. A $2bn Intelsat senior unsecured bond maturing in 2021 has a 16 per cent yield and trades at 70 cents to the dollar, which indicates a high default risk.Famed for having broadcast Neil Armstrong’s walk on the moon in 1969, Intelsat has struggled in recent months to boost revenue growth as it faces increasing competition as well as pressure from declining US military spending.Fears of oversupply of so-called high-throughput satellites, which have a much larger transfer capacity than older satellites, have led many large investors to sell shares in the operator.Intelsat shares are down more than 54 per cent since the start of the year, a trend that reflects the broader challenge facing the company in generating new growth.The 51-year-old company, which operates a fleet of 50 satellites, carries one out of every four television channels in the world via its platforms, making it a key gateway connecting content providers to cable operators.Among its most valuable assets are its US and Latin American media unit, which distributes programming such as HBO series for broadcasters and cable companies such as Comcast across the globe.Intelsat also has a more sensitive US government and military related unit, which could be of interest to other buyout firms with a focus in the area, said a person familiar with the matter.Liberty Media and Eutelsat could not immediately be reached for comment.Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi and Matthew Garrahan

Mr Dolan is the chief executive of Cablevision, the New York pay-TV provider that was acquired by Altice for $17.7bn earlier this week. It is the best outcome for the Dolans and for Cablevision’s public shareholders. The company’s modest scale made it vulnerable to the structural changes sweeping the media industry. Cablevision had been founded by Mr Dolan’s father, Charles, in 1973, but the younger Dolan never succeeded in taking it beyond what it is today: a middling, regional player.Brian Roberts was also born into television royalty. His father, Ralph Roberts, started Comcast as a small television provider in Mississippi. But Comcast, under the leadership of the younger Roberts, has become a media titan, with 27m cable subscribers across the US. Comcast’s dominance extends into broadcast, cable and film content, having acquired NBCUniversal in 2009.The Dolans too have a smaller publicly listed content businesses: AMC Networks has blossomed by showing highbrow dramas. But like Cablevision, it may ultimately be too slim to survive on its own. Another Dolan unit, Madison Square Garden, comprises the famous arena along with the Knicks (basketball) and Rangers (ice hockey) teams. The Knicks’ long barren streak — they have won little this millennium — has arguably done the most to damage Mr Dolan’s image.

219;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-09-17T13:55:02Z;Television executives signal a shift in relationship with Netflix;Time Warner and 21st Century Fox chiefs say they need to deal better with rise of streaming services;Two of the biggest US television network owners have signalled a shift in their relationship with Netflix, amid fears that the popularity of the streaming service is accelerating a wave of defections from the pay-television industry by “cord-cutting” customers.Netflix and its rivals license much of their content from the big networks and have become an important source of revenue for the industry. But investors fear that the success of digital video services could be accelerating a decline in ratings, advertising sales and pay-TV subscriptions.Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, said that networks such as Turner needed to be sure that licensing fees from Netflix were not cannibalising more lucrative sources of revenues. Time Warner owns the Turner network, which operates the rolling news channel CNN and the Cartoon Network.“We don’t want that money to replace the more money that someone else was paying us,” said Mr Bewkes at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference in New York.Asked whether he thought the rise of Netflix was accelerating cord-cutting, he said: “I do.”Mr Bewkes suggested that when buying content in the future, networks like Turner should offer programming through their own video-on-demand services or those operated by the established pay-TV groups.Time Warner’s HBO division recently launched HBO Now, its own digital video service, and has said it could expand it to include television from Turner and films from the Warner Bros studio.James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox, said Netflix was a “valuable partner”, but that the company could choose to license more of its content exclusively to Hulu, a rival service that is jointly owned by the Fox network, Comcast’s NBC and Walt Disney.“The business rules are changing and our thinking is evolving,” Mr Murdoch said, adding that Hulu reimbursed Fox in a way that was “attractive to us”.Netflix said: “We do a ton of business with Time Warner and Fox, and we appreciate them as important partners.”The comments came as new study found that the rise of digital video services was the main driver of cord cutting. Roughly three-quarters of respondents who said they were “extremely likely” to cancel their pay TV subscription this year cited the availability of digital content on services like Netflix, according to a survey conducted by Magid Associates, a consultancy.The same survey found that the number of US consumers who are “extremely likely” to cancel their pay-TV subscription had nearly doubled to 3.7 per cent in 2015 — small in percentage terms but the equivalent of roughly 3.7m customers.August 14: When 24m US viewers tuned in to watch Donald Trump slug it out with his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, Fox News hit record ratings for a non-sports cable broadcast. However, those who followed on social networks had a common complaint: Fox had made it virtually impossible to watch the event online.Read moreFor several years, the television industry has played down the danger of cord-cutting. But that position has become increasingly untenable following a second quarter that was the worst on record in terms of pay-TV customer losses for the sector.Executives now admit cord-cutting is happening, but are trying to convince investors they are able to capitalise on the growing popularity of online video too.“There’s going to be a lot more choice in the marketplace,” Mr Murdoch said. “Customers want more choice, with them spending $10 to $15 on streaming services and getting a little less from their” pay-TV provider.“The streaming environment is better for us because it gives us control and we have the ability to innovate in advertising,” he added, pointing to the use of customer data to send viewers more targeted advertising.He admitted advertisers wanted more proof that Fox content was reaching customers through digital channels, and said it was incumbent on the large networks to find a way of measuring this audience. “The biggest networks need to push ahead on this rather than being passive and waiting for traditional rating agencies to catch up,” he said.Executives from the pay-TV providers also insisted they were well-placed to deal with any acceleration in cord-cutting.“While there is a transformation in how people are watching, hourly video consumption is continuing to increase,” Mr Stevens said. “The key for us is to deliver services over multiple platforms — satellite, broadband and wireless.”John Stevens, chief financial officer of AT&T, said the 133,000 subscriber losses at its DirecTV satellite TV division in the second quarter had been in line with the company’s expectations, and that it would focus on “long-term profitable growth” rather than winning customers back with promotions.Upon completing its $49bn acquisition of DirecTV this year, AT&T became the largest pay-TV group in the US by subscribers.Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, said his company would benefit from the shift to digital video because it would drive uptake of its broadband products. “We think video over the internet is more friend than foe — the more you rely on online video, you need broadband,” he said.Mike Cavanagh, the company’s chief financial officer, touted a series of products designed to appeal to cord-cutters and “cord nevers”, including an online streaming product and a discount package for students.“Not every one of these is going to be a home run, but more important is a willingness to experiment to try out and stay tuned in with [how] our current and future customers are behaving,” he said.
220;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-09-09T10:27:02Z;Interest rate rise: turning point looms for US debt binge;Flip side of cheap financing exposed as energy companies expected to default in greater numbers;With a $4tn mountain of debt maturing over the next five years, corporate America’s reliance on cheap cash is about to be tested.The prospect of steadily increasing interest rates in the coming years as the Federal Reserve gradually tightens policy, means US companies that tapped global markets for inexpensive finance over the past four years will soon face a different environment.US corporate treasurers have rushed to lock in cheap borrowing costs in advance of the expected rate rise, refinancing more than $1tn each year between 2012 and 2014, according to Standard & Poor’s.Tighter borrowing conditions will mark a turning point in the recent debt binge. Companies have had easy access to cash to write cheques for multibillion-dollar takeovers, to fund buybacks and dividend strategies — all welcomed by investors as share prices rallied off 2009 lows.But as rates turn higher, investors may see the flip side of cheap financing. Analysts warn companies will begin defaulting in greater numbers, particularly in the energy sector, which has found itself in the line of fire as commodity prices languish.In the first half of 2015, the pace of capital raisings accelerated, with bond issuance from blue-chip companies — those rated “investment grade” by one of the leading credit agencies — such as Apple, Comcast, Exxon and Boeing — jumping nearly 50 per cent from a year earlier. Bond issuance by non-investment grade companies, often called “junk”, is up 21 per cent in the first six months of the year from the same point in 2014.But this hearty bond borrowing binge could be challenged this year. Traders are betting that the Fed will lift interest rates in December, while many economists and analysts are leaning towards a hike as early as this month. “It has become clear we are close to the point when the Fed starts to raise rates,” says Hans Mikkelsen, a strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The most powerful central bank in the world is considering whether to raise its record-low interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Even before the US Federal Reserve makes a move, the effects are reverberating throughout the global economy. Our project explores how.Go to hub pageThat prospect worries some analysts. The increase in corporate debt — often spurred by cheap financing to fund acquisitions or shareholder-friendly measures such as stock buybacks and dividend increases — has led to a deterioration in the health of US companies. The debt burden of US high grade companies has now climbed to 2.62 times trailing 12-month earnings — the highest level since 2002, according to BofA.Even when excluding sectors rattled by the fall in commodity prices, and adjusting for climbing cash levels, leverage has touched the highest point since 2008 when the financial crisis roiled markets.Moody’s and S&P warn that defaults are likely to increase in the coming years as interest rates rise, a concern echoed by bond funds such as Pimco. Analysts with S&P expect defaults among junk-rated US companies to hit 2.9 per cent by June 2016, nearly twice the rate in 2013. Moody’s list of companies rated B3 with a negative outlook or lower — its lowest rating rungs in the “speculative” space — eclipsed 200 for the first time since 2010 in July“Credit quality has been deteriorating by and large over the last three years,” says Bill Wolfe, an analyst at Moody’s. “Speculative grade companies, they’ve taken advantage of very buoyant market conditions over the last few years. The number of weakly rated companies we rate is much greater than it used to be.”Given the oil price crash the list is naturally dominated by the energy companies — including Goodrich Petroleum, Midstates Petroleum Company, and SandRidge Energy. But they are joined by well-known US companies such as Weight Watchers, Toys R Us, Sears, and Advanced Micro Devices, a chipmaker.Investor focus has centred on energy and materials groups that have struggled with a drop in commodity prices and higher borrowing costs. “Sectors like drillers, metals [and] mining can continue to remain under pressure given weaker growth in emerging markets, particularly China,” says Mohit Mittal, a fund manager at Pimco.While most strategists and investors still take a relatively sanguine view on the overall corporate debt market — expecting the rise in defaults to remain well below the rate seen during the financial crisis — the ability for companies to issue new debt has been flagged as a concern.“There’s reason to believe that primary markets on the debt side become less robust once the Fed starts hiking rates, both in terms of the size of deals that can reasonably be priced in markets and also the kind of interest rates companies will have to pay on that debt,” Mr Mikkelsen says.But not all companies will be affected equally, with indebted energy companies likely to be the biggest victims. Eric Gross, a strategist with Barclays, points out that the concern for lowly rated energy companies is not if they pay 7 per cent or 9 per cent interest rates, but whether “they can get financing at all”.For the vast majority of solid investment grade companies, the ability to tap debt markets as rates rise has not come into question. Investors have instead wondered what the impact will be on buyback and dividend policies, as well as what obstacles mergers and acquisitions activity will face — important bulwarks for frothy US stock market valuations in recent years.Marc Zenner, a senior JPMorgan banker, says that higher rates should not be an issue for most companies, particularly if the US economy is improving and sales are healthy. “If rates rise because the economy is doing well and firms are bullish, you could see more buybacks because they’ll be generating more cash flow,” he predicts.Analysts say the pharmaceuticals and healthcare industry, which has been engaged in a wave of debt-fuelled dealmaking, could be one of the hardest hit sectors when rates rise.Fitch downgraded its outlook on the sector from stable to negative at the start of the year, though it did little to dampen investor appetite for chunky debt offerings.In March, Valeant raised $10bn to fund its purchase of Salix in one of the largest junk bond offerings on record, demonstrating significant investor demand.But Fitch warns that the relative ease with which companies can tap the debt markets has pushed up M&A valuations, and that the sector could be “exposed to rising rates, a more volatile business risk profile and elevated leverage, which could undermine credit quality”.Monica Erickson, a portfolio manager with DoubleLine, a bond fund management group, argues that increasing interest rates could spark more responsible behaviour from corporate treasurers who have grown comfortable with cheap and abundant funding.“It may be better off if rates are rising and companies behave a little better,” Ms Erickson said. “Maybe share buybacks and dividends will decrease, maybe M&A will decrease and perhaps we’ll see less debt issuance.”Additional reporting by David Crow.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplattThe way some people see it, higher interest rates will spell doom for the online marketplace lenders. The likes of Lending Club, Prosper and SoFi have grown rapidly in recent years, matching yield-hungry investors with borrowers unable, or unwilling, to obtain funds from traditional sources, writes Ben McLannahan.But once rates start to tick up, the argument goes, the marketplace lenders’ advantage will erode. Until now, they’ve had a clear run: offering net yields in the high single-digits, they’ve been an obvious choice for investors seeking income. But if rising rates make traditional assets more appealing, then institutional investors will start to shop around — especially if defaults begin to rise on the marketplace lenders’ relatively unseasoned portfolios. And if funding dries up, then the business dries up. At Lending Club, for example, 89 per cent of second-quarter income came from fees for originating and selling new loans.Rubbish, says Renaud Laplanche, chief executive of Lending Club, which owes most of its growth to consumers refinancing variable credit-card debt pegged to banks’ prime rates. If that prime rate rises, he says, then Lending Club’s rates will rise too. And it is silly to associate rising rates with higher defaults, he says. If anything, delinquencies should drop in a period of economic expansion.At SoFi, chief executive Mike Cagney accepts that if long-term bond yields rise to about 5 per cent, say, his core product — refinancing government-backed loans at 6 or 7 per cent — could be less appealing to investors. But such rates are a long way off. Until then, he says, there is plenty of scope to push into other products such as mortgages and personal loans. And more opportunities to develop partnerships like the one with Citizens, the Rhode Island-based bank, which has agreed to buy up to $700m of SoFi’s student loans.“They need assets like any other bank does,” he says. “They recognise we’re originating cheaper and faster than they can do on their own.”

It is where he made some of his best-known films, including Jaws, E.T. and Jurassic Park, and he still works out of offices at the studio.Disney struck a distribution deal with DreamWorks in 2009 but since then has bolstered its output from Marvel Studios, which it bought later that year, and will this year release the first of several new Star Wars films following its 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm.DreamWorks’ deal with Disney covered 30 films, or up to six films a year. Disney received a 10 per cent fee for each DreamWorks film it distributed and marketed and also provided some loan funding to the production company.Disney and DreamWorks are set to release two new productions directed by Mr Spielberg before the deal expires: Bridge of Spies, a Cold War thriller starring Tom Hanks, in October and The BFG, based on the Roald Dahl children’s book.Mr Spielberg was heavily involved as executive producer of Universal’s blockbuster Jurassic World, the latest sequel to his 1993 hit, which has collected the third-highest global box-office receipts behind Avatar and Titanic.DreamWorks was originally founded by Mr Spielberg and film producers David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg in 1994. It was bought by Viacom in 2006 for $1.6bn.Mr Katzenberg and Mr Geffen are no longer involved with the studio, which relaunched as a standalone production company in 2009 with $325m of backing from India’s Reliance Entertainment, controlled by billionaire Anil Ambani.Three years ago it struck a partnership with London-based Mister Smith Entertainment to manage distribution of its films in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Its output has slowed in recent years, however, and only 11 films have been released under its 30-picture deal with Disney.In 2012 Reliance injected an additional $200m into the company, which subsequently scaled back production to about three films a year. Last year it lost its chief executive, Stacey Snider, to 20th Century Fox.Mr Spielberg’s talks with Universal were first reported by The Hollywood Reporter.Universal has been on a tear this year with a string of hits. Jurassic World, Furious 7, the Despicable Me spin-off Minions, Pitch Perfect 2 and Fifty Shades of Grey were all in the top US releases by box office takings. The recently released Straight Outta Compton, a biopic about hip hop group NWA, has been the top-grossing film for three straight weekends.Its Hollywood firepower helped boost revenue and profit at parent Comcast, which reported a 7 per cent lift in profit in the second quarter.

Viacom, Discovery Communications, ITV and Time Warner were among those hit: in one day of trading, $37bn was wiped from the market value of the biggest media businesses.Television continues to be a highly profitable, cash-generative industry, but viewing habits are changing. New, digital services such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are luring talent — and viewers — from traditional broadcast and cable TV networks. Now, the hottest new programmes are as likely to be shown first on digital streaming services as they are on TV.Price is another problem. In the US, the high cost of cable and satellite packages — and a perception that the bundles of channels on offer do not represent value for money — has led to cancellations, known as “ cord-cutting”. Meanwhile, there are plenty of other forms of entertainment, such as social media, to suck up time that was once spent watching TV.But these trends are not new. So what triggered the sell-off in media shares?It began when Walt Disney, the world’s largest media company, revealed that growth had slowed at its hitherto unstoppable ESPN sports cable network. ESPN holds the largest collection of live sports rights with long deals in place to broadcast the most sought-after competitions. In the TV industry, the prevailing argument has always been that live sport is immune to changes in viewing patterns. After all, nothing keeps a US household away from their favourite match on TV. With all the drama and tension inherent in a big NFL or NBA game, it has to be watched live rather than later via a digital recorder. This means ESPN has been able to command hefty premiums from advertisers and the highest fees from cable and satellite companies that carry its channels.But sport is an expensive business. Competitors such as NBC Sports and Fox Sports are vying for the same rights as ESPN. This has driven up the prices the network pays for rights — a cost that is passed on to the cable and satellite companies that pay to carry ESPN and, ultimately, to the consumers that subscribe to pay-TV.Local broadcasters’ gravy train may be about to slow downContinue readingDisney’s revision of its growth projections for ESPN sent alarm bells ringing across the media landscape. “It showed that everyone was exposed,” says Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research.It also coincided with dreadful audience ratings figures for some of the most popular cable channels in the US.In the past 12 months, leading networks such as MTV and Time Warner’s TNT Network have suffered ratings declines of about 20 per cent on the previous year, according to Nielsen. Some companies, notably Viacom — which owns MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central — have been grappling with falling ratings for more than a year.But it is clear that lower ratings are the new normal across the media landscape — a realisation that is, belatedly, being reflected in the valuations of the companies that produce and distribute TV programming.Record numbers of Americans are unplugging their subscriptions.Read moreAmong media executives, the hot new book this year is Michael Wolff’s Television is the New Television. He argues that TV is holding its own in the face of competition from digital players. Despite the demise of TV being long predicted, he says it continues to thrive.He makes a good point. Cutting-edge companies such as Vice Media have already jumped into TV production, quietly realising that there are more advertising dollars to be earned there than on the internet. BuzzFeed and Vox Media plan to follow suit, with both companies having secured investment from Comcast, owner of the NBC broadcast network.Investors are nervous, judging by the performance of media stocks.

223;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-08-21T17:17:36Z;US TV: over the top, under the gun;Investors who ignored the rumour are selling the news;There were good reasons to sell shares in US television companies (those that make programming and those that distribute it) before this month. Ratings have been lousy for a while. HBO, which makes some of the most popular programming, has made it possible to buy its content outside a larger TV package. Streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu are growing. And distributors such as Dish and Verizon, responding to creeping declines in subscribers, have started selling basic, low-cost video packages.All of this threatens the wonderfully lucrative TV model whereby anyone wanting to watch good programming has to buy it along with a huge amount of rubbish in a bundle costing perhaps $70 month. Even so, shares in Disney, Time Warner, Comcast, and Time Warner Cable churned upwards this year (the likes of CBS and Viacom, with greater sensitivity to advertising, have struggled more).So the rumour was ignored. August brought the fact. Second-quarter subscriber numbers at the cable companies declined — but no faster than usual. Then telecoms and satellite distributors released awful figures. Total pay TV subscriptions fell by around 600,000 (off a base of 100m), the worst quarter on record, according to SNL Kagan. Disney cut its targets for its TV business. The sector saw a harrowing sell off: Time Warner and Disney both fell more than 15 per cent for the month. They now trade at 15 and 18 times earnings, respectively, down three notches from July.What now? For the distributors, the days of the big expensive TV package are numbered. They must offset this by making sure customers pay up for the bandwidth they are using to watch video — whether they are watching old-style channels or streaming video. For content producers, the trick is to make shows that customers will pay for individually. TV companies used to have market power. Now they need pricing power.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

It is unclear what the unit could sell for.Bain Capital, Blackstone and Comcast’s NBCUniversal acquired The Weather Channel for about $3.2bn in a hotly contested 2008 auction for what used to be predominantly a cable network.When the consortium of buyers acquired the channel it was the third most distributed cable network in the US. Since then the business has suffered as cable networks have struggled to win over new millennial viewers and distributors have squeezed them on fees paid to carry the channel.Comcast took a $252m impairment charge last month related to its investment in the channel. The company added that as of June 30 the value of its stake had dropped to $86m from $335m last year.Meanwhile, the digital unit, which includes the channel’s app and other units Weather.com, Weather Underground and Weather Services International, has flourished to become the most valuable part of the company.The Weather Channel’s mobile app has consistently been one of the most downloaded globally on Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices, because of users’ obsession with the climate.The most likely buyer for the digital business is a tech company, said people informed about the negotiations.“The number of eyeballs the app gets is phenomenal . . . we are talking millions,” said a person close to the company.Bloomberg first reported news about a potential sale of the digital business.
225;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-08-17T17:20:48Z;BuzzFeed looks to go viral in Japanese;Venture with Yahoo Japan marks a departure for the online media group;"BuzzFeed is launching a joint venture with Yahoo Japan, the country’s top internet portal, to create a Japanese-language version of the viral news and entertainment site.The partnership structure marks a departure for BuzzFeed, which wholly owns its operations in other countries including the UK, Germany, Brazil and India. The companies did not disclose how much they are investing in the venture, but BuzzFeed will hold a 51 per cent stake and Yahoo Japan will own the remaining 49 per cent.BuzzFeed’s international push in the past two years has come as its content, which is widely distributed over social media including Facebook, reaches an increasingly global audience. Some 45 per cent of its website’s 200m monthly unique visitors now come from outside the US, said Greg Coleman, BuzzFeed president.*BuzzFeed’s side of the venture will be financed from its existing funds, including the $50m it raised last year from Andreesen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture firm, which was partly earmarked for international expansion. Comcast’s NBCUniversal is expected soon to conclude a $200m investment in BuzzFeed at a valuation of $1.5bn, according to a person familiar with the situation.Teaming up with Yahoo Japan— itself a joint venture between Yahoo and SoftBank — will allow BuzzFeed to tap the group’s large audience of 88 per cent of Japanese internet users and its relationships with advertisers.“We will have the opportunity to get the massive traffic from Yahoo Japan to help accelerate the growth of our site and we also will be getting access to the largest [digital media] sales team in Japan,” Mr Coleman said.BuzzFeed derives its revenue from creating sponsored content for brands that look like its popular gif-illustrated stories and lists. The company passed $100m in sales in 2014, and recent financial documents obtained by Gawker, the US gossip website, show BuzzFeed first reached profitability in 2013 and booked $2.7m in net profit in the first six months of last year.In many ways we’ll be the first to market. That’s terrific but it also means you have to break the ice with a lot of marketersDigital ad spending in Japan is projected to grow 10 per cent to $9.7bn this year, out of a total $37bn advertising market, according to eMarketer, the researcher. But Japan is in the “very early stages of native advertising”, Mr Coleman said. “In many ways we’ll be the first to market. That’s terrific but it also means you have to break the ice with a lot of marketers.”In previous international expansions BuzzFeed has followed a consistent formula, starting with a small editorial staff that creates the fluffy viral content for which it is well known, then moving into harder news coverage and native advertising sales. In Japan, it will start by hiring editors and a chief executive to run the joint venture before courting marketers, but the focus will be on news from the start, Mr Coleman said.BuzzFeed has been investing heaving in its editorial side, with high-profile hires including Janine Gibson, the former deputy editor of the Guardian. Its editorial budget ballooned to $10.5m in the first half of 2014, compared with $11.7m in all of 2013, according to the Gawker documents.The Japanese venture will also import BuzzFeed’s strategy of social sharing to give its content a reach far beyond its own website. Its existing relationships with Facebook and Twitter, both of which have large followings in Japan, will be a benefit but the Japanese operation will also need to make inroads with local operators.“This is why the traffic we’ll get from Yahoo Japan will be so important to prime the pump,” Mr Coleman said.BuzzFeed and Yahoo Japan began talks a year ago, around the time Mr Coleman joined the US company. The executive has a history with the Japanese group in his previous roles as president of Criteo, a digital advertising company that also partners with Yahoo Japan, and as Yahoo’s executive vice-president of global sales.BuzzFeed will control the joint venture’s board with representation from Yahoo Japan. Holding majority ownership will make it easier for BuzzFeed to consolidate Japanese earnings in the event the US company decides to go public, Mr Coleman said.This article has been amended to correct the number of monthly unique visitors on BuzzFeed’s website.shannon.bond@ft.com

226;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-08-14T22:15:49Z;TV flickers as viewers find new screens;Record numbers of Americans are unplugging their subscriptions;When 24m US viewers tuned in to watch Donald Trump slug it out with his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, Fox News made television history, recording record ratings for a non-sports cable broadcast.However, those who followed the political jousting on social networks had a common complaint: despite partnering with Facebook to host the debate, Fox News had made it virtually impossible to watch the event online.Twitter users traded links with illicit livestreams and lambasted the network’s failure to cater for “cord-cutters” or “cord-nevers” — people who have either ditched their pay-TV subscription or have never signed up for one.The disconnect between the knockout ratings and the incredulity of young, media-savvy viewers appeared to support the central thesis of broadcasters and pay-TV providers: cord-cutting might be fashionable for trendy elites, but it has yet to make a dent in “real” America’s love affair with television.That theory is coming under attack like never before. The second quarter is always tough for the pay-TV industry, as families move home and college students disconnect, but this time it was the worst on record for net customer losses: an estimated 566,000 people cut the cord. With the exception of Verizon, which is still rolling out its video service, all pay-TV companies lost subscribers during the quarter.Worse still, the poor performance comes against the backdrop of improving macro trends that are usually positive for the industry, including a rise in new household formation following several years of stagnation.With roughly 100m US pay-TV subscribers, the loss of half a million customers does not equal Armageddon. The subscriber base shrunk 0.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, its sharpest contraction on record, but nowhere near as precipitous as the declines seen in other media businesses such as newspapers and recorded music.But after a decade of fretting about cord-cutting, investors think it has finally arrived.Concerns over younger customers’ changing viewing habits led to a sharp sell-off in media stocks earlier this month. More than $50bn was wiped from the market value of the S&P 500 Media Index, after Walt Disney cut growth estimates for its cable networks and companies including Viacom, Fox and CBS reported declining advertising revenue.Among the companies who pipe pay-TV into customers’ homes, satellite groups have emerged as the biggest casualties of cord-cutting. These groups amassed a huge subscriber base when they entered the market in the 1990s, with deep discounts to cable products and technology that could reach rural homes — but now the disrupters are being disrupted.Unlike cable operators, satellite companies cannot offer a high-speed broadband connection — an essential for anyone wanting to watch streaming services like Netflix or Hulu.“We are witnessing the rapid erosion of satellite’s competitiveness,” says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “The industry is no longer growing in the US and the dynamics have shifted in favour of cable, and in favour of broadband.”Analysts estimate Dish, one of the two big US satellite groups, lost 151,000 subscribers in the second quarter, versus a loss of 44,000 a year ago. It reported narrower net customer losses of 85,000, but that figure lumped in sales of Sling TV— a new slimmed-down streaming TV service for cord-cutters that is delivered via an internet connection or “over-the-top”.Charlie Ergen, Dish chief executive, has said he expects its pay-TV business to come under pressure, and has tried to diversify by launching Sling TV and by acquiring tens of billions of dollars of spectrum— the airwaves needed to deliver wireless telecoms services.Never one to shy away from rubbing salt into the wounds of struggling broadcasters, Mr Ergen had a sharp message for content owners earlier this month: “The biggest problem in the linear [TV] business today is that viewership is going down. Advertising rates are going down. And everybody wants to go to the street and say they’re still making the same amount of money.”DirecTV, the satellite group recently acquired by AT&T for $49bn, also had its worst quarter ever, posting net customer losses of 133,000, versus 34,000 in the same period of 2014. Investors in AT&T appear to be nervous about the prospects for the new company, sending its shares down as much as 3 per cent on Wednesday after an analyst day where executives outlined their long-term strategy.For cable operators, the picture is much better. As owner of NBC, the broadcaster, Comcast got burnt in the recent media sell-off, but its cable subscription business performed quite well, shedding 69,000 subscribers versus a loss of 144,000 a year ago. Time Warner Cable lost 43,000, compared with a loss of 147,000 in the second quarter of 2014.Sesame Street deal shows how HBO’s chief has steered into the digital ageContinue readingAnalysts say cable companies are faring better because those customers who still want pay-TV services also want high-speed broadband, which can be delivered by a cable but not by a satellite dish.And even if the cable industry experiences some immediate pain from cord-cutting, some predict a win-win situation in the long term. When customers ditch their pay-TV subscriptions and flock to Netflix, HBO Now and other online services, they will still need a high-speed internet connection.“As subscribers cut the cord they are more reliant on faster broadband, which favours cable,” says Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, who points out that many smaller cable companies make no profit from video services, while larger groups, like Comcast, make very little.Cable One, a small Arizona-based operator, has lost 20 per cent of its video subscriber base in a year, while increasing earnings and cash flow. “Smaller operators have already crossed the Rubicon,” says Mr Moffett. “Eventually it will come to that for all.”In the second quarter, Comcast crossed a Rubicon of its own: it now has more broadband subscribers than video ones.Still, Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research, thinks the likes of Comcast and Time Warner Cable will be less sanguine about losing video customers. “They still make money in video, which makes it harder to abandon. They charge more than it costs them [to pay affiliate fees to broadcasters]. If they are only in broadband, they have to accept lower revenues or raise their prices.”Perhaps the biggest risk for cable companies is that regulators block them from hiking broadband prices to account for lost pay-TV profits. Currently, the economics of pay-TV are quite simple: a customer pays, for argument’s sake, $80 a month. Roughly half goes to the broadcasters for content, while the other $40 goes to the pay-TV company transporting the content.In the Netflix world, Comcast et al still deliver the content, but they need to find a new way of getting paid. The Federal Communication Commission’s recent net neutrality ruling closed down at least one avenue, banning cable operators and telecoms groups from charging Netflix and others for a “fast lane” to access their viewers.That means sharp price increases for consumers, though that too could face opposition. In vast swaths of the US, customers have only one choice of cable provider. If companies were to start using their monopolies to extract more cash from customers, regulators could step in with utility-style price caps.“The real question is whether they can charge for delivery when the same video is delivered over the same network, but is being sent by Netflix,” says Mr Moffett.As investors and executives grapple with accelerating changes in media consumption habits, they are nervously eyeing one group in particular: today’s kids, who they worry may not grow up into tomorrow’s pay-TV customers.The worst-hit stock in the sector’s recent sell-off was Viacom. The home of Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central dropped 20 per cent over two days as it missed revenue estimates and reported a 9 per cent decline in US advertising sales.Once powerhouses of programming aimed at children, teenagers and young adults, Viacom’s channels have suffered sharp ratings declines as young audiences shift to watching programmes on demand on their digital devices, often without advertising. Viewership across its networks was down 18 per cent in the second quarter, according to Bernstein Research.“Viacom still boasts some attractive programming, but it appeals mainly to a younger demographic that is more likely to abandon traditional TV viewing,” said Dave Novosel, analyst at Gimme Credit.Viacom has countered that the Nielsen ratings that underpin the $70bn US TV advertising market do not capture its digital reach. It is taking steps to lessen its reliance on the research firm’s measurements, including launching a subscription online streaming service aimed at preschoolers.But traditional TV networks also face competition from online-only programmers including Netflix and Amazon, which are investing in original children’s content and licensing popular programming from Walt Disney, DreamWorks Animation and Viacom’s own Nickelodeon, which runs commercial-free, an appealing fact for many parents. This week, HBO struck a five-year deal to carry Sesame Street on its premium channel and digital platforms.A study this week from PwC, the consultancy, found more than half of eight to 18-year-olds said streaming TV was their favourite media content, ahead of cable and network TV shows, games and short videos.Their reported viewing habits told a different story, however. Those surveyed spend an average 7.8 hours a week watching traditional network TV, compared with 6.2 hours watching cable TV, 6.1 hours streaming shows and movies on a laptop, smartphone or tablet and 7.2 hours watching YouTube videos.Still, the risk remains for the TV industry that this generation of children growing up with iPhones and the ad-free offerings of Netflix is developing a very different notion of what exactly constitutes “television”.
227;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-07-30T17:43:16Z;NBCUniversal in talks to invest in BuzzFeed and Vox Media;Funding would value digital media groups at $1.5bn and $850m respectively;BuzzFeed and Vox Media, two leading digital news groups, are close to striking hefty investment deals with Comcast’s NBCUniversal that value BuzzFeed at $1.5bn and Vox at $850m.NBCUniversal, owner of the US broadcast network, Universal movie studio and portfolio of cable channels, will invest $250m in BuzzFeed and an undisclosed amount in Vox.The investments serve each company in different ways, according to a person familiar with the situation. Like other traditional media groups, NBC wants to reach younger audiences that are increasingly shunning television for digital platforms. For BuzzFeed and Vox, the new funding and closer partnership with NBC could lead to television projects and new sources of revenue, the person added.Vox and BuzzFeed have both invested in branded content, a growth area for digital news operations. The branded content market is forecast to increase 20 per cent a year in the US, from $10bn in 2014 to $25bn in 2019, according to new research from Boston Consulting Group, the management consulting firm.The negotiations to invest in the two companies are at an advanced stage but no deals have yet been signed, according to people familiar with the matter.The value of digital properties able to connect with large audiences online has soared in recent years. Last year, BuzzFeed, known for its lists, Gifs and expertise in aggregation, took a $50m investment from Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley firm, which valued it at $850m. It also briefly held talks with Disney for a sale that would have valued it at $1bn.Vox, which owns sites such as SB Nation, Curbed and Eater, secured $46.5m of financing last year from General Atlantic, the New York private equity firm, in a deal that valued it at $380m.The company recently bolstered its portfolio of web properties with the acquisition of Recode, the influential technology news website that was started by two former Wall Street Journal reporters, Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg. News of the talks were first reported by Recode, owned by Vox, which already counts Comcast as a shareholder.BuzzFeed and Vox may have an eye on Vice Media in negotiating their new deals with NBCUniversal. The youth-focused media group’s valuation has soared since it got into television production and distribution. Last year it raised $500m from investors last year including A&E Networks and Technology Crossover Ventures, the Silicon Valley private equity firm, that valued it at $2.5bn.NBCUniversal declined to comment on the talks with BuzzFeed and Vox Media.
228;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-07-21T23:23:41Z;US regulators set to clear $49bn AT&T bid for DirecTV;FCC proposes approval of deal with conditions covering interconnection agreements;US regulators are expected to clear AT&T’s $49bn acquisition of DirecTV in a major victory for the companies amid government scrutiny and scepticism over telecoms mergers.Tom Wheeler, head of the Federal Communications Commission, has proposed approving the transaction with conditions, including requiring the companies to submit all interconnection agreements to the agency.“We will require an independent officer to help ensure compliance with these and other proposed conditions,” Mr Wheeler said in a statement. “These strong measures will protect consumers, expand high-speed broadband availability, and increase competition.”In a separate announcement, the US justice department said it would not block the AT&T-DirecTV deal. The DoJ reviewed the deal for anti-competitive issues while the FCC assessed it based on what is in the public’s interest.“After an extensive investigation, we concluded that the combination of AT&T’s land-based internet and video business with DirecTV’s satellite-based video business does not pose a significant risk to competition,” said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer of the antitrust division.The approval comes after other deals have faced stiff opposition from regulators. In April, Comcast and Time Warner Cable called off their merger in what would have combined the two biggest cable companies in the US. The DoJ was poised to sue the companies, while the FCC also criticised the deal.Mobile phone company Sprint dropped its pursuit of T-Mobile after officials from both the DoJ and FCC publicly expressed scepticism of such a deal, a rare move for a transaction that had not been finalised by the companies.Charter Communications is now in discussions to acquire TWC, while T-Mobile is in talks to be acquired by Dish, the pay-TV group controlled by satellite billionaire Charlie Ergen.The AT&T-DirecTV deal faced less opposition because the companies are not direct competitors, although the combination will make it the biggest distributor of multichannel TV in the US as well as one of the country’s leading internet service providers.The deal would combine AT&T’s U-verse pay TV business with DirecTV’s satellite services.As part of the FCC conditions, AT&T would be prohibited from excluding affiliated video services and content from data caps on its fixed broadband connections and it would have to provide regular reports on network performance to the agency.If the deal is approved with that criteria, 12.5m customer locations will have access to competitive high-speed fibre connections, which is about 10 times the size of AT&T’s current fibre deployment, Mr Wheeler said.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

The company had been working with the Trump family on a reality TV project, which was scrapped last week.Mr Trump caused outrage this month when, announcing his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, he said Mexico was sending to the US “people that have lots of problems, and they are bringing those problems [to] us. They’re bringing drugs; they’re bringing crime; they’re rapists; and some, I assume, are good people”.He also called for a “great, great wall” to be built on the US-Mexico border, adding that “the US has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems”.Mr Trump said in an Instagram post on Monday that he stood by his statements on immigration. “NBC is weak, and like everybody else is trying to be politically correct — that is why our country is in serious trouble,” he said.NBC’s decision followed growing public pressure to cut ties with Mr Trump. More than 200,000 people signed a Change.org petition calling on NBC to cancel shows involving Mr Trump, including Miss Universe and Celebrity Apprentice, the reality series he hosts.Univision, the largest US Spanish-language broadcaster, last week cancelled its plans to broadcast Miss Universe and Miss USA.On Monday, NBC said it would no longer air the two pageants. “At NBC, respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of our values,” the network said.However, the broadcaster will remain home to Celebrity Apprentice, a version of The Apprentice TV series that has been hosted by Mr Trump since its inception in 2008. NBC noted that Celebrity Apprentice is licensed from Mark Burnett’s United Artists Media Group and the relationship would continue.Mr Trump had told CNN on Sunday that he would give up hosting the show while running for the White House.In his statement on Monday, Mr Trump said that he had told NBC “long ago” that he would not participate in The Apprentice “because I am running for President in order to Make our Country Great Again”.He continued: “Their contract violating closure of Miss Universe/Miss USA will be determined in court.”Celebrity Apprentice’s most recent season aired at the beginning of this year after a nearly two-year lapse. It performed relatively well, drawing 26 per cent more viewers overall and 17 per cent more watchers in the coveted 18 to 49-year-old demographic than the 2013 version.During the show’s final episode in February, Mr Trump said it would return for another season — the eighth for Celebrity Apprentice and the 15th for The Apprentice in the US — but no timing of the filming or broadcasting was announced.shannon.bond@ft.com@shannonpareil@FTMedia"
231;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Ralph Roberts, Comcast founder, 1920-2015;Child of the Depression who built cable empire;Ralph Roberts, who died on Thursday at the age of 95, helped shape the modern cable television industry, transforming Comcast from a small Mississippi-based operator into a media and telecommunications powerhouse.He was a child of the Depression. Born in New York on March 13 1920, he was old enough to appreciate the enormity of the financial crash when his family, which owned a chain of drug stores, lost everything. Tragedy struck a year later. “My father died, and we lost all our money,” he once said. “People who never had a financial problem in their lives can never understand what terror there is in that.”The experience shaped his outlook on life and was a constant motivation. “If you lived through the Depression it changes you forever,” his son, Brian Roberts, now Comcast’s chief executive, once said. “You live your life assuming everything you have can be taken away from you. And that’s how Comcast got built.”After graduating from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1941, Ralph Roberts served a four-year tour of duty in the US Navy. Then he discovered he had an entrepreneurial flair. For a time, he sold a revolutionary golf putter. He ran a men’s accessories business and worked for Muzak, selling the bland recorded ditties played in shops and lifts.In 1963 Roberts and his partners acquired a cable television operation in Tupelo, Mississippi with 1,200 subscribers. The cable business model reminded him of Muzak, in that once an initial capital investment had been made, revenue would recur — and keep recurring. “You put up a tower and some equipment,” he told William Novak, the author of the official Comcast history, An Incredible Dream, “and they paid you every month”. Cable, he added, “looked to me like the greatest business in the world”.American homes used to get their television signals over the airwaves. That began to change, slowly, in the 1940s and 1950s in areas that were hard for broadcast signals to reach. Originally called “community antennas television”, cable systems were developed that received a single TV signal and distributed it to multiple homes. Cable was an efficient way to pump multiple channels into individual homes. As time went on the number of systems grew exponentially.In the decades that followed, the always nattily turned-out Roberts began a round of consolidation that continues today. An industry once known for thousands of locally run operators is now dominated by a handful. Comcast is the largest of the bunch.Roberts did not grow up with cable — he was 43 when he bought Comcast — but his son, Brian, did. The younger Mr Roberts worked in every aspect of the company and succeeded his father as chief executive. Ralph, though, remained a constant source of counsel and guidance. “He is the one person I can truly say anything to, Brian Roberts once said of his father. “I have never had a ‘bad idea’, according to [him]. Now, I’ve had some terrible ideas but he would never say that, he would just guide me.”In recent years Comcast has diversified beyond its core distribution business. In 2004 it made a $54bn bid for Walt Disney that was rejected. The company had better luck five years later when it bought a controlling stake in NBCUniversal, the US media group that includes the national television network and Universal movie studio. Four years later it had acquired 100 per cent of the company.[Cable] looked to me like the greatest business in the worldIt recently failed to complete a $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable. The proposed deal would have created a giant of cable and internet provision but regulators indicated they would block the combination of the two companies and Comcast withdrew its bid.Still, as the largest provider of high-speed broadband in America, Comcast is well-placed for future growth. It is a vast company barely recognisable from the small operation Mr Roberts acquired in 1963 but it continues to bear all the hallmarks of the man who built it. “I don’t want to be rich,” he once said. “I want to build a great company that I can turn over to Brian.”Mr Roberts is survived by his wife Suzanne, four of his children and eight grandchildren.

News of Deutsche Telekom’s talks with Comcast came out in a German publication, Manager Magazin.Talks between Dish and T-Mobile are at an advanced stage, according to another person, who said a deal could be reached within a few weeks if the two parties managed to come to an agreement on valuation.Deutsche Telekom is concerned about a deal that includes a high portion of Dish shares, one person said. The German group would be more open to a deal with a higher cash component.Mr Ergen, who has amassed billions of dollars worth of wireless spectrum, is a former professional poker player who is known as a hard negotiator.Shares in T-Mobile US were up 2.4 per cent to $39.79 in mid-morning trading in New York.
233;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Regulators will ask if Charter-TWC deal is in public interest;Analysts believe acquisition could face fewer hurdles than Comcast bid;The question facing regulators sizing up the three-way merger of Charter Communications, Time Warner Cable and Bright House is whether their combined businesses would become a useful rival to the cable and video giant Comcast — or just another Comcast.Analysts and even some opponents of Comcast’s failed bid for TWC said the Charter deal stood a much better chance of being approved by the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator.Comcast’s TWC bid was scuppered by concerns that it would hurt competition and consumers. But the FCC has sought to correct an industry perception that it has a knee-jerk aversion to all cable deals, according to a person familiar with the matter.On Tuesday, Tom Wheeler, FCC chairman, signalled that the Charter-TWC deal will face close scrutiny and stressed that such transactions must be in the public interest. “An absence of harm is not sufficient,” he said in a statement.The FCC worries about size in the cable industry for two principal reasons. The first is the fear that a dominant player such as Comcast can jack up its prices or let service quality stagnate when consumers have few or no alternative providers.This should be less of a concern with a Charter-TWC-Bright House deal. The combined companies say they would represent less than 25 per cent of the high-speed broadband market — significantly less than Comcast-TWC, which would have controlled an estimated 57 per cent.The second regulatory concern stems from the spectacular growth of online video services as more Americans turn to them for entertainment and news.The FCC’s response to the Comcast-TWC deal suggested worries that Comcast’s ownership of a video content businesses gave it a motive to use its broadband clout to hurt online video providers such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Apple or Google.Unlike Comcast, which owns the NBCUniversal broadcast business, neither Charter nor TWC owns any TV channels.Analysts at New Street Research noted that John Malone, Charter’s largest shareholder, also has a stake in the TV business Discovery Communications, but they wrote that “affiliation is not the same thing as control”.They added that Charter-TWC had other advantages, including its knowledge of how regulators assessed the proposed Comcast deal and the absence of past troubles akin to its dispute with Netflix over connection speeds.Rick Boucher, a former US congressman who represents broadband companies, said: “I would rate the deal’s prospects as encouraging.”But consumer advocates were not so heartened.Gene Kimmelman, chief executive of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group that opposed the Comcast deal, said his group would likely push for regulators to impose conditions to ensure that Charter-TWC could not discriminate against certain video distributors.“While it does not appear to have the same competitive harms that the Comcast deal did, the burden is on Charter to demonstrate why this actually serves the public interest,” he said.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan and Gina Chon
234;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-05-26T16:52:18Z;Charter/Time Warner Cable: cowboy up;TWC was once less excited about shares in Malone’s company;Good things come to those who wait. And to those with deep pockets. Sixteen months ago, Charter Communications offered to buy Time Warner Cable for $132.50 per share. That deal fell through when TWC went with Comcast, which offered about $160. But with the Comcast deal scuttled by regulators last month, Charter was free to have another go. On Tuesday, it clinched a revised deal, buying TWC for $196 per share. That would seem to be a huge victory for TWC (albeit one made possible by regulators). But it is not an unequivocal victory.In what was a heated fight with Charter last year, TWC offered nothing but contempt for Charter shares. It demanded $160 per share from Charter, with at least $100 of that in cash. The target insisted that the stock component would have to be protected by a so-called collar that would increase the number Charter shares offered if its share price fell. In Tuesday’s deal, TWC shareholders will get their $100 per share in cash (or up to $115 if they want). However, the share component will not be protected by a collar.So how should TWC shareholders feel about Charter shares? Since last February when TWC went with Comcast, Charter’s shares have risen 40 per cent. That rally helps explain how Charter feels comfortable paying a juicy nine times cash flow for TWC.Charter’s own trading multiple of 11 times cash flow is well ahead of the sector. The risk for TWC shareholders is that it falls to the industry average of seven times. Charter might try to push up its equity value by paying down its $62bn of debt but in the past month, as deal speculation grew, the buyer’s shares have fallen nearly a tenth.John Malone, Charter patron, has in just a few years pushed the company from bankruptcy to being the kingmaker of American cable. Five years ago, Charter shares traded at $35. Today they are at $175. The next five years will not be so easy.E-mail the Lex team at lex@ft.com
235;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-05-25T19:20:27Z;Charter/Time Warner Cable: everything is possible;In the current climate, size, price and leverage mean little;"This is where capital markets are in mid-2015. One company is about to bid for another that has well over twice the profits and total value; it is doing so despite being highly indebted; and it just shook hands on another major deal less than two months ago. And no one will suggest that the deal will be hard to finance. Shareholders are unlikely to make any significant fuss — the job of nattering on about overpayment will be left to a few journalists and the odd analyst who does not work for one of the financing banks. Stock markets may have been flattish for a bit, but the boom goes on.If, as reported, Charter offers $195 a share for Time Warner Cable, with a little over half of that in cash and the rest in shares, the combined company would look roughly as follows: its total value will be over $110bn, with about 40 per cent of that in equity and the rest debt. It will generate roughly $32bn in sales and $11bn in earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation). Net debt will be a dizzy 5.5 times those earnings, or more.Time Warner Cable shareholders will receive a premium of about 23 per cent over the price early last week, when deal speculation was rekindled. And they will be receiving a fat bump compared with the $160 bid that Comcast made in early 2014 (only to see it turned back by regulatory resistance). A value of 9.5 times ebitda will have been stamped on their company, nearly 50 per cent above the average since its 2007 listing.There are ways to cut the leverage. A direct equity investment from Charter’s controlling shareholder, John Malone, is expected. As much as $1bn in cost cuts would fit with the savings targets offered up in previous cable deals; a few hundred million might come out of capital investment, too. The combined company will have 22m subscribers, still short of Comcast, which has better margins and cash conversion than either Charter or TWC.Size helps, then. But it is not everything. Recent solid results in pay television do not diminish the main challenge: a world where broadband matters more and TV — which accounts for almost half of the new company’s sales — is set to erode. Is the value of size, which brings efficiency and negotiating power, greater than the danger of heavy debt? Mr Malone has bet on size and debt before and won — but those bets were not made when the industry was so challenged.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
236;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Time Warner Cable battle highlights industry upheaval;Aftershocks expected with Altice the potential loser as Malone’s Charter closes in;The battle over Time Warner Cable, the second-largest US cable television operator, reflects the profound change sweeping through the industry and is expected to set off a series of aftershocks.After days of haggling, it emerged on Monday that Charter Communications, the third-largest cable TV company, which is backed by media tycoon John Malone, was closing in on buying TWC in a $78bn deal including debt. The potential loser is Altice, the European cable group chaired by billionaire Patrick Drahi, which has also been interested in acquiring New York-based TWC, according to people familiar with the matter.Luxembourg-based Altice made its first foray into the US only last week by striking a $9.1bn deal to acquire a controlling stake in Suddenlink, the fifth-largest pay-TV operator, and is expected to look for another deal to muscle up against a combined Charter-TWC and industry leader Comcast.This all comes at a time when subscription TV providers are slowly but steadily shedding customers. The US pay-TV industry has shrunk by 0.5 per cent over the past 12 months, according to Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson Research. “That may not sound dramatic, perhaps, but it’s the fastest rate of decline on record,” he says.Smaller cable groups, many of which have been in family control for years, are seen as likely takeover targets. Shares of Cablevision, the fourth-largest pay-TV operator controlled by New York’s billionaire Dolan family, surged 22 per cent last week on speculation about further consolidation. Privately owned Cox Communications is also seen as a target.In recent years, industry executives have argued that consolidation would help cable operators better compete against their rivals in the satellite and telecoms sectors, face off against programmers over rising content costs, and address the growing threat of so-called cord-cutters— consumers who turn to online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon and HBO Now.Cable companies have countered antitrust concerns by arguing that their geographical spread means that no single group has a national presence: the industry evolved in a fragmented way that gave large operators control of regional monopolies.But recently, growth in their broadband businesses has surpassed TV services. Comcast counted more internet subscribers than video customers for the first time in the second quarter of this year.The emerging primacy of broadband has changed the picture for the industry and, crucially, for regulators. Following Comcast’s withdrawal of its bid for TWC in April, Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the chief US media and telecoms watchdog, said the deal “would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation, including the ability of online video providers to reach and serve consumers”.With this in mind, the same regulatory concerns that derailed Comcast’s attempt to buy TWC may figure in scrutiny of any tie up between Charter and TWC.“We believe after the TWC-Comcast review, the government now believes Comcast is already too big, and Charter-TWC creates another Comcast,” says Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG Research. “It will get blocked.”As well as regulatory issues, Charter could face questions about how it is going finance a purchase of TWC, and also the level of indebtedness at the New York-based company after the takeover.Charter is expected to propose offering $195 a share for TWC — well above the $132.50 it bid for the New York-based company last year. TWC’s stock closed at $171.18 on Friday.In the current climate, size, price and leverage mean littleContinue readingHow Charter, which has a large debt load on its balance sheet, can finance a large cash offer for TWC may be a critical factor.Meanwhile, Mr Drahi has made a name for himself by using leverage to develop Altice’s European media empire — an approach he is now taking to the US.Altice only put $1.2bn of cash on the table to buy Suddenlink, in a deal that valued the target at $9.1bn including debt.There are questions about a possible counter bid by Altice for TWC. The most important one is whether, as such a new entrant to the US market, Mr Drahi is prepared to take on so much so quickly. The Suddenlink deal brings Altice’s shopping bill over the past 15 months to a staggering €36bn.But the other doubt is how he will fare when competing against his former mentor, Mr Malone, particularly if regulators are inclined to block a Charter purchase of TWC. For Mr Drahi, there is still much to play for.Additional reporting by Adam Thomson in Paris

The enterprise value of the transaction will be $78bn, which includes about $22bn in net debt.The deal comes amid sweeping changes in the US cable industry, with consumers increasingly watching their video on the internet, rather than on television sets. Consolidation could help cable operators compete more effectively with a new generation of online video services such as Amazon and Netflix, and also better withstand the growing pricing power of content providers.In a wave of dealmaking that has swept the sector, AT&T agreed to buy DirecTV for $48.5bn in 2014 and Charter itself lined up to acquire Bright House Networks, a smaller US cable operator, for $10.4bn earlier this year.As part of the TWC deal, Charter will complete its Bright House transaction and merge the three groups into a single entity that will have a total of 23m customers.That will make it the second-largest cable operator behind Comcast, which has 27m customers, including telephone and internet. Comcast, was thwarted by regulators in its own bid for TWC.TWC shareholders will have the option of $100 in cash and the remaining $95 in Charter stock or $115 in cash and the remaining $80 in stock.Mr Malone, the Colorado-based billionaire who has been a linchpin of cable consolidation for more than two decades, will inject $5bn of equity to help fund the deal through Liberty Broadband.Charter is prepared to pay 23 per cent more than Comcast had agreed to pay for TWC in 2014. The large premium is partly because of the late entry of France’s Altice in the bidding war for TWC.Altice’s defeat is not likely to signal a retreat by the European operator from further expansion in the US. The French group, which last week bought rural cable operator Suddenlink for $9.1bn, is expected to continue scouring for deals both in the US and in Europe.Aftershocks expected with Altice the potential loser as Malone’s Charter closes inContinue readingCable companies are the largest providers of high-speed broadband services in the US so the Charter-TWC deal is likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny because a successful deal would concentrate significant broadband power in one company.Regulatory opposition was a key factor in Comcast’s withdrawal of its own $45bn bid for TWC. The Philadelphia-based company had pursued TWC for more than a year but dropped the bid even as regulators indicated they would have blocked the transaction.The Charter-TWC deal has a $2bn break fee, which indicates that there are concerns that the deal could still fall apart over regulatory concerns.A definite agreement is expected to be announced before US markets open on Tuesday morning after the Memorial day break, but people familiar with the matter warned that the deal could still fail.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan in New York and Adam Thomson in Paris

Deploying billions of debt-financed dollars makes the other ways of getting rich seem like child’s play.This may be changing. The venerable Carlyle Group recently lost co-president Michael Cavanagh to media titan Comcast; he had served just a year since joining from JPMorgan. Carlyle lost finance chief Adena Friedman last summer; she left to be co-president at Nasdaq OMX, where she had previously worked. In the midst of the turnover at the top, shares of Carlyle are off a fifth since February 2014.Stock price is an imprecise way to measure PE firms. The business is wildly cyclical. When assets values are high, as they are now, firms sell holdings and can return cash to shareholders; but at such time it is hard to buy assets at attractive prices. Carlyle’s revenue — management and performance fees — will stay relatively flat between 2013 and 2015 at $3bn.Of the nearly $200bn in assets Carlyle manages, the largest part is invested in traditional buyouts. But banks are becoming less aggressive in lending for buyouts, and corporate buyers flush with cash are better positioned to win auctions.So firms such as Carlyle are pushing hard into new investing areas such as property, stock, bonds and debt. There have been bumps along the way. Carlyle recently shut down two small “liquid alternative asset” mutual funds that are part of an effort to attract funds from well-heeled retail investors.The core business is chugging along, though. Carlyle’s first-quarter appreciation on its funds was a healthy 6 per cent and it is touting a healthy stream of investment exits in the second quarter. While investors ponder when Carlyle’s revenues and earnings will grow again, they are being paid to wait. Based on payouts over the past year, Carlyle’s dividend yield is a formidable 7 per cent.Is the long-term view brighter still?

Altice has lined up financing from banks including JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada, Nomura and Société Generale to support a possible bid, some of these people said.But one other person close to the company said Altice had only just struck a $9bn deal five days ago and the company usually studies a new market for several months before seeking further deals.Altice, TWC and Charter all declined to commentCharter had until last week appeared seemingly uncontested in its efforts to acquire its larger rival Time Warner Cable, until Altice made its first foray into the market by acquiring Suddenlink, the US’s seventh-largest cable operator.Following the deal, which valued Suddenlink at $9.1bn including debt, Altice fed speculation that further moves would follow soon by declaring that any company smaller than the largest US cable operator Comcast was a potential consolidation target.Time Warner Cable only last month saw a $45bn takeover attempt by Comcast, which was agreed in February 2014, collapse because of regulatory scrutiny.That deal was originally struck as Time Warner Cable sought to escape the clutches of Charter, which had previously offered $132.50 in cash and stock. Time Warner Cable asked Charter for $160 per share at the time but then agreed a deal with Comcast that valued it at $158.82 per share.Shares in Time Warner Cable rose 3.1 per cent to $171.18 on Friday, giving the company a market value of $48.4bn as speculation of a deal with either Altice or Charter continued.The takeover talks come amid sweeping changes in the US cable industry as consumer habits are shifting away from television sets in favour of mobile and broadband connections and as content providers are exerting greater pricing pressure on distributors for premium programming that keep their customers’ attention.By consolidating, cable operators look to cut costs and use their scale to combat prices set by content providers.Additional reporting by Shannon Bond

Banks, insurers and other non-financial institutions have issued another $240bn on top of that.The appetite for new bonds has remained rock-solid in recent weeks despite the turbulence in government bond markets, which has sent the US 10-year Treasury yield up from an April low of 1.85 per cent to 2.29 per cent on Tuesday.Despite the rise in longer-term Treasury yields, it remains exceptionally cheap for borrowers to tap the US bond market.The average yield of bonds in the Barclays Aggregate index — the broadest gauge of borrowing costs — is just 2.24 per cent, up from a record low of 1.56 per cent in 2012 but down from over 5 per cent before the financial crisis and compared to the long-term average of over 7 per cent.“Supply for the overall fixed income market has been and may continue to be out of balance relative to demand,” Stephen Antczak, a strategist at Citigroup, said in a note. “We expect this factor to support corporate valuations in the period ahead.”Tuesday’s deals were dominated by “supranational” and government-related entities like the European Investment Bank and the export credit agencies of Canada and Japan, in addition to a smattering of bank bonds from Sweden’s SEB and Australia’s ANZ.But it also included companies like Comcast, Columbia Pipeline Group and a foray over the Atlantic by Volkswagen. US corporate issuance surpassed the $100bn mark for three months running in 2012, but has not held above that mark for four months since at least 1995, when Dealogic’s records began.Goldman Sachs and Comcast were behind the day’s most high-profile deals. The investment bank raised $5bn in a three-part sale, and the cable company sold $4bn of bonds maturing in 10, 20 and 30 years — underlining the move by corporate treasurers to take advantage of investor demand for fixed income to lengthen their average repayments.Including all entities — such as supranationals like the EIB, export credit agencies, structured finance deals, US agencies and the government — there has been over $1.2tn of bond sales in the US already this year, according to Dealogic.Issuance typically slows down drastically during the summer months. Analysts and investors said that the unusually heavy supply of the first five months of the year was probably the result of companies, development banks, financial institutions and other entities doing their funding ahead of schedule due to a possible Federal Reserve rate rise after the summer.
241;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-05-12T22:58:16Z;Facebook hires a net neutrality moderate;;In Kevin Martin, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under George W Bush, Facebook has just hired a moderate on the all-important issue of network neutrality.One of his first challenges: to prevent a repeat of the backlash seen in India last month against Facebook’s Internet.org, which critics see as a blatant attempt by the social network to colonise the mobile internet.Though a Republican, Martin oversaw the FCC’s first action against a US cable company over a net neutrality issue. That was back in 2008, when the agency challenged Comcast’s policy of “throttling”, or slowing, some types of internet traffic.Martin used his casting vote to side with two Democratic commissioners.Yet he was far from being a hard-liner on the issue. In particular, he later said that he would not have used so-called Title II regulation to keep networks open – the very approach that has been proposed by the Obama administration this year, with strong backing from Silicon Valley.Martin’s attempt to restrain Comcast ultimately failed. After he left the agency, a court threw out the FCC’s order. That prompted his successor to announce a stronger net neutrality stance – which was again rejected by a court, leading to the Obama administration’s present position.Beneath the simplistic headlines (who wouldn’t want to keep networks open?), net neutrality is set to remain the most challenging policy issue for global communication networks and the services which ride on them – which makes Martin’s new job, as vice president for mobile and global access policy, a key one at Facebook.That net neutrality is a double-edged sword for internet companies was underlined by what happened in India last month. A group of companies there withdrew from Internet.org in protest over zero-rating, under which the use of services like Facebook on mobile do not count against a user’s data plan.That approach amounts to a form of network bias, they complained, since it encourages users to tap into “free” services, to the detriment of others.The issues are not exactly the same as those raised in the US debate over network neutrality this year. But it didn’t take a crystal ball to see that zero-rating would become the next big issue in the global debate over network access, particularly in markets where mobile is all.This was what Mark Zuckerberg blogged in response to the backlash in India:[But] net neutrality is not in conflict with working to get more people connected. These two principles — universal connectivity and net neutrality — can and must coexist.To give more people access to the internet, it is useful to offer some service for free. If someone can’t afford to pay for connectivity, it is always better to have some access than none at all.It will now be up to former FCC chairman Martin to sell that idea around the world.
242;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-05-11T16:45:31Z;Mike Cavanagh quits Carlyle to join Comcast;Former JPMorgan banker becomes cable group’s finance director;"Mike Cavanagh, the former heir apparent to Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase, has quit Carlyle after less than a year to join Comcast as chief financial officer.He told colleagues at the private equity group that he had decided he was a “big company guy”, according to one person familiar with the matter. Mr Cavanagh did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Comcast, a cable and internet provider valued at $147bn, is much bigger on most measures than Carlyle, although it has a much smaller market value than JPMorgan’s $243bn.Carlyle hired Mr Cavanagh in March last year with considerable fanfare and agreed to buy out his unvested JPMorgan stock at significant expense. He started work in July.At Carlyle, Mr Cavanagh was co-president alongside Glenn Youngkin, a 20-year veteran of the Washington-based private equity group, who is now seen as having more chance of running it after co-chief executives William Conway and David Rubenstein.One former Carlyle executive said he had not “left his footprint” on the group during his short tenure and the company was suffering from too much bureaucracy.Mr Cavanagh’s second unexpected departure in 14 months came after Comcast announced in March that its then chief financial officer, Michael Angelakis, would found a new company, backed by the media and technology giant, to invest in smaller media and technology companies. The cable group has agreed to invest $4bn with Mr Angelakis putting in at least $40m.Comcast last month dropped its $45bn bid for Time Warner Cable after failing to convince regulators that a deal was in the public interest.Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, said: “I’m so thrilled Mike is joining our team. He is a world-class executive with significant experience leading and overseeing large companies with multiple, complex businesses. He has had a distinguished career that spans more than two decades, is incredibly talented, and will be a great leader for Comcast.”Mr Cavanagh joined Carlyle after telling Mr Dimon that the regulatory burdens and public pressure at the top of JPMorgan had become too much. Mr Cavanagh was with Mr Dimon for much of his career. He was co-head of the corporate and investment banking division when he left; his earlier roles included chief financial officer.Carlyle had agreed to pay him a “make whole” of about $30m for the unvested JPMorgan stock he was forfeiting. He has already been paid more than $9m of that, although he forfeits the rest. He was also paid more than $5m in bonus and salary.In a regulatory filing, Comcast said it would pay Mr Cavanagh $10m in performance-based stock, which vests next year, $2.5m in performance-based stock, which vests over three years, and a deferred bonus of $10m. He will also receive $1.8m in annual salary and up to $5.4m in cash bonus."
243;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-05-06T17:06:59Z;US cable television: how big is too big?;The failure of the Comcast/Time Warner merger is not the end of the dealmaking;"It is better to deal from strength than weakness; and often better still not to deal at all. Early last year, Time Warner Cable, hit by subscriber losses and under siege from a hostile bidder, signed a risky tie-up with Comcast. With that $45bn deal now scuttled by regulators, the operator (and its 11m television and 12m broadband subscribers) is back in play.A year ago, Robert Marcus, TWC’s new boss, rightly took heat for the $80m golden parachute that would have opened above him had the Comcast deal gone through. But while the deal was pending, he stabilised the business. TWC may have gone from desperate seller to kingmaker.When TWC jumped into the arms of Comcast, it was running away from the clutches of Charter, its smaller rival controlled by John Malone, the cable tycoon. Charter had offered TWC $132.50 a share — $83 in cash and the rest in Charter stock. TWC was unimpressed by the stock component. It asked for $160, with $100 in cash and the stock portion to be guaranteed against big fluctuations. That counterproposal was made moot by the Comcast merger.Today TWC shares trade at $158. As a multiple of forward earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) its shares trade at a robust 8 times. Charter’s offer last year was at around 7 times. There are ways to manipulate multiples with cost savings and tax benefits but the game of merger musical chairs has made the sector more pricey regardless.The thinking a year ago was that, despite its size, TWC would have to sell itself. However, TWC has halted the fall in subscriber numbers (in the first quarter it added 30,000 video subscribers along with 315,000 internet users).Today it could use that strength to be the buyer of smaller cable operators such as Bright House, which are too small to respond independently to the changes being brought to television consumption by internet video. The options are tantalising. Comcast’s ambitions were slowed by its size, something TWC must consider as it weighs its options.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
244;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-05-05T19:00:28Z;Netflix challenges AT&T’s $48bn DirecTV deal;Online video group seeks ‘appropriate remedies’ to prevent abuse;Netflix has warned US regulators that AT&T’s planned $48bn takeover of one of the country’s largest satellite television groups would create a company with the power to stop customers from ditching their pay-TV subscriptions in favour of online video services.In a letter to regulators at the Federal Communications Commission, the streaming video service said that AT&T’s bid for DirecTV would make it the biggest distributor of multichannel TV in the US as well as one of the country’s leading internet service providers.“These two dynamics create a powerful incentive for AT&T to protect its investment in DirectTV . . . by using its ability to harm online video distributors,” Netflix said in the letter dated May 4.This power would enable AT&T “to prevent or delay cord-cutting and cord-shaving,” Netflix added, referring to the trend of customers cancelling their cable and satellite TV subscriptions and getting their TV from cheaper online alternatives instead.The letter accused AT&T of having already degraded its customers’ access to Netflix’s online video service, which is home to shows including House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. “Netflix urges the commission to reject the merger as currently proposed,” it concluded.A person close to AT&T described Netflix’s move as a “last second attempt” to impact on the deal, and said there was “nothing new in their filing”. AT&T and the FCC declined to comment.Netflix was one of the leading voices in a broad coalition that opposed Comcast’s ill-fated $45bn bid for Time Warner Cable, which was terminated last month amid signs that regulators were planning to block the deal.However, a spokesperson said Netflix was not opposing the AT&T-DirectTV deal outright, but rather seeking remedies to ensure the combined company would not be able to abuse a dominant position.“While we are participating in the government’s review, we are not opposing the merger. We’ve been highlighting concerns about AT&T’s broadband practices and the need for appropriate remedies since last September,” the spokesperson said.AT&T-DirecTV was announced in the shadow of the Comcast deal. I don’t know if it was deliberate but it saved them from a lot of scrutinyNow that Comcast has pulled its offer for Time Warner Cable, many internet campaigners and companies have turned their attention to the AT&T deal, according to John Bergmayer, an attorney at Public Knowledge, the consumer advocacy group that also played a prominent role in the “Stop Comcast” coalition.“There is no doubt that AT&T-DirecTV was announced in the shadow of the Comcast deal. I don’t know if it was deliberate, but it saved them from a lot of scrutiny they otherwise would have got,” he said.Public Knowledge has petitioned the FCC to reject the deal, based on fears that it will hurt online video platforms and make the internet less open. Mr Bergmayer said that AT&T should be forced to sign up to the FCC’s latest open internet rules, which it is challenging in the courts, along with other telecoms groups.In its letter, Netflix argued that AT&T would be able to use data caps and usage-based pricing to make services like Netflix more expensive compared to its own online video offerings.The FCC seeks to make merger decisions within 180 days of a deal being agreed, but it stopped the clock on the AT&T-DirecTV deal in mid-March at the 170-day mark. On the same day it also paused its countdown on the doomed Comcast-TWC merger. The decisions were made to allow time for a District of Columbia appeals court to rule in a related case.At the time the FCC said: “The Commission reserves the right to restart the clock as it believes will best serve the public interest and it intends to provide further guidance as it becomes appropriate.”

Charter had made a hostile bid for TWC last year but was trumped by Comcast’s $45bn offer.Comcast incurred $99m of costs relating to the TWC bid in the quarter, bringing the total spent on the deal to more than $300m. Mr Roberts said during an investor call that he had hoped to bring Comcast’s technology and services to TWC’s customers in markets such as New York and Los Angeles but “ultimately the government didn’t see it the same way”.Earnings per share rose from $0.71 to $0.81. Excluding adjustments, earnings per share were $0.79; analysts had been expecting earnings per share of $0.74.Net income rose from $1.9bn to $2.1bn, boosted by gains in the number of subscribers to its broadband services. Revenues rose from $17.4bn to $17.85bn.Comcast is adding $2.5bn to its share buy-back programme, raising its total for this year to $6.75bn.The performance of Comcast’s NBCUniversal unit was boosted by the popularity of the Harry Potter attraction at its theme parks. Steve Burke, NBC’s chief executive, told analysts the company planned to invest in the parks, adding a new attraction every year.The theme parks in Orlando and California were generating $400m a year when Comcast acquired its first tranche of NBCUniversal in 2009. “This year they will do $1.3bn in operating cash flow,” he said.NBC was boosted by the film adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey, which topped box office charts round the world.The company also released Furious 7, which became the first Universal Studios film to hit $1bn in global box-office receipts, although the film was released early in the second quarter.Comcast shares rose 0.5 per cent by close of trading in New York to $58.72."
246;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-04-28T18:20:39Z;Media: Comcast’s next act;After Brian Roberts’ $45bn bid for Time Warner Cable was blocked, will he move to counter the internet upstarts?;In sport, as in business, Brian Roberts does not like to lose. The amateur squash player has won five medals at the Maccabiah Games, often known as the Jewish Olympics. At the same time, he scored with Comcast, turning a company co-founded by his father in 1963 into America’s largest provider of cable television and broadband internet services.Comcast’s growth has been fuelled by aggressive dealmaking by Mr Roberts, who has masterminded the multibillion-dollar acquisitions of AT&T Broadband and NBCUniversal. But last week, the chief executive’s winning touch deserted him when Comcast withdrew its $45bn offer for Time Warner Cable after spending the past 14 months trying to convince regulators to approve it.The combination of the two largest internet and cable operators would have created a broadband behemoth that controlled the high-speed access of 57 per cent of connected US homes. But from the start, Mr Roberts’ deal faced stiff opposition. Open internet advocates and Hollywood writers joined Comcast rivals such as Netflix and Discovery Communications to lobby against the merger, arguing it would have too much control over the broadband and TV markets. The US justice department and Federal Communications Commission concluded that a tie-up was not in the public interest.“It’s not going to happen,” a flat Mr Roberts said when Comcast withdrew last Friday. “In the end, we’ve got to move on.”The question now is where Mr Roberts moves next. With a steady revenue stream flowing from millions of pay TV and broadband subscribers, Comcast has performed well even as the digital revolution has upended much of the media world. But a rapid reshaping of the television industry poses big challenges to Comcast and its competitors, leading some analysts to conclude that the company should push hard into next-generation wireless technology to satisfy rocketing demand for online video. Others say it should look beyond the US for growth.“Since Comcast announced the TWC deal last February the entire television landscape has changed,” says James McQuivey, a media analyst with Forrester Research.A generation of young “cord-cutters” has drifted away from cable, leading channel owners to, belatedly, try to reach them through other means. HBO, the premium network behind shows such as Game of Thrones and True Detective, recently launched a standalone, “over the top” service that does not require the kind of expensive, bundled subscription that Comcast sells.CBS, Nickelodeon, the children’s network, and the WWE Network are already selling their programmes directly to consumers, with new services also on the way from Comcast’s own NBC network and Showtime, the premium cable channel.And a new set of cheaper, online-only channel bundles is putting further pressure on the cable and broadbandpackages sold by Comcast for between $50 and $200 per month. Sony recently launched PlayStation Vue, an internet TV service that costs $50-$70 a month — much less than a typical cable package — and includes channels such as CBS, Nickelodeon, Fox and Discovery.Dish Network’s $20 a month Sling TV service has also made waves because it includes the sought after ESPN sports channel, as well as AMC, home of The Walking Dead zombie drama. Apple is stepping up its presence in online TV this year after holding talks with broadcasters including Fox and ABC. Verizon, the telecoms group, plans to launch an online video package for mobile devices.The new services come as digital video has surged in popularity — at the expense of cable TV. Netflix recently passed 60m subscribers, with 41m of them in the US: it is ploughing money into original programming such as Orange is the New Black and Daredevil to complement a broad library of licensed TV shows and movies. Amazon has also got into the digital video business, winning plaudits for original online programmes such as its Golden Globe-winning Transparent and commissioning a comedy series from Woody Allen.Netflix says its users streamed 10bn hours of video in the first quarter. That accounted for nearly 6 per cent of TV viewing in the US — and represented 43 per cent of the drop in cable and broadcast ratings (audience size), according to MoffettNathanson analysis of Nielsen data. “We believe Netflix’s US total streaming hours relative to traditional television will steadily rise,” says Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. The trend of lower TV ratings has been “gaining strength over the past few years as Netflix has gained subscribers”.From humble origins to a thwarted $45bn bid for Time Warner CableThe owners of cable channels are feeling the heat from these viewing trends, with Viacom among the worst hit. Controlled by 91-year-old billionaire Sumner Redstone, it has suffered some of the sharpest ratings declines, with viewing down 18 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to MoffettNathanson’s analysis. BET, which is aimed at African-American audiences, fell 22 per cent, Nickelodeon was down 17 per cent and MTV declined 14 per cent.Lower ratings mean lower advertising revenues. Cable channels owned by Comcast’s NBCUniversal are among those feeling the pinch: at NBCU’s cable channels, which include CNBC, USA Network and Bravo, revenues from advertising fell 5.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014 from a year earlier.Meanwhile, online video channels are surging. At a recent presentation to advertisers by Crackle, Sony’s ad-supported online video service, comedian Jerry Seinfeld mocked the networks that, two decades ago, provided the platform for his success. “The TV networks are hoping you don’t figure out that they are over and there’s nothing special about it,” he said. He said his show, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, which is returning to Crackle for a sixth season in June, attracted 100m total views last month. “What is the internet? It’s a way of reaching people — it’s just television.”Netflix has built its increasingly global business around the idea that “internet television is replacing linear TV”, or watching shows at the time they are broadcast, in the words of chief executive Reed Hastings’ recent letter to shareholders.“The world’s leading linear TV networks, such as HBO, ESPN, Canal Plus and BBC, are moving into internet TV,” he wrote. “Eventually, as linear TV is viewed less, the spectrum it now uses on cable, fibre, and over-the-air will be reallocated to expand internet data transmission. Satellite TV subscribers will be fewer and more rural. The value of high-speed internet will increase.”Not surprisingly, streaming video consumption is highest among the youngest consumers, with nearly three-quarters of households headed by someone under 35 subscribing to a service such as Netflix or Hulu Plus, according to Nielsen — the same consumers who are least likely to be pay-TV subscribers. Traditionally, advertisers have coveted these younger viewers.For the world’s biggest media companies, including Comcast, reaching that next generation means giving them access to content when, where and how they want to watch it.Richard Plepler, chief executive of Time Warner’s HBO, describes the premium channel’s new standalone service, launched this month, as a “millennial missile”. HBO says it is targeting the service at the 10m US homes that only have broadband connections — “a large and growing opportunity that should no longer be left untapped,” Mr Plepler said when he unveiled it.The big shift to online viewing explains why Comcast was so keen to acquire TWC. The consumers deserting linear television in favour of on- demand, online viewing still need internet access: a Comcast-TWC combination would have been the main gateway to those new services for more than 30m broadband subscribers. With the purchase of TWC blocked, Mr Roberts needs another route to growth.He has several options, including investing in new ways to deliver video services to customers Comcast does not currently serve. Comcast is limited to operating in markets where it owns and operates physical cable infrastructure — about 30-40 per cent of US households, according to Forrester. This is why it wanted to increase the size of its available market by combining with TWC.But new, wireless broadband technology may eventually mean that it can deliver services to US markets without needing any physical infrastructure. If it does not invest in this technology it risks losing out to competitors that do, says Mr McQuivey.Dish Network, the satellite TV group controlled by Charlie Ergen, has staked a large bet on US wireless spectrum, which could be used to deliver broadband internet. That could open the door to packaging its Sling TV service with a wireless internet connection — giving consumers an alternative to Comcast’s cables for their high-speed connections.“Say you can get television from Sling and broadband from a wireless broadband supplier like Google or Dish,” says Mr McQuivey. “Suddenly you don’t need Comcast for anything. Comcast is going to be threatened by a new set of broadband providers.” He says Mr Roberts should invest some of the funds saved on the TWC deal on wireless broadband, which could be deployed in markets where the company has no physical presence.The international market is another option for Mr Roberts. Comcast, which also owns the Universal movie studio and theme parks, has a minimal television or internet presence outside the US. With the TWC bid no longer viable, Mr Roberts may look to the “cable cowboy” John Malone for inspiration.The 74-year-old billionaire was behind much of the US cable consolidation but has spent the past few years on the acquisition trail in Europe, spending €35.3bn since 2010 on cable groups such as Virgin Media in the UK, Kabel BW in Germany and Ziggo in the Netherlands.Pay TV penetration is much lower in Europe — less than 60 per cent of available households compared with about 85 per cent in the US — so there is more room for operators such as Mr Malone’s Liberty Global group to grow.The European market would be more competitive than what Comcast has been used to. In the early days of the US cable industry, the companies that were first to lay their pipes in a town or city could operate in those markets unchallenged: for rivals, the cost of laying cable in an area that was already served was prohibitive. This led to the regional monopolies that still exist today: TWC is the sole cable operator in large parts of New York and Los Angeles, for example.But in the UK, operators are allowed to use infrastructure owned and operated by BT, which means multiple operators can serve the same market. A successful bid for Sky, the satellite operator that owns rights to English Premier League football, would give Comcast immediate entry to the UK, Italian and German markets, following the recent three-way merger between Sky, Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia. A bid for Liberty Global would be another option.Or Mr Roberts could double the bet he made in 2013 when Comcast acquired Universal by buying another content company, such as Time Warner, which owns HBO, or ITV of the UK.Mr Roberts has proved he is willing to think big, having done some of the largest deals the US media and telecoms sector has ever seen — spending $72bn on AT&T Broadband and $30bn on NBCUniversal. But he has had some misses too, being rejected by Walt Disney after Comcast made a $54bn offer and now, 11 years later, with the failed bid for TWC.As a hardened squash player Mr Roberts knows all about working the angles to win. But with the rules of the media game evolving rapidly his next shot will need to be well placed.
247;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-04-24T16:23:22Z;Comcast opponents hail open internet victory;TWC deal failure seen as sign of broadband users’ growing political clout;Comcast officially withdrew its $45bn offer for Time Warner Cable as the US justice department suggested it would have blocked the combination and hailed the failure of the deal as a victory for innovative content providers and streaming video services.Campaigners who had opposed the combination of America’s two largest cable and broadband providers from the start greeted its collapse as a sign of increasing support for an open internet in Washington.“The demise of this merger, alongside the net neutrality victory from earlier this year, mark the rise of internet users as a powerful political constituency that can no longer be ignored by elected officials and policy makers,” said Craig Aaron, chief executive of the lobby group Free Press.Regulators’ opposition supported the proposition that they had focused more on rapidly evolving digital technologies than on the cable video market.The mooted Comcast-TWC deal “would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation, including to the ability of online video providers to reach and serve consumers,” said Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.The DOJ similarly cited “significant concerns” that the tie-up would have made Comcast “an unavoidable gatekeeper for internet-based services that rely on a broadband connection to reach consumers”.Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company would “move on”.“Of course, we would have liked to bring our great products to new cities, but we structured this deal so that if the government didn’t agree, we could walk away,” he said.Neither company will have to pay a “break fee” following the deal’s collapse. But at least 11 banks worked on the deal and related transactions and stand to miss out on up to $325m in fees, according to estimates from Freeman & Co, the consulting group.This includes fees associated with the likely collapse of Comcast and TWC’s agreement to sell 3.9m subscribers to Charter Communications, the John Malone-backed cable operator, and Charter’s $10.4bn proposed purchase of Bright House Networks.TWC executives will also miss out on a hefty windfall. Rob Marcus, TWC’s chief executive, was in line to receive $79.9m in cash, equity and benefits if the deal had completed — despite only being appointed to the job two months before Comcast submitted its offer.Arthur Minson, TWC’s chief financial officer, had been set for a severance package worth an estimated $27m.Comcast’s next move is unclear but the company, which owns NBCUniversal, is likely to look for other deals, said Amy Yong, a Macquarie Securities analyst.Its options “could include expanding its footprint overseas, increasing its presence in media to boost NBCUniversal, or moving into the wireless business,” she said.Analysts and bankers expect Charter to make a renewed approach to TWC, which it had bid for last year before Comcast entered the picture.A combined Charter-TWC may then look to buy another company such as Cablevision, controlled by New York’s Dolan family. “Charter-Time Warner Cable is the most logical long-term buyer” for the 3m-subscriber company, said Ms Yong.The failure of the Comcast-TWC deal will not dent cable consolidation for long, said Susan Crawford, co-director of the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard University.“There will be more efforts in the cable industry to further consolidate but that’s not good for the country,” she said. “Operators face neither competition nor real oversight so they can essentially extract a private tax from all high-capacity uses of their networks.”
248;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-04-24T12:46:21Z;Comcast walks away from $45bn TWC deal;Withdrawal after FCC intervention could set stage for new round of media mergers;Comcast officially dropped its $45bn bid for Time Warner Cable on Friday after failing to convince regulators that a deal that would have transformed the US media and internet landscape was in the public interest.“Today, we move on,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast chairman and chief executive, in a statement. “Of course, we would have liked to bring our great products to new cities, but we structured this deal so that if the government didn’t agree, we could walk away.”The end to the 14-month quest to combine America’s two largest US cable and internet providers came after the US communications watchdog recommended a procedural hearing that looked likely to kill the combination.TWC was trying to salvage the deal as late as Thursday, according to a person familiar with the situation, and had made last-minute overtures to Comcast in a bid to bring it back to the negotiating table.The collapse of the deal was hailed by the US attorney-general as a victory for the Department of Justice that was the “best outcome for American consumers”.“This is a victory not only for the Department of Justice, but also for providers of content and streaming services who work to bring innovative products to consumers across America and around the world,” Eric Holder said.The failed effort to create a content and distribution powerhouse is the second largest media deal to have collapsed since 1999, according to S&P Capital IQ, displacing Comcast’s failed 2004 bid for Walt Disney.The proposed deal sparked several other transactions, including AT&T’s agreed $48.5bn purchase of DirecTV, which is thought to have a better chance of regulatory approval.The Comcast-TWC tie-up drew immediate regulatory attention and a storm of protest when it was announced in February 2014, with open internet advocates and companies such as Discovery Communications and Netflix lining up to oppose it.Its fate seems to have been sealed on Tuesday when antitrust staff at the Federal Communications Commission recommended that the deal be referred to an administrative judge.People familiar with the matter said the referral torpedoed the transaction, pointing to the fact that only two deals have survived such administrative hearings in the last three decades.Robert McDowell, a former Republican FCC commissioner said one factor counting against Comcast was its apparent failure to meet all the merger conditions set in 2011 for its acquisition of NBCUniversal.The FCC antitrust staff analysing the transaction on Wednesday briefed FCC commissioners and then Comcast officials. “In their estimation this merger would do more harm to consumers and not have many benefits,” said one person who was briefed.The deal’s failure is likely to have wider repercussions.Charter Communications, backed by John Malone, had agreed to buy 3.9m subscribers from Comcast and TWC, and had bid $10.4bn for Bright House Networks.The group may become the world’s largest media company. Content companies are worriedContinue readingBoth deals were contingent on the completion of the Comcast-TWC combination. Analysts and bankers believe Charter could instead make a fresh approach to TWC, possibly below the price at which Comcast trumped its unsolicited offer last year.Analysts expect Comcast to turn its attentions elsewhere following the FCC’s recommendation. Potential targets could include a content company, such as Time Warner, Lionsgate or Netflix, or a wireless provider such as T-Mobile US. Another option would be to look overseas, with Liberty Global and Vodafone among the possible targets mentioned by analysts on Thursday.Comcast, which also owns NBCUniversal, has also been linked with a bid for ITV, the free to air UK commercial broadcaster.Comcast shares closed up 1.1 per cent while shares in TWC were down 0.6 per cent. There was no termination fee in the transaction, which means neither company will incur a financial penalty from its collapse.Reporting by Matthew Garrahan, Shannon Bond and James Fontanella-Khan in New York and Barney Jopson in Washington
249;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-04-23T14:44:48Z;Comcast: the day after tomorrow;The media group looks set to abandon a deal under which the ground had already shifted;Walking away may be the easy part for Comcast. The media juggernaut announced a surprise deal for rival Time Warner Cable in February 2014, thinking the merger would be complete within a year. That year has passed, and the company, after getting resistance from regulators, appears ready to abandon the deal. Regardless of the outcome, the industries Comcast plays in have evolved since last year and its dominance in them is slowly eroding.Comcast is the rare media company to have successfully executed a content and distribution strategy. Its pay-TV and broadband units have more than 20m customers and accounted for two-thirds of its $68bn in annual revenue. While the number of subscribers to its bundles of television channels is shrinking — it lost 200,000 last year — the decline is slower than competitors. And it is adding about 1m broadband customers annually. The operating margin on TV/broadband business is more than 40 per cent.Both areas have come under assault this year, however. HBO and CBS are offering their content over the internet, outside of a traditional channel package. Verizon, a telecoms group that also distributes TV, introduced a “skinny bundle” — a smaller set of channels at a lower price. (Content producers Disney and 21st Century Fox argue that skinny bundles violate their contracts with Verizon.) Comcast’s broadband strength is a hedge against weakness in pay-TV but US “net neutrality” rules, enacted this year, may curtail Comcast’s pricing power there.The concerns on the content side, at Comcast’s NBCUniversal unit, may be more immediate. The past year has seen a sharp drop in cable television ratings and, subsequently, advertising revenue. In the fourth quarter, Comcast cable advertising revenue fell 6 per cent and even with good results in other units such as broadcast television and theme parks, NBCU’s total revenue was up just 2 per cent.Comcast, like every traditional media company, is trying to guess how content will be consumed in the future. Mergers may protect profits whatever happens — the TWC deal came with $2bn in cost savings. The more intriguing option is to find fresh ways to compete in the new world. The $4bn venture capital fund Comcast just created to invest in emerging technologies may be a step in the right direction. Old media’s survival hinges on the difficult task of building something different.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
250;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Proposed $45bn Comcast-TWC deal hits regulatory turbulence;FCC recommends administrative hearing in move seen as ‘certain death’ for merger;"Comcast’s hopes of completing its $45bn purchase of Time Warner Cable have been dealt a blow after the US communications watchdog recommended an administrative hearing, a move it typically makes when it decides a deal is not in the public interest.The recommendation by the Federal Communications Commission “appears certain death for the transaction”, said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research. “The question now is how soon does Comcast walk away and what do they focus on next?”The deal to combine the US’s two largest cable and internet providers would have changed the media landscape, creating a content and distribution powerhouse.A combined Comcast-TWC would have supplied some of the largest metropolitan areas in the US with cable television services and, more significantly, would have been the largest provider of fixed-line, high-speed internet access.Comcast also owns the NBCUniversal broadcast and cable network, as well as the Universal Studios theme park and movie studio.The deal, which requires approval from both the FCC and the justice department, has faced more than a year of regulatory scrutiny and a storm of protest from open internet advocates and opponents of cable consolidation.Critics and companies such as Netflix and Discovery Communications have lined up to urge the FCC to block the deal because the combined companies would wield too much market power.The FCC’s staff recommendation must now go to the regulator’s five commissioners, who will vote on whether to approve it.The FCC is required to refer merger proposals to a judge via a hearing designation order if it cannot determine that a deal is in the public interest or if it has substantive questions about its details. An administrative law judge then reviews the deal in a trial-style process.It is rare for transactions to be passed to a judge by the FCC, but in 2011 the regulator’s decision to refer AT&T’s attempt to buy T-Mobile turned out to be a bad omen for that deal, which eventually collapsed.A review by an administrative law judge would probably take several months.Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on the recommendation for an administrative hearing, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.“Giving so much control over our communications system to one company — especially one with a track record of spiralling prices, terrible customer service and blocking internet content — would be a mistake,” said Matt Wood, policy director of Free Press, a non-partisan group that opposes the deal.If, as seems likely, the deal collapses, other transactions will be jeopardised.Comcast’s proposed sale of 3.9m subscribers to rival Charter Communications — which it proposed to appease regulators — would fall through. Charter’s agreed $10.4bn purchase of Bright House Networks would also be in doubt.Comcast, like every traditional media company, is trying to guess how content will be consumed in the future. Mergers may protect profits whatever happens. The more intriguing option is to find fresh ways to compete in the new world.
Continue readingThe tide first began to turn against the deal in November 2014, when President Barack Obama urged the FCC to regulate the internet as a public utility much like the US telephone system.His intervention stunned Comcast, which has argued against reclassification, and sparked market jitters that the deal would be blocked.Comcast held separate meetings on Wednesday with the FCC and with the justice department. Bloomberg reported last week that justice department staff attorneys were nearing a recommendation to block the deal.It is unclear if Comcast and TWC would agree to further concessions to ease regulatory worries over the combined company’s footprint in pay-TV and broadband and its negotiating power over TV programmers."

Charter’s acquisition of Comcast customers would be in doubt, as would Charter’s recently announced $10.4bn agreement to buy Bright House Networks.Consumer groups, some lawmakers and content providers such as Netflix have come out strongly against the deal, arguing that the companies could raise prices for customers and charge content providers more to reach audiences.Bloomberg reported on Friday that justice department staff attorneys were nearing a recommendation to block the deal, and Wednesday’s meeting, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, could result in the companies being pushed to agree more concessions.Regulators are also worried about the negotiating power Comcast-TWC could have over television programmers, which obtain payments from cable companies to show their content, according to people familiar with the case.But cable providers argue that such deals benefit programmers. Last year, TWC was locked in a battle with CBS over how much the cable company should pay to show CBS-owned programming. The disagreement caused a month-long blackout of CBS-owned networks, such as Showtime and the Smithsonian Channel, for certain Time Warner Cable subscribers.The parties resolved their disagreement in a deal that gave CBS more favourable financial terms, although details were not disclosed.Merger may die but Time Warner Cable may be fine with thatContinue readingTWC shares fell 5.4 per cent on Friday and are trading 11 per cent below the value of Comcast’s all-share bid, indicating that investors are sceptical that the deal will go ahead.Comcast and TWC have argued their merger would lead to an improved service and they have also pledged to abide by net neutrality principles that would require them to treat all internet traffic equally.“The Comcast/Time Warner Cable transaction will result in significant consumer benefits — faster broadband speeds, access to a superior video experience, and more competition in business services resulting in billions of dollars of cost savings,” Comcast said.“These benefits have been essentially unchallenged in the record — and all can be achieved without any reduction of competition. As a result, there is no basis for a lawsuit to block the transaction.”TWC said: “The regulatory process remains fluid, and we do not intend to comment on our interim dealings with the DOJ, FCC or other regulators. As we have said, we believe the transaction is pro-competitive, in the public interest and that there is no basis for regulators to block the deal.”If the DoJ moves to block the deal, it does not necessarily mean the transaction will die. The agency sued in the American Airlines-US Airways deal, but ended up approving the merger in 2013 after the companies agreed to additional concessions.Comcast and TWC have already agreed to divest 3.9m customers to Charter, but they may have to give up more customers or agree to other conditions to allay regulators’ concerns.The deal also needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission, which reviews transactions to ensure they are in the public’s interest. But the agency’s merger review has been put on hold because of lawsuits over whether third parties can view documents related to the deal.
252;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-04-06T14:56:57Z;US broadband providers wake up to the need for speed;Google’s Fiber service has spurred companies to build their own superfast networks;Slow and expensive. For years, those two words have summed up the broadband internet experience in the US, despite the preeminence of Silicon Valley’s tech industry.Now, the US telecoms industry is awaking from its slumber — prompted, in part, by Google Fiber, a superfast broadband network that is being built from scratch by the search group.On Thursday, Comcast announced Gigabit Pro, a new residential internet service that offers download and upload speeds of 2 gigabits per second — a blistering pace that most consumers simply do not need. It has been likened to offering a Lamborghini to a parent who only needs a car for the school run.Nevertheless, the company — the largest US cable provider, with a roughly 57 per cent share of the broadband market — said it wanted to “help customers push the boundaries of what the internet can do” and “inspire developers to think about what’s possible in a multi-gigabit future”.It will launch the service in Atlanta next month, before introducing it in other cities throughout the course of the year. Other details, such as pricing, were sketchy. Comcast’s fastest service currently costs $399 a month, considerably more than rival offerings, although a source familiar with its plans said Gigabit Pro would be cheaper.For most customers, though, it is still likely to prove too much speed for too much money.However, the wider significance of Gigabit Pro is that it presages a broader upgrade of Comcast’s network, due to be completed next year. At present, only those who live very near the fibre backbone of Comcast’s network will be eligible for the new service. After the upgrade, the company will be able to offer 1 gigabit speeds to almost all of its customers.Comcast is the latest provider to offer superfast speeds, alongside AT&T and Centurylink — and their efforts can be seen as a victory for Google. Back in 2012, the tech group entered the broadband market by launching a gigabit offering in Kansas City, with the aim of championing a speedier American internet.Would these speeds have come along eventually without Google? Probably. But would they have happened as quickly? Probably notIt is also a vindication of “ nudge” economics. Google says it does not want to become a full-scale telecoms operator, and Google Fiber is available in only three markets, with plans to launch in a few dozen more. But its incursion into the broadband market has pushed the incumbents to up their game.AT&T has introduced its U-verse Gigapower service in seven markets, including Austin, Texas and Kansas City, where Google Fiber also operates, and in Cupertino, California — home to Apple and right on Google’s doorstep. It plans to expand to 11 additional markets and is exploring 25 more.There are also signs that Google is pushing down prices in the markets where it operates. Google Fiber offers gigabit internet for $70 a month — just a few dollars less than the price to get a connection with a third of that speed in New York.In Kansas and Austin, the two areas where AT&T competes directly with Google, it offers a gigabit service for $70 a month. But in markets where Google is absent, such as Cupertino and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, it charges $110 — almost 60 per cent more.AT&T played down suggestions of a Google effect. “We are trialling different prices in different markets,” a spokesperson said.Even so, Jeff Kagan, an independent technology analyst, said the launch of Google Fiber had encouraged AT&T and others to roll out gigabit speeds more quickly than they would have otherwise: “Would these speeds have come along eventually without Google? Probably. But would they have happened as quickly? Probably not. Google wanted everything overnight.”Google is not the only one that will be heartened by the rise of superfast broadband. Tom Wheeler, the chair of the Federal Communication Commission, has been busy defending his decision regulate broadband as if it were a public utility — a proposal that will, according to the industry, have a chilling effect on investment. Increased competition in the superfast broadband market undermines this claim.In speech in Ohio last week, Mr Wheeler pointed out: “Some internet service providers say investment will suffer if an open Internet is mandated. Google Fiber and hundreds of rural companies . . . say they can build their businesses within the sort of light-touch rules we have adopted. Even Comcast, AT&T and Verizon, who oppose what we did, continue to invest in their networks.”
253;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-03-31T17:18:59Z;Charter/ Bright House: harmonic convergence;Who needs debt when equity has doubled in two years;Despite resilient corporate debt markets, paying in stock is suddenly fashionable for big deals. Last week Warren Buffett and his private equity firm of choice, 3G Capital, merged their company Heinz with Kraft using mostly shares, sharply reducing Heinz’s leverage. On Tuesday, US cable company Charter Communications, chaired by noted junk bond fan John Malone, borrowed the Heinz/Kraft template, announcing a $10.4bn acquisition of competitor Bright House Communications.Bright House is a cable operator with 2m subscribers (against 4.3m for Charter). It is privately held by media conglomerate Advance/Newhouse. The Charter/Bright House tie-up is the latest round of musical chairs in US cable and broadband industry. The tune should stop following regulatory approval and closing of the Comcast/ Time Warner Cable mega-merger. Charter in a separate, previously announced transaction, is acquiring subscribers from Comcast/TWC as well as investing in another cable company being spun-off from Comcast/TWC.The quarter stake that Advance/Newhouse is taking in Charter will result in a more complicated structure than in the Heinz/Kraft deal. Advance/Newhouse and Charter will form a partnership to which both contribute their cable assets. Advance/Newhouse then receives $2bn in cash, $5.9bn in partnership units that exchange into common stock, and most interestingly, $2.5bn in preferred units that pay a 6 per cent coupon but can be converted into shares at a 40 per cent premium to the current Charter share price. And like Mr Buffett and 3G Capital, Mr Malone’s Liberty Broadband vehicle will buy another $700m in stock in Charter to maintain a 19 per cent stake.These machinations (partly driven by tax) will take Charter’s net debt/cash flow ratio below a reasonable 4 times. Charter shares have doubled since Mr Malone invested two years ago. With that kind of rally, equity can be cheaper than debt.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
254;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Comcast backs CFO in $4bn growth venture;Michael Angelakis will retain role integrating Time Warner Cable acquisition;Comcast’s chief financial officer, Michael Angelakis, will leave his post to take the helm of a new $4bn company focusing on growth investments around the world backed by the US’s largest cable group.Mr Angelakis’s move comes more than a year into Philadelphia-based Comcast’s closely scrutinised bid to acquire Time Warner Cable for $45bn, a deal that would create a dominant force in US broadband and pay-television. Last week, Comcast again extended the expected closing date for the deal from early 2015 to the middle of this year, citing regulatory delays.Mr Angelakis will serve as chief executive of the new venture, with Comcast as the sole outside investor for 10 years in an exclusive partnership. The cable group is investing $4bn, Mr Angelakis is putting in at least $40m, and other senior management at the new company will invest the remaining portion to bring total capital commitments of up to $4.1bn.It is Comcast’s first international push. While its NBCUniversal media group has some overseas presence, the parent company has built its business by consolidating cable operators across the US.Known for big deals such as Time Warner Cable, NBCUniversal, AT&T’s broadband business and cable group Adelphia Communications, Comcast has also been active in smaller, early-stage investing through its San Francisco-based venture capital arm, Comcast Ventures.Under Mr Angelakis, the new company will focus on a middle ground of growth-oriented investments at a time when the pay-TV industry is being challenged by internet video and technology is reshaping how media and advertising are delivered and consumed. It will spend up to $2bn a year and all deals beyond $400m must be signed off by Comcast.“This is a time of tremendous change and opportunity in our core technology and media industries, as well as in adjacent business areas,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive. “We believe the ability to establish entrepreneurial ventures that partner with and participate in the growth of innovative companies can be an important driver of strategic and financial value creation.”Comcast said Mr Angelakis would remain CFO until a successor is selected, and then become a senior adviser. He will assist with the transition and begin the integration process for the Time Warner Cable deal, which he has been closely involved with and for which he created the financial structure. The CFO was also closely involved in Comcast’s 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal.Comcast shares were little changed at $56.47 by close of trading in New York.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter:@shannonpareil

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
256;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-03-19T20:29:21Z;Comcast/TWC: School in session;Merger may die but Time Warner Cable may be fine with that;American high school students suffer “senioritis” in the spring — ignoring studies after university applications have been filed and graduation approaches. It is a dangerous illness. Colleges have been known to rescind the admission in the worst cases.Companies about to be acquired can make the same mistake. A year ago, Time Warner Cable agreed to be bought by Comcast. The regulatory review was supposed to be tough, but conventional wisdom held that the deal would squeak through. But now the betting leans the other way and so TWC may have to go it alone.Both companies say the right things about seeing the process through. But the chance of a dead deal (Comcast can terminate the deal at no penalty) can be quantified with stock prices. The “deal spread,” the gap between where TWC shares trade and what deal value is (based on the share exchange ratio), has soared as high as 13 per cent. A trickier calculation — based on theoretical TWC standalone price and the deal price — has put the chance of the deal closing below 50 per cent for months.This pessimism makes sense. The recent enactment of strict net neutrality rules may hurt the pricing power that Comcast would hold if the deal was allowed. But the market concentration it would create in broadband — up to 60 per cent of the US market — still worries regulators.Interestingly, the deal spread and probability of closing have improved of late as TWC shares have rallied 15 per cent since late January.Perversely, those gains may come not from confidence in the deal, but comfort with the idea of TWC going it alone. TWC’s fourth-quarter results showed some promise that it can survive on its own. Residential video subscriber losses narrowed to 38,000 after seeing losses of about 200,000 the previous year. Those steep declines had driven it to pursue a transaction in late 2013 and early 2014 where another management team could better run its assets. Perhaps the present team is fine. It can pay to stick to the books.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
257;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Apple close to launching online TV service;Group in talks with Fox and ABC to provide subscription streaming service;Apple is close to launching the latest step in its assault on the living room, with plans to start an online television service this year.The company is in advanced talks with US broadcasters including Fox and ABC to launch subscription streaming, according to people close to the negotiations. The news comes just weeks after the company announced a deal with HBO to bring its on-demand streaming app to Apple TV, its set-top box, next month, and cut the price of the service from $99 to $69.Viewers are increasingly looking to options that allow them to pick and choose individual channels for their TV service, instead of having to pay for predetermined bundles of networks, many of which they never watch.Observers have long speculated that Apple would launch its own over-the-top television service, which would go round traditional cable or satellite distribution in favour of streaming live video to consumers over the internet. Some believed that the iPhone maker might even release its own TV set.But Apple is increasingly seen as unlikely to add another screen to its family of devices. Instead, last week’s price could indicate that a revamped version of its set-top box is more likely.People with knowledge of the situation said that a new device was in the works last year, perhaps including the launch of the company’s App Store on TVs.For many years, Apple TV, which was originally launched alongside the iPhone in 2007, was described by Apple executives as a “hobby”. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said at an event last week that Apple TV had sold 25m units, up from 20m a year ago, making it a relatively small contributor to a company with revenues of almost $200bn in 2014.Nonetheless, Mr Cook said on several occasions last year that television was an area of “great interest”, generating more than $1bn in sales.“TV is one of those things that if we’re really honest, it’s stuck back in the ‘70s,” he said. “The interface is terrible.”Apple TV offers a range of channels, from the well-known such as Netflix, YouTube, CNBC and Sky News, to more niche content such as Crunchyroll, which shows Japanese animation.Some channels, including HBO, Watch ABC and Fox Now, are available only if customers also have a separate cable subscription. All have struck individual deals with the company’s media team to be included on Apple TV.Peers that point the way for what an extended Apple service could look like include Dish Networks’ Sling TV, which streams live TV to customers without a cable subscription for $20 a month, and Sony’s planned PlayStation Vue, an internet-TV service tied to its games consoles. Both have negotiated streaming deals with most of the biggest US networks.One holdout in Apple’s negotiations is said to be Comcast, but a person close to the situation said that failing to secure rights from its NBCUniversal subsidiary would be unlikely to prevent a launch in the coming months.Apple declined to comment on the talks, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Additional reporting by David Crow in New York
258;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-03-06T18:59:11Z;Lack back in charge at NBCU’s news unit;Veteran executive to steady division reeling from Williams controversy;Andy Lack, the veteran US news executive, is retaking the helm of NBCUniversal’s news division, which has been reeling from a controversy surrounding newscaster Brian Williams and broader ratings struggles at its broadcast and cable channels.It marks a return to the Comcast-owned television group for Mr Lack, 67, who ran NBC News from 1993 to 2001 and served as NBC president and chief operating officer from 2001 to 2003.Under his watch, the network’s flagship news shows — Today, Nightly News and Meet the Press — were each top-rated in their time slots, helping to burnish the reputation of a news business that Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts called NBC’s “crown jewel” when he bought the media company in 2011.“Andy’s experience and familiarity with our company and specifically the news division will be critical to our growth and future success,” Steve Burke, NBCU chief executive, told employees in a memo on Friday.As chairman, Mr Lack will oversee NBC News and MSNBC, the cable network. Deborah Turness, the head of NBC News, and Phil Griffin, head of MSNBC, will report to Mr Lack. CNBC, the business cable news channel, will report directly to Mr Burke. The news group’s current chairman, Pat Fili-Krushel, will move into a new corporate role at NBCU, Mr Burke said.Andy’s experience and familiarity with our company and specifically the news division will be critical to our growth and future successThe management shuffle comes during a tumultuous period for NBCU’s news operation, and Mr Lack’s appointment suggests the media company is looking for an experienced hand to steady the business.Mr Williams, the presenter of Nightly News since 2004 and one of NBC’s best-known faces, caused a public uproar in February when he admitted to fabricating a story about being in a helicopter that was shot down during the Iraq war.The network appeared slow to respond to the controversy, but ultimately suspended Mr Williams without pay for six months. Mr Burke said the anchor’s actions “jeopardised the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News” — a critical issue for any news outlet.The Williams scandal came at a particularly difficult time for NBC News and Ms Turness, whom the US network hired in 2013 from UK commercial broadcaster ITV to revive flagging ratings.Today, the morning programme hosted by Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie, lost its long-held crown in 2012, falling behind ABC’s Good Morning America. Meet the Press has also seen viewership fall and last year replaced longtime host David Gregory. Among viewers of cable news outlets, MSNBC trails far behind Fox News and CNN.NBC and MSNBC, like other television networks, are struggling with ageing audiences, sweeping changes in how people get news and entertainment in the face of competition from digital upstarts, and a broad shift away from watching live television.Like the embattled and now suspended NBC news anchor Brian Williams, I have never been in a helicopter that has been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade over Iraq, writes Robert Shrimsley. Unlike Williams, I have always regarded that as a good thing.ContinueMr Lack brings a wealth of experience across the media industry. He started his career as a news producer at CBS. After he left NBC, he was chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment and chief executive and chairman of Bloomberg Media Group, where he ran TV operations.From January until this week he served as chief executive of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, an independent US agency that oversees Voice of America and Radio Free Europe.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
259;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-02-26T18:33:49Z;Watchdog heeds Obama on net neutrality;Biggest government intervention in the internet in two decades could face legal challenges;The US has entered a new era of online regulation after rulemakers approved the biggest government intervention in the way the internet is run in almost two decades in order to stop broadband companies from blocking or favouring different websites.In a split decision at a tense meeting packed with activists, the US telecoms regulator adopted new “net neutrality” powers to ensure all internet traffic is treated equally by regulating broadband as a public utility.The move satisfied a call President Barack Obama made before last November’s midterm elections, but infuriated Republicans who called it an outrageous power grab.The Federal Communications Commission vote, in which commissioners split along party lines, was a victory for an open internet coalition that includes west coast digital companies such as Netflix and Democratic activists. It was a defeat for mobile and fixed broadband providers such as Verizon, AT&T and Comcast.But it is likely to become bogged down in legal challenges from broadband companies or their allies, raising doubts over how long the new rules will stay in force. They are due to come into effect 60 days after being officially filed.Tom Wheeler, the FCC chairman appointed by Mr Obama, said: “The action that we take today is an irrefutable reflection of the principle that no one — whether government or corporate — should control free and open access to the internet.”“The internet is too important to allow broadband providers to be the ones making the rules,” he said. “This is no more a plan to regulate the internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech,” he addedAdvocates of the open internet principle — known as “net neutrality” — want to ensure that broadband providers are banned from setting up fee-based internet fast lanes or “throttling” content from websites that use a lot of bandwidth or compete with their affiliates.Ajit Pai, a dissenting Republican FCC commissioner, said there was scant evidence of such abusive conduct by broadband providers. “It’s all anecdote, hypothesis and hysteria,” he said.“I don’t know whether this plan will be vacated by a court, reversed by Congress, or overturned by a future Commission. But I do believe that its days are numbered,” he added.David Cohen, executive vice-president at Comcast, said it was “deeply concerned” about the route the FCC was taking. While the cable provider supported the principle of an open internet, it said resorting to utility-style regulation threatened to create “litigation and regulatory uncertainty and may greatly harm investment”.Other broadband allies say the move opens the way to forms of regulatory intervention used in the EU to break the stranglehold of former telecoms monopolies.Tim Berners-Lee, the British web pioneer, told the meeting via a video recording that the FCC’s action would preserve the ethos of “permission-less innovation” online and help to protect free speech and human rights. Watching in the audience was Steve Wozniak, the Apple co-founder, who has become a leading advocate of net neutrality.Mr Obama’s forceful call for net neutrality rules after last November’s election has turned the internet into one of the most hotly contested partisan issues in Washington, alongside immigration, energy policy and financial regulation.America’s business leaders are frustrated and alarmed by the FCC’s decision to impose Depression-era regulations on the internet, a foundation of innovation and prosperity in the 21st centuryTo loud applause from activists, the proposal was endorsed by a 3-2 vote with two Democratic commissioners supporting Mr Wheeler and two Republican commissioners opposing it.Michael O’Rielly, a Republican commissioner, accused the Obama administration of “disgraceful” interference in the FCC’s activities and said it had sought to “dictate an outcome for pure political purposes”.Reactions poured in after the vote, with the NCTA, a cable lobby group, slamming the FCC and calling on Congress to step in to stop the regulator. The FCC was “abandoning a bipartisan national commitment to limited government involvement that has reigned for decades”, it said.John Engler, president of the Business Roundtable, a lobby group for blue-chip companies, said his members supported an open internet but argued that the FCC was taking the wrong approach.“America’s business leaders are frustrated and alarmed by the FCC’s decision to impose Depression-era regulations on the internet, a foundation of innovation and prosperity in the 21st century,” he said.The move was cheered by small internet companies including Tumblr, a social media business, and Etsy, a Brooklyn-based online retailer. Chad Dickerson, Etsy’s chief executive, told the meeting: “Thank you for voting to protect the internet as an engine of economic opportunity.”Chip Pickering, chief executive of Comptel, which represents smaller network providers, said: “Today’s action is a defeat for those companies that want to exert gatekeeper control over the internet and a clear victory for individual choice, free expression [and] competition.”
260;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-02-24T17:04:01Z;Comcast chief warns on new internet rules;Internet provider presses on with planned $45bn purchase of Time Warner Cable;"The US communication watchdog’s proposed new regulatory regime for the internet has “unnecessary risks” for internet providers, according to Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, America’s largest internet provider.The Federal Communications Commission will vote on Thursday on whether to regulate the internet as a public utility, much like commercial telephone networks. The vote, which is expected to pass, is likely to trigger legal challenges from large internet providers.Mr Roberts said Comcast was “absolutely for a free and open internet” and agreed with President Barack Obama and Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, on many points.“But this agreement boils down to what legal authority the FCC should use to put in place these rules,” he said, pointing to the risks associated with “1930s-style regulation of something as dynamic as the internet”.“We hope that when all is said and done there continues to be incentives to make new investments,” he added.Comcast is pressing ahead with its planned $45bn purchase of Time Warner Cable, despite increasing concerns that regulators may block the deal. “Our integration planning is on schedule,” Mr Roberts said.America’s largest cable operator reported flat fourth-quarter profits at the low end of expectations. The group still managed to record stronger revenues at its high-speed internet, advertising and business services divisions.Revenues rose from $16.9bn to $17.7bn, while net income was flat at $1.92bn. At the operating level, profits were up from $3.6bn to $3.8bn.Revenues from high-speed internet customers rose almost 10 per cent to $2.9bn; at its business services and advertising divisions revenues increased close to 20 per cent.At NBCUniversal, Comcast’s media group, which includes a broadcast network, film studio and cable channels, the theme parks business was the best performer, with revenues rising almost 30 per cent to $735m. Universal Studios’ theme park in Florida operates a Harry Potter attraction, one of the most popular in the country.Comcast said it would lift its dividend 11.1 per cent to $1 per share on an annualised basis. The company is also increasing its stock repurchase programme authorisation to $10bn, with the aim of repurchasing $4.2bn during 2015.It will consider more share repurchases if it is able to complete the Time Warner Cable acquisition, the company said.The shares rose 1.9 per cent to $59.32 in afternoon trading in New York."
261;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-02-22T20:02:12Z;Broadcasters fear falling revenues as viewers switch to on-demand TV;Concern over falling audiences and impact on advertising revenue;"With YouTube to watch, Instagram pictures to take and Facebook, Snapchat and other social media platforms to explore, a generation of young Americans that used to turn to television for entertainment is finding its fix elsewhere.They are watching on-demand services, such as Netflix and Hulu and the BBC iPlayer but turning off “linear” TV, or tuning in at a set time on a set channel. This migration has been gradual but is starting to show up in the quarterly results of some of the world’s biggest media companies — and investors are beginning to notice.Television executives started sounding the alarm last autumn when Viacom, 21st Century Fox, Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, and Walt Disney began reporting lower advertising revenues for some or all of their networks. Todd Juenger, senior analyst with Bernstein Research, called the ratings declines “alarming” and “unprecedented”.The trend has continued into the most recent round of financial results, with Viacom among the worst hit. The company, controlled by 91-year-old billionaire Sumner Redstone, has suffered some of the sharpest ratings declines, with viewership down 18 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to a MoffettNathanson analysis of Nielsen data.BET, which is aimed at African-American audiences, fell 22 per cent, the children’s network Nickelodeon was down 17 per cent while MTV declined 14 per cent.Viacom’s profits have held steady but on the company’s recent investor call, Philippe Dauman, chief executive, alluded to significant changes in audience habits. “It is no secret that there are far-reaching shifts taking place in our industry,” he said.His peers agree. In a nod to the popularity of subscription services such as Netflix, Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, owner of networks such as CNN and HBO, recently said television was “in the midst of a secular shift to on-demand consumption”. That has pushed networks including HBO and CBS to launch their own online offerings.At Viacom, the ratings decline is not only putting pressure on ad sales, but reducing the company’s leverage in negotiating with pay-TV providers that carry its channels. Some small operators, including St Louis-based Suddenlink Communications, which counts about 1m video subscribers, have dropped Viacom altogether. Suddenlink said Viacom’s pricing demands were too high.Viacom maintains its programming is still being viewed by young people and says they are just watching it in different ways. It has turned its fire on Nielsen, the consumer research company, whose ratings are the currency on which the $70bn television ad market depends.The broadcaster believes Nielsen’s measurements have not kept up with how people consume content. Such changes, it argues, are especially pronounced among younger audiences that watch its channels on smartphones and gaming consoles, which Nielsen does not measure.Mr Dauman said such “inadequate measurement” undermined “innovation” and disproportionately hit programmers such as Viacom. He has pledged to move away from relying on Nielsen ratings by boosting Viacom’s digital advertising inventory and selling more sponsorships and targeted ads that are inserted when shows are watched on demand. Viacom wants to increase the proportion of ad sales from those sources to 50 per cent in the next three years, from 30 per cent last year.Viacom is also loading more advertising into some programmes to generate more revenue, boosting commercial time by more than 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to Mr Juenger at Bernstein Research.Channels aimed at young viewers are not the only ones being hit. Viewership among 18-to-49 year olds of primetime broadcast and cable shows — some of the most valuable television advertising available — dropped 7 per cent in the final three months of 2014, the third consecutive quarter that audiences shrank, according to MoffettNathanson, the analysts. “This is just about the worst decline we have seen,” it said.David Zaslav, chief executive of cable programmer Discovery Communications, added to the criticism of Nielsen, saying last week “there’s no question that it’s under-measuring . . . I think they will fix it over time, but it’s a problem”.He contrasted the US to Norway, where “anybody that watches anything, whether you watch it in a bar, you watch it at your vacation house, whether you watch it on your iPad, it counts”. Since Norway moved to a new measurement system last year, he said, TV viewership has swung from double-digit declines to a 15 per cent increase.Nielsen plans this year to introduce new tools to measure watching on digital devices which it says will provide a more comprehensive portrait of evolving viewership habits.It also acknowledges that viewing a programme after its original transmission has taken a toll on audience ratings: the traditional metric, known as “C3”, captures only the live viewing and what is viewed within three days of the show being aired.“What it looks like is a decline in ratings when in fact there is shifting viewing that is not captured,” said Megan Clarken, Nielsen’s executive vice-president of global digital products.But she also noted that consumers have more choices in what they watch. “There’s a competing landscape on the digital side with digital pure plays producing content.”That includes Netflix and Amazon, which are both spending more on hit shows such as House of Cards and Transparent, and Google’s YouTube, whose online video stars are particularly popular with young viewers.Mr Juenger at Bernstein Research argues that television is undergoing a “structural” migration from ad-supported networks to streaming video services. “We don’t think those viewers are coming back,” he warns.Nielsen wants the television industry to adopt a new standard of ratings that captures viewing no matter the screen or source, and has been developing its own “total audience” metric to measure digital content. “We think it’s important that the ratings we provide are reflective of what’s going on in the environment,” Ms Clarken said.But, she added, redefining the industry’s currency is ultimately up to the media owners and the agencies that buy commercial time. “It will be the marketplace who decides the numbers on which they trade.”While the TV industry struggles to hammer out new models for revenue and measurement, advertising executives say they are following consumers in expanding the definition of television itself to encompass on-demand viewing, streaming and digital video.“I believe you have to redefine what television is. It’s more about moving content,” said Amir Kassaei, chief creative officer for Omnicom’s DDB Worldwide, an advertising agency.“There is still the old media platform called TV, which is strong and you should use it if you need to build awareness and build a bigger audience. But the way people are interacting with moving content more broadly is changing, especially with young people. We have to be selective if we are trying to reach people in the right way.”Shrinking live TV viewing threatens broadcasters’ bottom linesThis week, 3m more viewers than usual tuned into watched EastEnders, the long-running BBC soap opera, as it broadcast live, writes Henry Mance.But that one-off success is unlikely to break a trend of falling live television viewing in the UK, as viewers switch to Netflix, DVDs and catch-up services. Now the question is whether advertising revenues — which have been increasing at broadcasters such as ITV and Channel 4 — will start to drop.The amount of time that British children spend watching TV has fallen by 22 per cent since 2010, according to industry data from Barb. Many industry figures have argued that the shift away from live TV is a kids’ phenomenon, which will disappear as audience grow older.In fact, says Toby Syfret, an analyst at Enders Analysis, “the habits of the parents are changing too”.Live television viewing has fallen 11 per cent among adults aged 35 to 54 since 2010. For those audiences, the transition to on-demand viewing is often an easier behavioural shift than, say, the move from print books to ebooks. Only among the oldest demographic — aged 55 and above — has live television viewing remained relatively unaffected, falling 2 per cent in the past four years.Broadcasters are, however, riding a recovery in advertising sales. ITV’s shares are at their highest since the dotcom boom, with ad revenues rising 6 per cent year-on-year in the nine months to September 2014.In the short term, the fall in television audiences may actually increase the price of TV advertising. Brands want their ads to be seen a certain number of times on television; as it becomes more difficult to reach audiences, the cost of doing so rises.Brands cannot switch their spending to Netflix, which does not show ads. The obvious option is to advertise more on online platforms — including ITV’s on-demand player and YouTube.For the moment, “advertisers and media buyers just do not see [YouTube] as a substitute for mass market reach”, says Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum.“The big thing that prevents disruption is the content most people want to watch is produced by the big broadcasters,” says Mr Syfret.Broadcasters are therefore investing in making their own programmes. Some are also exploring revenue streams that would hedge against a decline in revenues. ITV launched its first pay channel in more than a decade last year, and offers ad-free digital subscriptions.This article has been amended since first publication to show correct figures for the chart labelled “Traditional v online TV”.Back to the top of the page"
262;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;US broadband: slow-speed internet;Selling networks is a high capital and low return business;Judging by the scorn heaped on US companies that deliver high-speed internet and cable television, it must be a wonderful business. Two big telecoms operators, Comcast and Time Warner Cable, are among the most loathed by their customers (according to customer satisfaction surveys) because of perceived high prices and poor service. And pressure on them is growing. The merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable still awaits approval from the Federal Communications Commission. Add in the FCC chairman’s recent call for a strict version of “net neutrality”, which could limit the providers’ ability to increase their broadband pricing, and there is not much warmth directed towards the sector.Except from shareholders. The sector, which also includes Charter Communications and Cablevision, has outperformed the US market over the past five years. That strong result may not be totally merited, however.To make performance appear rosy for investors (both debt and equity), broadband and cable operators focus on growing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. But ebitda is deceptive for broadband and cable companies as it does not account for the heavy capital expenditure needed to build the fastest networks or sharpest digital television pictures. A better performance measure would be return on invested capital — how efficiently spending turns into profit.The ROIC figures are not pretty. The average sector ROIC between 2011 and 2014 was just 9 per cent, which barely meets the cost of capital. That may be partly because capital spending has been heavy. As that moderates, returns could improve.But the dilemma now is how future investment will be funded. Would a combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable with a broadband market share of more than 60 per cent be less keen to upgrade its networks in future? Would the chance of consumer price regulation (a possible consequence of the net neutrality rules) make investments even less lucrative?All this scrutiny suggests that the sector will become a less attractive place to invest. The surprising part is how unattractive it already is.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Owned by Sumner Redstone’s Viacom, the network now attracts an in-demand young audience at a time when TV viewership is declining and ageing.When Jon Stewart leaves The Daily Show later this year it will bring to a close 16 years of cutting political comedy-cum-analysis. Here is a selection of clips spanning the high points of his career.Continue readingAt NBC, the scandal that has engulfed Mr Williams, presenter of the NBC Nightly News since 2004, has hindered efforts to revive its once dominant news operation and made the network a punching bag for the rest of the US media.Mr Williams, the face of one of NBC’s most visible and respected brands, recently admitted fabricating a story about a 2003 incident during his coverage of the Iraq war, having wrongly claimed that a helicopter he was flying in had been forced down after being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.He apologised to viewers on air after his account was disputed by a soldier who was present and this week was suspended without pay for six months. Steve Burke, the chief executive of NBC, which is owned by cable operator Comcast, said Mr Williams’ actions were “inexcusable” and “jeopardised the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News”.Viacom and Comcast generate billions of dollars in profits from a range of media businesses so identifying the direct financial impact from the Stewart and Williams exits is difficult. Viacom’s shares fell 1.45 per cent on Wednesday but Comcast rose 0.64 per cent. Yet analysts agree that both stars were central to the branding and reputation of core businesses — Comedy Central for Viacom and NBC News for Comcast.“Comedy Central has resonated with millennials and young media consumers, which is a highly sought after demographic,” said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Nomura. Viacom, he adds, “will want Comedy Central to retain its cachet as a smart network” following Mr Stewart’s departure.Viacom is struggling with ratings declines across its portfolio of cable networks, which includes MTV and Nickelodeon, and an accompanying loss of advertising revenue. Mr DiClemente said Mr Stewart’s show ranks as the kind of “must-have” programming Viacom needs for leverage in negotiations with the cable and satellite operators that carry its channels. Without Mr Stewart, its hand is arguably weakened.“You really want people who have passionate loyalty [from viewers] so that if Viacom’s networks were pulled they would switch providers,” he said.Brian Williams, the NBC News presenter and managing editor who sparked a furore when it emerged that he had told a bogus story about the Iraq war, has been suspended without pay for six months by the Comcast-owned broadcaster. The suspension casts doubt on Mr Williams’ future at NBC and comes as Deborah Turness struggles to improve the fortunes of the network’s flagship morning Today Show and its Sunday programme, Meet the Press.Continue readingViacom said Comedy Central had a “deep bench that we can draw on” of supporting talent, which will be keen to replace Mr Stewart at The Daily Show. The network has shown that it is capable of developing big stars who resonate with viewers and advertisers: Stephen Colbert, who will take over from David Letterman on CBS later this year, got his big break working on Mr Stewart’s show, as did John Oliver, who moved from Comedy Central to Time Warner’s HBO in 2014 to host his own satirical news programme.“The fact that Oliver left and Colbert left just makes it even more challenging for Viacom. Talent is scarce and hard to come by,” said Allen Adamson, North America chairman of Landor, a branding company. “For any content provider, when you lose a big star, it’s hard to fill that void.”At NBC, the issue is less about replacing a star than restoring credibility. Mr Williams, who has become a celebrity beyond his nightly news programme and a fixture on late night talk shows, is the best-known and — until the recent controversy — most positively rated of the evening news anchors, according to Henry Schafer of Q Scores, a brand measurement agency.“He expanded his awareness and appeal to other audiences outside of the 6:30pm newscast, which is a good marketing strategy if you handle it the right way,” he said. “Unfortunately, it backfired.” His mistake has cost NBC and Comcast hard-earned credibility.

Mr Williams had embellished the account on several occasions, saying at one point that his helicopter had been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and taken enemy fire.However, he was forced to make an on-air apology when his account was disputed recently by a soldier who was present when the attack took place: Mr Williams, the soldier said, was miles way when the incident happened. Mr Williams apologised last week, claiming he had “misremembered” the incident.Steve Burke, the chief executive of NBC and a friend of Mr Williams, said the news anchor’s actions were “inexcusable”.“By his actions, Brian has jeopardised the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News,” he said. The suspension, he added, was “severe and appropriate”.Ms Turness, who was hired from UK commercial broadcaster ITV in 2013 to revive NBC News, said Mr Williams had on a recent broadcast “misrepresented” events that had occurred during his coverage of the Iraq war.“It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues,” she said, referring to an account given by Mr Williams on CBS ‘s The Late Show with David Letterman. “This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian’s position.”In democracy, as in life, an ounce of humour is worth a pound of logic. There is nothing new in using it to sway opinion.Continue readingMr Williams’ broadcasts are being scrutinised by Richard Esposito, a former investigative reporter with ABC News, and Kim Harris, the general counsel of NBC Universal, which also operates a film studio, theme parks and a portfolio of cable channels.In a note to NBC staff at the weekend Mr Williams, the lead presenter of NBC’s Nightly News for the past decade, said it had “become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions”.In recent years he has become well known for his other media appearances away from the news. He is a regular on the late-night chat show circuit, playing off his strait-laced journalist persona to comic effect, “slow-jamming the news” on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, for example.Last week, Mr Williams’s on-air apology drew scorn and ridicule. On Twitter, users adopted the hashtag #BrianWilliamsMisremembers to post mocking photos of the journalist inserted into historical events including the Kennedy assassination and OJ Simpson’s 1994 car chase. It has also sparked questions about Mr Williams’ accounts of other events, including his experience in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.Mr Williams’ shifting story has come at a difficult time for NBC News, which has struggled with declining ratings at its flagship shows, which once dominated viewing in the industry’s three key timeslots: mornings, evenings and Sundays.Today, the morning programme hosted by Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie, lost its long-held crown in 2012, falling behind ABC’s Good Morning America.Today generated $421m in advertising revenues in the first nine months of 2014, according to Kantar Media, down from $504m in the same period a year before. Good Morning America, which broadcasts for only two hours compared with four for Today, took in $262m during that time.Nightly News took $148m in advertising spending in the first nine months of 2014, according to Kantar Media. ABC counted $144m and CBS $117m in the same period.

Despite having higher ratings, Good Morning America took in $262m during that time.The uproar over Mr Williams’s account “will not make any meaningful difference” to NBC News advertising revenues, said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research. “News for any given network is hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, which in the grand scheme of things is not that much.”Nightly News took in $148m in advertising spending in the first nine months of 2014, according to Kantar Media. ABC counted $144m and CBS $117m in the same period.But the potential damage to viewers’ trust in Mr Williams is a concern, as the familiar faces of news presenters are a critical part of networks’ brands. “The number of people who watch news is relatively small at this point, but they have disproportionate importance in their exposure to thought leaders and politicians,” Mr Wieser said.Mr Williams in particular has become a star for the Comcast-owned network, with regular appearances on late night programmes including The Daily Show and The Tonight Show, where he sheds his serious presenting demeanour and sometimes raps alongside host Jimmy Fallon.9mAverage viewers per episode for Nightly News, compared with 8m for ABC and less than 7m for CBSMs Turness was appointed in August 2013 to lead a turnround of NBC News but has hit turbulence.She hired Jamie Horowitz from ESPN to lead production of Today, but he left the company after only two months after reported conflicts with some of the programme’s stars.In August 2014, Ms Turness and other executives drew fire for their treatment of David Gregory when they replaced him as host of Meet the Press, the politically focused Sunday show, after rumours of his pending exit swirled for more than a year.Shortly thereafter, she angered NBC News staff when she said in an interview with the New York Times that the division “hadn’t kept up with the times in all sorts of ways, for maybe 15 years . . . I think the organisation had gone to sleep.”However, in recent weeks the network has regained some ground. Today has narrowed the gap with Good Morning America in total viewers and beat its ABC rival in the key 25-to-54-year-old demographic on half of the last 14 broadcast days.Meet the Press, under new host Chuck Todd, posted its biggest audience in almost a year at the end of January, but still trails behind CBS’s Face the Nation.Nightly News averages nearly 9m viewers an episode, compared with 8m for ABC and less than 7m for CBS, but ABC’s World News Tonight has been chipping away at NBC’s lead.
266;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:22:32+0000;US regulator’s plan to treat internet traffic as utility upsets providers;Regulator seeks sweeping powers to enforce ‘open internet’;The US is planning sweeping changes to the regulation of broadband by reclassifying it as a public utility and using new powers to stop internet service providers from blocking or favouring particular websites.The head of the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator, announced steps on Wednesday to ensure that all internet traffic is treated equally — satisfying a call by President Barack Obama but dismaying the wireless industry by including mobile broadband.The proposal from Tom Wheeler, the FCC’s chairman, marked a victory after years of fighting by a coalition of advocates for an open internet — or “net neutrality” — that spans Silicon Valley tech companies and Democratic internet activists.But it signalled a defeat for mobile and fixed broadband providers such as Verizon, AT&T and Comcast, which say they support an open internet but object to the FCC treating broadband as a utility, because they fear it will usher in a new era of heavy-handed regulation.Mr Wheeler said in an op-ed on Wired: “I am submitting to my colleagues the strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the FCC. These enforceable, bright-line rules will ban paid prioritisation, and the blocking and throttling of lawful content and services.”Last November Mr Obama called on the FCC to ban fee-based internet “fast lanes”.Berin Szoka, President of TechFreedom, a pro-cable lobby group, said Mr Wheeler had “just shot himself in the foot” and accused him of rewriting the law to suit a political agenda. “The FCC was always going to face a difficult court fight, but Wheeler’s grandiose framing makes it even more clear that the FCC is heading for its third loss in court on net neutrality,” he said.The US has spent more than a decade debating net neutrality and two previous FCC attempts to enforce it were challenged successfully in the courts by Comcast and Verizon.Silicon Valley is broadly in favour of an open internet, or the principle of “net neutrality”, which matters particularly to video streamers such as Netflix and internet phone groups such as Skype, which are heavy bandwidth users and fear being “throttled” by broadband providers.The Internet Association, a lobby group whose members include Google, Amazon, eBay and Netflix, welcomed the FCC move but added: “The details and implementation of the proposal matter, and we look forward to seeing the text of the order to ensure that a free and open Internet is fully protected.”Broadband providers had worried that the FCC, by using powers under a part of telecommunications law known as Title II, would gain the authority to do much more than ensure the equal treatment of all internet traffic.Seeking to reassure them, Mr Wheeler wrote: “There will be no rate regulation, no tariffs, no last-mile unbundling.”Shares in telecoms companies jumped in New York trading in response to those words, but Craig Moffett, an analyst at Moffett Nathanson, said that investors did not yet understand the ramifications of Mr Wheeler’s proposals.Wired broadband providers such as Comcast, Charter and Time Warner Cable added between 2.8 per cent and 4.3 per cent, while the “big two” wireless groups, Verizon and AT&T, added 0.6 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively.Mr Moffett said: “They are responding to the rhetoric about no price regulation and allowing companies to make a return. But there was never any prospect the FCC would say anything about price — the risk of price regulation comes down the road.”“The market should not mistake this for anything other than a confirmation of the worst case scenario,” he added.The FCC’s five board members will vote on the proposal on February 26, when it is expected to be approved with three Democrats supporting against the opposition of two Republicans. The move is then likely to face legal challenges.
267;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Dreams of a cyber fast lane lie stuck on the hard shoulder;US regulator’s decision to redefine broadband has put internet speeds in spotlight;“Mom, the internet is broken again!” the kids call from the family room.My emails seem to be coming through just fine but, sure enough, when I run up there, the kids are right. The latest episode of Dr Who from the BBC’s online streaming service has stopped dead, leaving a large Tyrannosaurus Rex frozen against the London skyline.We have replaced our wireless hub three times since November and upgraded to a premium fibreoptic broadband, but still this kind of interruption happens at least twice a week during the crucial post-bath, pre-bedtime viewing hours.It feels like a decline in service standards, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the real change is in our usage habits and those of our neighbours. Until recently, our peak hour entertainment came from cable television, DVDs and music downloads, so we did not need or demand a particularly fast internet connection. The music streaming service Spotify, Amazon’s Prime video service and BBC’s iPlayer have changed all that.Regulators are starting to acknowledge this new reality. On Thursday, the US Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 to change its definition of broadband to require download speeds of at least 25 megabits per second, compared with its previous definition of 4 Mbps.Consumer advocates hope the shift will shame US internet providers into providing faster broadband and put pressure on regulators to improve competition. Under the new definition of “true” broadband services, more than half of American families have no choice of provider — giving them no way to fight back against price increases and bad service. And the sector is due to consolidate further.The first big test of the new regime is likely to come later this year, when the FCC and Department of Justice decide whether Comcast’s $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable is good for competition and in the public interest. DoJ watchdogs do not have to take the new broadband definition into account, but consumer groups are hoping they do.In the UK, the regulator Ofcom splits its definitions of broadband service into basic (2 Mbps), standard (10 Mbps) and superfast (30 Mbps). As of December, 25 per cent of British households lacked access to a 30 Mbps service, and the goal is to cut that to 5 per cent by 2017.Britain’s broadband competition issue revolves around consolidation across services. Two of the biggest broadband providers have just announced plans to move into mobile phones: BT is in negotiations to buy mobile group EE and Sky will start selling mobile phone contracts. Now, all the UK’s major broadband providers — those two, Virgin Media and TalkTalk — will be offering so-called “quadplay” contracts that include fixed-line, mobile, broadband and pay-TV services.By offering discounts for bundled services, they hope to convince entire families to sign up to a single telecoms provider and reduce the chances that they will switch to rivals. Right now, only 2 per cent of UK customers are signed up for quadplay, compared with 12 per cent in Spain.But I have my doubts as to how much that will change. My mobile phone service is no more reliable than my broadband — my daily commute takes me through three large dead spots. Why would anyone want to put themselves at the mercy of either one?brooke.masters@ft.com
268;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-01-29T19:10:02Z;Comcast-TWC $45bn deal faces new hurdle;FCC redefinition of broadband paints largest US cable company as a more dominant force;US regulators have thrown a new roadblock in the path of Comcast’s $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable, rewriting their definition of broadband to paint the largest US cable company as a more dominant force in high-speed internet access.The US communications watchdog on Thursday voted 3-2 to define broadband as an internet service with download speeds of at least 25 megabits per second, compared to its previous definition of 4 Mbps.The Federal Communication Commission’s decision has big implications for Comcast’s bid for TWC because it dramatically changes the competitive landscape for broadband — a central consideration for regulators deciding whether to approve the deal.The change means the number of American families reliant on a single provider for true broadband services will climb from 19 per cent to more than half. In most cases, that provider will be one of the big cable companies, which have fiercely resisted the change.This redefinition shines a bright light on the reality for most Americans, which is that the only choice of broadband provider is the cable monopoly“This redefinition shines a bright light on the reality for most Americans, which is that the only choice of broadband provider is the cable monopoly,” said Susan Crawford, a co-director of the Berkman internet centre at Harvard University“Comcast might claim it is in fierce competition with other providers, but that is a bit like saying the New York Yankees compete with high school baseball teams. Both roughly do the same thing, but the speed and capacity is completely different,” added Ms Crawford, a persistent critic of the Comcast deal. TechFreedom, a pro-cable lobby group, accused FCC’s chairman Tom Wheeler of pushing through “a reckless, ideologically driven regulatory agenda that would, in fact, slow the investment needed to drive speed upgrades.”The National Cable & Telecommunications Association, an industry lobby group, said the decision was “arbitrary” and “a clear effort to justify and expand the bounds of the FCC’s own authority”.The FCC split along party lines, with the three Democrats saying the proliferation of mobile devices, video streaming and the “internet of things” meant consumers needed superior internet speeds and Republicans saying 10 Mbps download speeds were sufficient.Mr Wheeler said cable companies were “telling us one thing and telling consumers another”, noting that Comcast had told the FCC that a 4 Mbps connection was sufficient to handle streaming high definition video, but its marketing materials encourage consumers to pay for 100Mbps-plus connections.The Department of Justice must decide whether the Comcast-TWC deal is anti-competitive while the FCC will rule on whether it is in the public interest. The DoJ is not legally required to take the new broadband definition into account.Both agencies are taking longer than expected to assess the transaction. Comcast had hoped to complete the deal by the end of last year, but on Thursday it extended its merger agreement with TWC by six months to August 12.An increasing number of investors are betting that the deal will fall apart amid the drawn-out regulatory review and President Barack Obama’s increasingly aggressive stance on digital issues.The spread between the value of Comcast’s offer and Time Warner Cable’s share price has been rising since the start of this year and touched 11.1 per cent on Thursday, the widest since Mr Obama’s call for broadband companies to be reclassified as public utilities sent cable stocks tumbling.His call for the reclassification to preserve “ net neutrality” — the principle of a free and open internet — took the cable industry by surprise, especially given its assiduous lobbying on the issue. David Cohen, the architect of Comcast’s regulatory strategy, has hosted several fundraisers for the president at his home.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said: “The Comcast/TWC merger has lost its air of inevitability. Depending on how far you think TWC’s shares would fall if the deal is rejected, the market appears to be assigning odds that are no higher than 50/50.”Comcast has opposed the redefinition of broadband, although it has said the takeover will have little impact on its share of the 25 Mbps market, because so few TWC customers receive high speeds. It has also said regulators should not look at its national share of the broadband market but should instead focus on competition at a local level, where it hardly competes with TWC.People familiar with the company’s thinking also say the figures on consumer choice, which date from 2013, do not take into account new high-speed broadband services including Google Fiber and Verizon Fios. Google this week announced plans to double the number of cities that receive its superfast broadband service.The redefinition of broadband will also dramatically increase the number of households which have no access whatsoever to high-speed internet, from 7.3m to 23m, giving ammunition to those concerned about a “digital divide” who argue that the government should play a role in building new networks.A new FCC report found that 17 per cent of all Americans lack access to internet connections with 25 Mbps download speeds. In rural areas, 53 per cent of people lack such access.Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic commissioner, said: “It’s time to dream big.

Should we include the estimated bandwidth for that as well?” he asked.

He told Republicans their draft bill would limit the FCC in several unhelpful ways.“Summarily blocking the FCC’s use of existing statutory enforcement authority could leave the agency helpless to address improper behaviours well within its authority,” he said, “and would leave consumers and businesses in the internet ecosystem without adequate certainty about the FCC’s enforcement powers.”Mr Walden told him: “I think we’ve got ways to address a lot of what you pointed out.”Broadband companies including Comcast and Verizon have vigorously opposed Mr Obama’s proposal, arguing that it would harm the open internet and discourage investment and innovation by internet providers. Verizon has also agreed with Republicans that the FCC would get bogged down in litigation.Tom Wheeler, the FCC chairman, is set to unveil updated net neutrality rules next month that are expected to rely on the powers the president outlined.

It’s a necessity. It’s a necessity for businesses, for families, and for our national competitiveness.”The White House’s stress on improving internet competition comes at a sensitive time for Comcast’s proposed $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable as regulators size up the deal, with critics saying it would reduce choice for consumers.Comcast counters that it does not compete directly with Time Warner Cable in any local markets, so there will be no damage to competition. Mr Zients declined to comment on the Obama administration’s view on the proposed takeover.The White House said the lack of broadband competition in different parts of the country rarely reflected a lack of demand. “Too often, it is the capital costs of building out broadband infrastructure and a combination of laws that prevent communities from providing incentives to attract providers,” it said in a fact sheet.The moves on internet policy do not require any action by Congress. But they include another overt White House attempt to influence the Federal Communications Commission, the independent telecoms regulator.“The president is calling to end laws that harm broadband service completion,” Mr Zients told reporters on a call. “The president specifically is filing a letter with the [FCC] urging it to join this effort by addressing barriers inhibiting local communities from responding to the broadband needs of their citizens.”In December Mr Obama made a surprise intervention by calling for the FCC to adopt sweeping powers to enforce “ net neutrality” — the idea that all internet traffic should be treated equally with no fast lanes or tolls for different content providers.Ahead of the State of the Union, the president has criss-crossed the US over the past week to tout fresh measures to boost America’s still-struggling middle class.They have included making it easier for first-time buyers to afford a home and giving two years of free tuition at community college to students who attend at least part-time and keep their grades above a certain level.
271;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-01-08T13:39:34Z;FCC chair seems to be siding with the president on net neutrality;Tom Wheeler’s comments at CES suggest he agrees that content should be treated equally online;"Is he thinking what Barack Obama is thinking?That was the question on everyone’s lips when Tom Wheeler, chairman of the US telecoms watchdog, took to the stage at CES in Las Vegas on Wednesday to discuss “ net neutrality” — the principle that all content should be treated equally on the internet.Under Mr Wheeler, the Federal Communications Commission has spent several years trying to write a set of rules to preserve a free and open internet, so that traffic from small start-ups is assured the same access to customers as behemoths such as Google.Its attempts to introduce new regulations have failed, first due to vociferous opposition from the telecoms industry, much of it in the courts, and then because a watered-down version of the proposals provoked a fierce public backlash.In November, the president lost patience, and called for the FCC to reclassify broadband providers as a public utility, a move that would give it sweeping powers to adopt tough net neutrality rules.However, the FCC is an independent body, and Mr Wheeler has so far kept his counsel on whether he agrees with Mr Obama. Many were hoping he would use his appearance at CES to clarify his position.Officially, the line was this: the FCC, a commission with three Democrats and two Republicans, will be sent a new set of rules at the start of February, which they will then vote on at the end of that month.Yet Mr Wheeler, who is in charge of writing those rules, gave his strongest hint yet that he is siding with Mr Obama, who appointed him to the FCC in 2013.He said reclassification of broadband providers as “common carriers”, a type of public utility, had “always been on the table”, and that the FCC had been investigating that option since last summer — well before Mr Obama’s intervention.Any suggestion that he and the president were “pulling at opposite directions” was not “exactly reality” he said. In fact they were “both pulling in the same direction”.News, commentary and analysis from this year’s event — the world’s biggest convention for gadgets, home electronics and other consumer tech

Further readingBoth agreed that the likes of Comcast, Verizon and Time Warner Cable should not be able to sell internet fast lanes to big content groups which can afford to pay for them. There should be “no blocking, no throttling of applications, no paid prioritisation” he said.Most tellingly, he said he wanted broadband providers to behave in a “just and reasonable” manner — using language taken directly from Title II of the 1934 Communications Act, the piece of legislation Mr Obama wants the FCC to use to govern the industry.Mr Wheeler acknowledged there were “onerous and inappropriate provisions” in the law, but said the FCC would be able to cherry-pick the most important parts and refrain or “forbear” from implementing the rest.Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, said the comments “essentially confirmed” the FCC would “move forward Title II reclassification of broadband”.Brian Dietz, a spokesperson for the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, the industry’s lobby group, took to Twitter to hit out at Mr Wheeler’s comments. “Ironic to hear that 1930s regulations will likely be imposed on the internet at an international event that is all about the future,” he tweeted.Even if Mr Wheeler secures backing for tough net neutrality rules — all he needs is the votes of his two fellow Democrats — he is sure to face a stiff challenge in the courts. Verizon has already said any such move would “face strong legal challenges and would likely not stand up in court”.The introduction of new regulations would have big implications for two huge deals: Comcast’s $45bn takeover of rival Time Warner Cable and AT&T’s $48.5bn purchase of DirecTV, the satellite broadcaster.The rationale for Comcast’s deal — dominance of the broadband market — appears less attractive in the face of tougher regulation, especially due to fears that future politicians will introduce some of Title II’s more onerous provisions, such as price caps.Some industry executives also think the FCC could demand that AT&T and Comcast agree to abide by its tough new rules as a condition of approving their deals — even if the regulations are struck down in court. The watchdog did something similar when Comcast bought NBC in 2011.“You gotta wait until February to see the specifics,” Mr Wheeler told his audience at CES. However, few in the industry were left with the impression that he is about to cross the man who gave him his job."
272;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2015-01-05T09:16:08Z;China’s M&A mission to reach for the stars;Acquisitions driven by the needs of ever-more sophisticated consumers;In 2010, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the storied Hollywood studio behind classics from The Wizard of Oz and James Bond to The Hobbit, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It was the classic victim of a leveraged buyout from a group including Providence Equity Partners and TPG Capital, alongside Sony and Comcast.Now it is rumoured to be the target of another group of investors with a lot of capital in their pockets — this time the Chinese. Mainland companies such as Dalian Wanda and Fosun, a conglomerate, are both flush with cash. Dalian Wanda just went public in Hong Kong raising almost $4bn in the process and Fosun has access to the coffers of its Portuguese insurer among other sources of money.Both are interested in movies: indeed they seem to be interested in acquiring almost anything, regardless of the lack of apparent synergy. Today, they control a dizzying variety of businesses, making their purchases at an ever accelerating speed. Moreover, they are merely two out of numerous Chinese firms on outbound buying sprees.Whatever the object of a possible sale, the Chinese have surfaced as potential buyers. Indeed, they are becoming what private equity used to be — the buyers of first resort.It is a dramatic turnround. In 2014, mainland firms spent almost $70bn making offshore acquisitions, according to data from Dealogic, as of December 29. By contrast, foreigners spent just $25.5bn on acquisitions going into China, down significantly from the $41.6bn peak reached in 2010.Soon brokerage firms will obligingly put out lists of potential targets for the Chinese just as they used to put out lists of potential take private candidates. That way everyone else could front-run the buyout firms, purchasing shares and selling debt of target companies which would inevitably be downgraded if the reports proved correct.Meanwhile today, the private equity firms themselves sit on the sidelines, as the prices of companies in their sights soar way higher than those their spreadsheets tell them is reasonable and corporate buyers with expensive shares and stagnant revenues swoop in and clinch the deals instead.In any case, it seems safe to assume that 2015 will be a big year for cross-border deals generally, whether growth picks up globally or (as seems more likely) falls short of New Year hopes.One adviser in China recalls pointing out that if his financial client had nobody who speaks Russian, acquiring a Russian bank might prove challengingThere are lots of reasons to expect the Chinese to be even bigger participants in the future, especially in the US. Movies say a lot about where China is today — increasingly urban, increasingly hungry for entertainment, and increasingly able to pay for it. More and more acquisitions will be driven by the needs of this huge class of ever-more sophisticated consumers, rather than just the needs of the voracious state-owned enterprises, with their focus on natural resource extraction in emerging markets from Africa to Latin America.Future transactions are more likely to be driven by a new batch of players that are either private sector or less state-ish in their goals, though. That means more investment and acquisitions in Europe and the US, both for bargains and the most upmarket brands. China will also be helped by the relative strength of its currency, which makes acquisitions abroad cheaper in Chinese terms.Of course, the path is not entirely free of obstacles. For one thing, especially in the US, politicians and regulators have had a chilling effect on Chinese buyers ever since Cnooc withdrew from its planned $18.5bn purchase of Unocal in 2005 in the face of huge political opposition.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which reviews transactions with potential national security issues, has vetted deals that lawyers say have little security implications, such as a Hong Kong-based bank’s sale of a handful of US branches to a Chinese bank. It has also vetoed the Chinese sovereign wealth fund’s purchase of a 7 per cent indirect stake in a US telecoms towers company.Moreover, the ambitions of Chinese managements often can exceed their ability to oversee their new toys. One adviser based in China recalls pointing out that if his financial client had nobody who speaks Russian, acquiring a Russian bank might prove challenging.The Chinese may not buy MGM or Lions Gate Entertainment or anything else in which they have expressed an interest. And if they do, and the investment goes wrong — well it will not be the first time. We have seen this movie before.henny.sender@ft.com

But at SeaWorld the problems go deeper than that. On Thursday, the company’s troubles prompted the departure of chief executive Jim Atchison. Its shares have nearly halved this year, as visitors have been put off by the film Blackfish, which highlights what the filmmakers assert is inhumane treatment of killer whales in SeaWorld parks. That share price reaction may look extreme – the SeaWorld brand accounts for just 3 of the group’s 11 parks and half of its profits. And SeaWorld parks are not just whales. But the theme park business is fragile.SeaWorld expects revenue this year to fall by up to 7 per cent and operating cash flow by up to 16 per cent. After playing down lower attendance earlier in the year, declines in the second and third quarter were sharp. Theme park competition is stiff, particularly in Florida where SeaWorld is up against the deep pockets of Comcast (owner of Universal Studios) and Disney.While part of the crash in SeaWorld shares is related to management’s credibility in forecasting traffic, there have been other problems. Park owners have to build new attractions to persuade tourists to pick one park over another. SeaWorld blamed thin traffic earlier in 2014 on a delay to the “Falcon’s Fury” ride at Busch Gardens, just as rivals had new attractions up and running.Then there is the debt that SeaWorld carries: $1.6bn or about 4 times annual cash flow. Interest on that, combined with capital spending and dividends eats up all of the company’s cash flow.There are reasons for optimism. Efforts are under way to improve the killer whale shows, for example by building bigger tanks. They are essential if SeaWorld is to win back visitors. An international expansion is planned. And given the sharp drop in the share price, private equity may decide to pay another visit.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
274;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T19:36:57+0000;Telecoms groups find it difficult to connect with content strategies;Companies compete for programming and push up prices;Remember ringtones? They were what passed for a content play in the 1990s telecoms industry and remarkably successful they were too.Almost costless to produce and prone to rapid, viral take-up, electronic offerings such as the “Crazy Frog” may have been fantastically irritating to listen to. But they were a marketer’s dream. Customers bought them in droves, delivering a tidy risk-free income to their entrepreneurial distributors. Profits were abundant, and most of the cash fell sweetly to the bottom line.Vittorio Colao could be forgiven nostalgia for that simpler era last week as Vodafone’s chief executive surveyed the latest trend in content strategy to sweep the UK telecoms market. It’s a far cry from selling ringtones for a few quid to youthful mobile subscribers.These days, telecoms companies are punting billions on buying up television content in the hope not only of securing customers’ loyalty, but also motivating them to log on.Taking their cue from Comcast and AT&T, which have swallowed entire mainstream TV operators in the US, British telecoms companies such as BT and Virgin Media have been building portfolios of broadcast content.Over the past two years BT has spent £2bn buying up content rights, mainly to big sporting events such as Premier League football. Virgin has bought a stake in a production company and toyed with buying the terrestrial broadcaster, Channel Five.Mr Colao indicated that Vodafone might join the feeding frenzy itself, as it seeks to relaunch a consumer broadband service. Not that he showed much enthusiasm. “If someone starts bidding for content then you might have to bid yourself,” he said, adding: “Personally I have doubts that in the long run that this will really create a lot of value for the platform.”Mr Colao is right to be wary. It is hard to make money when everyone is slugging it out over the same assets.Most UK operators have all-but-identical strategies, seeking to offer consumers the “quad play” of fixed and mobile telephony, along with broadband and pay TV. While exclusive media rights are not necessary to provide this service, the idea is that they provide a differentiator beyond the boring everyday stuff like service quality and rapid customer response. Owning juicy content allows you to push a product your rivals cannot simply ape.There is a problem with this approach, however. It is that there is a scarce supply of sure-fire exclusive programming – mainly rights to popular sporting events such as Premier League football and grand slam tennis tournaments.Competition is inflating the prices of these assets. For instance, the rights to the PGA golf championships went up by 150 per cent when they were recently auctioned.Yet the only other way to gain must-have content is to buy or build your own high-quality hits factory, like HBO in the US. That takes nous, nerve and very deep pockets.The second issue is that telecoms operators do not have a reliable mechanism to monetise the content that they do buy. Purchasing territorial rights to sport on a national basis and screening to a small subset of subscribers is a very efficient way of losing huge sums. Just ask Orange: the French carrier’s foray into football did exactly that a few years ago.But the alternative is little better. BT does not have much of a plan for recovering the sums it has invested. Lacking the coverage to drag viewers from Sky, the pay-TV group that still dominates UK sport, it just hands the stuff out to subscribers free of charge.The freebie may have helped the company shore up its share of the superfast broadband market, but these gains are fragile. Yet BT’s costs have permanently gone up.Telecoms companies have always struggled to make money out of content. Undaunted, however, they have wrestled with the problem almost since the time of Alexander Graham Bell – whether pumping music and news down the wire to subscribers as Hungary’s Telefon Hirmondo did in the 1930s, or investing massively in proprietary interactive TV platforms in the 1980s, only to see them eclipsed by the supple connectivity of the internet.There’s a simple answer. Telcos should focus on the core task – connecting people – and let others work out what to push down the pipes. If they want a toehold in content, better to stick to simple but genuine innovations a bit like, well, ringtones. Time to send for the Crazy Frog.jonathan.ford@ft.com
275;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-11-18T17:25:13Z;Cablevision: fortunate son;The Dolans’ basketball team is awful, but prospects for its other businesses are better;High barriers to entry, strong pricing power, and subscription revenue: who wouldn’t want to inherit a cable television empire? Enter James Dolan, son of TV pioneer Charles Dolan. The younger Dolan is best-known as the guitar-strumming boss of the perpetually inept New York Knicks basketball team. It is a plum job obtained through his status as scion of the Cablevision family. There may be little hope for Knicks fans (off to an atrocious 3-8 start this season), but shareholders in the Dolans’ listed businesses may have better prospects.After two spin-offs in recent years, the Dolans’ content and distribution portfolio stretches across three companies. Cablevision, a pay-TV and broadband provider with 3m subscribers around New York. Madison Square Garden, owner of sports teams and entertainment venues. And AMC Networks, which owns TV channels.The Dolans have developed a taste for corporate shake-ups. Last month MSG said it may split its sports teams from its venues. Its shares jumped by more than a tenth in response.AMC Networks, once a backwater of second-run movies and shows from other programmers, has become the home of highbrow smashes Mad Men, Breaking Bad, and The Walking Dead. Yet its prospects for independence appear limited. The distributors who deliver AMC content are getting bulkier by consolidating (Comcast/Time Warner Cable, AT&T/ DirectTV). It may soon be sensible for AMC to be swallowed by a vast network owner such as Disney or Time Warner.Of the trio, Cablevision (where James Dolan is chief executive), has the trickiest path. Its growth is constrained by high consumer prices and overlap with rival Verizon. Before the spin-offs, the Dolan family had twice tried and failed to buy out other shareholders. Given Cablevision’s now limited prospects, the shareholders might be more interested today. Alternatively the company could be sold to another cable system such as Charter or Comcast. For better or worse, Mr Dolan could then fully devote himself to his basketball team.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
276;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-11-16T18:11:35Z;Net neutrality: Strife in the fast lane;The digital divide in the US throws up a challenge for broadband regulation;The Bradley family’s beaten-up green minivan was a common sight in the parking lot of their local McDonald’s. But they were not there for Big Macs and fries. They went to use the internet.Debra Bradley, a single parent with two college degrees but no job, would often park there until the early hours of the morning so her daughter, then 15, could use the WiFi to do her homework. The family could not afford the internet at home, but, as Darriale puts it, her mum still “demanded all As”.Occasionally, they would go inside for a burger, but most times they would stay inside the van. Darriale remembers one night in particular when she had to work into the night to complete a Shakespeare assignment. “That was the worst time,” she recalls. “No one wants to sit in a McDonald’s parking lot until 2am.”The nocturnal trips continued until Darriale spotted a flyer at school, offering broadband to pupils on free school lunches for $9.99 a month, a fraction of the $44 a month that commercial providers typically charge for basic deals. The deal was offered by Cox, the third-largest US broadband provider, and marketed by the charity EveryoneOn. She asked her mother to sign up.Once she was connected, Darriale filled out an online application for a job at Sonic, a chain of drive-in restaurants where the waitresses serve customers on roller skates. Some of her $5-an-hour wage went towards the new broadband bill.That was two years ago. Since then she has graduated from high school as a salutatorian – the second highest in her class – and in August she started at Pennsylvania State University, where she is studying computer science.Her home town of Macon, Georgia, is a predominantly African American city that has the distinction of being one of the least-connected places in the US. Despite the best efforts of non-profit organisations like EveryoneOn and numerous government initiatives, more than half of the city’s households do not have a broadband connection.The “digital divide” – the gulf between those who have access to the internet and those who do not – has become one of the flashpoints in the fierce battle over US broadband policy. Last week, President Barack Obama opened a new front with his call for the Federal Communications Commission to adopt sweeping powers to enforce “ net neutrality”– the idea that all internet traffic should be treated without any “fast lanes” or tolls. Such a move would make it easier for the FCC to prevent broadband providers such as Comcast and Verizon from charging content groups like Netflix and Google’s YouTube for access to their customers.Proponents of his solution – which would reclassify commercial broadband as a public utility – say it would make it easier to close the digital divide. That is because the Communications Act stipulates that these companies must ensure all consumers have “affordable access” to information services.The intervention marked a return to an early theme for Mr Obama, who styled himself as the US’s first digital president with pledges to increase broadband access and enshrine the openness of the internet.However, it has outraged the telecoms industry, with AT&T saying last week it will suspend plans to roll out superfast broadband in 100 cities until there is a clearer policy, and Verizon threatening to fight the proposals in court. Republicans, fresh from victory in the midterms, have promised to block the plans, with prospective 2016 presidential candidate Ted Cruz describing them as “Obamacare for the internet”.It has also cast some doubt on Comcast’s $45bn proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable, a deal that would merge the two largest cable groups into a company that controls about a third of the US broadband market.There is no certainty that the FCC will heed Mr Obama’s wishes. Tom Wheeler, the commissioner’s Democratic chairman, said he “welcomed” the president’s statement but pointed out that the body was an “independent regulatory agency”. Mr Wheeler, formerly a lobbyist for the cable industry, needs to find a solution that addresses the president’s concerns but which also has some chance of being implemented.What is clear is that the FCC faces two important decisions: how to proceed on net neutrality and whether to approve Comcast’s takeover. Both have huge implications for broadband in the US, and will affect a swath of media and telecoms groups, as well as millions of consumers – including those on the wrong side of the digital divide.Much of the discussion at the FCC has focused on the merits of a combined Comcast and TWC that would control such a large chunk of the market for high-speed internet and pay-TV. But opponents are also claiming it will exacerbate existing digital inequalities.Scores of community groups have written to the regulator opposing the takeover on digital divide grounds. They complain that the combined group’s market share will result in higher prices and freeze out more poor and remote families. Susan Crawford, a former special assistant for technology to Mr Obama, and a fierce opponent of the Comcast deal, says the “merger is another step that amplifies and entrenches the division of markets by gigantic communications companies”.Comcast counters that it does not directly compete with Time Warner Cable in any local markets, so there will be no damage to competition.“There is no way this deal can make things worse,” says David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice-president and architect of its regulatory strategy. “You can argue things may not be any better, although I think given our commitment to increasing speeds we are going to improve the competitive state.”Mr Obama has often spoken of his desire to close the gap between the digital haves and have-nots, unveiling a plan in 2010 to ensure “that every American should have affordable access to robust broadband service” by 2020.However, just 73 per cent of US households have a broadband subscription, according to the US Census Bureau. That is well below most countries in Europe, such as the Netherlands, where the figure is 95 per cent, and Germany and the UK, where it is 88 per cent.The received wisdom has always been that the rural geography of much of the US is to blame for this low number: about 67 per cent of households in rural areas have broadband, compared with 75 per cent of urban households. Yet the problem is just as acute in scores of cities, including Detroit, Miami, Memphis and New Orleans, where household subscription rates are under 60 per cent. Around one-third of African-American households and 55 per cent of families earning less than $20,000 have no broadband connection.One of the problems in urban areas is the cost of basic deals. The Paris-based OECD places the US 30th out of 33 countries for affordability for a slow 2.5 Mb/s connection. In the US this package would typically cost $44 a month, compared with around half that in the UK and $16 in South Korea.Comcast does offer a much cheaper plan – $9.95 a month – for families with children on free or cut-price school meals, not dissimilar to the scheme that Darriale benefited from. The company agreed to offer its Internet Essentials deal for three years as a condition of its 2011 merger with NBCUniversal. In September, it said it would extend the programme indefinitely, which some saw as a nod to regulators deciding whether to wave through the TWC deal.Mr Cohen says around 350,000 households use the service, making it the largest broadband outreach programme in the US. If it is allowed to buy Time Warner Cable, it says it will offer the plan in new markets including New York, Los Angeles and Detroit. The company estimates that there are 2.6m households in its coverage areas that are eligible for the programme, meaning that take-up is around 13 per cent.The scheme has created a loyal fan club, which includes organisations such as Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. When 50 US mayors endorsed the Time Warner Cable deal, they described Comcast as a “stalwart community partner”.However, some groups say Internet Essentials has been designed with strict eligibility criteria so it does not cannibalise higher-margin business. In a submission to the FCC, the Latino Community Foundation said Internet Essentials had “not lived up to its promise of helping the most disenfranchised community members” and that it has “received countless stories of very poor service . . . ranging from never receiving the equipment to false information”.One option the FCC is considering to address these concerns is asking Comcast to do more to close the digital divide as a condition of approving its takeover of Time Warner Cable. It could require the cable group to offer cheap deals to a much wider pool of poor families, and to senior citizens and those with disabilities. “The FCC could use the Comcast deal to achieve its other policy aims such as low-cost service offerings and broadband build-out,” says Robert McDowell, a Republican FCC commissioner between 2006 and 2013 who now works at law firm Wiley Rein.An increasing number of investors are betting the deal will fall apart if the FCC follows Mr Obama’s advice and reclassifies broadband as a public utility, reasoning it would be a lot less attractive if regulation gets tougher. The spread between the value of Comcast’s offer and Time Warner Cable’s share price touched 12 per cent last week, the biggest gap since the deal was announced.A person familiar with the deal said Comcast was “happy to accept reasonable conditions but not conditions that don’t make sense”. They pointed out the agreement did not include a “break-fee”, which means the company can walk away from the transaction without compensating Time Warner Cable.Mr Obama’s intervention on net neutrality shows he intends to make digital issues part of his legacy. His 2008 campaign became famous for how it built Barackobama.com as an online social network for supporters. Those looking for a sign of where he will focus his efforts in the remaining two years of his presidency should look at the email sent to the site’s members last week.“The concept of a free and open internet has been part of the whole deal from the beginning.”FCC: Wheeler drives search for a grand bargainThe debate over net neutrality has been raging for years. The Federal Communications Commission introduced net neutrality rules in 2010, which prohibited broadband providers such as Comcast and Verizon from charging a fee to content providers that consume more bandwidth, such as Netflix’s streaming service and Google’s YouTube.An appeals court threw those rules out in January following a challenge from Verizon, concluding that the FCC’s approach amounted to regulatory over-reach. It was the second time the FCC has failed to introduce open internet rules, following a 2008 court defeat at the hands of Comcast.Since the Verizon court defeat, Tom Wheeler, the commission’s chairman, has been working on a grand bargain. His first attempt, which would have allowed fast lanes in some circumstances, prompted public outrage and resulted in a record 4m submissions to the FCC, mostly in favour of tougher rules.Now he is working on a hybrid solution that would heavily police the “back end” of the internet – where the likes of Google connect to Comcast’s customers – while still allowing internet service providers to charge for special services in some instances.However, Mr Obama is pushing for a much more radical option – the reclassification of consumer broadband providers as a type of public utility, which would give the FCC much greater leeway to ban fast lanes and tolls. In meetings with business and consumer groups last week, Mr Wheeler – an Obama appointee – has said he has not yet made a decision, but that he is open to the US president’s recommendations.The issue has become even more partisan since Mr Obama intervened. Congress, which has already held hearings on net neutrality, is expected to question Mr Wheeler next month.Dozens of Republicans also sent a letter to Mr Wheeler on Wednesday urging him to reject the president’s proposals. The party is being urged by lobbying groups to take quick action in the new Congressional session next year to prevent the FCC from implementing the president’s suggestions, possibly by blocking funding for the agency.But the president’s proposals could help Democrats rally their liberal base. Turnout among Hispanics and African-Americans in this month’s midterm elections was stagnant compared with 2010 despite the party’s effort to get out the vote.
277;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-11-13T18:43:21Z;Net neutrality debate raises big questions for Comcast’s big deal;Investors increasingly jittery over potential threat to Time Warner Cable takeover;David Cohen, architect of Comcast’s political and regulatory strategy, has been a big supporter of Barack Obama over the years. He has hosted multiple fundraisers for the US president at his home – so many that Mr Obama quipped in 2013 that “the only thing I haven’t done in this house is have [the Passover] Seder dinner”.It is unclear whether Mr Obama will be returning to the Cohen residence anytime soon. This week the president stunned Comcast, the largest cable and broadband operator in the US, and other broadband providers such as AT&T and Verizon, when he waded into the debate about net neutrality– the principle that all web traffic should be treated equally. Mr Obama urged the Federal Communications Commission to ban so-called internet “fast lanes” and reclassify broadband as a public utility along so-called “Title II” lines – a position vigorously opposed by Comcast. It says reclassification will hinder investment and stifle future innovation.The president’s intervention comes at a sensitive time for Comcast – and not only because the company has cultivated close ties with his administration: Brian Roberts, its chief executive, has played golf with Mr Obama in Martha’s Vineyard, for example.The company has been spending a lot of time on FCC matters lately. The regulator is in the middle of a lengthy review of Comcast’s proposed $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable, the second-largest US cable company. The deal, which is also being reviewed by the US Department of Justice, would consolidate Comcast’s position as the largest provider of high-speed broadband services. Will Mr Obama’s intervention over net neutrality sway commissioners scrutinising the deal?Comcast says no. Mr Cohen points out that the FCC’s “open internet” proceeding – a review of net neutrality that has been under way for several months – is unconnected to its analysis of Comcast’s proposed Time Warner purchase. “It doesn’t have anything to do with our transaction,” he told me.He may be right but investors are increasingly jittery over whether the deal will be cleared. The spread between the value of Comcast’s all-share offer and the current trading price of Time Warner Cable has widened, hitting 12 per cent following Mr Obama’s comments.Net neutrality and the future of broadband regulation may explain some of the market’s concerns. The fastest growing businesses operated by Comcast and Time Warner Cable are broadband services. Will Comcast still want to double down in broadband when the market could potentially become much more tightly regulated?Comcast has historically been a content distribution business but in 2010 it began the process of acquiring NBCUniversal, the broadcast network and movie studio. “It’s possible that Comcast could conclude that Title II regulation [of broadband] would make it less attractive to own more distribution,” said Craig Moffett, analyst with MoffettNathanson.“They may decide they don’t want to increase their exposure to distribution assets at a time when price regulation of broadband hangs in the balance,” he said.Mr Cohen declined to comment on what Comcast will do if the FCC moves towards a tighter regulatory regime. Other companies have already reacted, with AT&T suspending plans to roll out superfast fibre broadband in100 US cities. Randall Stephenson, chief executive, said it could not “go out and invest that kind of money deploying fibre to 100 cities” without “knowing under what rules those investments will be governed”.If the FCC blocks the deal – or if Comcast withdraws its offer because the new regulatory environment for broadband services becomes too restrictive – the company has plenty of other options. It could invest in Europe, a market it has avoided and which is undergoing a round of consolidation. John Malone’s Liberty Global has acquired cable operators and BSkyBbought Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to create a pan-continental satellite player.A European foray would not be the first choice for Mr Roberts, who would rather stick to the original plan. But uncertainty surrounds a deal that once seemed to have a clear path through the regulatory thicket. While Mr Obama’s intervention may not have hurt Comcast’s chances, it certainly has not helped.matthew.garrahan@ft.com@MattGarrahan
278;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-11-11T22:17:15Z;Fears raised over Comcast’s TWC bid;Warning over Obama’s push for tough new broadband rules;Barack Obama’s push for tough new broadband regulations risks jeopardising Comcast’s $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable, a former commissioner for the US telecoms watchdog has warned.The US president has called for broadband providers to be reclassified as a type of public utility, giving the Federal Communications Commission sweeping powers to ban internet fast lanes and enforce “ net neutrality” – the idea that all online traffic should be treated equally.Lawyers and analysts expect any attempt to introduce so-called “Title II” regulation to be delayed by a Republican backlash and a lengthy battle in the courts, but Robert McDowell, a former FCC commissioner, has suggested Comcast could be asked to sign up to the tougher rules as a condition of the Time Warner Cable tie-up.Mr McDowell pointed to the precedent set following Comcast’s purchase of NBC in 2011 when the group agreed to abide by the FCC’s Open Internet rules as a condition of the takeover – and had to continue doing so even after the regime was struck down by a federal appeals court.“The merger conditions could contain some form of Title II,” Mr McDowell said, which would make the deal far less attractive for Comcast.“They could have to live under Title II and the potential for pricing regulation. They would have to think long and hard about that, and I’m sure they will be discussing it around the board table,” added Mr McDowell, a Republican FCC commissioner between 2006 and 2013 who is now a partner at Wiley Rein LLP.The president has asked for the FCC to reclassify broadband groups as “common carriers” while refraining from introducing price controls, but the telecoms industry fears the adoption of new Title II rules will make it easier for future administrations or federal politicians to introduce rate caps.Investors have become increasingly jittery about the chances of Comcast completing the takeover. The spread between the current value of its offer and Time Warner Cable’s share price was 12.4 per cent in New York trading on Tuesday, the biggest gap since the deal was announced.One hedge fund manager said the spectre of further regulation was to blame for the nervousness, adding there was a greater degree of uncertainty around politically contentious takeovers after AbbVie’s £35bn takeover of Shire was torpedoed by a crackdown on tax inversions.Keith Moore, an analyst with MKM Partners, said: “What generally happens when there’s a lot of uncertainty is people get out the sell orders, and that’s what’s been happening here. This situation is about as strange as I’ve seen in all my years.”One of the big mysteries in corporate America is whether telecom regulators will allow the Comcast/Time Warner Cable merger, announced in February, to close. President Obama’s comments on net neutrality on Monday might provide a clue …Continue readingA person familiar with the deal said Comcast was “happy to accept reasonable conditions but not conditions that don’t make sense”. They pointed out the agreement did not include a “break-fee”, which means the company can walk away from the transaction without compensating Time Warner Cable.Mr Obama’s proposals were denounced by Republicans, who are being urged to hold back funding from the FCC. The Republicans will soon control all congressional committees, including the groups that oversee the FCC’s budget, after big victories in last week’s midterm elections.“We’re looking at our options, and looking at the FCC budget could be a part of it,” said a Republican Senate aide.“We fully expect them to act quickly after they return [from recess this week] and for there to be significant action to prevent the FCC from implementing the president’s recommendations,” said a cable industry representative.Mr McDowell criticised the president’s intervention, describing it as “virtually unprecedented in FCC history” and warning “the issue of how independent the agency is was now in question”.“Does this development portend to how the president wants to spend his last two years, by pushing through his own agenda and rejecting overtures of compromise?” asked Mr McDowell.Michael Copps, a former Democrat FCC commissioner who is now an adviser to Common Cause, which advocates government accountability, said: “The president always weighs in on important policy discussions but it was a bit unusual for him to be this direct. It shows that the president gets the bigger picture of how much the internet helps drive the economy.”Tom Wheeler, FCC chairman, has said he welcomes the president’s input and that the legal issues surrounding net neutrality show it will take the agency more time to review it.
279;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-11-10T18:43:35Z;Net Neutrality: Taking sides;Internet infrastructure is expensive and somebody has to pay;One of the big mysteries in corporate America is whether telecom regulators will allow the Comcast/Time Warner Cable merger, announced in February, to close. President Obama’s comments on net neutrality on Monday might provide a clue: the government is going to make the business of delivering internet less attractive. This could undercut some of the objections to the deal.The White House statement said Mr Obama favoured reclassifying internet service providers such as Comcast and TWC as “common carriers”. Such a move by the Federal Communications Commission (which is independent of the president) would regulate ISPs like utilities. The president favours prohibiting “paid prioritisation” in which content providers buy access to faster distribution. Netflix struck such deals with several ISPs (including Comcast) this year but has since complained about them.The net neutrality debate has taken on a David v Goliath flavour. Scrappy Netflix heroically provides television and movies for just $8 per month while distributors gouge profits from their control of the pipes.The Netflix monthly fee roughly reflects the cost of acquiring content. The question then is whether that fee should jump to reflect the operating and capital costs Comcast incurs to deliver that content. Comcast and Time Warner are profitable businesses, unlike Netflix. But they are extremely capital intensive.Comcast shares shed four per cent on Monday, perhaps to the delight of its oft-irritated customers. But schadenfreude aside, US internet service remains slow and expensive compared with the rest of the world. It is fun to fantasise about reallocating Comcast profits to Netflix. But consumers and their advocates should think about what competitive framework would lead to the necessary investment in broadband infrastructure. The costs of delivering content can be shared, but not avoided.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

281;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-11-10T17:28:53Z;Washington urges ban on internet ‘fast lanes’;Cable groups protest at president’s call for broadband to be regulated as a public utility;"President Barack Obama has urged the US communications regulator to ban so-called internet “fast lanes” and reclassify broadband service as a public utility, sparking outrage among cable and telecoms groups.Mr Obama on Monday weighed in for the first time with specific recommendations for the Federal Communications Commission, which is revising its definition of “net neutrality”– the principle that all internet traffic be treated equally.His intervention follows a flood of opposition to the agency’s proposals, which has prompted about 4m comments to the FCC on the issue.The heart of the FCC’s proposal would allow ISPs to charge services like YouTube to reach customers at higher speeds, though only on “commercially reasonable” terms. That provision sparked uproar among consumer groups and companies like Netflix.Joining consumer groups and technology companies like Google and Facebook, the president said there should be a ban on paid prioritisation that would technically allow internet service providers to charge content companies like Netflix to reach consumers at higher speeds.“Simply put: no service should be stuck in a ‘slow lane’ because it does not pay a fee,” Mr Obama said. “That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the internet’s growth.”His comments triggered a sell-off in shares of cable companies, which are among the biggest broadband internet providers. Comcast, the world’s biggest cable operator, closed down 4 per cent, Time Warner Cable was off 5.1 per cent and Charter Communications down 6.2 per cent. Comcast is seeking regulators’ approval for a takeover of TWC.Comcast, whose executives have been prominent donors to Mr Obama, and telecoms groups such as Verizon have vigorously opposed the president’s idea that the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service as a public utility.Verizon said so-called “Title II” reclassification “would apply 1930s-era utility regulation to the internet” and be a “radical reversal of course that would . . . threaten great harm to an open Internet, competition and innovation.” The company added that reclassification would “likely also face strong legal challenges and would likely not stand up in court”.Michael Powell, chief executive of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, said the industry association was “stunned” at Mr Obama’s intervention. “This tectonic shift in national policy, should it be adopted, would create devastating results.”Comcast said reclassification would be “a radical reversal” of a decade of precedent that would harm investment and innovation.However, Mr Obama was cheered by open internet advocates such as Harvard Law School’s Susan Crawford and companies such as Netflix. “Consumers should pick winners and losers on the internet – not broadband gatekeepers,” said a spokesperson for the subscription video service. “This is a bold move.”The FCC has already lost two court challenges on net neutrality, including a lawsuit brought by Verizon. That loss prompted the agency to propose net neutrality rules for the third time, hoping the latest measure would stand up in court.One of the big mysteries in corporate America is whether telecom regulators will allow the Comcast/Time Warner Cable merger, announced in February, to close. President Obama’s comments on net neutrality on Monday might provide a clue: the government is going to make the business of delivering internet less attractive.Continue readingTom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC, said he was “grateful” for the president’s input and added that the legal questions around net neutrality show the agency has more work to do. “We would need more time to examine these [measures] to ensure that whatever approach is taken, it can withstand any legal challenges it may face,” said Mr Wheeler, indicating the debate could go into next year.Ted Cruz, the prospective 2016 Republican presidential candidate, highlighted the political heat around the issue, describing net neutrality as “Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.”Mitch McConnell, the Republican who is set to become Senate majority leader in the new Congress, said the president was abandoning years of a regulatory light touch, which had proven to be successful. “The Commission would be wise to reject it,” he said. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said his chamber would resist the push for additional regulations.Mr Obama’s comments put more pressure on the FCC to toughen its initial proposal.“The president who promised to take a back seat to no one on Net Neutrality has finally gotten in the driver’s seat,” said Craig Aaron, president of Free Press, which advocates an open internet. “And he may have saved the internet at the moment it was in the greatest jeopardy.”"
282;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-11-09T13:18:44Z;Having signed the multiyear contract, Netflix wants to put Comcast genie back in ‘fast lane’ bottle;FCC may offer compromise that protects content providers;In the second season of House of Cards, Netflix’s blockbuster political drama, viewers became acquainted with Raymond Tusk, a billionaire industrialist and éminence grise of the US president. Mr Tusk was the embodiment of all that is wrong with corporate America: mighty, monopolistic and far too close to the White House.Just 10 days after the release ofthe second series in February, Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, announced a landmark deal that had been hammered out in the same Washington back rooms frequented by Mr Tusk’s fictional lobbyists. His company agreed to pay Comcast an undisclosed sum, said to be $15m-$20m a year, in exchange for faster and more reliable access to the cable group’s broadband customers.Since then, Netflix has made no secret of which of the two companies it thinks most closely mirrors Mr Tusk’s conglomerate.The agreement he made was so important because it set a precedent that content companies like Netflix should pay companies like Comcast to access their customers, and led to a string of similar agreements with other internet providers including Verizon.The film and television streaming group had for the first time agreed to pay for an internet “fast lane” to reach customers, trampling over the principle of net neutrality, whereby the internet should be a level playing field with no such fast lanes or tolls.This idea had been an article of faith for Netflix and many of its West Coast neighbours including Amazon and Facebook. A start-up would be guaranteed the same speed and access to its customers as a behemoth such as Google.A decade after the term was coined by a Columbia University professor, the concept has also captured the public imagination. Ever since the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecommunications watchdog, passed a rule that would pave the way for a paid-for internet fast lane in July, it has received a record 3.9m comments from the public, mostly opposing the plans.The last time the FCC had to deal with an outcry anywhere near that size was when a “wardrobe malfunction” led to images of singer Janet Jackson’s bare breast being beamed live to 111m viewers during the 2004 Super Bowl. Total number of comments then: 1.5m.On the opposing side of the argument is a clutch of companies that are best described as the “pipe guys” – broadband and cable groups such as Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications, as well as telecommunications networks including Verizon and AT&T. Time and again, they point to one statistic: Netflix and YouTube, Google’s video site, account for half of peak internet traffic in North America, so why should the pipe guys stump up the investment to subsidise the content providers’ growth?Netflix says it had no choice but to hold its nose and do the deal with Comcast. “The degradation in quality that customers were experiencing in late 2013 led to a rise in complaints and cancellations,” the company said. “We just couldn’t ignore it any more.” After signing the multiyear agreement, download speeds jumped markedly.Netflix now wants to put the genie back in the bottle. It fears the deal has set a precedent that all content providers will have to transfer some of their revenues to the pipe guys.The company sees a cautionary tale in the fees that cable and satellite companies pay to broadcasters in return for their content. In 2006, six years after the fees were introduced, they were worth $200m. Now they are worth almost $5bn, a figure that is set to almost double to $9.3bn by 2020, according to SNL Kagan.If the fees Netflix pays to the pipe guys are to grow at anywhere near that rate, it could put a strain on the company’s business model. It has marketed itself as an ultra-cheap alternative to the $100-plus packages offered by traditional pay-TV providers, with plans starting from $7.99 a month.It would be hard to maintain such low prices if Netflix were handing out hundreds of millions annually to Comcast and its peers. Last month, the group blamed its lacklustre third-quarter earnings on price hikes, warning “slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth”.Comcast said: “Netflix executives conceded our interconnection agreement ‘works great for consumers’ and . . . have repeatedly said interconnection was in no way related to their recent price increases which were driven by programming costs. The cost of interconnection is minuscule compared to the amount Netflix spends on programming.”Mike Mooney, senior vice-president and group general counsel at Level 3, a communications company that owns much of the internet infrastructure in the US, warns that the likes of Verizon and Comcast have a vested interest in pushing up Netflix’s prices because they have their own competing content to sell: Comcast owns broadcaster NBC, while Verizon is expanding its fibre video service.“Do only wealthy content providers who can afford the fast lane succeed? They have an incentive to heavily congest the slow lanes so more people move to their fast lanes,” explains Mr Mooney, who says they are in an enviable position. “They are in the catbird seat. Either they get more money off of their rivals, or their rivals’ customers suffer substandard quality.”The issue has also become a partisan battle in Washington. Last month, President Barack Obama said he was “unequivocally committed to net neutrality” and firmly against “the notion that somehow some folks can pay a little more money and get . . . more exclusive access to customers”, earning cheers from his Silicon Valley audience.Yet Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, is in an unenviable position. His previous attempt to ban fast lanes was thrown out by the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit following a challenge from Verizon.Now Mr Wheeler is trying to find some kind of compromise. One option that has been floated is a hybrid approach that would strictly regulate the “back end” of the internet – including deals with Netflix – while giving the pipe guys more freedom when it comes to selling to consumers, a plan that Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson research, has described as a “grand bargain”.Verizon was quick to say that any “so-called hybrid” approach “would be unlikely to stand up in court”.TechFreedom, a think-tank that does not disclose its backers, but which regularly speaks up for the pipe guys, said: “King Solomon wasn’t serious when he proposed splitting the baby. Let’s hope chairman Wheeler isn’t either.”Free Press, a think-tank on the opposing side of the debate, described the plan as a “Frankenstein” form of net neutrality and warned the “legally dubious hybrid proposals won’t protect internet users”.As Frank Underwood, Kevin Spacey’s fictional US president in House of Cards, would no doubt tell Mr Wheeler, the problem with grand bargains is that they end up disappointing everybody.Fast lanes rulingIn January, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit threw out the FCC’s attempts to ban internet fast lanes. Its reasoning was technical but important.Under existing rules, broadband providers are classified as “information services” rather than “telecommunications services”. That means they are regulated with a much lighter touch, and the court ruled the FCC’s attempt to introduce tough new rules was a case of over-reach.The court said if the FCC wanted to ban fast lanes, it would have to reclassify broadband providers as “telecommunications services”.But the last time the FCC attempted something that radical, during the tenure of Mr Wheeler’s predecessor Julius Genachowski in 2010, it prompted an outcry among Republicans, who passed a bill in the House of Representatives that threatened to slash the watchdog’s budget.People close to Mr Wheeler say he has little appetite for the same fight.Although reclassifying broadband companies is still an option, Mr Wheeler is seriously exploring some kind of compromise designed to appease Netflix and its supporters, including the US president, without prompting a string of legal challenges.One plan that was floated last week would split broadband regulation into two. The “back end” of the network – the part where Netflix connects to Comcast et al – would be a tightly-regulated telecoms service.That means the FCC would be able to police deals like the one Netflix did in February. Those deals would not be banned outright, but Comcast and other broadband groups would be forced to show they were good for consumers.Retail broadband – the part where Comcast et al. connect to their customers – would continue to be a lightly-regulated information service, which Mr Wheeler hopes will assuage concerns that the FCC is tying up the internet in red tape.

Its videos receive over 900m views a month, while RTL’s other businesses, including the recently-acquired BroadbandTV network, receive roughly 3bn.Guillaume de Posch, RTL’s co-chief executive, said StyleHaul would break even within two years, highlighting its branded content deals with fashion brands such as Maybelline and its reach among women aged 18 to 34. “Longer term, you can take the view that it can branch out into ecommerce, talent management, et cetera,” he said.RTL bought a 22.3 per cent stake in StyleHaul for $11m last year, and its production arm FremantleMedia subsequently worked together on original series The Crew.Under the deal announced on Monday, the European broadcasting group will pay $107m to increase its shareholding to 93.6 per cent and will also invest an additional $20m to expand StyleHaul’s business.“It’s a risky strategy because the digital assets that RTL buys don’t lead to a very transparent and significant contribution to earnings,” said Stefan Wimmer, an analyst at Meltzer Equities, contrasting RTL’s acquisition strategy with that of rival ProSieben.Shares in RTL, which is controlled by German conglomerate Bertelsmann, rose 1 per cent in early trading on Monday.Deutsche Bank analysts said RTL’s acquisition spending this year remained in line with previous guidance of €250m, meaning that the broadcaster could still pay out an extraordinary full-year dividend.Other broadcasters to invest in online video include Comcast, Disney and UK pay-TV provider BSkyB, which last week announced a $7m investment in sports network Whistle. However, profiting from YouTube popularity has been hard due to the low prices paid for display advertising. StyleHaul said its revenues, including from branded content, “are expected to triple in 2014 compared to the previous year”.RTL is continuing to look for further investments in multichannel networks with marketable technology, such as BroadbandTV, or particular audience niches, such as fashion. “What we want to make sure is we get the right set of skills and the right verticals,” said Mr de Posch.

But the investment is a useful guide to broader shifts in the television industry and follows a flurry of similar moves by other big media groups including RTL, Comcast and Walt Disney.The move follows a series of other recent bets by Sky: it invested $750,000 in virtual reality start-up Jaunt in July, $500,000 in online video aggregator Pluto.TV and $5m for a stake in advertising technology company Sharethrough.The deals show how Sky is trying to hedge against changing viewing habits. Younger audiences in particular are shifting to online video services that operate outside of conventional pay-TV packages.Whistle Sports is BSkyB’s first investment in a “ multichannel network”, and operates 192 channels on platforms including Google’s YouTube and Microsoft’s Xbox gaming console. The company was only founded in January, but has built a library of 28,700 videos that have attracted more than 1.25bn views.Its videos are short and complementary to mainstream sports coverage, and range from basketball to less well-known sports such as Ultimate Frisbee. This contrasts with Sky’s sports channels, which are built around expensive exclusive rights to high-profile competitions such as Premier League football and international cricket.“We see lots of potential to harness Sky Sports’ content and relationships with major sports bodies and brands to work alongside Whistle Sports’ talent network”, said Barney Francis, managing director of Sky Sports.He added that Sky hopes to be able to collaborate on video content to build its reach among younger audiences.Sky’s other investments have been aimed at strengthening different parts of its business, which spans programme-making, distribution and ad sales. It holds a stake in Roku, an online streaming service, whose technology is used in Sky’s pay-as-you-go service, Now TV. It has also invested in 1 Mainstream, which enables the distribution of video on devices such as tablets.But when it comes Sky’s investments in early-stage companies, the question remains whether it has backed winners.“I always get nervous when big operating companies start behaving like [venture capitalists]. Sometimes it can lack coherence,” said Nigel Walley, a consultant at Decipher.“In the back of your head, there’s always the ITV / Friends Reunited deal,” he added, referring to the 2005 deal in which broadcaster ITV bought Friends Reunited, the social networking site, for £170m to strengthen its digital presence. It ended up selling the company for a fraction of that price four years later.However, Sky’s enthusiasm for digital bets is at least matched by its peers.RTL, the European broadcaster, last year invested $36m for a 51 per cent stake in BroadbandTV, a YouTube network with more than 7,800 channels, while media company Comcast was one of several groups to invest in Fullscreen. Disney agreed to pay up to $900m for Maker Studios, which also distributes its video content on YouTube.This week YouTube, which makes money through advertising, said that it is considering the introduction of an ad-free subscription service. Such a move would give the Google-owned company a business model more similar to that of Netflix and traditional pay-TV networks.

Content companies are worried;"Ralph Roberts, the 94-year-old co-founder of Comcast, was seriously ill last year, spending 85 days in bed after being stricken by double pneumonia. His son, Brian, Comcast’s chief executive, visited regularly to check on him and update him about the company — the largest cable television and broadband provider in the US and the owner of the NBCUniversal broadcast network and film studio.During one visit, Mr Roberts told his father that Comcast had been approached to see if it was interested in buying The Washington Post. “My dad’s lying there and we agreed that the newspaper business wasn’t a good fit,” he recalls, sitting in his office at Comcast Center, the gleaming 58-floor skyscraper that towers over Philadelphia.The Post was eventually bought by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But Mr Roberts had also been approached by Glenn Britt, the late chief executive of Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable operator, to discuss a deal. “I said to my dad: ‘What about Time Warner Cable?’” recalls Mr Roberts. “His eyes opened. He said: ‘For that, I’ll get better’.”The elder Mr Roberts went on to recover from the double pneumonia and Comcast made an audacious $45bn offer for Time Warner Cable, grabbing the company from under the nose of John Malone, the “cable cowboy”, whose Charter Communications had pursued TWC for months.The proposed takeover is being studied by regulators, who are expected to decide whether to approve it by early next year. If the deal goes ahead, it will create the world’s biggest provider of broadband and cable television services, reshaping the media landscape in the process. The prospect of an enlarged Comcast — which will leapfrog Walt Disney as the world’s largest media company — has sparked anxiety among content companies. The recent, shortlived $71bn bid for Time Warner, owner of HBO and CNN, from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox was driven in part by a need to create a company big enough to stare down Comcast in negotiations on distribution over its cable systems.A combined Comcast-TWC will supply some of the largest metropolitan areas in the US with cable television services and, more significantly, will be the largest provider of fixed-line, high-speed internet access. More than 40 per cent of homes with speeds of 10 mbps — which is necessary to view streaming video services such as Netflix — will get their broadband service from Comcast-TWC. For fixed-line homes capable of receiving speeds of 50 mbps, the combined company’s share will jump to at least 50 per cent, according to Free Press, a non-profit group that campaigns for a free and open internet.Comcast has developed rapidly over the past 50 years, becoming one of the world’s largest media groups. From one acquisition to the next, it now serves customers across America and has a powerful position in cable video and the supply of high-speed internet services. Its origins, though, were rather more humble.The proposed merger of the top two cable providers has generated a storm of protest. Companies such as Netflix, Discovery Communications and other critics have lined up to urge the Federal Communications Commission to block the deal because the combined companies will wield too much market power.“If it is permitted to merge with TWC, for at least half of American households the only choice for high-capacity internet will be Comcast,” says Susan Crawford, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School and the author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.She equates Comcast’s power in high-speed internet provision with the great monopolies of the past, such as the railroad barons of the late 19th century.There is “no consumer benefit” to the Comcast-TWC combination, she says, urging the Department of Justice, which is also reviewing the deal, to act. “It has a public-interest standard to uphold and if it is driven by the facts it will block the merger. This is about freedom of information flows in America.”Want to start an online business that uses bandwidth? You will have to go to ComcastTo understand why Comcast and its expansion plans have attracted such opposition, it is necessary to look at the company’s origins and its place within the evolution of the US cable industry. American homes used to get their television signals over the airwaves. That began to change, slowly, in the 1940s and 1950s in areas that were hard for broadcast signals to reach. Originally called “community antennae television”, cable systems were developed that received a single TV signal and distributed it to multiple homes. Cable was an efficient way to pump multiple channels into individual homes and, over the years, the number of systems grew exponentially.Comcast was born in 1963 when Ralph Roberts, an entrepreneur from Philadelphia, bought American Cable Systems, a 1,200 subscriber cable television operation in Tupelo, Mississippi. It was not his first company: previous ventures included a revolutionary golf putter, a men’s accessories business and a stint working for Muzak, selling the inoffensive recorded ditties played in shops and lifts.The cable business model reminded him of Muzak, in that once an initial capital investment had been made revenue would recur — and keep recurring. “You put up a tower and some equipment,” Ralph Roberts told William Novak, the author of the official Comcast history, An Incredible Dream, “and they paid you every month.” Cable, he added, “looked to me like the greatest business in the world”.Another reason it was, and remains, an appealing business is because a crucial element of the industry in Ralph Roberts’ era still holds true today: the lack of competition.“The cable industry has never competed against itself,” says Leo Hindery, the former president of TCI, the cable operator that was eventually sold to AT&T and then to Comcast. The capital cost of laying cables was so prohibitive that once an operator had laid pipes in a particular street or neighbourhood, it effectively had that area to itself.Satellite television changed that dynamic. “Satellite could paint the whole sky,” says Mr Hindery, referring to operators such as DirecTV and Dish, which were unconstrained by the limits of physical cable infrastructure. With satellite’s coast-to-coast reach cable operators had to bulk up and, starting in 1998, they did in a period Mr Hindery calls the “summer of love”. Individual operators such as Comcast swapped systems with other providers — “at least two-thirds of the nation’s subscribers changed hands”, says Mr Hindery.Consolidation continued apace as operators linked individual cable systems, increasing the size of their regional markets. “We moved from an industry that once had 100 operators to 50, then 20,” says Mr Hindery. Fast forward to 2014 and there are even fewer operators; if the Time Warner Cable sale is cleared, the number of cable companies serving 5m or more subscribers drops from four to three.The prospect of the largest operator in a particular industry buying the second largest would normally set regulatory alarm bells ringing but Comcast executives are confident the deal will be cleared. “There is nothing in this transaction that will lead to a reduction of competition in any [US] markets,” says David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice- president — and the architect of the company’s political and regulatory strategy.Comcast operates across a swath of the northeastern US in cities such as Philadelphia and Boston, as well as Florida and parts of the west coast. Time Warner Cable has markets that include New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. “There is no competitive overlap and there is not a single consumer in America who will have less choice after this transaction,” says Mr Cohen.Comcast’s size and heft in the market for broadband provision is where opponents of the deal believe the TWC transaction could fall foul of antitrust authorities.“If the deal goes through it will make Comcast the gatekeeper over the future of communications,” says Craig Aaron, the president and chief executive of Free Press. “Want to start an online business that uses bandwidth? You will have to go to Comcast.”Comcast points out that it faces competition in broadband from a range of players: telecoms companies such as Verizon and AT&T offer broadband — as well as television services — to their subscribers. Google, which has laid high-speed fibre lines in Kansas City, also has designs on the broadband market.Yet none of these operators has as many customers as Comcast. The company and its cable peers have an inbuilt advantage over potential competitors from other sectors: the networks and cables they laid over the past decades. It turned out that the cables laid by Comcast to carry TV signals were also big enough to carry broadband signals. Broadband is on the way to becoming Comcast’s biggest business — and also gives it a natural hedge against “cord-cutting” cable customers who are cancelling their monthly video subscriptions.Younger viewers that have grown up watching online video may balk at expensive bundles of channels sold by the likes of Comcast and its competitors. But if these viewers want to watch streaming video offered by Netflix or new “over the top” services announced last week by CBS, the broadcast network, and Time Warner’s HBO channel, they will still need a fast internet connection, which is where the largest provider in the US — Comcast — comes in.Most American homes lack competitive choices for fixed high-speed internetWhether the FCC will allow Comcast to complete the TWC deal is up for debate, although Comcast has taken steps to head off potential concerns. “We’re going to sell and spin off about 4m customers,” says Mr Roberts, referring to a complex deal the company struck with Charter Communications. The move will keep Comcast’s share of the cable video market below a 30 per cent limit recommended by the FCC.Prof Crawford says Comcast reducing its share of the video market is “irrelevant”. The bigger issue, she says, is its power in broadband. “What really matters and what is really bringing profit to cable these days is infrastructure and the delivery of information.”Comcast, though, is relaxed about its share of the broadband market; Mr Cohen does not anticipate any regulatory concerns. This, he says, is because there no such thing as a “national” broadband market: consumers buy their services from local providers. “You can’t buy broadband as a consumer nationally. Relevant markets in antitrust [regulations] are driven by people’s ability to purchase services in the relevant market.”The FCC is taking increased interest in the broadband marketplace. Tom Wheeler, its chairman, recently expressed concern over the lack of competition in high-speed broadband provision. “Most American homes lack competitive choices for fixed high-speed internet,” he said. “Where meaningful competition is not available, the commission will work to create it.”Laying out a policy framework to deliver more competition, he added that “where meaningful competition is not available, the commission will work to create it”.It is unclear what this stance means for the deal; Comcast will have to wait to find out. What is clear is that the future of the media industry — which for so long has been gripped by a debate about whether content or distribution is “king” — will be contested on a broadband battlefield. A bigger Comcast will be ready for that fight.The Roberts family: Maintaining control and forging political linksFor all the big takeovers it has pulled off — AT&T Broadband for $72bn including debt in 2002; NBCUniversal for $30bn in 2013 — Comcast remains tightly controlled by the Roberts family.Brian Roberts’ stake in Comcast is worth about $1.2bn. But the company has a dual-class share structure; with about a third of the voting stock, he has effective control over the company that his father started with Julian Brodsky and Daniel Aaron.There was never any doubt that he would follow Ralph Roberts into the company. “If you found me at 10 and asked me: what do you want to do? I would have said ‘I want to work with my dad’,” Roberts says.As a young man he worked for Comcast in a range of roles — sales, marketing and “climbing poles”. “It was a fantastic apprenticeship,” he says.He was made president of Comcast when he was 30 and went on to oversee the most intense period of the company’s growth. “When I got out of college in 1981 we had almost $40m in revenue. We generated about $65bn in revenue last year and the business continues to grow.”The company’s growth has been matched by the forging of deep political connections. David Cohen, its regulatory and political chief, has hosted several fundraisers for Barack Obama. (The president joked at a 2013 fundraiser at Mr Cohen’s home that he had visited so frequently “the only thing I haven’t done in this house is have [the Passover] Seder dinner”). Mr Roberts has played golf with the president at Martha’s Vineyard.The influence of Ralph Roberts continues to shape Comcast. The elder Mr Roberts was himself profoundly affected by the Great Depression; as a child he saw his father lose everything. Ralph “always liked to keep a lot of cash and a lot of debt on the balance sheet”, says Mr Roberts. “But he liked to keep the cash because we’ll always be ready for a rainy day and with cash we can also be opportunistic.“If you lived through the Depression it changes you forever. You live your life assuming everything you have can be taken away from you. And that’s how Comcast got built.”This article has been amended since original publication. Professor Susan Crawford says at least half of all American households will only be able to receive high-capacity internet from Comcast, not two-thirds as previously stated."
286;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-10-23T11:45:05Z;Comcast profits rise as broadband subscribers surge;US company adds 315,000 internet customers but cable viewers decline;Comcast added 315,000 subscribers to its high-speed internet service, its best third-quarter performance for five years, as the cable operator reported earnings that were slightly ahead of expectations.The increase lifts the number of Comcast broadband subscribers to 21.6m and suggests it could soon eclipse the number of subscribers to the company’s cable television service.Comcast has 22.4m cable video subscribers, a number that is shrinking as viewers “cut the cord” of their television subscription or move to competing services from rivals, such as Verizon or AT&T.Comcast lost 81,000 video subscribers in the quarter, an improvement on the comparable quarter last year, when it lost 127,000.Revenues for the quarter rose 4 per cent from $16.2bn to $16.8bn. Net income rose nearly 50 per cent from $1.7bn to $2.6bn but was lifted by a one-off tax gain. Earnings per share climbed from $0.65 to $0.99, but excluding the one-off gain, earnings per share increased from $0.65 to $0.73.Comcast has made an agreed $45bn offer for Time Warner Cable, a deal that will increase its US footprint and reshape the US media landscape. However, the two companies are waiting for regulatory clearance from the Federal Communications Commission, which has been collecting public comment on the transactions. The FCC said this week that it was stopping the informal 180-day “clock” on the deal to give companies more time to submit comments about the proposed transaction.The order came after certain companies and groups, such as Dish Network, asked for more time to submit comment on the transaction. They also complained about opposition to access to confidential information that they said was necessary to properly provide input on the deal.Some companies, such as Discovery Communications and Netflix, have criticised the Comcast-TWC tie-up in submissions to the FCC. Comcast, which also owns the NBCUniversal broadcast network and movie studio, last month accused Discovery Communications of “extortionate demands” and seeking “unwarranted business concessions” as a condition of the company’s “non-opposition” to the deal.Discovery had said the Comcast-TWC combination would have an “enhanced position to impose prices, terms and conditions on programmers” and hold an “unfair information advantage over programmers in carriage negotiations”.
287;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-10-13T17:26:15Z;CSX/Canadian Pacific: railway to heaven;Both railroads have gone through turnrounds;Cable companies and railroads are not dissimilar. Both have capital-intensive networks snaking through their home regions. Within those regions, they face limited direct competition. So if one industry can attempt consolidation across geographies, perhaps the other can as well. Thus Canadian Pacific has reportedly approached CSX, one of two railways in the Northeastern US, following a track laid by Comcast in its pursuit of Time Warner Cable.Big railroad deals come with big regulatory risk. North America has shrunk to seven large regional railroads, with two in most regions (CSX shares the east coast with Norfolk Southern). Regulators quashed the merger of Canadian National with BNSF in 1999.CSX has transformed its operations in the past decade. Its operating margin has gone from 10 to 30 per cent, as the company has squeezed labour and other costs. That is all the more remarkable given that its coal volumes have dropped nearly a third in the last decade. Coal now accounts for just a quarter of CSX’s total volumes.An even starker turnround has taken place at CP. Since investor Bill Ackman and new CEO Hunter Harrison arrived in 2012, CP shares are up 200 per cent. Mr. Harrison is widely considered the best manager in rail. He has taken CP’s operating margin from 20 to 35 per cent. Last week, he said CP would double its earnings per share in the next four years.The rationale of creating a transcontinental railroad is compelling. Connecting CP and CSX could ease the bottlenecks at the Chicago rail exchange where many North American lines meet. Crude oil could flow more easily from the Western continent to Eastern refineries.The deal maths lines up nicely as well. Both have equity values of just above $30bn. CP trades at 20 times earnings. With CSX trading at only 15 times before the rumours, CP has some room to pay premium. The bigger negotiating challenge: where to allocate the antitrust risk.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
288;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-10-12T14:52:04Z;Starz to launch in international markets;US pay-TV network strikes deal with Sweden’s Parsifal;Starz, the US pay-television network behind shows such as Spartacus and Black Sails, has struck a deal to build an “over-the-top” video streaming service that will launch in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America.The company is creating the international Starz Play service with Peter Ekelund’s Parsifal Entertainment, which helped launch HBO’s streaming service in Nordic countries.The deal, which the company will unveil on Monday at the Mipcom television market in Cannes, comes as more channels launch video streaming services that circumvent traditional distributors, such as cable and satellite companies.The battleground of this so-called over-the-top distribution has been driven by the success of Netflix and HBO Go in the US, and services such as the BBC iPlayer in the UK, which has led other operators to enter the marketplace.Netflix, which operates in the US, Latin America and the UK, recently launched in several other European countries, while HBO, the premium cable network behind shows such as Game of Thrones, has scored in the Nordic market with its HBO Go digital platform.Most innovation in over-the-top services is taking place outside the US.“What we focused on is how quickly and dramatically HBO succeeded with its Nordic programme,” said Chris Albrecht, Starz chief executive – and the former chief executive of HBO.“The amount of money and capital investment needed to build these new platforms is a fraction of what it is to build a linear [television] channel,” he said. “This gives us an international business that has real potential.”Parsifal, a Swedish media group, has invested alongside Starz in the new venture, together with unnamed financial institutions. “We’re seeing a lot of indigenous investors willing to partner with US companies to make a stand in their own territories,” added Mr Albrecht.Mr Ekelund has experience of streaming services, having worked with HBO on its Nordic venture. “Viewing habits are changing,” he said. “With on-demand behaviour consumers are getting used to another way to watch television.”CBS, the owner of Showtime, which competes with HBO and Starz in the US, is also exploring an over-the-top streaming service. “Is there some time in the future that could happen? Absolutely,” said Les Moonves, CBS chief executive, recently.Shares in Starz have doubled since the company was spun out of John Malone’s Liberty Media at the beginning of 2013.It is among the companies that could be an acquisition target in the expected consolidation of the media sector, following the proposed $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable by Comcast.The prospect of a Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination was one of the motivations for the recent $71bn pursuit of Time Warner by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.Fox abandoned the bid this summer after only a few weeks when its shares went into decline.
289;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;US media mergers have dried up but Univision may be on the cards;Owners weigh options for US Spanish-language broadcaster;With three multibillion-dollar deals landing in relatively quick succession, 2014 was all set to be the year of the media mega merger.In February, Comcast launched a $45bn offer for Time Warner Cable, which was followed in May by AT&T’s $48bn bid for DirecTV and then, in August, by a $71bn move for Time Warner by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.Since Mr Murdoch withdrew his offer last month, deal activity has dried up. But it may not stay quiet for long. The private equity firms that control Univision, the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the US, are considering their options after seven years of ownership. A sale or initial public offering could be on the cards.There are several reasons why the timing might be right for a sale, which could fetch more than $20bn, according to some analysts. The strategic rationale that underpinned Fox’s aborted bid for Time Warner was the need to create a larger, more powerful programming and content entity capable of holding its own in negotiations with beefier distributors, such as a combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable or AT&T-DirecTV.Univision, with 16 broadcast, cable and digital networks and 129 local television and radio stations, has the size to make a difference to a channel owner wary of negotiating against a larger and newly emboldened distributor.The consortium that owns Univision – Madison Dearborn, Providence Equity, TPG, TH Lee and Saban Capital – bought the company in a highly leveraged deal in 2006. The timing was terrible, and the company’s debt mountain, estimated at more than $9bn, has been a deterrent to potential acquirers in the past.But Univision’s financial performance is steadily improving: it scored record ratings for the football World Cup and profits in the second quarter rose close to 20 per cent. Free cash flow has increased, and the debt is being paid down.Potential impediments to a sale have also been reduced. Televisa, the Mexican media group, once had a stormy relationship with Univision but in 2010 signed a long-term deal to supply programming – an arrangement that works because the companies can see how shows perform when they are screened in Mexico before bringing them to the US. Televisa has a 5 per cent stake in Univision, as well as convertible debt equivalent to 30 per cent of Univision’s shares.Univision’s private equity owners will be aware that Univision’s audience is rapidly expanding. Latinos are the fastest growing demographic group in the US and their purchasing power is increasing, which makes them increasingly attractive to advertisers. By 2015 they will have $1.5tn of buying power – a 50 per cent increase on 2010, according to Nielsen.The size of the Latino audience can be seen in television ratings for the second quarter, when Univision was the fourth most watched network, ahead of CBS, for people aged 18-34. Its station in Los Angeles was the most watched in the entire US for adults aged 18-49 in day and primetime programming.Univision should appeal to several potential buyers – particularly those keen to strengthen their hands ahead of distribution negotiations with the likes of Comcast and AT&T. But which company would be the best fit?CBS, 21st Century Fox, Walt Disney and Time Warner could all benefit from Univision’s portfolio of assets. CBS, Disney and Fox also own local television stations in markets that, in some cases, would overlap with Univision – and which would probably require divestment to satisfy regulatory concerns.There would be no such problems with Time Warner, the owner of the Warner Brothers movie studio, news channel CNN and the HBO premium cable channel. Time Warner does not own any stations and, on paper at least, represents the best fit. It has the balance sheet to afford a potentially chunky transaction and a chief executive in Jeff Bewkes who, after rebuffing Mr Murdoch’s advances, has to show his investors that he has a growth plan in place.If no offers are forthcoming, Univision is likely to pursue an IPO, or it will continue to sit tight: its owners have held on for more than seven years, which is a lifetime for private equity firms. Waiting to sell a little longer will not hurt. But the stars seem to be aligning for a deal.matthew.garrahan@ft.com
290;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-09-25T12:42:42Z;Comcast: Wedding trashers;Many guests want the marriage with Time Warner Cable to be called off;Forever hold your peace? Not a chance when it comes to marriages in media. US cable companies Comcast and Time Warner Cable are in the midst of the Federal Communication Commission’s review of their $44bn tie-up. This week, Comcast replied to the reams of feedback the FCC received about the deal. Comcast in effect accused Discovery Communications of extortion, alleging that Discovery demanded higher rates for its programming in exchange for supporting the deal. Throw in bad blood between Netflix and Comcast and the rehearsal dinner becomes a drunken brawl.There are two ways a Comcast/TWC clan, which would have 30 per cent share of the business, could change the market. Discovery and its peers would have less leverage in negotiating prices for its programming. In recent years, networks such as Discovery increased the fees they charged Comcast, TWC, DirectTV and other distributors faster than the distributors could increase consumers’ prices.Pay TV bills have risen enough that subscriber counts are falling. If consumers still want to watch TV programmes without a cable plan, however, they require internet connections. That is the second front of this war. Netflix opposes the merger because the new Comcast would be a dominant internet provider. Netflix has already voluntarily entered into “interconnect” agreements with Comcast and other broadband providers such as Verizon to ensure the quality of its streaming. But like Discovery, it remains leery about Comcast’s control of distribution.Comcast is paying for Time Warner with shares. Based on Comcast’s recent price, which is in effect unchanged from the February announcement, Time Warner shares are trading at a 7 per cent discount to the implied deal value. The betting says that the minister shouts down the rabble and that the happy couple will head off for their honeymoon.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
291;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-09-24T13:06:42Z;Comcast accuses Discovery of ‘extortionate demands’;;Comcast has launched a broadside against critics of its proposed $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable, accusing Discovery Communications of “extortionate demands” and seeking “unwarranted business concessions” as a condition of the company’s “non-opposition” to the deal.The deal, which would combine Comcast, the largest cable operator and broadband provider in the US, with the third largest, will reshape the US media landscape if it is approved by antitrust authorities, creating a content distribution powerhouse that also owns NBCUniversal, the broadcast network and movie studio.The deal has attracted criticism from several companies, such as Netflix, the streaming video service, and Dish, the satellite operator, which have told the Federal Communications Commission that a combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable would wield too much market power.Discovery, the owner of channels such as TLC, Animal Planet and Eurosport, is the largest content producer and channel owner to have spoken out publicly against the deal. In a filing with the FCC this month it said a combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable would have an “enhanced position to impose prices, terms and conditions on programmers” and hold an “unfair information advantage over programmers in carriage negotiations”.Comcast filed a lengthy response to comments about the deal with the FCC on Wednesday and saved its strongest barbs for Discovery.It accused Discovery of seeking favourable terms with Comcast in exchange for not opposing the transaction. Such demands were “patently improper”, it said. “Discovery does not need additional regulatory help to succeed in the marketplace,” Comcast said. Discovery’s claims were “baseless and should be rejected”.Discovery hit back in a statement, saying Comcast had chosen “not to talk about . . . what they would do post-merger to demand extreme discounts from cable programmers or block the launch of new networks and brands”.Discovery does not need additional regulatory help to succeed in the marketplaceDavid Leavy, Discovery’s chief communications officer, said the company stood by its concerns “that Comcast could use its enhanced leverage from the proposed merger to impose deep price reductions and onerous terms”.“Comcast’s silence on the details of key issues like programme discounts, and instead, its continued strategy of intimidating voices that are not fully supportive of its position, is troubling.”The FCC is wading through thousands of comments submitted in response to the Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up and will rule on the deal in the next few months.Some analysts expect the FCC to seek concessions from Comcast in order to clear the deal. The company has already agreed to divest 3.9m subscribers of its cable and internet services to John Malone’s Charter Communications to ease regulatory concerns about the takeover of Time Warner Cable.Analysts have also predicted a wave of consolidation in content production and programming if the deal is cleared.Operators of cable channels may need to strengthen their position when negotiating with the combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable over distribution of their channels.The recent $70bn bid by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox for Time Warner – which is unrelated to Time Warner Cable – was a direct response to the prospect of a bigger, stronger Comcast. Mr Murdoch eventually withdrew the bid after Fox’s shares fell steeply and the Time Warner board refused to discuss his proposal.
292;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-09-19T16:04:35Z;Wall-to-wall coverage lined up for golf’s ‘world cup’;With an entire channel dedicated to the event, gone are the days of patchy broadcasting;Television coverage of the Ryder Cup used to be a sedate affair lacking breadth, urgency and razzmatazz. When the BBC was the only UK broadcaster covering the event in 1993 it often lacked space in its schedules to show the most important events, such as the Friday tee-off, live.Not so in 2014. On both sides of the Atlantic the three-day contest has become a major fixture in the broadcasting calendar, with days of televised build-up, previews and analysis to stoke the excitement of golf fans before wall-to-wall live coverage begins from Gleneagles on Friday.In the UK, Sky Sports will be showing 300 hours of programming on a dedicated Ryder Cup channel over a two-week period. The scale of the company’s outside broadcast operation has increased substantially since Sky first began screening the tournament in 1995, with interest from viewers growing at each staging of the biennial event.The company will be using 80 cameras at Gleneagles – double the number it used at Valderrama in 1997 – and has scheduled more on-site programming than ever, such as a three-hour highlights show from the course each night.After broadcasting the event in 3D for the first time in 2010 at Celtic Manor, this year it will be testing an ultra high-definition technology, called 4K, for internal research and development. “We felt it was prudent to start looking to the future,” says Jason Wessely, executive producer of Sky’s golf coverage.“When we first broadcast the Ryder Cup in 1995 it was the first time the first tee shot had been shown live,” he adds. “It was uninterrupted golf. The BBC had always struggled with the number of hours to cover. We took that on board and made a big thing of showing it all.”Nearly 20 years later Sky is showing more than ever. “I think the fact that we have dedicated a whole channel to it shows how highly we regard it,” says Wessely. “It’s become like a World Cup or Olympics. The build-up to the competition, when the captains are announced, the start of qualifying, the wild card selections . . . it’s like a long journey that builds the excitement. We’re pushing it very hard this year because recent Ryder Cups in 2012 and 2010 were so incredibly nail-biting and exciting.”The tournament is enduringly popular and rarely fails to deliver drama, incident and spectacle. “It’s become an event that almost transcends golf,” says Guy Kinnings, global head of golf for IMG, the sports marketing and media group. “It’s a time when people who are not necessarily golf fans – but who love sport – won’t miss a minute of it. There’s always a story.”We are pushing it because recent Ryder Cups were so excitingFor media companies, there are other factors at play. In an increasingly cluttered television landscape, sporting events – particularly marquee ones, such as the Ryder Cup – stand out. Unlike pre-recorded programming, such as dramas or comedies, which a viewer may record to watch later so they can skip commercials, compelling sports events are better watched live.This makes the biggest events highly prized by advertisers, which is why broadcasters such as Sky in the UK and NBC and Golf Channel in the US, are spinning off as much programming from the event as they can. While they have the viewers’ attention they want to hold it for as long as possible.In the US, Golf Channel – which like NBC is part of Comcast, the cable company – is carrying the Ryder Cup for the first time and will share the coverage with NBC. The PGA of America and NBC recently agreed a long-term deal that will keep the tournament on NBC’s family of networks until 2030. NBC, like Sky in the UK, has a long relationship with the tournament, having broadcast it since 1991.As part of the deal, NBC is committed to expanding the reach of the event beyond the week it is staged. “There are wonderful synergies between [Golf Channel] and the PGA of America,” said Pete Bevacqua, chief executive of the PGA of America.Synergies aside, the value of sports rights to marquee events has increased exponentially for the past 15 years. The Ryder Cup has earned its place alongside the world’s other biggest sporting events. “I genuinely think that the sports fan is drawn to something that delivers,” says Kinnings of IMG. “And the Ryder Cup always delivers.”
293;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-09-11T15:54:28Z;Online companies join battle over ‘internet slow lanes’;Massive protest erupts against proposed changes to net neutrality;A fierce battle is raging for the hearts and minds of web users – a battle that, if the heated rhetoric from each side is a guide, could have serious ramifications for the future of the internet.In one corner is a loose coalition of popular online services, such as Netflix, Reddit, Kickstarter and Foursquare, together with free speech and liberal advocacy groups. In the other are anti-tax organisations, cable companies such as Comcast, and telecoms providers including AT&T and Verizon.Their fight centres on “net neutrality”: the principle that all web traffic should flow across networks to users at the same speed, unimpeded by restrictions or the prioritising of certain traffic.It is a nebulous, complex issue that provokes responses ranging from the impassioned to the apathetic. On his HBO TV show, the comedian John Oliver recently said of net neutrality: “The only two words that promise more boredom in the English language are ‘featuring Sting’.”But this week saw a massive online protest against proposed changes to net neutrality principles. The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates US internet provision, wants to give internet service providers the ability, under certain conditions, to charge companies such as Netflix for using high-speed networks.Opponents claim that this will skew the competitive landscape and create a two-tier internet. A website produced by a coalition of tech and free speech groups calling itself “Team Internet” this week urged all web users to tell the FCC to drop its proposals. On Wednesday, websites supporting the protest displayed large, slowly spinning circular icons – the symbols that appear when a website or online video takes too long to load – to draw attention to the issue.Their campaign generated 420,000 submissions to the FCC in a single day, while 146,000 calls were made to Congress and the White House, according to Fight for the Future, a non-profit group that is part of the coalition.Google, one of the prime movers in a campaign that helped to defeat another proposed reform of the web – the Stop Online Piracy Act of 2011 – has also joined the fray over net neutrality. It sent an email this week to supporters of the anti-SOPA campaign, urging them to “stand for an open internet”, saying: “Internet policy should be like the internet itself . . . free and inclusive”.Most critics of the FCC’s proposals want to reclassify broadband provision as a public utility. This, they claim, would prevent the creation of online fast lanes for companies willing to pay more. But opponents of reclassification say it would slow innovation and deter companies from investing in high-speed broadband networks. On a website called www.dontbreakthe.net, another coalition makes the case for not reclassifying broadband as a public utility, arguing that public utilities are “lousy at delivering high tech services”.Broadband providers, it says, “are constantly pushing the boundaries of technology to keep pace with exploding demand. If you regulate broadband like you regulate water, competition will evaporate.”This may or may not be true. While the market for broadband provision is supposed to be competitive with both cable and telecoms providers vying to offer services, in some big markets such as New York there are areas where only one operator offers high-speed services.But in other parts of the US, telecoms groups are belatedly getting in on the act after the cable sector stole their thunder. Cable companies had realised a decade ago that the pipes carrying analogue TV signals into homes could also carry high-speed internet traffic. The switch from analogue to digital channels has freed up space in those cables, enabling companies such as Comcast to offer a range of internet services at faster speeds.Now, telecoms operators are fighting back – and this competition should eventually heat up. AT&T and Verizon are both pushing fast internet access, and offering pay-TV as part of their bundle of services.In the meantime, the FCC will have to wade through a vast trove of comments and submissions as it draws up new principles on net neutrality. And while it remains a complex subject, public interest is growing. When John Oliver took aim at the FCC’s proposals and urged his TV audience to contact the regulator, irate viewers sent more than 1m submissions. Unlike Sting’s Broadway musical The Last Ship, perhaps net neutrality is not that boring, after all.Matthew Garrahan is the FT’s media editormatthew.garrahan@ft.com
294;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Media M&A: digital divide;Media legends are missing out on transition to digital video;Criticise Amazon all you want for spending $970m on Twitch, which streams videos of people playing computer games. But criticise the traditional media stalwarts who did not buy Twitch even more. It is not as if those titans – Comcast, 21st Century Fox, Time Warner – are averse to dealmaking. Rather, they spent or have tried to spend (in the case of Fox) tens of billions to buy their peers. Defensive deals like those simply to get bigger and take out costs may boost earnings in the short term. But these tie-ups are unimaginative – they do little to position incumbents for a media landscape in which the relevance of traditional TV is dwindling.Not only is there a business to broadcast video game contests, but it is doing well. Twitch had 55m unique visitors in July who watched 15bn minutes of content. It generates revenue through subscriptions and ads. The $970m purchase price is estimated to be 12 to 14 times revenues. For Amazon, Twitch is another leg in a media strategy that includes Amazon Prime streaming video and the Fire phone, Fire TV and Kindle tablet platforms. The dream scenario is that Twitch turns into a YouTube or even a mini-ESPN. For Amazon the acquisition demonstrates its desire to be not just a distributor but also content owner, although the 15 per cent fall in the stock price this year suggests some scepticism about the strategy.The other rumoured suitor for Twitch was Google. But where was Time Warner or Fox? Overshadowed by the mega-consolidation this year has been the weakness in the television ad market. Big marketers such as Procter & Gamble are shifting away from TV. Recent second-quarter results were weak at several networks including Time Warner, Viacom, and CBS. By 2017, Magna Global estimates that digital ad spending of $72bn will finally surpass TV ad spending. Traditional media companies have been hurt by digital investments in the past (remember Fox’s ownership of MySpace?) But that is no reason not to try again. When Fox abandoned its bid for Time Warner, it said it would buy back $6bn of its own shares. Surely $1bn was available to grab Twitch.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
295;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-08-24T16:25:45Z;European media bet on tech start-ups;;European media companies are committing hundreds of millions of dollars to investing in digital start-ups, as they look for ways to diversify away from stalling growth in their core businesses.In the past two years, groups such as Germany’s Bauer Media, Sweden’s Modern Times Group and Italy’s Mediaset have launched venture funds designed to pump cash into fledgling technology groups.According to figures compiled by the Financial Times after speaking to several major European media groups, close to half a billion dollars has either been invested in start-ups or placed in separate venture funds by these companies since 2000.Executives at media companies had differing reasons for setting up venture funds. Though some said they were looking for “strategic” investments, such as small digital companies that can assist their television or publishing arms, most said they looked solely for financial returns, turning to investing as a way to prop up their core business.Earlier this month, Bauer Media said it was launching a venture fund worth €100m. The company said the fund was “fully return oriented . . . looking for highly scalable digital business models with a high probability to generate attractive exit proceeds”. It added that it may make investments worth up to €7m.In July, Jaunt, a Silicon Valley-based virtual reality company received $27.8m in a funding round that included BSkyB – the satellite broadcaster that has also invested in an $8m venture fund with Luminari Capital.Others, including Germany’s Bertelsmann and the Anglo-Dutch group Reed Elsevier, have also created funds or already made digital investments worth £100m or more.The pattern follows America’s leading media conglomerates, which have also set up independent venture groups. Comcast Ventures, whose parent company is the world’s largest media group by market capitalisation, has invested in fast-growing technology start-ups such as Flipboard, a popular newsreader app, and Jawbone, the gadget makers.Comcast Ventures said: “We’ve always made it clear that we are first and foremost a financial fund, not a strategic fund, in that we don’t need an operating reason to do an investment.”American corporate firms have invested $3bn in early-stage companies in the US in the first three months of 2014, the highest for two years, according to CB Insights.Following the examples of Time Warner and Comcast, European companies have sought to structure their venture arms like independent funds – with partners judged on the financial value of the portfolio companies, rather than on looser strategic value to the parent company.“It’s a question we get all the time from good entrepreneurs. They want to know that the incentives are aligned,” said Urs Cete, managing director of Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments.According to the media groups, corporate venture previously peaked before the dotcom bubble and the 2007 financial crisis, but has returned in recent years.“It is coming back now. It’s pretty heated already,” said Martin Weber, general partner at Holtzbrinck Ventures, which separated from German publishing company Holtzbrinck in 2010.Although tech groups such as Google and Intel have been the most active investors, European media groups have expanded their efforts because they face threats to their traditional print and analogue business models.“This is just the beginning for us,” said Jorgen Madsen Lindeman, chief executive of Swedish broadcaster Modern Times Group, whose digital accelerator has invested “tens of millions of dollars” since its inception last year. “We cannot limit ourselves to a [specific financial commitment].”While most media companies invest capital, some offer their excess advertising inventory instead. One such arrangement saw publisher Axel Springer take a minor stake in accommodations site Airbnb.German broadcaster ProSiebenSat. 1 said it now gave start-ups ad slots with a list value of €500m a year in exchange for equity stakes, through its venture arm SevenVentures.“It’s a cornerstone of our digitisation efforts. It’s basically the diversification unit,” said Claas van Delden, managing director of SevenVentures. “All German media companies are looking for ways to diversify from their traditional businesses.”However, sceptics wonder whether many investors will survive the next downturn. “Corporate venture is, for most of the companies, in-and-out,” said Mr Weber, general partner at Holtzbrinck Ventures.“Why? Whenever something goes wrong in the core business the first thing you get rid of is the not really necessary venture business.”
296;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-07-29T17:01:20Z;Windstream soars on Reit spin-off plan;;The US telecoms sector climbed on Tuesday after a small wireline network announced plans to spin off part of its business into a real estate investment trust, establishing a new way for rivals to derive value from assets.Windstream, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, said it would turn its existing fibre and copper network, as well as other fixed real estate assets, into a publicly traded Reit, allowing the new company to avoid federal income taxes.The approach has been tried by cellular tower operators like American Tower, but not by a larger cable or fibre optic network owner.Windstream said its board of directors had received a favourable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, although it will still require regulatory approval.“Given the IRS approval, we expect other companies may explore the possibility of spinning off their wireline assets into a similar structure,” Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said.Analysts with Credit Suisse said AT&T and Verizon were likely evaluating a similar strategy, but would “have the advantage of waiting to see how the Windstream transition plays out”.The conversion to a Reit comes as many companies, particularly those in the pharmaceutical sector, evaluate means to reduce taxes. Several, including AbbVie, are hoping to redomicile overseas to reduce their tax bill.The news sent shares of S&P 500 listed telecom operators broadly higher. Windstream soared 12 per cent to $11.83, AT&T rose 3 per cent to $36.59, Verizon advanced 1 per cent to $51.97 and Telephone & Data Systems increased 5 per cent to $25.92.UPS was under pressure after the company, which together with FedEx and Deutsche Post’s DHL dominates the business of shipping parcels around the world, cut its profit forecast for the year as it invests in its business.The company said it would expand operations on the day after Thanksgiving in the US as part of a $175m increase in operating expenses. UPS executives hope to avoid a surge in demand last year that left it incapable of meeting delivery targets.Earnings per share will now be between $4.90 and $5.00 this year, UPS said, compared to a previous forecast of $5.05 to $5.30 a share.Shares of UPS are among the worst performing on the Dow Jones transport index this year. The company declined 4 per cent on Tuesday to $98.86 while rival FedEx dropped 2 per cent to $147.14.A 17 per cent slide in second-quarter profits and tepid third-quarter earnings guidance from Herbalife sent its shares 14 per cent lower to $58.35.Net income at the nutrition supplement company declined to $120m, or $1.31 per share, shy of Wall Street expectations. Sales climbed 7 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn.Herbalife has sought to keep shareholders on board amid its battle with Mr Ackman, the founder of the Pershing Square hedge fund who claims the company is a pyramid scheme.The company, which denies Mr Ackman’s allegations, accelerated its $1.5bn share buyback plan earlier this year.Both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched a probe into the allegations.Darden shares rose 4 per cent to $46.88 after the company said Clarence Otis, who has served as Darden’s chief executive for nearly a decade, would step down at the end of the year amid an ongoing tussle with activist investor Starboard Value.The shake-up within Darden’s executive suite came as the company entered settlement discussions with Starboard regarding the firm’s proxy contest.Darden, which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, said it would trim the list of nominees to its board of directors to ensure at least three Starboard nominees are elected at the company’s annual general meeting in September.Overall, US equity markets trended lower despite rising consumer confidence figures. The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,969.95 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 16,912.11.

297;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-07-23T16:28:07Z;Murdoch’s bid for Time Warner threatens the golden age of television;The fact that once-dominant cable companies face new online and digital competition is good;"My first reaction to the $73bn bid from 21st Century Fox for Time Warner, which this week settled in for a prolonged fight as Time Warner blocked Fox from mounting a rapid assault on its board of directors, was to ask: what problem is Rupert Murdoch trying to solve?It is not a paucity of high-quality television. Indeed, the problem is the opposite these days: it is hard to find enough time to watch all of the fine series that pour out of broadcast and cable networks, both subscription and free to air: True Detective, Game of Thrones, Orange is the New Black. The Good Wife, The Americans, House of Cards. The list goes on.Nor are the networks in financial trouble. Competition among cable and satellite operators to gain viewers – and efforts by services such as Netflix to draw them away – has created a production boom. In the US, non-sports cable networks receive $17bn a year in fees from cable and satellite operators; video-on-demand and similar services gain another $7.5bn, growing by 20 per cent in 2013, according to Barclays.Hollywood studios such as Warner Bros and Fox are feeling the pinch, but this is a golden age of television, in creative and financial terms. That is the healthy outcome of fierce competition in a market where the barriers to entry have been falling, but it could be placed at risk by a wave of megamergers such as Fox/Time Warner and Comcast buying Time Warner Cable.Although we are now used to a bevy of dramas and comedies vying for our attention – both in the US and on international channels and streaming services – it is worth noting how recent the phenomenon is. The first series of The Sopranos, the HBO series that started the race to the top in television production, began 15 years ago.It was launched two years before the ill-conceived and disastrous 2001 merger of AOL and Time Warner, which was accompanied by a lot of corporate flannel about how AOL would usher old media into the digital age. The upheaval that The Sopranos caused was more potent and enduring than the financial engineering inflicted on HBO’s parent company.Murdoch, of all people, should recognise the benefits of competition since he is an innovator. He broke the grip of the big three broadcast networksAOL Time Warner is no more, but HBO’s value has grown hugely – it is the jewel Fox most wants to seize in Time Warner’s crown. The channel gained its power with cable operators by being innovative, not by being big. Subscription channels including Showtime and free ones such as AMC, which produced Mad Men, followed its lead.This happened in an extremely competitive market, driven by four big broadcast networks, six major Hollywood studios and the disruptive force of the internet, which enabled new services to be created. No company had sufficient power of distribution, or share of production, to inhibit it.Mr Murdoch, of all people, should recognise the benefits of competition since he is an innovator. He broke the grip of the big three broadcast networks by launching the Fox network in 1986. Fox News, which he started in 1996, has (for good or ill) overtaken Time Warner’s CNN. FX, a Fox cable channel, makes good shows such as Fargo.The best quality of News Corp, now split into a publishing company and Fox, is entrepreneurialism. Mr Murdoch has founded (or retooled from brands that had been allowed to fade by others) a range of media properties, from The Sun newspaper to BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster. They would not have survived, or existed, without him.Mr Murdoch has another side – that of adept and ruthless dealmaker. He has a history of forcing his way into a market and pouncing on an old-established asset, often at a high price. He paid a breathtaking $5bn for Dow Jones in 2007 and Fox has returned $12bn to shareholders over the past three years in an effort to rebuild credibility.I prefer the first Murdoch, but the second is now at work. He has struck just as Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, has slimmed it down by spinning off Time Warner Cable and Time Inc, but before its growth potential was fully proved. The $73bn offer is not enough, and it will be hard to persuade Time Warner without overpaying.The deal makes perfect sense for Mr Murdoch. He has coveted it since the 1980s, when he attempted to buy Warner Brothers before setting up Fox. He would control a production powerhouse, with one broadcast network, two film studios and cable networks including HBO, and be the king of the content castle.What about the rest of us, though? We have been extremely well served by the existing industry structure, and the intensification of competition in the past two decades. Why would the consumer want to lose all of that to consolidation and the rebuilding of media oligopolies?Ask a company in this wave of mergers and the answer tends to be: “We have no choice.” Others are growing and they must respond. Media companies cite the power of Comcast, particularly if the Time Warner Cable deal gets approved. Comcast itself points to internet giants such as Google.The size argument is not self-evident – it helps in negotiations but what matters more is making shows that cable and satellite operators need. The fact that cable companies that once dominated distribution face new online and digital competition is difficult for them but is good for consumers, and it cannot be solved by merging with others.Before the entertainment industry plunges into a frenetic round of self-reinforcing, defensive consolidation, both US regulators and companies should consider: what is so bad about what we have?john.gapper@ft.comTwitter: @johngapper"
298;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;High-speed broadband growth helps Comcast beat forecasts;;Comcast, the largest US cable operator by subscribers, beat expectations with a 15 per cent rise in earnings as it added high-speed internet customers and boosted growth in business services.The cable, phone, internet and entertainment company – whose $45bn offer for Time Warner Cable is awaiting regulatory approval – continued to lose video subscribers, however, as online viewing on services such as rival Netflix grew.Video subscriber losses slowed to a net 144,000 in the three months ended June 30, from a loss of 162,000 in the same period a year ago. Cable groups tend to lose customers in the second and third quarters of the year when college students and “snowbirds” cancel their services for the summer.“[The second quarter] is typically the weakest quarter of the year for the video distribution business, and 2014 is no exception,” said Vijay Jayant, analyst at ISI Group, ahead of the results.In the final quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of this year, Comcast increased cable subscribers for the first time in more than six years. The slower rate of losses in the second quarter suggests that the company’s efforts to retain customers with updated technology are showing some success.Comcast has been investing in its next-generation X1 platform and Xfinity streaming video offerings to compete in a television industry being reshaped by Netflix, YouTube and the rise of “cord-cutting” among younger viewers who are eschewing traditional cable packages. Capital expenditures in the cable business – including new set-top boxes – were up 20.4 per cent in the quarter.On Monday, Netflix said it had passed the 50m subscriber mark worldwide, with 36m in the US.Brian Roberts, chief executive, hailed “strong progress” at an “important time as we focus on gaining approval for our Time Warner Cable transaction.” The company said it expected to hold a shareholder vote on the merger in the third quarter and hoped to close the deal by the end of the year.Comcast’s cable losses were offset by strong demand for high-speed internet, adding 203,000 subscribers in the quarter, compared with 187,000 a year ago. Across cable, internet and phone, the company shed a net 25,000 subscribers, compared with a loss of 66,000 a year ago.The company is squeezing more money out of its remaining customers, with the average bill rising 4.5 per cent to $137.24.With fewer new pay-TV customers, Comcast and its peers are turning to acquisitions to drive growth and keep pace with competition from streaming services. AT&T has agreed to buy satellite provider DirecTV for $48.5bn.The consolidation among distributors is also raising the possibility of mergers among content providers to keep pace. Last week it emerged that Time Warner had rejected a bid from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.But NBCUniversal chief executive Stephen Burke told a conference call that Comcast’s own content division was in good shape. “We certainly don’t think we need to bulk up in content,” he said.Comcast’s consolidated net income rose 14.8 per cent to $1.99bn, or 76 cents a share, from $1.73bn, or 65 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding gains on items related to sales and acquisitions, earnings were 75 cents a share, beating Wall Street’s consensus of 72 cents.Revenue was up 3.5 per cent to $16.84bn, compared with an estimated $16.97bn.Cable revenue was up 5.4 per cent to $11.03bn, with business services surging 22.4 per cent.NBCUniversal revenue edged up 0.3 per cent to $6.02bn. Higher revenues from theme parks, broadcast TV and cable networks offset a 15.3 per cent decline in the films unit from last year when Universal released the action movie Fast & Furious 6.TV advertising revenues were down on broadcast and cable channels, falling 1.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively, despite a ratings boost that made the NBC broadcast network the most-watched among the coveted 18 to 49-year-old cohort.NBC’s popular singing reality show The Voice was moved up in the viewing schedule in the first quarter this year to capitalise on the audience who tuned in for the Winter Olympics, leaving fewer broadcast hours in the second quarter to sell ads.Cable advertising was affected by the shutting of the Style Network and the reclassification of the Fandango online movie ticketing business under Comcast’s films division.Shares rose 1.4 per cent to $54.55 on Tuesday morning in New York.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil

This would rival NBC, now the only big broadcast network with a cable news channel in MSNBC.Al Jazeera America, the Qatari-owned cable news channel, and Bloomberg, the financial data and news company owned by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, are also considered possible buyers for CNN, which would fit with their existing cable programming.Walt Disney

Earlier this year it entered a bid to buy Channel 5, but has since pulled out of the running. It also owns Scandinavia’s SBS and holds a majority stake in Eurosport International.Discovery may be in the sights of larger competitors. “If Fox finds Time Warner attractive, surely Rupert would see similar industrial logic in pursuing other cable network names, including Discovery, Scripps and AMC,” says Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente.Discovery’s strong stable of unscripted shows gives a “unique advantage of owning multiple leading brands in a genre of content that is relatively low cost to produce, has limited competition, and is extremely portable globally,” says Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.Content costs for the company’s namesake channel and TLC are about 20 per cent of revenues, compared with a cable industry average of 47 per cent, he says, giving Discovery more operating leverage than its peers.Chief executive David Zaslav has acknowledged the advantages of growing bigger, telling journalists at the recent Allen & Co conference in Sun Valley: “You’ll probably see some more consolidation on the content side in order to balance that scale.

And Apple has already made a big move into media this year with the $3bn purchase of Beats Electronics– which many analysts say was focused on Beats’ subscription streaming music service.“All of the digital giants are beginning to blast away at the traditional [broadcast and cable] bundles, habits, and pricing.

300;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-07-16T14:43:54Z;Four reasons why Fox wants Time Warner;;"Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has offered $80bn for Time Warner – setting up the possibility of the world’s biggest merger in media since AOL bought Time Warner at the height of dotcom mania in 2000.What would Mr Murdoch get for his money?1. Television clout
From The Simpsons to Game of Thrones, the pair’s properties span the range of broadcast and premium cable in the US and around the world, with channels including Fox, Fox News, HBO and TNT. While the proposal includes the sale of Time Warner’s CNN, Fox News has held the top spot in US cable news ratings for more than a decade.Beefing up Fox would give the company more leverage amid a wave of consolidation among the cable providers – including Comcast and Time Warner Cable – that distribute their television content.2. Sports prowess
A tie-up would be a powerhouse in live sports broadcasting, by adding Time Warner’s deals to show US professional and college basketball leagues, Major League Baseball and professional golf to Fox’s rights for the National Football League, Nascar and the next two football World Cups.“21st Century Fox has focused on building and buying sports networks around the globe to secure its must have/must watch future,” says Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG Research. At a time when few things draw a large live audience except sport, such content is increasingly valuable.3. A bigger bite of Hollywood
Uniting Warner Bros with 20th Century Fox would be the first step in a long-rumoured consolidation of the big six Hollywood movie studios. The two studios commanded more than a quarter of North American box-office receipts in 2013, far ahead of their closest rival, according to Nash Information Services.4. International reach
Fox would also augment its global reach by adding Time Warner’s HBO, Cinemax and E! properties in Latin America to Fox’s holdings there, creating what Bernstein analysts called a “Latin American pay-TV powerhouse” with “upside for [Time Warner] in Asia and Europe”.

However, once that oil has been refined into another fuel – such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel – it can leave the country.The news that oil producers could export a type of oil that is lighter than regular crude depressed shares of refiners and sent the S&P Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing Index to its biggest one-day decline since 2011.Valero tumbled 8.29 per cent to close at $51.35, Phillips 66 slumped 4.21 per cent to $81.36 and Marathon Petroleum fell 6.34 per cent to end at $80.97.Analysts with Wells Fargo warned that the sharp pullback could be overdone as condensate demand and the size of initial exports, which are expected to begin this summer, are unknown.“We recognise that this will shake confidence in the refining outlook but this is not the end of the road, in our opinion – just an anticipated bump,” analyst Roger Read said.“Unfettered crude exports will require an act of Congress and the political will for that is undeveloped at this point.”The decision lifted independent oil producers, including those drilling in Eagle Ford and Bakken shale of Texas and North Dakota.Shares of SM Energy rose just over 6 per cent to $84.96, Pioneer advanced 5.15 per cent to $233.07 and Rosetta Resources climbed 5.25 per cent to close at $53.69.US broadcast networks were boosted by a Supreme Court ruling that found streaming television service Aereo violated their copyright in a decision that safeguards a key revenue stream for the companies.Broadcast networks – including CBS, Fox, ABC and NBC – earn some $4bn a year from so-called retransmission fees from cable distribution companies like Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Dish.A win for Aereo would have allowed cable distributors to follow its model of using tiny antennas to capture over-the-air television and redistribute it for free.June 2014: Michael Mackenzie discusses with Gregory Meyer how sectarian violence in Iraq coupled with high oil consumption in the US may affect the markets.The retransmission fees, which research firm SNL Kagan forecasts will rise to $7bn in coming years, have become a backbone for revenue at the networks.CBS, which is the largest US standalone broadcast network, rose more than 6 per cent to $62.48.Walt Disney shares advanced 1.48 per cent to $83.90, Twenty-First Century Fox rose almost 2 per cent to $34.88 and Comcast, which owns NBC, climbed more than 1 per cent to $53.21.Shares of Monsanto, the world’s largest maker of genetically modified seeds, climbed just over 5 per cent to $126.73 after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast and said it planned a new two-year $10bn share buyback programme.The company also announced a goal of doubling annual earnings by 2019 on the back of strength in its core seeds business and new big data offerings.Barnes & Noble, the US bookseller fighting fires both in its brick-and-mortar and digital businesses, said on Wednesday that it will split its Nook and retail divisions into two separate companies.“We have determined that these businesses will have the best chance of optimising shareholder value if they are capitalised and operated separately,” chief executive Michael Huseby said.The split is expected to take place in the first few months of 2015. Its shares rose 5.3 per cent to $21.65. Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, holds a minority stake in the Nook business.Overall, US equity markets advanced despite a report that showed economic activity contracted at a worse than expected 2.9 per cent rate in the first three months of the year.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.49 per cent to close at 1,959.53 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.29 per cent higher to 16,867.51. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.68 per cent to end the day at 4,379.76.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
302;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
303;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-06-18T19:57:23Z;Most ISPs improving performance, says FCC;;Most broadband internet service providers in the US are improving their performance, but those using local telephone networks are falling behind in advertised online access speed for customers, says a government report on Wednesday.The Federal Communications Commission will use the findings in the report on fixed broadband service to call for improvements from chief executives of underperforming companies.Comcast and Time Warner Cable, along with AT&T, Cox and several other companies, provided less consistent speeds than advertised, according to the report. ISPs also offered much higher download speeds than upload speeds, reflecting consumer trends of downloading more data than uploading.“While it’s encouraging to see that in the past these reports have encouraged providers to improve their services, I’m concerned that some providers are failing to deliver consistent speeds to consumers that are commensurate to their advertised speeds,” said FCC chairman Tom Wheeler.The report comes at a crucial time for the agency, which is tackling new proposals on net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally, and assessing mega mergers such as the planned tie-up between Comcast and Time Warner Cable. It is certain to attract scrutiny by Congress.Cablevision was one of the few companies that consistently delivered 100 per cent or better of its advertised speed to 80 per cent of FCC panellists 80 per cent of the time during peak periods, the agency said. About half of the ISPs delivered less than 90 per cent or better of the advertised speed, while one-third of them provided at least 60 per cent of advertised speeds.The FCC report found that ISPs on average provided 101 per cent of advertised speeds, compared to 97 per cent in a report in 2013. All of the major ISPs except for Verizon DSL, CenturyLink, Frontier DSL and Windstream delivered at least 90 per cent of advertised performance on average during peak periods.The four services that did not meet the criteria use digital subscriber line technology, or DSL, which provides internet access on local telephone networks. The other companies use fibre or cable technology.Internet accessibility has come in for intense debate this year after the FCC put out for public comment proposals over net neutrality, which ensures that providers do not discriminate against third-party content providers such as Netflix on the basis of speed, and that there is no discrimination against organisations including start-ups trying to reach consumers online.I’m concerned that some providers are failing to deliver consistent speeds to consumers that are commensurate to their advertised speedsThe proposals would allow ISPs to charge companies such as Netflix and YouTube to reach consumers at higher speeds, but only under certain “commercially reasonable” conditions that would be tightly scrutinised.After two successful legal challenges, the FCC is trying to craft rules that would stand up in court, but which would also satisfy those who do not want to see consumers hit by additional charges for faster speeds.Senate judiciary committee chairman Patrick Leahy and Representative Doris Matsui recently introduced a bill that would require the FCC to ban such agreements over paid prioritisation.This month the agency announced it was investigating recent deals in which Netflix agreed to pay extra charges to Comcast and Verizon to reach viewers at faster speeds. The deals are not covered by net neutrality principles because they cover only the last mile of service to the consumer.The scrutiny is the result of thousands of public comments the FCC received on its net neutrality proposals. Mr Wheeler said last week that the probe was aimed at examining whether consumers were getting the quality of service that had been advertised.The FCC study also uncovered network congestion at certain interconnection points. Those results will be released separately.
304;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-06-17T16:58:31Z;Netflix switched on by upbeat analyst report;Rise caps recovery from low of below $300 struck in April;Netflix shares received a boost from an upbeat report from analysts at Morgan Stanley, contributing to a 37 per cent rebound in the stock since it hit a low in April.The tech sector, including Netflix, has benefited as investors revisited stocks sold off in April. At the time, fears of stretched valuations weighed on the broad Nasdaq Internet index. Netflix itself was pressured by fears the costs to stream its service over internet providers like Verizon and Comcast could surge in the future.Netflix shares rose 3 per cent to $443.65 by close of trading on Tuesday, capping a recovery from the low of below $300 struck in April amid the broad sell-off in the tech-related sector.Analysts with Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the film streaming company with an ‘overweight’ rating and $500 price target, which would make it only the 14th US company with a market capitalisation of more than $1bn that trades at or above that price.Morgan Stanley estimates Netflix will reach 108.6m paid subscribers by 2020, as domestic growth slows and the company shifts its focus abroad. The investment bank projects that 48 per cent of total subscriptions by that date will originate outside the US, with a heavy focus on Europe and Latin America.“Proven success in initial markets provides a road map to success in new markets and, as in the US, scale should allow Netflix to leverage content investments and drive margins,” analyst Benjamin Swinburne said.The investment bank also tempered concerns around the net neutrality debate, which has seen Netflix sign agreements with Comcast and Verizon to provide faster service to subscribers.“The regulatory risk for internet service providers is asymmetric, with significantly more downside than upside. Imposing further restrictions in the last mile, including aggressive metered billing or peering charges, could backfire,” Mr Swinburne added.Shares in Expedia rose on a broker recommendation, up 4 per cent to $77.62 after Susquehanna Financial Group upgraded the travel bookings website operator to “positive” from “neutral”, with a new target price of $90.Earnings per share estimates for 2014 and 2015 were respectively 3 per cent and 4 per cent too low and the “valuation isn’t stretched”, according to analyst Brian Nowak.Expedia was expected to have three sources of growth over the two years within its core brands, and monetisation trends were improving, Mr Nowak said. Susquehanna has subsequently raised its 2015 earnings per share estimate by 5 per cent. Its 2014 estimate remained unchanged.The cooling in the housing market evident in the latest figures from the US Commerce Department caused investors to look more critically at the home building sector.Though Wall Street economists expected a narrower decline in starts, new home construction fell 6.5 per cent from a month earlier in May, to an annualised pace of 1.001m new homes.Building permits, a leading indicator of “groundbreaking” on new homes, also declined in the month, falling 6.4 per cent to an annualised pace of 991,000.The slide in permits issued suggests somewhat stagnant growth ahead, as homebuilders continue a tepid pace of expansion.This followed separate figures released on Monday by the National Association of Home Builders, showing that although builder confidence was recovering it remained below levels from a year ago.Shares in D.R. Horton, the largest US residential housebuilder, fell 1 per cent to $23.48, and shares in NVR construction fell 0.2 per cent to $1,119.83.In contrast, shares in Lennar and PulteGroup, other home construction companies, rose 1 per cent to $41.30 and $19.62 respectively.Shares in SolarCity increased 18 per cent to $64.53 after the solar energy company announced plans to acquire Silevo, another solar technology and manufacturing company.SolarCity will pay $200m in stock with the option of an additional $150m if certain conditions are met. Shares in the company were up 79 per cent on Tuesday from a year earlier.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 27 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 16,808.49, the S&P 500 gained 4 points to 1,941.99 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.37 per cent to 4,337.23.
305;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-05-19T21:15:19Z;Google buys New York start-up Divide;;Investment bankers addicted to Candy Crush, take heart. Google has bought Divide, a New York-based start-up that lets users securely separate their work and personal data on smartphones and tablets, effectively turning one device into two.The idea is to help Google attract business customers dealing with a generation of “ bring your own device” workers – people who reject the clunky hardware favoured by many big companies, and instead use their own smartphones for work documents and emails.This self-service approach poses a problem for companies which cannot control security on those devices, and which risk losing their sensitive data and intellectual property if an employee misplaces their personal phone in the back of a taxi.The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Divide had previously raised $25m from investors including the venture arms of Google, Qualcomm and Comcast.Divide, formerly known as Enterproid, was founded in 2010 by three mobile executives who met at Morgan Stanley in New York – “a software house masquerading as an investment bank”, said co-founder and chief operating officer Alexander Trewby. He was referring to the bank’s innovations in areas such as high-frequency trading and mobile technology.“Back in early 2000s, we were one of the only firms on Wall Street to have a mobile engineering team,” Mr Trewby said.Divide will join Google’s Android operating system team and shut its office in London to work alongside Google. It also has offices in Hong Kong and headquarters in New York.The software allows users to flick seamlessly between personal and secured work applications, and lets employers wipe data remotely in the event the device is lost.The move should help Google extend Android’s reach as a tool for businesses. Google’s open-source model and the fact it has a relatively permissive approach to who can sell apps in its store, has made Android more vulnerable than Apple’s operating system to malware. It has also provoked some concern among potential enterprise customers.Apple, by contrast, adopts a more restrictive stance towards developers in its store. The company is reported to be working on introducing a split-screen function for the next generation of iOS, which currently only allows one app to be displayed at a time.Managing security on workers’ devices is particularly important in regulated industries like banking, where data breaches can attract hefty fines. In 2009, HSBC was fined over £3m when customer data were lost in the post.Research group Gartner estimates that by 2016, one in five “bring your own device” programs put in place by enterprises will not work, because they will be too restrictive and employees will work around them.For younger generations, the line between work and play is blurry, said Gordon Graylish, vice-president of sales and marketing at Intel.“Millennials want access to both personal and work content on their business devices and there is a desire by companies to have the ability to separate [the two],” he said. Big companies are concerned about being able to attract and retain a younger workforce and need products that cater to that need, he added.Mr Trewby said Divide had noticed a spike in activity around Thanksgiving, because people appear to be taking the opportunity of time away from the office to go through work emails.
306;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-05-15T21:29:24Z;Fox in push to create $2bn TV production group;Preliminary deal struck with makers of ‘American Idol’ and ‘Big Brother’;Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has reached a preliminary deal with Apollo Global Management to create one of the world’s largest television production businesses.The agreement would see Fox’s Shine Group enter into a joint venture with two TV production businesses controlled by Apollo – Core Media, the maker of American Idol, and Endemol, the company behind Big Brother.The combined entity, which would likely be valued at over $2bn, would be well placed to deal with pay-television companies such as Comcast that are consolidating partly to strengthen their negotiating position with content providers.At the same time, the explosion of digital media is creating an ever greater demand for video content among networks and online outlets.One person familiar with the discussions said Apollo and Fox planned to broaden their reach beyond reality TV to be more aggressive in scripted formats and digital productions. Drama has already grown to about 25 per cent of Endemol’s sales.In a statement on Thursday, Fox confirmed a “preliminary agreement, subject to a number of conditions”, but said there was “no assurance that the proposed transaction will be completed”.No details about valuation or timing of the possible joint venture were available. Fox said the deal was not yet signed and there was much work to be done before it could close.Endemol’s sales were £1bn last year and Shine’s were £510m, according to a UK industry survey. That suggests Fox would have a minority stake in the joint venture unless it put in substantial new investment. Fox’s co-chief operating officer Chase Carey has called for the company to reduce its investments where it does not own controlling stakes.For Fox, the joint venture may also offer a possible exit from Shine Group, which its predecessor News Corp bought for £415m three years ago from its founder Elisabeth Murdoch, Rupert’s daughter.News Corp later settled a shareholder lawsuit alleging the deal showed “rampant nepotism”.Ms Murdoch, who remains Shine’s chairwoman but not its chief executive, is supportive of the deal, a person with knowledge of the situation said.Management roles for the combined company have not been decided, the person added.Endemol was bought by investors including Goldman Sachs and Silvio Berlusconi’s Mediaset for €3.4bn on the eve of the financial crisis.However, it has subsequently struggled for growth, leading its lenders, including Apollo, to take control of the company.Endemol’s earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation were up to £150m last year, two industry figures said.That would value the company at up to £1.3bn, using the multiple paid for fellow “super-indie” All3Media this month.Apollo previously proposed a merger between Endemol and Core Media in 2012, but ran into opposition from Endemol’s co-founder John de Mol.
307;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;AT&T/DirecTV: Coming out on top;$50bn on DirecTV doesn’t look bad compared to the alternatives;Take heart, AT&T shareholders. There are even more scary ways for the company to squander its capital than by spending $50bn on DirecTV. Diving head first into pay-TV seems like an odd decision but at least in DirecTV, AT&T is going after a big, highly profitable business. Yes, the deal might have little long-term strategic logic. But better to pay the right price for a strategically weak deal than to overpay for a strategically sound one.Should AT&T snap up DirecTV, it will get 20m US subscribers. Put them together with AT&T’s 5m video customers, and there may well be some savings when it comes to programme buying. Unfortunately, satellite transmission does not lend itself to good broadband internet connections. So unlike cable TV companies such as Comcast, which have prospered by adding internet subscribers, DirecTV brings only a flat TV subscriber count (although it does have a faster-growing base of 18m Latin American subscribers).DirecTV does, however, bring $4bn of annual free cash flow. That will come in handy – in 2013 AT&T spent $38bn on acquisitions, capital expenditure, dividends and share buybacks when its cash flow from operations was just $34bn.If AT&T really wanted to capture the future of TV distribution it could buy Netflix. That would cost about $25bn, or half of DirecTV. But Netflix had no free cash flow in 2013. And therein lies the conundrum for the incumbent media titans. Their size precludes direct consolidation plays, as AT&T discovered when regulators quashed its proposed T-Mobile purchase. But buying upstarts cannot be financially justified.Wisely, AT&T this year announced it would spend $500m on “over-the-top” television delivered via the internet rather than by cable, satellite or fibre. And while AT&T investors wait for OTT to take off, they can enjoy DirecTV’s cash flows.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
308;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-05-13T16:31:41Z;AT&T and Sprint bet on regulatory change;;AT&T’s negotiations on a near-$50bn bid for DirecTV, like Sprint’s desire to buy T-Mobile US, look likely to test US regulators’ willingness to rethink traditional definitions of competition and public interest issues in the converging broadband, telecoms and video industries.AT&T’s 2011 attempt to buy T-Mobile US, its smaller mobile rival, ended in costly failure after opposition from the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice, and the company could ill-afford a second failed deal.Buying a satellite television group is less likely to provoke antitrust objections, but public interest issues and overlap in the two groups’ video businesses will still attract attention.The fact that AT&T and Sprint are again willing to contemplate such deals reflects a belief that another transaction – Comcast’s proposed $42bn acquisition of Time Warner Cable – could herald a broad regulatory reassessment of the fast-changing communications industry.Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, is among the industry leaders who have described the Comcast/TWC deal as “industry redefining”.Regulators’ caution about such deals reflects the fact that the US now has just four large mobile operators and two satellite TV companies, AT&T and Verizon control the vast bulk of fixed lines and most local markets are served by just one cable company.As US wireless growth slows, AT&T has looked at various possible acquisitions, including Vodafone of the UK. But the Comcast/TWC deal has refocused its attention on its domestic market. A deal with DirecTV would expand AT&T’s US video footprint significantly, from 6m customers to 26m.It would also help AT&T compete with Comcast, which would consolidate its position as the biggest cable TV and broadband supplier with 30m customers if its TWC deal is approved.Analysts note that acquiring DirecTV would also help AT&T offer faster broadband speeds. That matters because cable TV rivals have been stepping up download speeds and Google has been extending its Google Fibre initiative which offers speeds up to 100 times faster than the US average.However, Craig Moffett, an industry analyst at MoffettNathanson, has questioned whether buying DirecTV or Dish Network, its main US satellite TV rival, makes strategic sense for AT&T.“The best option for both [satellite TV] companies is, of course, to merge,” he wrote last week while noting that regulators blocked a proposed Dish-DirecTV merger in 2002 over antitrust concerns.Both DirecTV and Dish have explored their options in recent months, but Charlie Ergen, Dish’s chairman, conceded to analysts last week that a bid by AT&T for Direct TV appeared to make financial – if not strategic – sense.“[AT&T] would be crazy not to look at it,” he said. “We don’t have the kind of money to go outbid Sprint for T-Mobile or outbid AT&T for DirecTV,” he added, while arguing that such a bid could boost valuations of Dish’s wireless spectrum holdings.Of the regulatory backdrop, Mr Ergen said Washington would “pick winners and losers,” but cited as “good news” the fact that Barack Obama’s administration and the Federal Communications Commission “have talked a lot about competition and being in favour of competition”.Washington’s attitude towards consolidation would also be tested by any bid by Sprint, which is 80 per cent owned by Japan’s SoftBank, for T-Mobile US, the fourth-largest US mobile operator.Industry insiders say SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom, which owns 67 per cent of T-Mobile US, have been edging towards an agreement, despite regulators’ likely opposition.US regulators have indicated that they would probably oppose cutting the number of major mobile operators from four to three, but SoftBank argues that a combined Sprint-T-Mobile US would be a stronger rival to Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility, which control more than 75 per cent of the US wireless market.Like AT&T, SoftBank hopes the Comcast-TWC deal will encourage regulators to take a broader view of competition, particularly in internet access where mobile broadband has an opportunity to provide services in rural areas where fixed-line broadband does not make economic sense.Regulators have been warmer to the broadband argument, hoping that competitive pressure may also encourage AT&T and Verizon to upgrade their wireless services in rural areas.Without such a regulatory change of heart, however, AT&T and Softbank’s dealmaking efforts could struggle.
309;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;AT&T closing in on near-$50bn DirecTV bid;;AT&T is in advanced discussions with DirecTV, the largest US satellite-television provider, over a deal worth almost $50bn that would further shake up the country’s fast-changing pay-TV market.The two companies have been in on-off discussions for some time, but talks have progressed recently, according to people familiar with the matter, who said a deal was still weeks away.DirecTV has a market value of $44.5bn but AT&T is discussing a cash and stock bid of between $92 and $95 per share, these people said, implying a value of slightly below $50bn, one of the people said. The structure of the combined company’s management is still under discussion.A deal is not certain, however. The parties have previously come close to agreeing terms, only for negotiations to break down. Any deal could also face a prolonged battle to convince regulators to allow further consolidation in pay-TV.The discussions come at a time of acute change in America’s communications market, with Comcast, the country’s largest cable company, in the process of seeking regulatory approval for its $42bn agreed bid for Time Warner Cable, its closest cable rival.Sprint, the US mobile group controlled by Japan’s SoftBank, has been considering a bid for T-Mobile US, its smaller rival which is controlled by Deutsche Telekom. That bid would also challenge regulators, who are wary of letting a market with four big companies consolidate down to three.A DirecTV bid would further cool speculation of a bid by AT&T for Vodafone of the UK. Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, cautioned in March that “the window may be closing on perhaps owning wireless assets” in Europe.Acquiring DirecTV would not only give AT&T the second-largest domestic pay-TV business after Comcast, adding 6m AT&T video customers to DirecTV’s base of 20m. Analysts point out that it would also enable AT&T to move video content from its U-verse network on to DirecTV’s satellites, and ratchet up broadband speeds for its customers.“AT&T’s broadband/wireless assets help address the inability for satellite firms to deliver broadband connectivity, which seems to be increasingly becoming a competitive issue,” said Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.AT&T’s broadband/wireless assets help address the inability for satellite firms to deliver broadband connectivity, which seems to be increasingly becoming a competitive issueSome analysts had expected AT&T to have shown more interest in acquiring Dish, DirecTV’s US satellite rival, particularly since the Colorado-based company has built up a sizeable wireless spectrum portfolio.Charlie Ergen, the Dish chairman who has also been seen as a merger candidate for DirecTV, has expressed interest in entering the mobile phone business.Commenting last week during a call with analysts to discuss Dish’s first-quarter results, Mr Ergen said an AT&T-DirecTV deal made financial sense, if not strategic sense. From a financial standpoint, “they (AT&T) would be crazy not to look at it,” he said.“We don’t have the kind of money to go outbid Sprint for T-Mobile or outbid AT&T for DirecTV. And so . . . we have to be well positioned,” Mr Ergen said. “Washington will make rules and regulations and merger approvals . . . and they’ll pick winners and losers. And the good news is that the administration and the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] have talked a lot about competition and being in favour of competition.”DirecTV shares rose 6 per cent to $92.50 in extended trading on Monday. DirecTV and AT&T both declined to comment.News of AT&T’s renewed interest was reported earlier on Monday by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.
310;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-05-08T16:37:21Z;Comcast abuses market power, hearing told;;Comcast, the US’s largest cable and broadband provider by revenues, abuses its market power and its behaviour will only worsen if it is allowed to merge with Time Warner Cable, critics of the deal told US lawmakers during a hearing on the proposed transaction on Thursday.The House subcommittee on regulatory reform heard claims of Comcast dropping independent programmers and pushing for extra charges from other internet service providers as reasons why the deal should be blocked.The all-stock bid, now worth $41bn, to combine the two largest US cable operators faces tough scrutiny from regulators at the justice department and the Federal Communications Commission. A combined Comcast-TWC would control about a third of the US pay-television market while some experts estimate the merged entity would also have a 40 per cent share of the broadband sector.In April, Comcast said it would divest 3.9m subscribers as part of a $20bn deal with Charter Communications aimed at boosting its case before regulators. Comcast’s top lobbyist, David Cohen, cited the Charter deal at the hearing and emphasised that Comcast was voluntarily reducing its share below the FCC-suggested 30 per cent cap on cable ownership, even though those criteria have been rejected by US courts.“Comcast keeps its promises and plays fair,” said Mr Cohen, who reiterated that the deal would not lead to customer price increases. He added that consumers would benefit from the deal because of improved service and quality, and the merger would also allow Comcast to compete more effectively with rivals such as DirecTV, Apple and Google.Patrick Gottsch, founder and chairman of independent programmer Rural Media Group, told Congress that his experience with Comcast demonstrated the harm that a TWC merger could cause. He said Comcast dropped Rural Media’s RFD-TV channel in Colorado and New Mexico following Comcast’s merger with NBCUniversal in 2011. As a result, RFD-TV lost about 470,000 subscribers.Comcast also stopped launching RFD-TV in new markets, Mr Gottsch said. In the meantime, RFD-TV enjoys “excellent” relations with other cable operators, such as TWC, he added.“Comcast has the strength to foreclose such competition now, and will be in an even stronger position to do so following its merger with Time Warner Cable,” Mr Gottsch said.One entity controlling access to so many of America’s ‘captive eyeballs’ should immediately raise red flagsMr Cohen said consumers in New Mexico wanted more high-definition programming from the Smithsonian channel and others, which is why RFD-TV was dropped. But Comcast carries about 160 independent programmers, including RFD-TV, in other markets for around 700,000 customers.Dave Schaeffer, chief executive of internet service provider Cogent Communications, said his company’s experience with Comcast reflected the power it wielded. Cogent interconnects with other ISPs, such as Comcast, for free in what are known as peering arrangements so customers can connect to the entire internet.When Cogent began carrying Netflix original programming, such as House of Cards, in 2012, Comcast refused to increase capacity to handle the jump in traffic, leading to delays and granular pictures, according to Mr Schaeffer. To fix the congestion, Comcast for the first time demanded that Cogent enter into a commercial relationship to pay additional fees, which Cogent refused.“One entity controlling access to so many of America’s ‘captive eyeballs’ should immediately raise red flags,” Mr Schaeffer said.
311;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;NBC pays $7.75bn to extend Olympics deal;;NBCUniversal, the US media group owned by Comcast, has agreed to pay $7.75bn for a 12-year extension to its deal to broadcast the Olympics, keeping the rights until 2032.The agreement with the International Olympic Committee includes a $100m “signing bonus” to be used for the promotion of “Olympism” and Olympic values between 2015 and 2020.The deal maintains NBC’s decades-long relationship with the IOC: the network first broadcast the Olympics in 1964 and has held the US rights exclusively since 1988.The IOC did not offer an open tender for the rights, preferring to negotiate exclusively with Comcast.Thomas Bach, IOC president, said the extension was first discussed at a dinner with Comcast executives in New York, adding that the organisation did not want to “take any risk” with a competitive auction.“We are sure that the Olympic Games will be presented in a way that the Olympic spirit requires, and how we see it. Then it was a question to find the right balance with the financial commitment and from the fact that we have signed this agreement today, you can see we have found this balance.”The long-term agreement comes only three years after Comcast won the rights to four games up to 2020, when it outbid rival offers from CBS, ESPN and Fox, paying $4.38bn.The deal, Mr Bach added, “would help ensure the financial stability and security of the Olympic movement”.The London and Sochi Olympics . . . each posted record performance [which] gave us confidence to make this investmentBrian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, said the company had “only begun to scratch the surface” of what it could achieve with Olympics broadcasting. Steve Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, said the deal was “one of the most important days in the history” of the network.Mr Roberts pointed to the London Olympics of 2012 and the recent Winter Olympics in Sochi to explain why the company moved swiftly to lock up rights to future games.“The London and Sochi Olympics . . . each posted record performance [which] gave us confidence to make this investment,” he said.The Sochi games were a boost to Comcast’s recent quarterly earnings, generating revenues from Olympics-related advertising of $1.1bn.NBC added more hours of coverage during the London and Sochi games, showing the events on its portfolio of cable networks as well as its main broadcast channel. Rio de Janeiro will host the summer games in 2016 while in 2018 the winter games will be held in Pyeongchang in South Korea. Tokyo recently won the right to host the summer games of 2020 but the hosts for Olympics after that year have not yet been decided.

The fourth-largest US mobile carrier swung to a loss of $151m, or 19 cents per share, compared to a profit of $107m a year earlier.Sales jumped 47 per cent from the year earlier to $6.9bn.“A year ago I promised that we would bring change to what I called this arrogant US wireless industry,” chief executive John Legere said. “We are delivering on that promise and our results reflect the growing customer revolution that we’ve ignited.”Shares in the company were also lifted by reports Sprint had approached several investment banks in its bid to purchase T-Mobile. The company, majority-owned by Japan’s SoftBank, is expected to tap bond markets for what could be a $50bn price for its smaller rival.T-Mobile shares climbed more than 8 per cent to close at $31.68, while Sprint rose 2.7 per cent to $8.73.Monthly sales reports from carmakers offered investors a fresh perspective of the underlying US economy, with the vast majority reporting better than expected sales gains.Sales at Toyota rose 13.3 per cent from a year earlier while sales at General Motors climbed 6.9 per cent. Both figures topped Wall Street expectations. Chrysler’s sales, which fell shy of expectations, jumped 14 per cent from a year earlier.“Retail demand was steady in April, and truck sales and transaction prices were especially strong,” said Kurt McNeil, GM vice-president of US sales. “As we expected, the economy continues to strengthen.”Sales at Ford dipped 1 per cent from a year earlier in April, one of the few automakers to report a decline. Newer products from Jeep, Dodge and Chevrolet have made trouble for Ford particularly acute.The second-largest US carmaker will roll out an update to its best-selling vehicle later this year – the F-150.Shares in Ford fell 1.5 per cent to $15.91. GM rose 1.2 per cent to $34.90 and Toyota also advanced 1.2 per cent to close at $109.70 in New York.DirecTV, a satellite television operator, has been approached about a possible takeover by US phone company AT&T, the Wall Street Journal reported.The report, which valued the deal at $40bn, sent DirecTV shares 4.1 per cent higher to $80.76, while those of AT&T fell less 0.3 per cent to $35.58.A combination of the two companies would present a bigger challenge to Comcast, whose proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable will make it the biggest provider of TV and internet access in the US. Together, DirecTV and AT&T serve roughly 26m subscribers across the country.Vodafone, often consider a potential acquisition target for AT&T, fell following the report, its shares ending 1.8 per cent lower at $37.28.Overall, US equity markets inched higher ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls report, which will shed some light on hiring trends after a brutal winter. Separate reports out on Thursday pointed to an acceleration in manufacturing activity, as well as rising wages and spending.“[The data] suggest solid momentum in underlying goods and services spending going into Q2 2014, and we project another 3 per cent increase in consumer spending on the quarter,” Barclays US economist Dean Maki said, referring to the income and spending figures.The benchmark S&P 500 was little changed at 1,883.68 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1 per cent lower to close at 16,558.87. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent at 4,127.45.
313;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;US cable: strange bedfellows;Charter is finally getting a bite of cable assets it can properly chew;Charter Communications is getting another bite at the apple. This time it’s safe to chew. On Monday it said it would snare 4m cable TV subscribers that are up for grabs as part of the Comcast/Time Warner Cable tie-up announced in February. Charter lost out to Comcast back then. But the demands of antitrust authorities breed strange bedfellows. To win regulatory approval (Comcast/TWC will still have nearly a third of the US cable market) Comcast needs Charter’s help. Whatever bitterness that Charter held towards Comcast for snatching TWC first should now subside. Charter’s shares are up nearly a fifth since rumours of this latest deal broke 10 days ago.After the multiple stages of its deal with Comcast/TWC, Charter will own or manage 8m cable subscribers, about double its current level. The first two steps are straightforward: Charter pays $7bn to acquire 1.4m former TWC customers and, separately, the two sides exchange 1.6m subscribers to better line up their respective regional exposures.The next part of the deal is more intriguing. Comcast/TWC will create a new public company for housing 2.6m subscribers. This company would initially be two-thirds owned by Comcast shareholders, and the rest by Charter (which will also manage the subscribers). The new company will have relatively high leverage of 5 times debt to cash flow, around the same as Charter and more than twice the level of Comcast. Thus, investors interested in US cable can choose between highly-leveraged bets (Charter and the new SpinCo) or the moderately-indebted Comcast.Clever structures aside, it is not obvious why this deal will assuage regulators. Comcast becomes an only somewhat smaller juggernaut. And Charter becomes the ironic cheerleader for Comcast, which stole the object of its affection.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
314;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-04-28T17:46:44Z;$20bn Comcast deal may not sway regulators;;Comcast’s $20bn deal with Charter Communications to divest 3.9m subscribers is not likely to change the odds that regulators clear its $41bn deal for Time Warner Cable but it puts Comcast in a better light for showing a willingness to compromise, say people familiar with the matter.Announced on Monday, the Charter agreement is contingent on regulators approving a tie-up that would give Comcast-TWC control of about a third of the US pay television and broadband markets.Comcast had said it was prepared to shed 3m subscribers when announcing its bid for TWC in February, the second-largest US cable operator.The Comcast-TWC merger is expected to face tough scrutiny by the Department of Justice, which is reviewing it for antitrust issues, and the Federal Communications Commission, which considers the public interest. The House judiciary committee will also conduct a hearing.“Regulators weren’t going to settle for arm-waving about divestitures. They need to be able to review concrete details about which systems need to be divested and where,” said Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson Research. “This checks the box with respect to completeness of the application. That is all it really does.”A US court of appeals has twice rejected FCC attempts to impose a 30 per cent cap on cable ownership. Therefore, Comcast’s deal to give up enough subscribers to fall below 30 per cent is seen as more of a good-faith gesture which could be a good starting point for negotiations, people familiar with the matter said.It also makes Charter a stronger competitor in cable, potentially easing antitrust concerns. Regulators would probably impose additional conditions to approve the TWC deal, but Comcast is showing its willingness to compromise by striking the agreement with Charter, the people said.Comcast has also said it would abide by the FCC’s net neutrality rules, even though those standards were rejected by the courts in January. The agency has proposed new rules that it hopes fits the court’s criteria.“This is definitely a sign of good faith that they are not trying to monopolise the industry,” said Amy Yong, a Macquarie analyst.February 2014: Comcast has ended a six-month battle to consolidate the fragmented US pay-TV market.The three-part transaction is one of the largest subscriber swaps in US cable history and would transform the country’s pay-TV and broadband infrastructure, doubling Charter’s footprint to create the country’s second-largest cable operator behind Comcast.First, Charter would acquire 1.4m TWC video subscribers for $7.3bn in cash. Second, the two companies would swap 1.6m TWC video subscribers and 1.6m Charter video subscribers. Finally, Comcast would spin-off about 2.5m video subscribers into a new company, of which Charter would acquire about 33 per cent.“This transaction today gives federal, state and local regulatory bodies early identification of our divestiture process, which we believe should be helpful in our efforts to gain approval for our merger with Time Warner Cable,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive.Critics said Monday’s announcement did little to allay concerns that Comcast would have unprecedented market power to raise prices and control the development of TV, broadband and media.Randy Falco, chief executive of Hispanic broadcaster Univision and a former NBC executive, blasted the deal for eliminating competition and said it would be bad for Hispanic audiences.“The fact is that there is not one other media or telecommunications company that has the level of vertical integration of Comcast – I’m talking about video, broadband and content – not Google, not AT&T, not Facebook, not the satellite providers,” he said. “And when it comes to video and broadband, they are by far and away the largest provider in the country.”“We’ve known from the day that the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal was announced that Comcast intended to divest some subscribers, so this doesn’t change anything,” added Democratic senator Al Franken. “The fact remains that Comcast will have unprecedented power in the television and broadband markets, and I’m very concerned that Comcast will use that power to squeeze competitors and consumers.”Michael Copps, a former Democratic member of the FCC who now serves as a special adviser to Common Cause’s media and democracy reform initiative, said: “It is still way too big, way too much, and I am still of the opinion that the deal should be clearly and promptly shut down.”A Comcast spokesman said: “Comcast has had an extraordinary, long-standing commitment to Hispanic programming, and through the transaction with Time Warner Cable we are committed to bringing high-quality Hispanic content to millions of additional Americans.”At the close Comcast shares were up 1.4 per cent at $51.70. Charter shares were up 7.7 per cent to $140.05.The transaction, which involves subscribers mostly in the Midwest and southeastern US, values the assets at about 7.125 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation – below the 7.9 multiple for Comcast’s TWC deal.Comcast stressed the deal would preserve the $1.5bn in cost savings and broader strategic rationale it had outlined for its TWC deal.“This already is more than what they were expecting to give up,” Ms Yong said. “If they give up more, there will be some investor concerns on the $1.5bn in synergies they have outlined.”
315;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-04-27T15:50:43Z;Social media not yet a ‘game changer’ for boosting TV viewership;;Twitter and Facebook may need to roll out a new sales pitch.The two social networks have spent the past year trumpeting a virtuous cycle between people watching television and using social media. But, in spite of the buzz, NBCUniversal’s head of research Alan Wurtzel says that social media “is not a game changer yet” in influencing television viewing.The statement is based on media habits observed during the Sochi Winter Olympics. Comcast’s NBCU held exclusive media rights for the Games in the US, airing more than 1,500 hours of coverage across both broadcast and cable television, the web and mobile. That amount of transmission time offered the broadcaster a valuable opportunity to investigate the future of media behaviours, said Mr Wurtzel.NBCU had expected social media to have a dominating effect on viewership for the Games. However, during the 18-day period of coverage, just 19 per cent of Olympic viewers posted about the games on social media, the broadcaster found. Mr Wurtzel said that a show’s ratings are more likely to drive activity on social media rather than vice versa.“A lot of people want to show that they are on the cutting edge. One of the things that is on the cutting edge is social media,” Mr Wurtzel said. “Why wouldn’t I want to say to you, ‘We have a potent new way in which we can drive ratings?’But “it just isn’t true”, he added. “I am saying the emperor wears no clothes. It is what it is. These are the numbers.”The social media activity pales in comparison to the average 21m viewers who tuned in for prime time coverage of the game on broadcast television, Mr Wurtzel said.On Twitter, there were 10.6m Olympic-related messages posted by 3m unique users. A total of 23m people saw tweets about the Olympics. On Facebook, about 20m people posted, commented, shared or liked something related to the Olympics, with those posts reaching a total of 150m users.Ad executives cautioned that the results could be skewed by the fact that the Olympics draws mass audiences who are likely to tune in regardless of social media buzz.21m – average viewers who tuned in for prime time coverage on broadcast TV10.6m – Olympic-related tweets20m – People who posted Olympics-related content on FacebookMore niche programming, such as dramas or reality television programmes, could show more correlations between social media activity and viewership, says Kate Sirkin, global research director at Publicis’ Starcom MediaVest Group, which last year committed to hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising spend on Twitter over several years.The findings come on the heels of a separate study that found that about one in six times a person is watching prime time television they are simultaneously using social media.However, about half of that social media activity was not related to the programme on the screen, according to the Council for Research Excellence, an independent research group created and funded by Nielsen.Twitter and Facebook have been pushing to capture a piece of the $236bn global television advertising budget by positioning their networks as a complement to television programming and commercials. Yet, media and marketing executives say that researching the connection between social media and television programming remains a work in progress.However, Twitter has pushed new advertising products that link ads on television to promotions on its site, for example, by targeting people on Twitter who are likely to have seen the commercials on television. And early results show that such targeted campaigns can increase the effectiveness of television commercials, Ms Sirkin said.“When someone is reached by both messages, the Twitter piece allows them to go deeper,” Ms Sirkin says.
316;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-04-26T20:07:16Z;Comcast and Charter poised to agree $20bn cable subscriber deal;;"Comcast and Charter Communications are close to agreeing an intricate deal that would reshape the US pay-TV market and draw a line under a lengthy power-struggle at the top of the cable industry.The transaction, which has a total value of about $20bn, is contingent on Comcast being granted regulatory approval for its proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable, the country’s third largest cable company with about 12m subscribers.The three-part deal, which could be announced as early as next week, involves Comcast, the US’ largest cable operator, divesting 3.9m subscribers, or about 18 per cent of its 22m subscriber network, according to people familiar with the matter.First, Comcast would sell Charter about 1.4m subscribers from TWC’s network; it would also place 2.5m subscribers in a new company in which Charter will own a roughly 35 per cent stake. Finally, Charter and Comcast would swap about 1.65m subscribers.It is unclear exactly which subscribers will be swapped or the exact geographies under discussion. The swap would be one of the largest ever in the US cable industry.The FT previously reported that discussions were ongoing over a deal.If the three-part deal is agreed, it would mark a victory of sorts for Charter, the company backed by cable industry veteran John Malone, which was thwarted in its attempt to buy TWC in February after Comcast’s bid emerged.A combined Comcast-TWC would supply up to 40 per cent of US households with high-speed internet access. In a gambit designed to mitigate an immediate backlash from regulators, Comcast said it was prepared to shed 3m subscribers at the time of announcing the deal.The all-share deal has fallen in value since it was announced from $45.2bn, or $158.82 a share, as Comcast’s stock price has declined.At the time of the deal, relations between Comcast and Charter were said by people close to the companies to be severely impaired. Charter had pursued its $132.50 per share bid for TWC on its belief that Comcast had ruled itself out of the running.Comcast executives made contact with their Charter peers in the days after the company made its offer public, but the talks over the subscription sales only started recently, according to people familiar with the matter.Comcast and Charter declined to comment."
317;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Why net neutrality no longer works;ISPs should be allowed to create a ‘fast lane’ on the web;"When the internet was invented 25 years ago, one of the core principles set by its founders was a level playing field for content providers, whether large or small. Indeed, one of the reasons why the world wide web has been a roaring success is that data move at the same speed across the network, irrespective of who is sending or receiving.But the internet today is very different from the one of 1989. The web pioneers could not have imagined the exponential growth in data traffic over the period. Video on demand, online gaming, peer-to-peer file-sharing and videoconferencing all compete to deliver content alongside the basic dispatch of emails. Networks have as a result become increasingly congested.The growing blockage explains why one of the ideals of the internet – “net neutrality” – is being called into question. According to this principle, internet service providers such as Verizon or Comcast must not be allowed to discriminate over what content is sent over their networks. They must treat all sources equally.But ISPs argue that, given rising congestion, net neutrality is now unworkable. They have long maintained that they should be able to charge content providers such as, say, Netflix and Skype, for preferential access to the network. This would boost the ISPs’ revenues but it would also guarantee reliable connections for customers using major services.This week the US Federal Communications Commission looked set to propose changes that favour the ISPs. It wants to allow them to give favoured access to bandwidth if made available on “commercially reasonable” terms. This would allow ISPs to charge content providers for access to a fast lane across the internet.At the same time, the FCC looks set to introduce compensating measures to preserve some elements of an open internet. These would forbid ISPs from deliberately blocking or slowing access to any legal website; and improve transparency over the information given by ISPs on the broadband speeds they provide.This was always going to be difficult terrain for the FCC. Internet purists, including Sir Tim Berners-Lee, one of the inventors of the web, contend that any compromise on net neutrality will spell the end of the internet as we know it. Any compromise also implies shifting away from a pledge by President Barack Obama to keep the internet open.The ISPs, for their part, say that without the power to provide preferential services to leading content providers, they will not gain the revenues needed to invest in future broadband infrastructure. They say such investment is essential, given the insatiable demand for more bandwidth.Now the FCC has found a good compromise. Like all industries that sell a fixed resource, price is the best way to ration demand to those who value it most. If customers are willing to pay more for a premium service, as they do with mobile phone contracts or business class travel, then they ought to have the right to do so.The fine detail of the FCC’s decision will matter. The regulator will have to ensure its reforms do not create barriers to entry for small and innovative companies – the internet giants of the future. The risks of permitting discrimination will also need to be managed. Competition must be maintained – a particular concern given the FCC’s failure to unbundle provision of internet services over the last mile.However, the FCC’s broad reform of net neutrality is the right one. An internet that remains completely neutral will ultimately be stymied. The FCC should now focus on how to encourage the innovation and investment that are critical if the web is to be as successful in the next 25 years as it has been in the past quarter-century.——————————————-Letters in response to this editorial:FCC’s fast lane will squeeze out new entrants / From Mr Martyn RoetterToo early to announce the death of net neutrality / From Mr Jim Russell"
318;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T19:53:04+0000;FCC accused of violating net neutrality;;A US government agency staunchly defended new “net neutrality” rules to be proposed on Thursday, after critics blasted the measures for violating open internet policies and disadvantaging small entrepreneurs.The US Federal Communications Commission is proposing new rules that would allow internet service providers to charge companies such as Netflix and YouTube more to reach consumers at higher speeds or quality, but only if they meet a new standard of “commercial reasonableness” that will be judged by the FCC.After two successful court challenges, this is the agency’s third attempt to propose rules that uphold net neutrality, the principle that requires all internet traffic to be treated equally. The criticisms of the new rules reflect the challenges the FCC faces in crafting measures that would satisfy public interest groups, survive a court challenge and avoid a turf war with other regulators.“The FCC is inviting ISPs to pick winners and losers online,” said Michael Weinberg, vice-president of Public Knowledge, a group that advocates openness on the internet. “The very essence of a “commercial reasonableness” standard is discrimination. And the core of net neutrality is non discrimination. This is not net neutrality.”Public interest groups like Public Knowledge urged the FCC to stick to its original stance of preventing ISPs from charging for faster access to customers, which would promote equal treatment of small businesses trying to reach consumers online. They said the FCC should use its authority to reclassify ISPs as common telecommunications carriers, which would allow the agency to enforce net neutrality.But that move would likely create opposition from the Federal Trade Commission, which could see the reclassification as encroaching on its ability to protect competition and consumer privacy among ISPs. The FTC, which does not have jurisdiction over common carriers, has told the FCC in the past that it would oppose a reclassification, according to people familiar with the matter.An FCC official denied the agency was reversing its position, saying it had never suggested a blanket no-discrimination measure, but instead prohibited unreasonable discrimination. Because a US court rejected that foundation but suggested the FCC could impose rules based on the commercially reasonable standard, the agency was proposing measure that could finally be enforceable, the official said.“There are reports that the FCC is gutting the open internet rule,” said Tom Wheeler, FCC chairman. “They are flat-out wrong. There is no ‘turnaround in policy’. The same rules will apply to all internet content.” He added that behaviour that harms consumers would be prohibited.The new rules could usher in tiered broadband pricing sooner than expected, which could result in additional revenues for ISPs and also help content providers like Netflix provide additional offerings and better quality service, according to a Barclays research note.Under the new proposal, ISPs would be able to enter into individual agreements to charge content companies for preferential treatment to reach customers at higher speeds. But they must meet a new “commercial reasonableness” criteria that would be determined by the FCC on a case-by-case basis.Broadband providers would still be required to provide a base level of service to subscribers, and the FCC would still prohibit discrimination or blocking of websites under the new rules.In February, broadband provider Comcast reached a landmark agreement with Netflix to charge the content company an undisclosed fee to reach Comcast consumers at faster speeds.Since then, Netflix has been criticising Comcast’s bid to take over Time Warner Cable, which would create the largest cable and broadband provider in the US. Netflix says the merger would give Comcast too much power over internet access in the US.Comcast has said the TWC deal would improve customer service, including internet access, and Netflix’s opposition is based on inaccurate claims.The FCC will vote on the draft measures at a meeting on May 15. If approved, the commission will then seek public comment on the plans before finalising them.In January, a US court sided with Verizon Communications and said the FCC overstepped its authority in imposing net neutrality rules, but upheld the agency’s ability to regulate certain practices of ISPs, including how they manage traffic. The FCC said in February it planned to propose new rules instead of appealing the court’s decision.
319;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-04-24T15:03:16Z;Time Warner Cable chief defends merger plan with Comcast;;Time Warner Cable’s chief executive defended the cable operator’s proposed merger with industry leader Comcast as the “best way to maximise value for shareholders”.His comments come after the value of the all-stock deal has dropped to less than $40bn from $45.2bn since it was announced, following declines in Comcast’s stock price.Rob Marcus, Time Warner Cable’s chief executive, said that the combination of the two largest cable operators in the US should create the most value in the long term, pointing to the fact that Time Warner Cable shareholders will own about 23 per cent of the combined company.“We don’t get terribly hung up by the fact that share prices move around from day to day,” he said during a conference call. “I have full confidence in the decision we made.”Mr Marcus noted that the regulatory approval for the tie-up, which would control about a third of the US pay-TV and broadband markets, was going as planned and that the integration process between the two companies was going better than expected.The comments came as Time Warner Cable reported that net income increased 19 per cent in the first quarter to $479m, compared to the same period last year. Total revenues rose 2 per cent to $5.6bn in the first quarter from the same period last year, driven by growth in the business services group offset by declines in its residential offerings.Costs related to its proposed merger with Comcast totalled $62m in the first quarter, with $29m for employee retention costs and $33m for advisory and legal fees.The cable operator is in the midst of executing on a three-year plan to revive its business, which executives outlined in January before Comcast later emerged with its bid. After three years of falling video subscriber numbers, the company pledged to return to growth through improving its poorly rated customer service and implementing new technologies.“The priorities we outlined on our fourth-quarter call are no less relevant today than they were before we agreed to merge with Comcast. We have not taken our eye off the ball as a result of the announcement,” Mr Marcus said. “By the time we close our do with Comcast, Time Warner Cable will be in the best shape ever.”The priorities we outlined on our fourth-quarter call are no less relevant today than they were before we agreed to merge with Comcast. We have not taken our eye off the ball as a result of the announcement. By the time we close our do with Comcast, Time Warner Cable will be in the best shape everIn the first quarter of the year, Time Warner Cable put the brakes on subscribers losses. The company lost 34,000 video subscribers during the first quarter of the year, compared to a loss of 119,000 video subscribers during the same period in 2013.Fuelled by growth in broadband subscribers, Time Warner Cable gained an addition of 148,000 total customer relationships for the quarter, the most in more than seven years. Even so, revenues in residential services declined, dragged down by decreases in video and voice revenues.“Time Warner Cable is playing for pride now,” said Craig Moffett, an industry analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. “The company’s first-quarter results reveal cause for both optimism, pride almost, and caution. Subscriber trends are improving, but there remains a steep hill of profitability for TWC to climb. Comcast’s deal presumes, and pays TWC shareholders for, the fix. Nobody said it would be easy.”News emerged last week that Comcast and Time Warner Cable were in talks with Charter over a deal involving between 3m to 5m subscribers, worth about $20bn, to allay Washington concerns about the proposed merger. Earlier, Charter had pursued a hostile $132.50 per share bid of TWC.
320;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Pace positions itself for video streaming;;The revival of Pace, the maker of television set-top boxes that has overcome a range of problems in recent years, picked up steam on Thursday as the company reported a continuing boost in profit margins and said it was on track to meet its revenue target of $2.7bn in 2014.The Yorkshire-based FTSE 250 group has benefited as its former rivals, including Cisco and Google, have wavered in their commitment to cable TV hardware at a time when more consumers are choosing to watch video via internet streaming services such as Netflix.Pace’s biggest customers are cable providers in the US such as Comcast, DirecTV and AT&T.The company said operating margins would rise from 7.8 per cent in 2013 to 8.5 per cent this year. The improvement is due to cost-cutting measures including outsourced manufacturing and the January acquisition of Aurora, a higher-margin US business that helps cable broadcasters allocate and expand the amount of data they can provide to consumers.“Pace has made a good start to the new financial year. Forecast demand for both current and new products is building as the year progresses,” said chairman Allan Leighton at the group’s annual general meeting.Free cash flow was expected to be $185m, down from $209m last year.Nick James, analyst at Numis, said: “Pace are well-placed as the leaders in the status quo of cable, but they’re mitigating their risks of disruption by building their software and infrastructure business.”With the Aurora acquisition, and the expansion beyond set-top boxes into software and hardware that help companies offer combined cable and internet services across multiple devices, Pace is trying to position itself for a market in which more video is streamed online, analysts say.Even so, the onward march of internet-based devices such as Amazon’s Fire TV and Apple’s TV are the biggest risks to the business over the long term. Amazon recently struck a deal with HBO, the cable and satellite television network, to stream its shows, including hit series such as The Sopranos and The Wire, to its US customers. In results announced on Wednesday, Apple said its TV business now generated sales of more than $1bn.By comparison, Pace’s sales of set-top boxes and media servers hit $1.98bn in 2013, accounting for 80 per cent of its sales.Shares in the company jumped as much as 5 per cent on Thursday morning before settling down to a slight gain at mid-afternoon.
321;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-04-23T22:25:18Z;FCC shifts stance on net neutrality rules;;New US “net neutrality” rules will be proposed on Thursday that would allow internet service providers to charge companies such as Netflix and YouTube more to reach consumers at higher speeds or quality, but only under certain circumstances.The Federal Communications Commission had originally opposed such charges for faster access, in an effort to require that ISPs treat all traffic equally, but a US court ruled three months ago that the regulator had overstepped its authority after a legal challenge from Verizon Communications.Tom Wheeler, FCC chairman, will hand out a draft of the proposed new rules to other commissioners on Thursday, before a vote at the regulator’s May 15 meeting. If approved, the commission will then seek public comment on the plans before finalising them.In January, the US court of appeals upheld the FCC’s authority in some areas to regulate practices of ISPs, including how they manage traffic. The FCC said in February it planned to propose new rules instead of appealing the court’s decision.Under the new proposal, internet service providers could charge content companies for preferential treatment to reach customers at higher speeds, but only on “commercially reasonable” terms. The FCC would decide whether the terms were acceptable on a case-by-case basis.“Broadband providers would be required to offer a baseline level of service to their subscribers, along with the ability to enter into individual negotiations with content providers,” the FCC said.What the baseline level of service should be and the specific standards for what would be deemed “commercially reasonable” are some of the topics that will be subject to public comment.Other net neutrality proponents have argued that no preferential treatment should be allowed under any circumstances. The FCC would still prohibit discrimination or blocking of web sites, and require broadband providers to make additional disclosure on internet traffic under the proposed rules.The debate over net neutrality rules has come up in cable company Comcast’s move to take over Time Warner Cable, which would create a giant in the US broadband market. Netflix has come out against the merger, which faces tough antitrust scrutiny, because it says the combined company would have too much control over internet access in the US.Comcast has said Netflix’s opposition is based on inaccurate claims. Comcast needs approval from the FCC and the US Department of Justice, among other regulators.In February, Netflix and Comcast struck a landmark deal in which Netflix would pay Comcast an undisclosed fee for faster access to Comcast customers. But since then, Netflix has become more vocal in its opposition to the Comcast-TWC deal.The Wall Street Journal reported on the FCC’s new rules on Wednesday.
322;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast defies fears to lift cable subscribers;Earnings ease ‘cord-cutting’ fears as Comcast negotiates to sell 4m subscribers to clear the path for its $40bn offer for Time Warner Cable;"Comcast has defied fears about viewers cancelling their cable TV subscriptions by increasing its customer numbers for the second consecutive quarter.The cable, phone and internet company – which has made a $40bn offer for Time Warner Cable– beat Wall Street earnings estimates in first quarter of 2014, thanks to an improved performance at its NBCUniversal unit, growth in its business services division, and a strong performance from its high-speed internet group.Pay TV operators have been increasingly fretting about “cord-cutting” – viewers cancelling expensive television subscriptions – particularly among younger people who can now choose cheaper online alternatives, such as Netflix and Hulu.However, Comcast added a net 24,000 subscribers during the quarter, as well as 383,000 high-speed internet customers. Comcast plans to offload as many as 4m subscribers following its proposed $40bn acquisition of Time Warner Cable in a two-stage deal worth $18bn-$20bn, a person familiar with the situation confirmed.The company in is in talks to sell 1.5m subscribers to Charter Communications, which Comcast outbid for Time Warner Cable. The remaining 2.5m subscribers would be spun out into a new public company, this person said.The divestiture will help ease regulatory concerns about the Time Warner Cable purchase while funds raised in the sale would go towards reducing Comcast's debt burden and into the company's share buyback programme.Michael Angelakis, Comcast's chief financial officer, told an earnings call that ""cash proceeds . . . can be used for return of capital to Comcast shareholders"".Comcast also scored with its line-up of programming from NBCUniversal, with shows such as The Voice, The Blacklist and The Tonight Show drawing audiences and advertisers. Its Universal movie studio also had a good quarter, aided by the box office performance of hits such as Lone Survivor and Ride Along.Advertising revenues at NBCUniversal almost doubled, thanks to the impact of the Sochi Winter Olympics, which the network covered exclusively in the US. The games generated $1.1bn of revenues for Comcast. NBCUniversal, which also owns cable channels, generated total revenues of $6.88bn, compared with $5.34bn in the comparable quarter.Excluding the Winter Olympics, NBCUniversal revenues were up 8 per cent to $5.77bn.Across Comcast, revenues increased from $15.3bn to $17.4bn, while net income rose from $1.43bn to $1.87bn. Earnings per share were $0.71, compared with $0.54 last time.However, Comcast’s bid for Time Warner Cable has begun to run into criticism, with Netflix this week calling for regulators to block the deal because it was not “in the public interest”.“If the Comcast and Time Warner Cable merger is approved, the combined company’s footprint will pass over 60 per cent of US broadband households . . . with most of those homes having Comcast as the only option for truly high-speed broadband,” Netflix’s chief executive Reed Hastings wrote on MondayComcast hit back, saying Netflix’s opposition was based on “inaccurate claims and arguments”.On Tuesday, Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, sounded a positive note about the Time Warner Cable deal. “The more planning we do for our proposed merger with Time Warner Cable, the more excited we are by the opportunities for the combined company,” he said.This story has been changed to amend the number of new subscribers from 25,000 to 24,000"
323;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Netflix trades barbs over Comcast’s TWC deal;;Netflix has traded barbs with Comcast over the cable company’s $40bn takeover of Time Warner Cable in a sign of potential hurdles in the path of a deal that faces scrutiny from antitrust authorities.Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, used a quarterly earnings letter to outline the company’s opposition to the deal, claiming it would give Comcast too much control of high-speed internet provision in the US.“If the Comcast and Time Warner Cable merger is approved, the combined company’s footprint will pass over 60 per cent of US broadband households …with most of those homes having Comcast as the only option for truly high-speed broadband,” he wrote. “We respectfully think it’s not in the public interest to have one company control a majority of US residential internet [provision],” he told the FT. “Our view is that the best remedy is to block the merger.”Comcast hit back, saying in a statement that Netflix’s opposition was based on “inaccurate claims and arguments”. Netflix claimed in the earnings letter that the combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable would “possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers”.Netflix recently struck a deal with Comcast to pay the cable group an undisclosed fee for “interconnection” – effectively connecting its streaming film and television service with Comcast’s internet network to ensure faster access. It later accused Comcast and other big internet providers of using their “market position” to impose tolls for access to their networks, hindering online video operators’ ability to provide a quality service.Netflix has raised concerns about the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal hindering “net neutrality” – the principle that ensures telecoms groups and internet providers charge the same rates for data and content services regardless of the amount of data being downloaded or streamed.Netflix is free to express its opinions. But they should be factually based“Netflix is free to express its opinions,” Comcast said in its statement. “But they should be factually based. And Netflix should be transparent that its opinion is not about protecting the consumer or about net neutrality. Rather, it’s about improving Netflix’s business model by shifting costs that it has always borne to all users of the internet and not just to Netflix customers.”Mr Hastings’ comments on Monday came as Netflix revealed its subscriber base had grown to more than 48m, with 4m people joining its service during the quarter.It added that it planned to increase the price of its monthly subscriptions. “Our current view is to do a one or two-dollar increase, depending on the country, later this quarter for new members only,” said Mr Hastings. US subscription is currently $7.99 per month.Monthly payments for existing members would stay the same for a “generous time period”, he added.Netflix expects subscriber growth to slow in the second quarter, in line with previous years and seasonal trends. It expects its international business to be profitable by the end of the fiscal year but said it would plough those profits into new territories.The company is known to be looking at launching a service in France and Germany. Netflix already operates in Canada, the UK, Ireland and Latin America, as well as the US.“We are approaching 50m global members, but that is far short of HBO’s 130m,” wrote Mr Hastings, referring to the Time Warner-owned premium cable network. “We are eager to close the gap.”Netflix subscriptions have been boosted by the company’s original series, such as the second series of House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey, and Orange is the New Black.February 2014: Comcast has ended a six-month battle to consolidate the fragmented US pay-TV market.Revenues for the quarter rose to $1.27bn, compared with $1.02bn in the comparable quarter last time. Net income increased from $2.7m to $53.1m. Earnings per share rose from $0.05 to $0.86.Comcast’s proposed takeover of TWC has also angered Charter Communications, the cable TV operator in which John Malone’s Liberty Media owns a 27 per cent stake.Charter had hoped to acquire TWC and spent months pursuing it. It recently filed legal documents contesting the proposed merger, claiming that the deal had been subject to a “flawed process”.Netflix shares were up close to 6 per cent to $368 in after-market trading.
324;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-04-18T18:50:20Z;Comcast and Time Warner in talks to sell subscribers to Charter;;Comcast and Time Warner Cable have entered negotiations to hive off cable assets worth up to $20bn in a deal with Charter Communications that aims to allay Washington’s concerns about their proposed merger.Comcast and TWC have held talks with Charter about a deal involving between 3m and 5m subscribers during recent days, according to people familiar with the matter.The options include the straight sale of subscribers and a scenario where Comcast and TWC spin off subscriptions into a new company and sell Charter a substantial minority stake. A combination of the two is also under consideration.The discussions are at an early stage and no deal is certain, the people cautioned.A deal to buy the subscriptions would mark a big victory for Charter, the company backed by cable industry veteran John Malone, which was thwarted in its attempt to buy TWC in February after Comcast emerged with a surprise bid. TWC has roughly 12m subscribers.The all-share deal has fallen in value since it was announced from $45.2bn, or $158.82 a share, to less than $40bn as Comcast’s stock price has declined. The combined group would have 33m subscribers and supply up to 40 per cent of US households with high-speed internet access.In a gambit designed to mitigate an immediate backlash from regulators, Comcast said it was prepared to sell 3m subscribers at the time of announcing the deal. Comcast’s chief financial officer said that the 3m subscribers would be worth at least $17bn.At the time of the deal, relations between Comcast and Charter were said by people close to the two companies to be severely impaired. Charter had pursued its $132.50 per share bid for TWC on the basis that it believed Comcast had ruled itself out of the running.Comcast executives made contact with their Charter peers in the days after the company made its offer public, but the talks over the subscription sales only started recently, according to people familiar with the matter.Industry observers have speculated that it is likely that Comcast will give up more than the 3m subscribers it had offered in attempts to clear the deal with regulators.“Once you offer something up, you only offer more up, you don’t offer less up. It is the starting point of the negotiations,” said Amy Yong, an industry analyst with Macquarie.“There is nothing legally that requires them to give up the 3m subscribers as the deal stands,” she added.Ms Yong noted the subscribers that Comcast will probably give up could come from the footprints of both Comcast and Time Warner Cable and that they are not likely to be from the top metro areas, such as New York City and Los Angeles.The subscriber sale negotiations come just days after Comcast and TWC outlined the arguments for their proposed merger before regulators. Comcast is the largest provider of high-speed internet services to US households.
325;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T17:44:25+0000;Business and state are kept apart for good reason;Adventurismfree-wheeling, can be excellent in a start-upcompany, but is a menace in a democratically accountable republic;Whatever ultimately led to the resignation last week of Kathleen Sebelius, the health secretary who presided over Barack Obama’s healthcare reform, her name is linked in the American mind to last year’s mismanaged rollout of the government’s healthcare website. It turns out to be much harder to introduce new technologies into the public sector than the private sector. It always has been, notes Aneesh Chopra, Mr Obama’s former chief technology officer, in his new book. In 1887, when typewriters were already “critical infrastructure” in most businesses, the federal government was scarcely using them at all.Mr Chopra defends the administration’s innovations in such sweeping terms, though, that one begins to wonder whether some larger hubris is to blame for its failures. Innovative State might be called a policy autobiography. Its tone is grandiose, somewhere between a university admissions essay and an Academy Awards acceptance speech. “In early 2012,” he writes, “I informed the President that I would be leaving the administration to run for office in Virginia, as part of a longer-term vision to implement a more innovative government in a state that, at Jamestown in 1607, had served as the birthplace of American democracy.” Of the “open government” reforms he championed, he says: “There doesn’t appear to be an ‘other side’ to the argument, not when the benefits are so obvious.”“This isn’t about bigger,” Mr Chopra writes. “This isn’t about smaller. This is about smarter.” But arguments about the size of government are a straw man. Few important politicians make them any more. Both Republicans and Democrats have for decades championed lean but effective government. The Republican view, that many government duties ought to be handed over to business people, has triumphed – but in an ironic way. Partly because George W Bush was distracted by war, privatisation has for 25 years been carried out by Democratic presidents.Mr Chopra is a devotee of the “open innovation” model pioneered by Henry Chesbrough of Berkeley. In the private sector, this means seeking ideas outside the company as well as inside, but Mr Chopra believes the same lessons can be applied to government. He lauds a fellow White House aide’s plan for “a fresh portfolio of services that blurred lines between the public and private sector”. Mr Chopra describes Mr Obama’s goal as “seeking to strengthen the handshake between the public and private sectors to benefit the American people”. The benefits are visible in the way profitable television stations and websites have piggybacked on government data provided by the National Weather Service, or the $65bn app industry that has grown up since President Bill Clinton ordered high-precision GPS data to be made accessible to the public.What is appropriate for business, however, is not appropriate for government. Adventurism, a willingness to flout the rules – these can be excellent things in a start-up but they are a menace in a democratic republic. Mr Chopra does not see this. He applauds the Just Do It awards in which Jeff Bezos, Amazon chief executive, “would honour employees for implementing their thoughtful ideas without seeking permission – even if the resulting project didn’t succeed”. If the US government had such awards, the Iraq war and Obamacare would have won them all.Similarly, Mr Chopra identifies “stall” – the moment when profit growth turns negative – as a danger point in the growth of young companies. But stall can be good. Government programmes should not be so dynamic that they come to serve ends different from the ones they were set up to serve.Before his White House days, Mr Chopra was a secretary of technology in Virginia. He was energetic but clearly deaf to the idea that certain “barriers” between government and business are there for a reason. When he wanted to increase the numbers in the state taking the GED, a test-based equivalent to a high-school degree, he discovered that Virginia’s cable companies had a store of broadcast programmes to help candidates prepare. “Couldn’t we convince the cable companies to voluntarily upload the [Public Broadcasting Service] tapes and offer free access through their on-demand platforms?” he asked. He sure could, with a “single phone call to two of the state’s dominant cable companies, Comcast and Cox Communications”.Mr Chopra does not ask in what sense business people can ever be said to respond “voluntarily” to a request from an aide to a governor who regulates their industry. We should pay attention. Power in Washington is a triangle of technology, business and politics. The first of these is often a pretext for allowing the second to dominate the third.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard
326;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-04-18T12:38:25Z;Online originals face battle to win over advertisers’ hearts;;"Jerry Seinfeld rides in cars with comedians; Sarah Jessica Parker goes behind the scenes of the New York City Ballet; Seth Meyers stars as a cartoon superhero – welcome to the vast, varied and increasingly star-studded world of original online video series.Chasing the $236bn global television advertising market, internet companies, newspapers and magazine publishers are producing a proliferation of television-like series designed for people to watch on their smartphones, tablets, computers and web-connected televisions. Not to be eclipsed, traditional networks such as Comcast’s NBCUniversal are also pouring resources into digital video programmes.The originals range from short four- to eight-minute clips, such as Ms Parker’s docudrama city.ballet. on AOL, to television-series length programmes, such as Mr Meyers’ animated comedy The Awesomes on Hulu.More than a dozen companies, including AOL, Google, Hulu, Microsoft and Yahoo, will host presentations in New York in the coming weeks to showcase their latest video programmes to advertisers as part of the third annual Digital Content NewFronts event.“There is a massive wave here,” says Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video. “Here’s why it matters: If you really want to create a meaningful video brand today, you have to have a mix of really good technology and really differentiated content.”The week-long event comes weeks before US television broadcasters host their own glitzy parties for advertising buyers to showcase their upcoming programmes as part of the annual “upfront” market, when the networks sell about two-thirds of their commercial inventory of advertising space.Despite the flurry of programming announcements and the buzz surrounding original web series – bolstered this year by the critical success of Netflix’s originals House of Cards and Orange is the New Black – advertisers say that web producers still have much to prove before they start committing TV-sized dollar sums to the digital video programmes. (Netflix and Amazon, which also develops original content, don’t sell digital video ads and make money via subscriptions.)Factors holding back advertising spending on the programmes are the limited audiences for most series, high prices, the quality of the shows and issues measuring both viewers and the return on the ads, marketing executives say.“The originality of the original online series is behind us,” says Rob Norman, chief digital officer of WPP’s GroupM, the world’s largest online ad buyer overseeing more than $5bn in billings. “Unless these come with significant audiences then significant dollars are not going to follow them.”Indeed, traditional television continues to dominate ad budgets as marketers seek a one-stop shop for reaching mass audiences, and TV continues to deliver. Ad spending on broadcast and cable television is expected to reach $68.5bn in the US this year, more than 11 times the $5.89bn directed toward digital video, according to eMarketer, a market research company.A growing number of US homes are utilising streaming devices, such as the Apple TV box, Google’s Chromecast and Roku, or internet connected televisions to watch online video, according to media consultancy and research group Frank N Magid Associates.Read more“It is safe to say that nobody has cracked the code on digital video to get a huge audience behind any of their properties,” says John Muszynski, chief investment officer at Publicis’ Spark media buying group. “There are some good signs of programmes starting to get traction.”As people spend more time watching video on digital devices, television’s hold on ad budgets is expected to decline. Ad spending on television is set to increase a tepid 3.3 per cent this year while spending on digital video is expected to surge 41 per cent.“Younger audiences, 18- to 34-year-olds, are spending more and more time watching video and not just on television,” says Carl Fremont, global head of digital for WPP’s MEC ad buying group. “That audience is very coveted by marketers.”A significant factor that has deterred advertisers from premium online video is expensive ad rates. Marketers buy commercial time based on the number of people who will see the spot. With audiences for online programmes often limited, that makes less commercial inventory available for sale and leads to higher prices.Two years ago, internet companies set the rates for digital video ads at about a 50 per cent premium over cable television, according to ad executives.Prices have steadily decreased. Last year the average rate for an in-stream online video advert that reaches 1,000 people was $23.03, 38 per cent more than the average rate for cable television advert targeted at the 18 to 49-year-old audience, according to research firm SQAD. Network television commands the highest rates, charging an average of $44.11 to reach 1,000 people in the 18 to 49-year old audience.Younger audiences, 18- to 34-year-olds, are spending more and more time watching video and not just on television. That audience is very coveted by marketersTo lure more viewers and ultimately advertising budgets, online outlets are pouring more resources into marketing their original series. Hulu, for instance, promoted the new season of its supernatural comedy Deadbeat at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and advertising on bus shelters in New York. The show also is featured prominently on Hulu’s site.“The biggest question we get is how are you going to promote these shows,” says Peter Naylor, head of ad sales at Hulu, the online video service owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast. “A lot of people can pursue this original content avenue, but you have to go out of your way to make sure that it is discoverable and that you are building an audience for the marketer.”Some experiments are starting to pay off. Citi, the financial services company, is returning this year as the sole sponsor for the second season of the city.ballet. series on AOL which follows the lives of company members of the New York City Ballet. The series has gained about 14m views to date.Video ads for Citi appear before the start of each episode and paid off in return-on-investment measures, according to Pete Stein, global chief executive of Publicis’ Razorfish, the digital marketing agency that brokered the deal on behalf of Citi.“I don’t know if I would say that [advertising on online original series] has reached prime time,” he says, “but it is on everybody’s radar.”"

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland.

It’s logical they want to save money . . . the ramifications will cascade through the economy and could lead to significant price increases,” he said.Comcast is the largest provider of high-speed internet services to US households. A combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable would supply up to 40 per cent of households with high-speed internet access, the committee was told.The all-share deal has fallen in value since it was announced from $45.2bn to less than $40bn as Comcast’s stock has declined. Comcast’s offer for Time Warner Cable trumped a rival bid from Charter Communications, the cable operator in which John Malone’s Liberty Media owns a 27 per cent stake.David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice-president, rejected the claims that the deal would be bad for consumers. “There is nothing in this transaction that will increase prices . . . nothing,” he said.The deal would generate “substantial benefit to consumers”, he said. “That’s a good thing, not a problem.”Comcast has positioned the deal as a development in a rapidly changing media landscape, populated by diverse competitors ranging from Apple and Google to DirecTV and Netflix.In a blog post published before the hearing, Mr Cohen wrote that the deal would “give our company the scale that will enable us to make larger investments in R&D, innovation, and infrastructure, so we can compete more effectively in this incredibly dynamic marketplace”.The company has increased internet access speeds for some of its customers for the 13th time in 12 years, Mr Cohen said.The squeeze will come from Comcast. It’s logical they want to save money . . . the ramifications will cascade through the economy and could lead to significant price increasesHowever, some members of the Senate committee were unconvinced. Senator Al Franken, a vocal critic of the deal, said it would “result in fewer choices and higher prices for my constituents”.Comcast owns a portfolio of cable networks, including The Golf Channel, following its 2009 purchase of NBCUniversal. Competing network operators have expressed concerns that a more powerful Comcast could give preferential treatment to its own networks.“We’re concerned that this merger will make a bad situation worse,” said James Bosworth, chairman and chief executive of Back9Network, an independently owned golf channel. “We’re competing directly with a Comcast-owned channel . . . right now they are judge and jury,” he said.Comcast has “an army of lobbyists” arguing for the deal to be cleared, Mr Franken told the committee. “We need to make sure that consumers’ voices are being heard, too.”The Sunlight Foundation, a non-profit group that pushes for transparency in government, revealed before the Senate hearing that employees of Comcast and Time Warner Cable had given $42.4m to politicians since 1989.The biggest recipient of cash from Comcast’s employees and the company’s political action committee over that period was Barack Obama, US president, who received more than $537,000.The company maintains close ties with the White House: Mr Cohen is a prominent “bundler” for Mr Obama and has hosted a fundraiser for the president at his home, Sunlight said.
329;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-04-08T15:13:05Z;Comcast FCC filing puts case for TWC deal;;Comcast is positioning itself as a limited player in a dynamic media and technology industry dominated by Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon, as the US media group attempts to convince regulators to approve its bid for rival cable operator Time Warner Cable.Comcast’s plan to combine America’s two largest cable operators, in a deal that would reshape the country’s video and broadband infrastructure, comes as rapid technological changes are forcing traditional companies to transform themselves, the group outlined in a 175-page document filed on Tuesday with the US Federal Communications Commission.The Comcast-TWC merger is expected to face tough scrutiny by the Department of Justice, which is reviewing the deal for antitrust issues, and the FCC, which considers the public interest.The all-share deal has fallen in value since it was announced from $45.2bn to $38.6bn as Comcast’s stock has declined.The combined company would be the largest provider of US pay television and broadband services by subscribers, controlling about a third of both markets, analysts estimate. Critics worry that the deal would give Comcast unprecedented market power to raise consumer prices and control infrastructure and the media.Comcast’s filing attempted to shift the focus, arguing that the days when it competed solely against other traditional cable operators to provide pay TV and broadband internet services were long gone.Today, Comcast competes against a complex array of companies with national and global scale, ranging from satellite TV providers to Netflix, Google, Apple and Amazon, which all offer streaming video services. It also faces competition in broadband from phone companies, wireless broadband services and new entrants such as Google Fiber.“The traditional boundaries between media, communications and technology are obsolete,” David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice-president, said in a blog post. “Many of these companies are far larger than our combined company would be.”Additional scale would allow Comcast to invest in innovation and infrastructure for broadband, video and other services and encourage rivals to invest too, Mr Cohen said.“We are looking for the scale and the ability to invest to make sure we can take new competitors and existing competitors on without one arm tied behind our back,” Mr Cohen said during a conference call on Tuesday.The traditional boundaries between media, communications and technology are obsolete. Many of these companies are far larger than our combined company would beComcast is arguing that the deal would not diminish competition or choice for customers because the two companies do not compete head-on in any region. Comcast has offered to give up 3m subscribers, extend open internet access rules to TWC customers and offer broadband packages to low-income consumers.The deal has sparked concerns from other industry executives. Chase Carey, chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox, said the combined company’s dominance over broadband would raise questions.“Probably the issue that will come out of it, and that will ultimately get focused on, is really the broadband issue. Is there choice in broadband? Are you really headed toward every home having simply one broadband provider, and what are the implications of that?” he told a recent conference.Company officials will face their first congressional hearing on the deal on Wednesday, when Mr Cohen and TWC chief financial officer Arthur Minson appear before the Senate judiciary committee. Gene Kimmelman, the Public Knowledge chief executive who has expressed concerns about the deal, and James Bosworth, chief executive of small golf lifestyle network Back9Network, are also due to testify.The House of Representatives is expected to hold a similar hearing. Some lawmakers have expressed concerns but the deal has not yet produced a groundswell of political opposition. Democratic senator Al Franken, who opposed Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal, has been the most vocal critic and has contacted regulators.Comcast pushed through its NBCU acquisition after agreeing to a host of conditions. In 2012, the FCC fined Comcast $800,000 for alleged anti-competitive behaviour because it had not made more clear the offering of its standalone broadband services, a condition of the NBCU deal.The FCC could use the Comcast deal to solidify its net neutrality policies after a US court ruled that the agency had over-reached its powers in that area. The FCC said in February it would propose new rules prohibiting internet service providers from charging companies such as Google’s YouTube to reach consumers at higher speeds or quality.
330;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Comcast / TWC: stay the course;Comcast’s share price may be slipping but it still holds leverage over Time Warner Cable;Comcast has proven to be a deft tactician in its pursuit of Time Warner Cable. Its acumen is tested again as its shares have slipped a tenth since the deal was announced.That is not just irritating for Comcast. Shareholders in TWC do not get any cash in the tie-up – just 2.9 Comcast shares for each TWC share. There are rumblings that Comcast should sweeten its bid before TWC shareholders vote. So far, Comcast’s only gesture has been to boost its share buyback plan by $2.5bn, to $5.5bn, after the deal closes. This should, in theory, boost the future Comcast share price and thus induce TWC shareholders to sanction the deal. Comcast’s appeasement campaign must go no further, though.The headline prices in all-stock deals are misleading. The original Comcast offer was $160. Today it is worth $145. Tomorrow it will be something else again. The real issue is whether the 23 per cent ownership which TWC shareholders would get in the new Comcast is reasonable, given the TWC contribution to profits. The value the shareholders will receive depends on that share, along with any new benefits the two companies can wring from the combination. That value proposition hasn’t budged in two months. If those two factors are less than compelling, then TWC holders should not approve the deal regardless.Comcast should not, then, offer a “collar”, where TWC shareholders get more shares if its stock price falls: it would distort the agreed-upon ownership split. And (say) a dividend paid only to TWC shareholders takes value from Comcast shareholders. TWC shareholders can keep flirting with John Malone’s Charter Communications, but if they wanted a deal with him, they could have directed their management to pursue one. Without a better suitor, TWC needs Comcast more than vice versa.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Those at Credit Suisse noted they remained doubtful that “BlackBerry can create a meaningful business”.“Our concern remains that the declining subscriber base and average revenue per user trends coupled with secular hardware issues mean that the services stream will see pressure for some time,” Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said.Mr Garcha said he believed services revenue would tumble more than 60 per cent from fiscal 2013 to $1.5bn in the current year.The downgrades follow weaker than anticipated sales in the three months to March 1, when quarterly revenues dipped below $1bn for the first time in seven years.However, the company’s loss narrowed from a quarter earlier to $423m, or 80 cents per diluted share. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast a loss of 55 cents per share.Analysts at Goldman Sachs reiterated their neutral rating on BlackBerry, but cut the company’s price target as cash on hand dwindled.“While we see the year end cash flow break-even target as achievable given the deep cost cuts, we are more sceptical on BlackBerry’s ability to return to profitability in fiscal year 2016, given the challenges in gaining traction with its smartphones or enterprise services,” Goldman’s Simona Jankowski said.Shares in BlackBerry slid 3.9 per cent to $8.95.Microsoft shares continued their advance on Monday, touching the highest level in nearly 14 years, as the company named Stephen Elop, the former Nokia chief executive, to lead its devices business.The decision was announced amid a round of appointments by new chief executive Satya Nadella and follows the company’s new software offerings for Apple’s iPad, which some analysts believe will lift revenues by more than $1bn.Mr Nadella also promoted Scott Guthrie to executive vice-president after serving as acting leader of Microsoft’s cloud and enterprise unit and gave Phil Spencer a new role leading Xbox.Shares in the company advanced 1.7 per cent to $40.99.Comcast shares rose following comments that the company would increase its share buyback by at least $2.5bn this year.A source familiar with the matter said the company was targeting at least a $2.5bn increase, following its $3bn share buyback announcement in January. Bloomberg was first to report on the company’s thinking.Together, Comcast could repurchase $5.5bn worth of stock in 2014. Time Warner Cable had suspended a $2.5bn share buyback programme after it announced it would be taken over by Comcast, creating the largest US cable provider.Comcast has not yet set a date for a shareholder vote on the merger, which must precede a rise in the buyback programme.Shares in Comcast rose 1.4 per cent to $50.04 while Time Warner Cable increased almost 1 per cent to $137.18.Biofuel Energy jumped 132.5 per cent to $7.30 after activist investor David Einhorn proposed a transaction that would increase his stake in the small ethanol producer.According to a filing with US securities regulators, Mr Einhorn and his affiliates will take a controlling stake in the company if Biofuel purchases certain real estate assets controlled by Greenlight and investor James Brickman for $275m in cash and stock.Mr Einhorn already owns more than a third of the company through Greenlight Capital. Biofuel said it would establish a committee to review the proposal.Overall, equity markets rose on the final day of the first quarter as a fourth regional manufacturing survey pointed to firmer economic activity in March.The benchmark S&P 500 advanced 0.8 per cent to 1,872.34 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8 per cent to 16,457.66. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 4,198.99.
332;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-03-28T12:49:49Z;CBS $3.3bn billboard spin-off signals end of era;;CBS’s spin-off of its $3.3bn billboard business into a public company, which began trading on Friday, signals the end of an era for big media.While some media conglomerates including Comcast and Disney continue to gobble up assets, CBS is joining News Corp, Time Warner and Tribune in whittling down its business. The spin-off of CBS Outdoor leaves the parent group primarily focused on making money on television content.“Companies are changing, and the point of view of the world has shifted,” Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, said in an interview. “We’re focused on the idea that television content is where the future is. We feel very strongly that way.”CBS Outdoor raised $560m in its initial public offering. Shares opened at $28 on Friday, and were up about 8.2 per cent in morning tradining to $30.30.Parent group CBS now owns 83 per cent of CBS Outdoor, and plans to use the money to buy back shares and pursue acquisitions in the content business. The total equity value for the outdoor group is estimated at about $3.3bn.CBS Outdoor, which operates about 350,000 signs across the US and Latin America, had $1.3bn of revenues in 2013, about the same as in 2012. Operating income for the unit fell 9 per cent to $217m from 2012.The company hopes to return to growth by converting more of its signs to digital, and potentially acquire smaller companies in the highly fragmented industry.“When you are non-core, you feel a little bit like a stepchild,” Jeremy Male, chief executive of CBS Outdoor, told the Financial Times. “It will be great to have the business run right from the top by people who are absolutely focused on outdoor.”Billboard advertising is one of the oldest forms of media, but in the US the industry is still growing steadily, fuelled by the digital conversion of traditional billboards and people spending more time out of their homes.Spending on outdoor advertising in the US is expected to climb 3 per cent this year to $4.2bn – faster than the 2.6 per cent growth projected for the television market, according to GroupM, a subsidiary of advertising group WPP.For CBS, Mr Moonves said he does not have its eye on a particular acquisition target at the moment but noted that there could be an opportunity to buy a content company in the wake of Comcast’s proposed $45.2bn takeover of cable operator Time Warner Cable. “You know what is good is to go to sleep at night and know that should the opportunity arise, you can seize it,” he said.
333;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Charter contests proposed TWC-Comcast merger;;Charter Communications has filed legal documents contesting the proposed $42.5bn merger between Time Warner Cable and Comcast, claiming that the deal has been subject to a “flawed process”.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday night, Charter, a cable operator, outlined a series of complaints against the structuring of the deal, with a particular focus on proposed divestitures and the lack of a break-up fee.“TWC’s process for negotiating and approving the merger was flawed because of the failure of the TWC board of directors to consider and investigate alternatives to the proposed Comcast merger,” the document reads.“In particular, the TWC board simply refused to meaningfully engage with Charter regarding a potential business combination even after deciding to pursue a transaction with Comcast.”The move to ask shareholders to vote down the deal marks a strike back by Charter and John Malone, the cable industry veteran who had backed Charter’s spurned offer for TWC.Before agreeing a deal with Comcast, TWC had spent months fighting off the attentions of Charter in a public battle that turned acrimonious.The filing questions the likelihood of regulators allowing the merger of America’s two largest cable operators – a combined business that would have control of nearly 40 per cent of the broadband market with about 33m subscribers. When Comcast and TWC announced their agreement to merge, Comcast said it would lose 3m subscribers.In its proxy statement, Charter said TWC’s “stockholders have no information to evaluate this aspect of the proposed merger”.The move to ask shareholders to vote down the deal marks a strike back by Charter and John Malone, the cable industry veteran who had backed Charter’s spurned offer for TWC“Furthermore, notwithstanding the likelihood of a regulatory opposition to the deal, the merger agreement contains no regulatory break-up fee, giving Comcast no incentive to seek solutions beyond these limited commitment[s],” it added.The merger consideration offered in the proposed Comcast merger was claimed to be worth $158.82 per TWC share at the time it was announced. However, the value of that merger consideration has declined substantially and based on the closing price of Comcast stock on Thursday is now worth $141.16 per TWC share.Charter had spent six months pursuing a deal with TWC and was caught off guard by Comcast’s successful bid in February.A deal would have seen Charter, the fourth-largest cable operator in the US, nearly triple its about 4m subscribers with TWC’s 11m in highly sought-after markets, such as New York and Los Angeles.Time Warner Cable responded to the filing saying “we are fully committed to our merger with Comcast, which we believe is in the best interests of shareholders”.Comcast was not available for comment.
334;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-03-24T17:14:26Z;Netflix shares fall on talk of Apple service;Nasdaq hit by biotech and social media selling;Netflix shares fell almost 7 per cent on concerns about competitive threats to its online film and series streaming service after an unconfirmed report that Apple was in talks with Comcast about a rival service using an Apple set-top box.The report in the Wall Street Journal said that discussions between the world’s most valuable company and the nation’s largest cable provider were in early stages and many hurdles remained.But any talks would come amid industry jostling on the issue of free delivery of content over the internet as providers seek to gain access to faster broadband speed and better services. Shares in Netflix finished down 6.67 per cent to close at $378.90.“Folks don’t understand the Comcast-Apple box and somehow think that because someone changes their set top that they would cancel Netflix for a service that does not even exist,” said Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible.The Nasdaq Composite was also hit by weakness in Twitter stock, down more than 4 per cent to close at $48.78, following a ban on the online messaging service by Turkey’s prime minister.The social media sector was also affected with Facebook shares down 4.67 per cent to $64.10 and Google down more than 2 per cent to $1,157.93.Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has in the past also threatened to block Facebook and Google’s YouTube.Herbalife shares surged after its largest shareholder, Carl Icahn, once again tightened his grip on the nutrition supplement company.Shares in Herbalife rose as much as 9 per cent after the company announced it would nominate and back three Icahn appointees to its board. The decision takes the activist investor’s hold of the 13-seat board to five. The shares eventually closed up 6.7 per cent, at $52.86.Hunter Gary and Jesse Lynn, employees of Icahn Enterprises, will be nominated for seats with terms expiring in 2016, according to a statement filed with US securities regulators.James Nelson, an Icahn Enterprises independent director, has also been nominated.Icahn Enterprises, which owns 16.8 per cent of outstanding shares, added it could increase its stake to as much as 25 per cent.Mr Icahn, who has waged a bitter public battle against investor Bill Ackman over the company, said he remained confident in the company’s board.The shares, which have been subject to volatile shifts over the past month, had fallen more than 30 per cent since the year’s start as the Federal Trade Commission opened a formal investigation into the company’s practices.Biotechnology shares were on track for another poor performance as shocks from a US Congressional committee’s questions over drug costs continued to weigh on the sector.The Nasdaq Biotech index fell by just over 3 per cent, adding to a 4 per cent slide on Friday that was triggered by a letter from the House Energy and Commerce committee to the chief executive of Gilead.The lawmakers questioned Gilead’s plans to sell the 12-week treatment, Sovaldi, for $84,000.Epizyme, Agios Pharmaceuticals, Zogenix and Novavax all fell by more than a tenth as nine in ten stocks in the index fell. Larger companies, including Gilead, Mylan, and Grifols also slid.The sector had reached an apogee earlier this year as sales estimates for some of the costliest drugs rose.The letter on Friday, which argued the cost would saddle state Medicaid programmes with unaffordable bills, tempered that euphoria.The sector’s decline weighed on the larger Nasdaq Composite, which was down 1.18 per cent to end at 4,226.39.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.16 per cent to close at 16,276.69, while the S&P 500 index finished 0.49 per cent lower, at 1,857.44.
335;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;AT&T hits back at Netflix over ISP fees;;AT&T has hit back at Netflix, calling the chief executive of the film and TV streaming service “arrogant” for arguing it should not pay extra fees to internet providers for its heavy bandwidth use.Jim Cicconi, who heads the telecoms company’s public policy team, said there was “no free lunch” and therefore “no cost-free streaming movies”.In an post entitled, “Who should pay for Netflix?”, he said the advent of streaming videos was driving consumer bandwidth consumption to record levels, requiring investment in broadband networks to build more capacity.The telecoms provider responded to a post by Reed Hastings on Thursday that criticised AT&T’s rival Comcast for violating the principle of net neutrality, which ensures telecoms groups and internet providers charge the same rates for data and content services regardless of the amount of data being used.“Mr Hastings’ arrogant proposition is that everyone else should pay but Netflix. That may be a nice deal if he can get it. But it’s not how the internet, or telecommunication for that matter, has ever worked,” he said. Mr Cicconi added that when Netflix delivered DVDs by mail, the customer paid for the cost of delivery, which he said was the equivalent of all broadband customers being made to pay for the heavy bandwidth use of Netflix users.“It would’ve been neither right nor legal for Netflix to demand a customer’s neighbours pay the cost of delivering his movie,” he said. “If there’s a cost of delivering Mr Hastings’ movies at the quality level he desires – and there is – then it should be borne by Netflix and recovered in the price of the service.”This latest spat in a series of disputes over “net neutrality” comes as the Federal Communications Commission is conducting public hearings on the subject. The Netflix blog post was submitted to the FCC.In the post, Mr Hastings hinted that Netflix had few options other than to agree to a deal with Comcast struck just last month to pay an undisclosed fee for “interconnection”. He accused Comcast and other big internet providers, of which AT&T is one, of using their “market position” to impose tolls.Comcast responded to the post, saying that no one had a stronger commitment to the open internet than the company. David Cohen, executive vice-president, said Netflix and other providers had always paid for their connection to the internet and had “ample options” to ensure customers received good performance at a “fair price”.
336;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-03-20T22:54:46Z;Netflix targets Comcast over ISP fees;;Netflix has accused Comcast and other big internet providers of using their “market position” to impose tolls for access to their networks, hindering the ability of online video operators to provide a quality service.Netflix struck a deal with Comcast last month whereby it will pay the cable group an undisclosed fee for “interconnection” – effectively connecting its streaming film and television service with Comcast’s internet network.But in a blog post published on Tuesday, Netflix hinted that it had been left with little choice. With some internet providers, “Netflix performance has been constrained, subjecting consumers who pay a lot of money for high-speed internet to high buffering rates, long wait times and poor video quality,” wrote Reed Hastings, chief executive.“Once Netflix agrees to pay the ISP interconnection fees, however, sufficient capacity is made available and high-quality service for consumers is restored.” Comcast is currently the only company Netflix has agreed to pay for “interconnection”.Comcast swiftly responded to Mr Hastings’ blog post. David Cohen, executive vice-president, said: “No company . . . has had a stronger commitment to the open internet than Comcast.”“Providers like Netflix have always paid for their interconnection to the internet and have always had ample options to ensure that their customers receive an optimal performance through all ISPs at a fair price,” he said.The Netflix blog post comes at a sensitive time for Comcast, the largest cable operator in the US. It is currently preparing for regulatory scrutiny over its $42.5bn bid for Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable group.Regulators are likely to take a close look at Comcast’s position in the broadband market, with the combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable set to supply an estimated 40 per cent of online US households with internet service upon completion of the takeover.He may not trump Comcast’s bid for Time Warner, but it is too soon write off John Malone, writes Matthew Garrahan.Continue readingThe Netflix blog post is being submitted to the Federal Communication Commission as part of its public hearings into “net neutrality” – the principle that ensures telecoms groups and internet providers charge the same rates to data and content services regardless of the amount of data being downloaded or streamed.In January, Verizon, the telecoms operator, won a landmark case against the FCC when a US court ruled that the regulator had over-reached its powers in enforcing net-neutrality. The court ruling could clear the way for online video operators to be charged for the data streamed by consumers on high-speed lines – an issue of concern to Netflix and other video services, such as Google’s YouTube.In the blog post Mr Hastings called for “strong net neutrality” to prevent “ISPs from charging a toll for interconnection to services like Netflix, YouTube, or Skype . . . to deliver the services and data requested by ISP residential subscribers”.Instead, “ISPs must provide sufficient access to their network without charge”, he said. “Without strong net neutrality, big ISPs can demand potentially escalating fees for the interconnection required to deliver high-quality service. The big ISPs can make these demands . . . because of their market position.”
337;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-03-20T12:16:02Z;Don’t expect Malone the ‘cable cowboy’ to ride into the sunset;History suggests it would be unwise to write off Liberty Media;When Comcast delivered its surprise bid for Time Warner Cable last month, most observers assumed it would knock the so-called “cable cowboy”, John Malone, off his horse.The Colorado billionaire earned his spurs – and his nickname – long before his Liberty Media and Liberty Global groups started rolling up swaths of the US and European cable television sectors. He had long coveted Time Warner Cable, and mounted a hostile bid using Charter Communications, a smaller cable television operator in which Liberty Media group holds a 27 per cent stake.But Comcast’s whopping $158.82 a share all-stock offer was valued at $42.5bn the day it landed – instantly trumping Charter’s lower offer of $132.50. As such, it appeared to end Mr Malone’s hopes of adding a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable to a portfolio of investments across Liberty Media and Liberty Global, which already includes LiveNation, the global concert and ticketing operator, Sirius XM, the satellite radio group, and Virgin Media, the UK cable TV provider.Market chatter suggests an improved bid by Charter for Time Warner Cable will not be forthcoming. Comcast and Time Warner Cable certainly seem unconcerned: recent public comments by senior executives have focused on their confidence that the acquisition will not face significant regulatory hurdles, rather than any risk of a revived Charter bid.However, history suggests it would be unwise to write off Mr Malone. There are few more accomplished – or aggressive – dealmakers in media, as Rupert Murdoch knows to his cost. A decade ago, Mr Malone began to build a position in News Corp voting shares, a move that threatened to undermine Mr Murdoch’s family control over the company. Mr Malone then secretly added to the stake, outfoxing Mr Murdoch who was forced to hand News Corp’s shares in DirecTV to Mr Malone in exchange for the stake.Last week, Mr Malone restructured his US holdings to give Liberty Media more firepower for acquisitions. The company launched two new tracking stocks and dropped a bid to buy the 47 per cent of Sirius that it did not own, in favour of a rights issue to raise new funds.Likely acquisition targets are smaller cable operators, such as Cox Communications – although it is unclear if family-owned Cox would sell – as well as the 3m or so subscribers that will probably be jettisoned by Comcast to ensure its Time Warner Cable deal is cleared by regulators.Mr Malone may also have his eye on bigger prizes – particularly if Comcast shares keep falling. Comcast stock is off 10 per cent since it bid for Time Warner Cable, which has driven down the value of its all-share offer by a corresponding amount. Might an improved Charter bid with a larger cash component be enough to sway investors in Time Warner Cable?Analysts think not. “Other than a regulatory pushback, it’s hard to see how Comcast doesn’t get this deal done,” says Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research.Not everyone is happy about the power Comcast will yield once it has absorbed Time Warner Cable. Last week, Chase Carey, the president of 21st century Fox, became the most high-profile corporate figure to voice concerns about the tie-up, pointing to the combined company’s dominance in providing high-speed internet access. Once the deal completes, about 40 per cent of US homes will get their internet from Comcast. “Are you really headed to every home having simply one broadband provider and what are the implications of that?” he said at an investment conference.Companies from all corners of the media industry will be affected by a bigger and stronger Comcast, including several of Mr Malone’s investments. He has a personal stake in Discovery Communications, which owns channels such as TLC and Animal Planet. Discovery would have to negotiate distribution agreements with Comcast-Time Warner Cable and, in the process, compete with cable channels owned by NBCUniversal, a Comcast subsidiary.Mr Malone has the motivation to build a viable competitor to a bigger and stronger Comcast at a time when broadband and pay-TV is in flux. Possible joint ventures and acquisitions abound – with satellite companies, such as DirecTV, and Dish Networks, and telecom groups, such as Sprint. With a possible war chest at his disposal once he completes the Liberty Media rights issue, do not expect Mr Malone to stand idly by. The cable cowboy is exploring every deal option. Comcast may want to keep the champagne on ice – at least for now.Matthew Garrahan is the Financial Times’ media editor
338;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-03-18T11:00:47Z;Hunger for long-term debt poses US rate risk;Investors could suffer big price falls if interest rates rise;Will it be all pain and no gain for investors who have piled into long-term corporate debt recently?Despite rising expectations of higher US bond yields this year, and the falling bond prices that are the flip side of that coin, there has been no shortage of buyers for the 30-year dollar bonds sold in recent weeks by companies such as Bank of America, General Electric, Pemex, Novartis, and JPMorgan Chase, among others.Such bonds could suffer big price falls if interest rates rise in the coming months. The danger was amply and dramatically illustrated last year when Apple’s 30-year bond quickly lost nearly a fifth of its value as Treasury yields rose sharply during the summer.Long-dated bonds are noted for being more sensitive to changes in underlying interest rates than shorter-term debt securities.For now, scepticism about the health of the US economy, low inflation and the expectation that the Federal Reserve is in no hurry to tighten monetary policy, as it slowly tapers its monthly bond purchases, have placed a ceiling on long-term interest rates.Rather than question whether this can last, investors have been willing buyers of long-term bonds, or those with a maturity of greater than 10 years.“The lesson here is that it has become extremely difficult to time the bond markets,” says Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at Prudential Fixed Income.“Even with a benign economic scenario and indications the Fed would start to taper, rates did not back up sharply, and probably won’t in the near future. As a result, long-term fixed income will outperform cash.”Concern about duration exposure in bond portfolios is being downplayed for the moment. Long-term corporate debt has generated a total return of nearly 5 per cent so far this year, while junk bonds have returned 2.4 per cent, according to Barclays.That is good news for institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurers, which have been the biggest buyers of long-term corporate debt in recent months. They use high-grade, longer-dated bonds to match their underlying liabilities, but a turn higher in rates stands to hurt those investors chasing the higher yields on longer-dated debt.Jay Mueller, portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management, says the appetite for duration exposure is data-dependent. Pension plans, which have been switching out of equities after their strong performance in 2013, are now moving into the longer-duration trade as uncertainty over the strength of the economy and low inflation dominate sentiment.“The preferred mechanism for pension plans immunising their portfolios is buying long-dated credit,” he says. “We seem to be in one of those periods where there is scepticism about the strength of the US economy, and yet the Fed is winding down its large asset purchase programme.”With the Fed’s taper on course to end by September, and the economy expected to rebound from its winter blues, the clock is ticking for long-term interest rates.A robust pick-up in economic activity that vindicates the recent record US equity market run is seen pushing long-term interest rates much higher.The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds stands at 2.67 per cent, but many economists forecast an increase to 3.5 per cent by the end of the year. As a rule of thumb, a bond with a duration of 10 years would experience a price decline of 10 per cent in the event that benchmark interest rates rose 1 percentage point.“At this stage, I’m not sure I would go too much beyond the 10-year mark when it comes to duration,” says Jim Sarni, a managing principal at Payden & Rygel.“There’s a yield pick-up the further along you go out with the [maturity of] bonds, but I don’t think it’s worth it, given the potential for price declines were benchmark rates to back up quickly,” he adds.For now, companies have been taking advantage of changing investor sentiment and the strong demand from institutional investors, with issuance of long-dated corporate debt at a robust level of $126bn so far this year, according to Dealogic. That figure is running slightly below last year’s record pace of $145bn, for the same period.“Demand from pension funds and institutional investors has been pretty powerful,” says Mr Sarni. “But it makes you wonder how long will it last, and what kind of impact it may have if for some reason they become less supportive.”
339;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:22:32+0000;Centerview Partners’ relationship care brings blockbuster deals;;"In the first few days of 2014, Centerview Partners helped Jim Beam, the US spirits group, sell itself to Suntory of Japan for $16bn. A month later, the investment bank cropped up on the list of advisers to have secured Time Warner Cable’s $42bn sale to Comcast.The deals marked the closing of a circle Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan, the Wall Street dealmakers who founded Centerview eight years ago.Both men had grown up working at independent investment banks – Mr Effron at Dillon, Reed, Mr Pruzan at Wasserstein Perella. By 2006, after a series of acquisitions, both were working for large multinationals. During months of casual conversations, the two realised they increasingly reminiscing about the old days of independent investment banks, where a firm was only as good as the relationships it built and maintained.That attention to relationship husbandry was repaid in those two blockbuster deals.“When you get Centerview you are getting two of the longest standing guys on the street and an attention to detail that isn’t always matched elsewhere,” says a lawyer who has worked on both the same and opposite sides of deals Centerview has been involved with.But Mr Effron and Mr Pruzan are quick to eschew the idea that it is them, rather than the firm and its reputation, which brings in the deals.At the heart of Centerview’s philosophy is the idea that a successful investment bank needs a layer of experienced, well connected bankers who can be left to manage their own relationships and conduct their own deals. Not so much a handful of rainmakers, but a weather system of senior investment bankers.“If you are in the business of giving good advice then you need to have a lot of senior, experienced people to do it,” says Mr Pruzan. “It is not that we are the rainmakers handing off execution to other guys in the firm; everyone here is able to manage their own relationships and deals.”That aversion to being key men was demonstrated last year. In spite of Centerview advising Onyx on its $10.4bn sale to Amgen, the fifth-largest biotechnology deal in history, neither Pruzan or Effron were involved in the negotiations.Today the firm has 35 partners and managing directors and close to 200 staff spread through offices in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and London."
340;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-03-13T23:43:26Z;Malone chooses rights issue over Sirius deal;;John Malone’s Liberty Media has dropped its bid to buy a minority stake in Sirius XM, the satellite radio operator, in favour of a rights issue to raise funds for further acquisitions in the cable industry.The move comes after Charter Communications’ hostile bid for Time Warner Cable was trumped by a $42.5bn agreed offer from Comcast. Liberty owns 27 per cent of Charter and had encouraged it to combine with TWC as a way of leading consolidation in the fragmented industry.The value of Comcast’s all-stock offer for TWC has fallen since the deal was announced last month, with Comcast shares falling more than four per cent.Liberty did not say how much new capital it intended to raise, but the rights issue could in theory allow the company to offer a more attractive mix of cash and stock should it choose to launch a new bid for TWC. It could also fund bids for smaller cable companies.Liberty is restructuring its holdings to support Charter’s expansion, the company said. It has created two new tracking stocks – Liberty Media and Liberty Broadband – and has launched a rights issue for holders of Liberty Broadband shares.The company said its holdings in Charter and its minority interest in TWC would be “attributed” to the Liberty Broadband tracking stock.Its 53 per cent stake in Sirius will fall under the Liberty Media tracking stock, along with investments from Live Nation to Barnes & Noble.“We believe the creation of the Liberty Broadband tracking stock and the concurrent rights offering will provide us greater flexibility to . . . support Charter in its expansion efforts,” said Mr Malone.Liberty owns 53 per cent of Sirius and had been working on acquiring the remaining 47 per cent. In January, Liberty proposed to make Sirius XM a wholly owned subsidiary to give it more ammunition in its push to consolidate the cable industry.At the time, Greg Maffei, Liberty’s chief executive, said the move would bolster Liberty's access to capital “to support the pursuit of other potential attractive investment opportunities”.Charter, the fourth-largest US cable operator by subscribers, is being forced to rethink its strategy after spending the better part of last year circling TWC.Charter has expressed an interest in acquiring some or all of the 3m subscribers that Comcast has pledged to dispose of as part of its effort to persuade regulators to approve the proposed Comcast-TWC tie-up.After missing out on TWC, Charter signalled that it is still on the prowl for deals that would boost its base of 4m subscribers. “If the landscape changes in such a way that we see opportunity, we will be opportunistic and take advantage of it.” Tom Rutledge, Charter’s chief executive, told investors in February.The tracking stocks should be created by the third quarter, Mr Maffei said in a statement. “We remain enthusiastic owners of 53 per cent of Sirius,” he added.
341;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-03-04T12:31:11Z;Comcast points to NBCU deal to convince regulators;;Comcast, the US media group, is trumpeting its compliance with conditions attached to its 2009 acquisition of NBCUniversal as a model for how to convince regulators to approve its $45.2bn bid for rival cable operator Time Warner Cable.Buying NBCU combined the biggest US television distributor with one of the largest US programmers, so Comcast had to agree to concessions ranging from expanding programming for children to offering cheap broadband packages for low-income Americans.Regulators’ view of how well Comcast is abiding by the conditions it agreed five years ago will play a crucial role in their assessment of the cable group’s new plan to reshape America’s video and broadband industries by combining the two biggest cable operators.“It is simply indisputable that we have honoured – in fact, over-delivered – on our commitments,” David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice-president, said in a blog post on Monday. “And we’ll continue to do so.”In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, Comcast said it had surpassed its pledges on broadband, video on demand, diversity and public service issues, connecting 1m Americans through its low-cost broadband plan and expanding its broadband network by 40 per cent more than the 4,500 miles required.It also highlighted its agreements with Amazon and Netflix as evidence that it is abiding by requirements to provide programming for online video distributors.However, in 2012 the FCC fined Comcast $800,000 for not making more clear its offering of separate broadband services for customers who do not want to buy its cable products.Critics of the Comcast-TWC deal highlighted such breaches. “Such history should be taken into account when evaluating Comcast’s proposal for future market expansion,” said Democratic Senator Al Franken in a letter to the FCC on Thursday.The FCC and the US Department of Justice are due to review Comcast’s TWC bid. The enlarged company would control about a third of the US pay-TV and broadband markets, potentially giving it more heft in negotiations with traditional broadcasters and newer digital services.Personnel changes at the FCC and DoJ’s antitrust division since the NBCU acquisition mean the TWC transaction will be the first major media deal to come before those agencies’ chiefs. But Bill Baer, assistant attorney-general of the antitrust division, has been tough on deals and has shown a reluctance to negotiate, at least not until after a lawsuit has been filed against a transaction.Comcast and TWC do not compete head-on in local markets, people familiar with the matter said, so regulators are more likely to focus on how much power a combined Comcast-TWC will have over the content side of the media industry.That concern applies to networks like CBS, content creators such as HBO and online video distributors like Hulu.Comcast is seen by former government officials as having done a decent job so far in complying with the NBCU conditions, despite problems such as the one that led to the $800,000 fine.Since Comcast is an active dealmaker that comes before agencies repeatedly, “it’s in their incentive to comply because it hurts their credibility the next time around if they don’t”, said a former government official who worked on the NBCU conditions.Critics remain unconvinced, however. Former FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, the sole agency official to vote against the NBCU deal, said he did not believe any conditions could mitigate his concerns about that transaction and he feels the same way about the Time Warner Cable bid.The NBCU conditions expire in four years, he noted. “I’m wary of the NBCU conditions, partly because they are time limited,” said Mr Copps, who is now at non-profit Common Cause, which is dedicated to a more open government.“The industry has become more consolidated, less competitive, and consumer prices keep going up.”Consumers’ perception of Comcast and TWC has also turned negative since the announcement of the proposed deal, according to YouGov’s BrandIndex. Both companies suffered drops in quality perception and the number of consumers who would recommend the brand to friends.Even if regulators ultimately approve the deal, Comcast’s past dealmaking suggests the negotiations will be lengthy – it took more than a year for regulatory approval of the NBCU acquisition.
342;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-03-02T17:56:34Z;Comcast nears $320m deal for FreeWheel;;Comcast is poised to pay around $320m for FreeWheel, a seven-year-old company that inserts advertising in online videos for television networks and distributors, according to sources close to the deal.The deal is the latest sign of the convergence of old and new media, with the largest US cable operator scrambling to respond to rapidly shifting television viewers’ habits in the age of on-demand video on smartphones and tablets.“[D]igital television is increasingly becoming more like traditional television,” FreeWheel said in a recent report, noting that the kinds of programmes that generated the most digital ad views matched those that Nielsen rated as its top-five primetime television shows in 2013.Comcast’s move comes a matter of weeks after it agreed to pay $45.2bn to buy peer Time Warner Cable, in a deal that would create a pay television behemoth almost seven times bigger than its rivals. The scale of the new entity could help it compete with Netflix, Apple and Amazon, whose streaming services have sucked subscribers away from cable operators.Google has also piled into the game, announcing in February that it hopes to build a fibre optic network covering 34 US cities in a move widely interpreted as a challenge to cable TV and telecoms groups.The acquisition by Comcast seems designed to boost its advertising revenues from online content. FreeWheel’s technology uses analytics to help marketers and media companies tailor their ads according to the device and type of video being watched. It also offers advisory and technology consulting services.FreeWheel was founded by former employees of DoubleClick, a Google subsidiary that serves up advertisements on behalf of agencies and media companies. It has raised $37m to date from backers including the venture capital arm of Walt Disney and a subsidiary of Time Warner.The company has offices in Silicon Valley, New York, London and Beijing, and will remain a separate business unit within Comcast, according to sources close to the acquisition. Its clients include NBCUniversal, Sky, Fox, Viacom and AOL.The mobile advertising market is expected to reach $18bn in 2014, with video advertising experiencing the fastest growth within that category, according to estimates from research group Gartner.But ad-serving platforms have been the focus of recent controversy, partly due to the difficulty of verifying whether or not viewers have watched the advertisements. Shares in Blinkx, a London-listed video advertising company, plummeted by a third in February after a Harvard professor questioned how the company generates traffic.
343;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-27T22:15:22Z;JC Penney soars on same-store success;;JC Penney soared by its biggest intraday rise on record after the retailer reported its first same-store sales growth since 2011 and forecast continued momentum over the year.The figures, released after the market close on Wednesday, prompted at least one upgrade from analysts on Wall Street as the retailer’s liquidity position strengthened.JC Penney said it expected to finish 2014 with $2bn in cash, roughly the same as at the end of last year.The company has $5.5bn in debt outstanding, including $2.5bn due in 2018.“Investor fears of an imminent large capital raise or a change in corporate structure seems to be off the table in the near term,” Wells Fargo analyst Paul Lejuez said.“Management took a more confident tone, giving decent 2014 guidance that featured comp and [gross margin] improvement.”Mr Lejuez upgraded the company to market perform from underperform.Its shares remain well below where they were even a year ago and analysts say the company now needs to prove it can meet targets it set this week, including same-store sales growth of 3 to 5 per cent in the first quarter.“While shares may rally on a better than feared report, we continue to have outstanding concerns,” said Stephen Grambling, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.JC Penney shares closed up 25.3 per cent to $7.47.TiVo shares climbed 6.6 per cent to $13.68 on Thursday after the company said sales advanced at a greater than expected pace and it would benefit from Comcast’s decision to integrate its services with TiVo’s set-top boxes across the US.Revenues rose 20 per cent from a year earlier to $106m, ahead of Wall Street expectations, as it added more than 313,000 cable subscribers, its greatest number on record.The company said it swung to a profit of $710,000, or 1 cent per diluted share, compared with a loss of $15.8m a year earlier.The digital video recorder maker has benefited in recent quarters from deals with cable operators including Britain’s Virgin Media and Spain’s ONO.Management, which said it “obviously had a good relationship” with Comcast, hinted its acquisition of Time Warner Cable could allow TiVo to widen its user base in the country.“Users are embracing the functionality (multi-device, streaming, out-of-home, etc) from TiVo’s newer products, giving confidence in the company’s cloud-based strategic vision,” Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald said in a note to clients.Record ratings for two shows lifted AMC Networks revenues 19 per cent, topping analyst expectations.The cable channel operator, which has enjoyed record ratings for its television dramas Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead, said profits more than doubled to $35m, or 49 cents per diluted share, on sales of $435m.AMC was lifted by a 31 per cent rise in advertising sales and a 9 per cent increase in fees distributors pay to transmit its channels. Its shares climbed 5.9 per cent to $73.75.Mylan, the generic drug manufacturer, led the benchmark S&P 500 after forecasting full-year sales would top Wall Street’s outlook.The company said sales would range between $7.8bn and $8.2bn with earnings of as much as $3.60 per share for the full year.Executives said they expected revenues in the firm’s injectables business, which includes the sale of vials and pre-filled syringes, would double in 2014.Management added they would work closely with the US Food and Drug Administration on the launch of several products.Mylan shares jumped 9.4 per cent to $56.27.Overall, equity markets drifted for their third straight day as durable goods orders fell less than many economists had feared and initial jobless claims worsened. They added some momentum by the end of the day.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,854.29 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.5 per cent to 16,272.65. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6 per cent to 4,318.93.
344;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-24T13:16:16Z;Netflix / Comcast: strange bedfellows;Relationships between Netflix and cable companies remain in flux;It’s easier to cheer for David than Goliath. That doesn’t make David right. On Sunday, Netflix and Comcast said they would establish “a more direct connection between Netflix and Comcast”. That is, Netflix will pay Comcast to ensure its video data moves faster.So, the disruptive content provider (yay!) is squeezed by the cable monopolist (boo!). Consumers root for the upstart – $7.99 a month is cheap for the wide, if slightly second-rate, slate of programming it delivers so conveniently, especially next to that $80 cable television package. But look at it another way: Comcast and its peers have invested billions in the infrastructure that makes fast internet possible (yay!) and Netflix free rides on that infrastructure (boo!), which is why it can charge its 32m US subscribers so little each month. Or how about this possibility: Comcast and Netflix have formed a cosy arrangement (boo x 2!). Comcast cuts Netflix a good deal, and Netflix keeps quiet as Comcast pushes its Time Warner Cable merger past the authorities.Because no financial details about the deal are available, interpretations proliferate. One thing is dead certain, though: the relationship between Netflix and the cable companies will remain fractious and in flux. Each side has problems to resolve. Netflix, with $3.6bn of revenue in 2013, had net income of $17m and negative free cash flow. It hasn’t shown that buying and producing content, then selling it at the current price, is a sustainable business. It needs to raise prices or add a lot more subscribers. It will fight to avoid the former and, if it does the latter, the pressure on cable companies’ TV businesses will increase. The cable companies, in turn, will need to charge Netflix or its customers still more for the growing stream of video traffic. Cheer for whom you like, and be assured: there is plenty of fighting still to come.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
345;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-24T00:41:29Z;Netflix to pay Comcast for better speeds;Faster streaming for cable operator customers;Netflix and Comcast have struck a landmark agreement for internet providers and content distribution companies, with Netflix agreeing to pay to ensure faster, smoother access to its library of programming for Comcast customers.Netflix is paying Comcast – which is in negotiations to buy Time Warner Cable in a $45bn deal – to attach “caching boxes”, or servers that can be deployed in local data centres, to the cable company’s broadband network, accelerating access speeds for Netflix customers.Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal follows last month’s court victory by Verizon, the telecoms group, over the Federal Communications Commission. A US court ruled that the regulator had over-reached its powers in enforcing so-called “net neutrality principles”.The ruling could clear the way for internet providers to charge fees to companies that send large amounts of data across their networks.The FCC said last week, however, that it planned to issue new rules in an attempt to prevent internet service providers from striking special deals with content companies for better delivery.The net neutrality principles have ensured that telecoms groups and internet providers charge the same rates to data and content providers regardless of the amount of data being downloaded or streamed.Netflix content accounts for about 30 per cent of downstream traffic in the US during peak periods and is among the companies which could be targeted.Netflix said the deal with Comcast, one of America’s largest broadband providers, was unrelated to the net neutrality ruling.The agreement was a “peering” deal, the company said on Sunday. “Netflix is not receiving preferential network treatment. This type of interconnection is common in the industry. What we want to do is give customers really good service so their stream is not getting buffered or slowing down.”The company already pays content delivery networks, such as Akamai, for access to larger broadband networks operated by the likes of Comcast. Under the deal struck with Comcast, Netflix will cut out the middleman and pay Comcast instead.The move to pay Comcast to take up Netflix’s “Open Connect” service comes as Netflix has been offering the service for free to European internet providers, such as Virgin Media.Following the deal, the company is likely to have to pay other large US internet providers to take up the service, said a person familiar with the matter.
346;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-23T16:46:21Z;Dish Network: a platter of choices;Satellite TV operator is facing challenges on several fronts;Charlie Ergen, chairman of satellite television provider Dish Network, was facing a tough time to start with. Pay TV already has high levels of penetration in the US and Dish has to compete with cable offerings that can bundle in the internet at faster speeds than satellite broadband can offer. Competition from the likes of Netflix and Hulu is also growing. Dish, the number three in the pay TV market, ended 2013 with 14.1m subscribers which is more or less where it has been since 2009. But as if this mature background was not enough, Dish now has to deal with the proposed union of Comcast and Time Warner Cable (numbers one and four in the market, respectively).To stay young and fresh, Dish has been buying wireless spectrum . And in share price terms at least, the move has paid off. In spite of the lack of growth prospects in the core satellite TV business, its shares have risen 65 per cent over the past year. But Dish’s strategy is not yet clear.One option would be to sell the spectrum to a big telecoms company, such as AT&T. Alternatively, it could use the spectrum to create its own wireless broadband services, although that would mean a longer route to realising value.But it could be part of a bigger plan to either sell the company entirely or else pursue a merger with fellow satellite TV provider DirecTV (the number two in the pay TV market). Such a deal has been talked about for some time and would make sense for the cost savings and the potential to create a stronger competitor to cable. There is debate over how the Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up would affect this prospect. It could herald more consolidation or, perhaps, throw a spanner in the works. If the Comcast/TWC deal secures approval, regulators may be less inclined to agree to further consolidation.At current levels, Dish’s stock is an option on a sale of the spectrum or the company, or a DirecTV merger. Anything else and investors are probably paying too much.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
347;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Charter prowls for deals after Comcast blow;;Charter Communications has not given up on its ambitions to grow through mergers and acquisitions after its hostile bid for Time Warner Cable was eclipsed last week by Comcast’s proposed $45.2bn friendly deal for the cable operator.Charter remains on the prowl for deals that would boost its base of about 4m subscribers, Tom Rutledge, Charter’s chief executive, said on Friday during a call with investors.“We are still interested in wisely acquiring subscribers through M&A when that opportunity arises,” he said. “If the landscape changes in such a way that we see opportunity, we will be opportunistic and take advantage of it.”Charter, the fourth-largest cable operator in the US by subscribers, is being forced to rethink its strategy after spending the past several months circling Time Warner Cable, advocating for consolidation of the fragmented US cable industry.Charter shares tumbled after news of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up last week and were trading at about $125 on Friday after previously hovering around $138.While Charter remains open to deal making, Mr Rutledge emphasised that the company’s main opportunity now lay in growing its business by increasing its penetration into the 7m homes it already passes. The company counts about 4.2m video subscribers and 4.4m broadband customers.“That is where the biggest ROI [return on investment] is. If Charter does that successfully, we will create enormous value for shareholders,” he said. “I don’t think the landscape changing precludes that opportunity.”His remarks came as Charter reported net income of $39m for the fourth quarter, up from a loss of $40m for the same period a year before. Revenues increased 12 per cent for the quarter to $2.1bn, thank to growth in video and internet sales.Industry executives have argued that consolidation would put cable companies in a better position to compete against satellite and telecom operators, as well as fend off the rising trend of “cord cutting”, as people cancel pay television subscriptions and turn to cheaper online streaming options such as Netflix and Amazon. Consolidation also could help cable operators in their battle with programmers against rising costs.“On the negative side of the ledger, however, there is still the nagging problem of programming cost. Absent a deal, it is hard to see what can stop the rise,” said Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson Research.Last May, John Malone’s Liberty Media spent $2.6bn on a 27 per cent stake in Charter. Within weeks, Liberty executives approached Time Warner Cable executives about a deal with Charter. Several advances were rejected until Charter made public a hostile cash-and-stock offer for Time Warner Cable valued at $132.50 a share. Comcast swooped in with an all-share bid worth $158.82 per share.News emerged last week that Charter had expressed interest in acquiring either some or all of the 3m subscribers that Comcast has pledged to release as part of its effort to persuade regulators to approve the proposed combination of the top two US cable operators.A Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up would control about a third of the US pay-television and broadband markets. Documents released last week showed that Comcast has promised not to agree to any such sales until late May at the earliest.Market rumours have suggested a possible follow-on deal involving Cox Communications, the third-largest US cable operator by subscribers, but the privately-held company has maintained that it is not for sale.
348;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-20T17:09:08Z;The tax credit that costs NY its cool;New York has lured The Tonight Show back after 42 years with a financial incentive;Events in New York this week reminded me of an old saying of Solomon Burke, the late great soul singer. “Sometimes you get what you want,” he said, “and you lose what you had.”I fear that was the case on Monday, when The Tonight Show – the late-night programme that has been running on the NBC television network since the first Eisenhower administration – resumed broadcasting from New York City after a sojourn of almost 42 years in Los Angeles.The show’s return was a big deal in these parts. It will provide new jobs in our entertainment industry – and cheer up older New Yorkers, who remember how sad it was to see Tonight and its host Johnny Carson leave for sunnier climes during the dark days of the early 1970s.But the new incarnation of the show, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, left this native New Yorker with mixed feelings. We got Tonight back by becoming more like other places, relying on our tax code rather than our cultural charms to attract business. NBC, owned by the cable company Comcast, only returned The Tonight Show to the city of its birth after the state of New York offered it financial incentives to do so. In its budget last year, the administration of Andrew Cuomo, New York’s governor, essentially created a tax credit – equal to 30 per cent of production costs – for the show.New York didn’t mention Tonight by name. But it didn’t have to. The state simply expanded an existing tax break for new television or film productions to include any “talk or variety show that filmed at least five seasons outside New York” before a studio audience of 200 people or more – which narrowed the field considerably.NBC has said it made a “creative” decision to produce Mr Fallon’s show in New York. But the network also has made clear it intends to apply for the relocation tax credit – which is “refundable”, meaning that if the show’s tax liability is less than the tax credit itself, it could receive cash from the state.Opinions differ on whether targeted tax breaks of this sort are good public policy. But my question is whether they will be helpful in fostering the long-term growth of New York’s creative industries.I’m enough of a man of the world to understand how tax come-ons can be used to lure hedge funds to remote islands or manufacturers to sweltering jungles. But I ask: did Jackson Pollock come to New York for a corporate tax credit? Did Duke Ellington, Martha Graham, Bob Dylan, John Belushi, Leonard Bernstein, Patti Smith, Piet Mondrian or Joseph Mitchell? Correct me if I’m wrong but I think not.Cool people come to New York because the neon lights are bright on Broadway, and there is always magic in the air. They come because if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. They come because New York, New York, is a helluva town.It even took more than tax attorneys and accountants to create a programme as successful as The Tonight Show. Like NBC’s long-running morning programme, Today, it was the brainchild of a television iconoclast called Pat Weaver, who died in 2002. The father of actor Sigourney Weaver, he helped reduce corporate influence over television content by selling advertising on a “magazine concept”, in which several sponsors paid for a programme rather than just one, as had been the practice during the days of radio.A freewheeling approach also marked the show during its glory years, when Carson’s desk became the centre of the US show business universe. Tonight’s host from 1962-92, Carson, who died in 2005, was one of the last American cultural figures able to appeal to just about everyone – even during the tumult of the 1960s and 1970s. As the writer Nora Ephron noted in 1967, he was “just sophisticated enough to talk to sophisticates, just hayseed enough to seem astounded by what they would tell him”.It will be interesting to see whether NBC gives Mr Fallon the freedom to be something more interesting than a New York tax break. He is a funny guy and he has potential. But he had barely made it past the eight-minute mark of his maiden voyage on Monday when he began cracking jokes about other NBC personalities – engaging in the kind of relentless cross-promotion that makes US network television so hard to bear.It was a bad sign. We used to have television stars in this town. Now all we get are exercises in corporate synergy.gary.silverman@ft.com
349;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Google eyes fibre expansion in US metro areas;;Google on Wednesday revealed ambitious plans to compete more directly with the US cable TV and telecoms industries as it said it wanted to build high-speed fibre optic networks in nine new US metropolitan areas covering 34 cities.The news came less than two weeks after cable company Comcast shocked the US communications industry with a $42.5bn agreement to buy rival Time Warner Cable, a deal that critics warn will tighten the stranglehold of a small number of companies on the nation’s broadband infrastructure.The Google announcement will provide ammunition for supporters of the deal, who will be able to point to it as evidence that greater competition is coming to broadband, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.“They just gift-wrapped a package to Comcast,” he added.Google’s announcement also came on the same day that the Federal Communications Commission said it was planning new net neutrality rules to keep US broadband networks open, after a Supreme Court ruling struck down its previous regulations.Google’s YouTube has become one of the biggest devourers of network capacity, making it a potential casualty of any move by existing broadband players to restrict services that do not pay a premium.Google has previously announced three experimental broadband networks, in Kansas City, Austin and Provo. On Wednesday, it said it had invited officials in nine metropolitan areas, covering 34 cities in all, to discuss proposals for networks in their regions as well. Of the 10 biggest metropolitan areas in the US, Atlanta was the only one to make the list.Explaining why Google announced its hoped-for network expansion before it has reached deals with any of the cities involved, Kevin Lo, general manager for the business, said it wanted to become involved at a very early stage with the planning reviews that would determine whether the cities wanted to back its plans.The first networks were seen as a shot across the broadband industry’s bow and a warning that Google would plough deeper in the market if it feared losing open access to users who depended on companies such as Comcast.The prospect that it would end up pouring billions of dollars into fibre optic networks unnerved investors three years ago, when the first experiment was announced. Since then, however, Wall Street has grown used to the idea that Google plans to make heavy investments as it expands beyond its original search business, Mr Wieser said.Some of the cities that Google has its sights on already have local cable systems run by Comcast or Time Warner Cable, putting Google on a collision course with the cable groups. These include Portland, Salt Lake City, Nashville and Atlanta, where Comcast has networks, and San Antonio, Charlotte and Raleigh, which fall within Time Warner Cable’s footprint.In a blog post, Milo Medin, vice-president of Google Access Services, said: “People are hungrier than ever for faster internet, and as a result, cities across America are making speed a priority.”

351;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-19T19:30:21Z;Comcast confident of TWC deal approval;;Comcast’s top lobbyist for shepherding the $45.2bn Time Warner Cable bid through the regulatory process has dismissed concerns that the deal would face significant antitrust challenges and predicted that officials will clear the transaction.David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice-president, told the Financial Times the acquisition of the second largest cable operator by the industry’s largest would not change the competitive landscape for current Comcast or TWC customers.His comments came as US politicians expressed reservations about the deal, which will face tough scrutiny from a bevy of regulators ranging from the Federal Communications Commission to state and local regulators.Comcast, already the biggest cable TV company in the US, has argued that it should be allowed to combine with number two TWC because the two companies do not compete on pay TV in local markets. “How are you worse off? You have one choice [now]. After the transaction, you have one choice. You are no better or worse off following the transaction than you were before,” Mr Cohen said.However, recent comments from politicians suggest they are also concerned about the combined company’s clout in the US broadband market, and will be looking more at the combined company’s total market share across both broadband and pay TV.“The proposed merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable could have a significant impact on competition in the video and broadband marketplace,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep Bob Goodlatte and Spencer Bachus, head of the Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Subcommittee. They will hold a hearing on the deal.John Malone, the US billionaire dubbed the “Cable Cowboy”, has begun planning his succession at Discovery Communications and Liberty Global by giving their chief executives right of first refusal if he decides to sell his stakes in the media companies.Continue readingThe combined company would have 54 per cent of cable broadband subscribers and 32.5 per cent of total US broadband customers, even after considering Comcast’s offer to divest of 3 million subscribers, according to MoffettNathanson research. Comcast disputes those estimates, and puts that figure around 25 per cent.The combined company will also face new competition in broadband from Google, which announced on Wednesday that it is expanding its high-speed Google Fibre network to 34 cities including Portland and Atlanta, where Comcast is active, and San Antonio, Charlotte and Raleigh where TWC offers services.Comcast’s Mr Cohen argues that the increase in his company’s share of the broadband market following the deal should not become a regulatory stumbling block.“Even if we have 50 per cent broadband market share, who cares?” he added. “We are not depriving any consumer of choice. There is no Time Warner Cable customer today that can buy Comcast broadband, and there is no Comcast customer that can buy Time Warner Cable broadband.”“Even if we have 50 per cent broadband market share, who cares? We are not depriving any consumer of choice.”Critics of the deal, he added, “are worried about our scale creating a vast highway that could charge Netflix or Google more, but that is illegal. It is illegal under the open Internet Order that we said we would extend to Time Warner Cable.”Still, it is likely that the concerns expressed by members of Congress will test Comcast’s deep political connections. Mr Cohen is a major fundraiser for the Democratic Party, has held events for President Obama at his home and attended the recent White House state dinner for French President François Hollande.
352;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-19T18:47:12Z;How to tackle the great American cable monopoly;The Federal Communications Commission has too often proved supine, writes Susan Crawford;What harm is there in merging Comcast, America’s biggest cable company, with Time Warner Cable, the second biggest? The trouble is not that it would create a slothful monopoly where once there was energetic competition. The industry has always been a patchwork of local monopolies. In 1997 the large operators reordered the map into a convenient tartan, with each controlling large contiguous territories. Leo Hindery, then chief executive of a cable company that was later absorbed by Comcast, called it the industry’s “summer of love”. These giants have never encroached on each other’s turf.When the industry’s main product was pay television, this did not seem quite so insidious. Satellite operators and terrestrial broadcasters offered rival forms of entertainment, and consumers could get calls and dial-up internet from their telephone company instead. But now the ribbons of cable knotted across America’s cities and suburbs have become pieces of essential infrastructure, akin to an electrical grid or clean water system. Internet access over copper telephone lines or mobile networks cannot keep pace with services such as high-definition streaming video. Verizon’s ambitious plans to roll out a high-speed fibre optic network have ground to a halt. For households that want high-capacity internet access at the highest speeds, there is no alternative but to sign up with the local cable monopoly.These companies are therefore under little pressure to cut prices or improve service. Americans are paying far too much for second-class service. For high-capacity connections, they pay more per megabyte than consumers in any developed country except Chile, Mexico and Turkey.That the country that was the birthplace of the internet should have fallen so far behind testifies to a monumental failure of regulation. Too often the Federal Communications Commission has proved supine. This will not change without action from political leaders in Washington. That would take real courage, given the political power wielded by Comcast. The company and its executives have donated extensively to both main parties.Yet all of this was true even before last Thursday when Comcast announced its proposed merger with Time Warner Cable. The trouble with the deal is not so much that it creates a monopoly seller of cable connections but that, by uniting two such monopolies, it creates a media empire that will wield immense power over many markets: internet access, applications such as telemedicine that use a lot of data, and television programming.Most Americans who have high-speed internet access also take a pay-TV package. Comcast’s vast subscriber base – which stands at 22m homes and would expand to 33m as a result of the deal – gives it serious clout with the networks that supply this programming. If an upstart began laying its own cables, it would be unlikely to gain access to programming on anything like the same terms. Comcast tries to preserve this advantage by driving subscribers into bundled services. People who take a TV package receive a large discount on internet access. This limits the appeal of internet streaming services such as Netflix as a substitute for cable TV. In effect, customers who shun their cable company’s TV offering end up paying twice because they have to buy expensive internet access in order to get access to their chosen service.Comcast’s advantage in content acquisition is not just a matter of price. As gatekeeper to such a large audience, it would be in a better position to demand onerous terms. We know from last year’s bust-up between Time Warner Cable and CBS, the television network, how these discussions go. The cable company was demanding constraints on CBS’s ability to distribute its content online, which would have made it harder for the cable companies’ rivals to obtain access to popular programmes. In the end TWC capitulated, signing an agreement that was more or less on CBS’s terms. Now that the cable companies have joined forces, they may not be defeated so easily.Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, has a problem. If he approves this deal he will be remembered as the former chief cable lobbyist who allowed the two largest operators to merge. If he blocks it, he will incur the wrath of two powerful entities while doing little to fix a market that is already broken.Instead, he should concentrate on encouraging new entrants to the market for internet access, as he did this week when he suggested that municipal fibre networks should be allowed. He is rightly seeking to replicate the efforts of many small communities across America to create their own wholesale fibre infrastructure. A similar approach has proved successful in Stockholm and Seoul. This would loosen the grip of the cable monopolies on America’s future.The writer, formerly the president’s special assistant for science, technology and innovation policy, is a visiting professor at Harvard Law School
353;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:22:32+0000;FCC plans new rules to free web traffic;Proposals follow adverse court decision;The US Federal Communications Commission will propose new “net neutrality” rules, prohibiting internet service providers from charging companies such as Netflix or YouTube to reach consumers at higher speeds or quality.The proposals comes just one month after a US court ruled the agency had over-reached in its powers in that area.The new measures would prevent internet service providers from striking special deals with content companies for better delivery. The rules would also prevent broadband services from blocking access to websites and discriminating against content providers.The proposals are part of the FCC’s effort to require internet service providers to treat all traffic equally, in what is known as net neutrality, a principal which was dealt a blow in a case brought by Verizon Communications to challenge the agency.The court, however, upheld the FCC’s authority to regulate some aspects of internet service provider practices, including requiring them to disclose how they manage traffic. The agency is using that authority to issue the new rules.A US court ruled in January that the Federal Communications Commission over-reached its powers in imposing “net neutrality” rules on internet service providers.Continue reading“Preserving the Internet as an open platform for innovation and expression while providing certainty and predictability in the marketplace is an important responsibility of this agency,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said.After the court ruling last month, the FCC said it would consider its options, including an appeal.But on Wednesday, the agency said it would not pursue additional legal action, and would continue to consider whether it could move to reclassify internet access as a telecommunications service – which the FCC could use to impose its internet rules.“The proposed FCC actions would enhance transparency for consumers so they know if and when their internet service provider is slowing down or blocking online content,” said Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, who co-sponsored a bill to restore the net neutrality rules after the court decision.FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai was critical of the agency’s move, saying “net neutrality has always been a solution in search of a problem”.“The internet was free and open before the FCC adopted net neutrality rules,” he said. “It remains free and open today“.The growing power of internet service providers is one of the concerns expressed by critics of Comcast’s $45.2bn bid for Time Warner Cable. Comcast has offered to extend net neutrality rules to TWC customers, as part of its efforts to win regulatory approval.“FCC chairman Wheeler has taken a thoughtful approach which creates a path for enforceable rules based on the appropriate authority outlined by the Court’s findings,” said David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice-president, who is in charge of guiding the TWC deal through the regulatory process. “We continue to be committed to work with Chairman Wheeler and the commission to play a constructive role going forward that will continue to allow the Internet to flourish.”The FCC will seek public comment and is aiming to finalise the rules in the next three months at the earliest.
354;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-19T03:35:30Z;US ‘Cable Cowboy’ John Malone begins succession planning;;John Malone, the US billionaire dubbed the “Cable Cowboy”, has begun planning his succession at Discovery Communications and Liberty Global by giving their chief executives right of first refusal if he decides to sell his stakes in the media companies.Both companies have dual class share structures that give Mr Malone control. In separate regulatory filings, the billionaire gave David Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery, and Michael Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global, the option to buy his voting rights, or match a final offer from another potential buyer, should he choose to sell.Mr Malone said he was “thrilled” to have reached agreements with Mr Zaslav and Mr Fries. “Nothing is changing right now,” he said. “I have no plans to transfer any of my voting shares and plan on staying actively involved in both Liberty Global and Discovery Communications.”“But, in the event that I do in the future decide to pursue the sale of my voting position, I am excited about providing these two strong executives . . . with a path toward acquiring that stake.”Mr Malone controls one of the largest collection of media assets and is one of the sector’s most prolific dealmakers. Liberty Media, which is focused on US media companies, has in the past few years spun off the Starz cable channel, taken control of Sirius XM satellite radio and acquired a 27 per cent of Charter Communications.Mr Malone intended Charter to be the vehicle for the purchase of Time Warner Cable but was outbid last week by Comcast in a deal that valued TWC at about $45bn.Liberty Global, which is focused on Europe, has spent close to $30bn in the past two years acquiring cable companies such as Ziggo in the Netherlands and Virgin Media in the UK.Discovery Communications, meanwhile, owns cable channels such as TLC, Animal Planet and OWN, its joint venture with Oprah Winfrey.Mr Zaslav could make about $110m this year after agreeing a new contract with Discovery that will keep him with the media group until 2019.Under his deal, Mr Zaslav will receive 1m performance-based restricted stock units that could boost his total earnings to $110m, although the final total could fluctuate with the performance of Discovery shares.
355;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-17T18:57:52Z;Television: More power to the cord;Comcast’s bid for Time Warner Cable is raising consumer concerns over broadband pricing;Marshall Maher is wreaking havoc on the media business. The 38-year-old Manhattan marketing executive is an avid television watcher. He is a fan of the Netflix original political drama House of Cards, keeps up with the HBO series True Detective and calls Sunday Morning, the weekly news programme on broadcaster CBS, “like church for me.”But Mr Maher has not paid for a traditional television subscription for two years. After subscribing to a Time Warner Cable video package for several years, he cancelled the service, cutting his bill from about $140 a month to the $45 he pays the cable operator for high-speed internet.While the cable company used to provide him with CNN, sports network ESPN and dozens of other channels as part of the monthly package, Mr Maher has customised his own programming menu. He is able to watch the programmes he wants to watch when he wants to watch them using a Google Chromecast digital media player, an $8 a month Netflix subscription, the Amazon Prime streaming service, his parents’ password for the HBO GO TV app and a digital antenna for free, over-the-air broadcasts.“The proliferation of options just started to reach a tipping point,” he says. “There just seemed to be so many tools that you could use to cobble together a similar or even better experience without all the fat. I’m opting out of a broken system.”Mr Maher is not the only one. In the past two years, about 1.4m customers cut their video subscription with Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable operator in the US. Millions more have cancelled their video services with other providers. These so-called cord cutters, along with a broader transformation in how people watch television, are a growing threat to the foundations of the media industry, upsetting the balance of power between television distributors, programmers and viewers.Last week, Comcast, the cable industry leader, made a move to win that power back, announcing a $45bn deal to acquire Time Warner Cable. The combination of the top two US cable operators would control about a third of the country’s video and broadband customers. It is expected to face close regulatory scrutiny.The tie-up could help the cable group regain leverage over programmers, which have seen the value of their content surge with the proliferation of new outlets such as Netflix. It would also give it a national platform to create a stronger competitor to Netflix and Amazon, as well as more control over the broadband networks that the online streaming services need.The companies are all fighting to secure their piece of the $143bn US television market and $387bn global television market for today and the future. The fallout is likely to have broad ramifications on TV and internet innovation in the US that are likely to ripple across the world.“The world changes very rapidly with technology. Over the last 25 years we’ve seen that, and it’s accelerating its pace of change,” Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, said last week. “Our company wants to evolve and help lead that change. I think we’re uniquely in a position to do that and to accelerate.”Consumer advocates fear that a Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up would place too much power in the hands of one company. (Comcast also owns NBCUniversal, the entertainment group.) They fear that the combined company would push up the prices of video and broadband services and exert more control over television networks and internet connectivity speeds.Some analysts question whether the deal as it is currently structured would receive the green light from regulators. Already, some lawmakers have expressed caution.“Of course, the threshold question must be whether the creation of an even larger video and broadband juggernaut results in greater choice and lower rates for consumers. This has not been my experience with previous mergers of this size,” says Senator John Rockefeller, chairman of the commerce committee.When Mr Roberts’s father Ralph Roberts founded the company in Tupelo, Mississippi, in 1963, the cable industry comprised tens of thousands of local franchises that did not overlap. The technical infrastructure required to lay cables meant that cable operators were the only show in town for people who wanted to pay for television subscriptions.The cable industry gradually consolidated. Comcast emerged as the largest, amassing almost 22m video subscribers. But the cable companies retained their monopolistic hold over local regions, barely competing in the same towns and cities. Comcast and Time Warner Cable, for instance, do not operate in any of the same postcodes across the US.That dynamic has changed. Cable companies now face competition from satellite providers, such as Dish and DirecTV, and telecoms, such as Verizon and AT&T, that are now offering video. At the same time, the cable companies are battling the rise of cord cutters.That rivalry has been a boon for television programmers. Each new television service is seeking to lure customers with an ever more robust line-up of programming, increasing the demand for quality content. Programmers are telling distributors to pay up.Content costs for distributors are soaring, increasing 8.9 per cent across the cable industry in the third quarter, according to Nomura. This is putting pressure on the profit margins of cable operators, which are raising subscription rates and emphasising broadband to keep growing.“This is the golden age for content companies that have the best programming,” said Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, the media group, which last week announced that its revenues rose 8 per cent in 2013. Record growth was fuelled through digital streaming deals and international syndication, among other sources.People are watching more television than before, but not just on a couch with a remote control in hand. The average American spends a total of 37.9 hours a week – or more than 1.5 days – watching video on traditional televisions, the internet and mobile phones, according to Nielsen, the measurement group.“The good news is that we are just beginning to find a whole new set of ways to monetise our programming on new platforms” such as Amazon, Netflix and Hulu, Mr Moonves said.…The benefits of the new internet platforms for traditional programmers are neatly demonstrated by a decision CBS took in 2009. The company shocked the media world when it pulled Without a Trace, the successful police drama, from its primetime line-up.The programme, which followed a missing persons unit, was attracting viewers and making money. Yet costs for the show, then in its eighth year, were almost $4m an episode. And CBS owned just half of the programme, which meant it made less money on syndication deals.So CBS pulled Without a Trace and slotted in The Good Wife, a new legal and political drama series that cost just $2m an episode – and CBS owned 100 per cent of it.If The Good Wife could attract comparable ratings, CBS executives would have a more profitable asset on their hands that would continue delivering revenues for years to come.The bet paid off, but in more ways than most television executives imagined in 2009. At the time, the market for digital video had just started taking off. Netflix had launched its streaming service but it was largely a perk for its DVD subscribers. Amazon had yet to launch a rival streaming service. Apple’s iPad tablet had yet to hit the market.Today, CBS makes money on the programme on traditional television and a web of digital outlets. The Good Wife attracts millions of viewers each week for its traditional television broadcast. CBS also streams the programme via its mobile app and sells the rights to subscription video and on-demand services, including Amazon and Hulu Plus, a basic cable network, local broadcasters and international distributors.“A hit show for us goes on forever and continues to pay dividends,” said Joe Ianniello, chief operating officer at CBS. “It’s like a snowball rolling down the hill.”Cable companies and other distributors are now trying to keep that snowball from turning into an avalanche.“The history of the business is replete with the industry solving its Balkanisation and scale problem through joint effort. I think it can be done again,” said Liberty Media’s John Malone, who led a wave of consolidation in the 1980s and 1990s. (Liberty backed a hostile offer from Charter Communications to acquire Time Warner Cable until it was trumped by Comcast last week.)Television distributors and programmers historically worked together to promote industry growth. But cable groups and programmers have fought increasingly frequent public battles over the rising price of content.…Last summer, a battle between Time Warner Cable and CBS led to the channel going dark for millions of customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas for about a month. Time Warner Cable lost 306,000 of its 11.7m residential video customers. It was one of more than 80 broadcaster blackouts in the past two years.“The water is boiling now,” said Todd Juenger, a media industry analyst with Bernstein Research.Industry executives say cable companies could have far greater bargaining power with programmers if they had a near-national US footprint, as Comcast-Time Warner Cable would. Comcast executives play this down, saying only a “distinct minority” of the $1.5bn in savings expected would stem from programming costs.Scale would also help the company develop technologies to compete with digital, satellite TV and phone companies – and stem the advance of the cord cutters. Comcast now offers Streampix, a streaming service at $4.99 a month, that offers unlimited access to television programmes and films on TV, tablets and smartphones.“They should be able to create a far more serious competitor,” said Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research.But Mr Greenfield cautions that regulators might seek to limit Comcast’s ability to compete with rivals such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Some cord cutters worry that a Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal will lead to higher prices, fewer options and bad customer service. In an industry with a reputation for dismal service, Comcast and Time Warner Cable rank at the bottom of customer satisfaction studies.“When two giant companies merge, in particular these two, I don’t think it has got to do with delivering better, more efficient programming to customers,” Mr Maher adds.——————————————-Broadband speeds: US pays more for slower online accessIn the US, customers are paying higher prices for internet speeds that fall far behind other countries across the globe.Comcast subscribers in San Francisco, for instance, in 2013 paid $114.95 a month for download speeds of 105 megabits per second. By comparison, in Seoul, the South Korean capital, people paid $31.47 for download speeds of 1,000 megabits per second, according to the New America Foundation.Industry observers attribute the slow speeds and higher prices to a relative lack of competition for broadband.In many US markets, consumers have few choices for a provider other than their local cable operator. Research shows that in markets where more companies offer competing services – such as Kansas City, where Google is deploying a new fibre broadband project – prices drop and speeds increase.As cable operators face dwindling numbers of video subscribers, they are becoming increasingly reliant on their broadband businesses, with many increasing prices.“Many American consumers take high prices and slow speeds to be a given, but our data demonstrates that it is possible to have faster, more affordable connectivity in cities of comparable density and size,” the New America Foundation said in a recent report.“Our data also shows that the most affordable and fast connections are available in markets where consumers can choose between at least three competitive service providers.”The worry among consumer advocates is that a combination of Comcast and Time Warner Cable will reduce competition, not increase it. They also express concern that an industry behemoth would start charging more for access to the web, impose usage caps and slow speeds for online streaming outlets such as Netflix and Amazon.John Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, says: “At a time when the future of video is increasingly online, policy makers have to weigh very carefully the ability of big companies to leverage their control of the internet to shape how Americans access and receive content and to limit new consumer-centric video services.”
356;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-14T22:50:16Z;Charter looks for way back into Time Warner Cable deal;;Charter Communications has expressed interest in picking up some or all of the 3m subscribers that Comcast could sell to help persuade regulators to clear its proposed $42.5bn acquisition of Time Warner Cable.Comcast eclipsed Charter’s hostile bid for TWC with a friendly deal agreed on Wednesday night. In an effort to smooth relations, the industry leader opened lines of communication with its wrongfooted rival on Thursday, according to people familiar with the discussions.Comcast told Charter that it could not negotiate over the disposal of those 3m subscribers for months. Deal documents released on Thursday show Comcast pledged not to agree any such sales until late May at the earliest.US cable heavyweights have spent nearly nine months haggling over the consolidation of the patchwork industry, plotting competing deals to reshape America’s video and broadband industries.Charter had made an unsolicited $132.50 cash-and-stock offer before Comcast countered with an all-share bid, worth $158.82 before its stock fell on Thursday and $154.38 on Friday.Industry experts doubt that it will return with a full counterbid for TWC, led by Rob Marcus, although people familiar with the company said it had not ruled out any option.Charter, the fourth-largest cable operator in the US with about 4m subscribers, missed out on the opportunity to nearly quadruple its footprint with TWC’s 11m subscribers in highly sought-after markets, such as New York and Los Angeles. But a deal to acquire 3m more customers also would increase the company’s heft.Speculation about a possible follow-on deal has swirled around Cox Communications, the third-largest US cable operator by subscribers, but the privately held company reiterated on Friday that it was not for sale.Some analysts have pegged Cox as a potential buyer for the assets that Comcast would divest in the TWC deal.Comcast has promised annual cost savings of $1.5bn from combining with TWC. Its shares were up 1.4 per cent at $53.70 on Friday having fallen 4 per cent on Thursday.TWC’s shares rose about 0.8 per cent to $146 on Friday after climbing 7 per cent on Thursday, but remained at a discount to the value of Comcast’s offer because of investor caution about a drawn-out regulatory review.Comcast could control what viewers get to watch on TV. And this could lead to higher pricing, which is already a serious concern in the cable industryThe combination of the two largest US cable operators would control about a third of the US pay-television and broadband markets, potentially strengthening Comcast in negotiations with traditional broadcasters and newer digital services such as Netflix. SNL Kagan said it would account for nearly 61 per cent of all US cable video subscribers.Analysts were split over whether the Comcast-TWC deal as it is now structured would be approved given the influence the combined company would have on which television networks it carries, internet connectivity speeds and other issues.“Comcast could control what viewers get to watch on TV. And this could lead to higher pricing, which is already a serious concern in the cable industry,” said Dave Novosel, analyst at independent corporate bond research service Gimme Credit. “Comcast could also regulate the speed at which (internet data) travels. Therefore Comcast could exert greater pressure on companies such as Netflix.”Comcast contends that the deal would usher in new technologies and services for consumers and not eliminate competition, as it now does not compete with TWC in any geography. Comcast expects to learn within about two weeks which regulatory agency will take the lead on what is expected to be a protracted review.The Federal Trade Commission has traditionally reviewed cable deals, but the Department of Justice led the review of Comcast’s acquisition of entertainment group NBCUniversal.Senator John Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, said that the proposed deal “raises serious questions that deserve thorough scrutiny”. He added: “Of course, the threshold question must be whether the creation of an even larger video and broadband juggernaut results in greater choice and lower rates for consumers. This has not been my experience with previous mergers of this size.”Additional reporting by Gina Chon
357;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-14T20:58:16Z;Comcast’s Roberts lines up TWC deal on Russian slopes;;It was in confident mood that several of the senior bankers on Charter Communications’ deal team headed to the slopes of Utah last Saturday for a long weekend of skiing and networking.The low-key event was hosted by Aryeh Bourkoff, the dealmaker whose Liontree boutique had been instrumental in forming Charter’s audacious and unsolicited multibillion-dollar bid to take control of its larger rival, Time Warner Cable.The assembled bankers, media executives and celebrities discussed the challenges facing the US media industry between turns down the languorous pistes that run through the Deer Valley resort.Even the pessimists among them would not have guessed that half way across the world in Sochi, the Russian ski resort hosting this year’s Winter Olympics, Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, was ironing out the final details of a bid that would all but destroy Charter’s takeover attempt.By Thursday morning, Comcast had gone public with its own offer for TWC. A $42.5bn, all-share bid valuing the company at $158.82 per share, that eclipsed Charter’s offer of $132.50 a share and won the agreement of a TWC management team that had been under siege for months from Charter’s hostile approach.Comcast, already the largest US cable television and broadband company, had been widely considered to be out of the running to make a counter bid. Just weeks before, it appeared to be working alongside Charter on an agreement that would have seen it take on some of the subscribers Charter would have to divest in order to win approval for a TWC acquisition.The sudden turn of events caught Charter’s deal team and the market off guard, and marked a huge victory for Barclays, JPMorgan and Paul Taubman, the veteran dealmaker, all of whom had been quietly working on Comcast’s solo bid.If it gets through what is likely to be a heated regulatory process, Comcast’s takeover of TWC will rank as the largest M&A deal so far this year, and the third largest since the financial crisis. It would be the 10th largest US M&A deal on record and the third-largest deal in the media and entertainment sector in history.Comcast’s financial advisers stand to make $51m to $68m in fees, according to estimates from Freeman & Company, and will enjoy the bragging rights of shooting up the M&A league tables in an otherwise placid year for dealmaking.Mr Taubman, in particular, stands to benefit hugely. As a lone operator, he will collect a large fee for himself. The win will be made all the sweeter by the fact that he left Morgan Stanley, TWC’s main financial adviser, less than 18 months ago after losing out on the top investment banking job.The deal would also be a huge victory for Rob Marcus, TWC’s recently installed chief executive, who stands to make an exit package of at least $50m if replaced and would be vindicated in his stance that the company he runs is worth about $160 a share.Charter’s deal team, which has been led by Mr Bourkoff and Goldman Sachs, has not ruled out another twist in the slalom-like race to consolidate America’s cable industry, however.Charter is already eyeing the possibility of bidding for the 3m subscribers Comcast has said it will divest if the deal goes through. That, in itself, would be a significant deal for a company with less than 5m subscribers, but would be a small consolation for the dealmakers who watched Comcast overtake them on the slopes.
358;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Letter from Lex: expectation management;The week turned out to be full of surprises;"Readers,Cast your mind back to last weekend. Predictions for the week ahead might have gone something like this: Charter and Time Warner Communications would continue to spar about the former’s offer for the latter; talk about the future of Nestlé’s stake in L’Oréal would rumble on but ultimately go nowhere as it always does; and Barclays would use its results to confirm that it is cracking down on pay.So, that all worked out well, didn’t it?The week turned out to be full of surprises. In the US, Comcast launched its own all-share offer for TWC, leaving Charter looking like a jilted fiancée. Still, John Malone, whose Liberty Media backs Charter, is still waiting in the sidelines. So are the regulators. More twists loom.The Nestlé/L’Oréal situation also sprung a surprise of sorts with the Swiss chocolate maker finally cutting its 29 per cent stake in the make-up group. Nestlé still owns 23 per cent though, and given the absence of economic or industrial logic for the holding, it should look to get rid of it entirely.Over at Barclays, any shareholders hoping that big pay packages were a thing of the past were disappointed. Tuesday’s results brought the unappetising combination of lower profits and higher bonuses. Chief executive Antony Jenkins has a tough job trying to please everyone, and could do with a bit of help from the economy.There were other companies that reminded shareholders to expect the unexpected, and not in a good way:•Rolls-Royce shares fell 14 per cent as it said that profits from its defence aerospace business would fall by a fifth this year.•Tate & Lyle complained of price wars in the artificial sweetener market. That will dent performance in its high margin speciality foods division. Down went the shares by 15 per cent.•Falling prices are also a problem for Yara, a Norway-based fertiliser maker. Its profits in the final quarter of 2013 were half the level of the same period in 2012.•In the oil sector, shares in Tullow fell even though its results had been trailed in a trading update last month. Perhaps investors had priced in better news on the exploration front.•And proving that disappointments are not limited to Europe, US retailer Whole Foods reported slowing rates of sales growth. Competition from both other specialists and mainstream grocers is intensifying.Predictions for next week? None from here. But if you come across any, take them with a large pinch of salt.Oliver Ralph, Deputy Head of Lex"
359;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-14T11:25:19Z;Squash-playing Comcast chief Brian Roberts no stranger to battle;;As a keen squash player who won gold at the Maccabiah Games – also known as the Jewish Olympics – Brian Roberts knows something about outplaying a competitor at close quarters.This week the chief executive of Comcast, the world’s largest media company by market capitalisation, did just that when he landed what could be a knockout bid for Time Warner Cable.Comcast’s all-share bid, which values its smaller rival at $42.5bn, trumped a lower offer from Charter Communications, backed by John Malone’s Liberty Media, which had been pushing for a deal with Time Warner Cable for several months.Although the deal will face antitrust scrutiny, analysts expect it to be cleared by regulators if Comcast makes significant concessions and disposals.For Mr Roberts the deal is the third multibillion-dollar acquisition he has masterminded for the Philadelphia-based company. Comcast was founded by his father in 1963 with the purchase of a 1,200-subscriber Mississippi cable television system. In 2001 he led the $50bn merger of Comcast with AT&T Broadband in a deal that laid the foundation for the company’s fastest growing business – internet provision. A decade later, Comcast snapped up NBCUniversal in a deal that eventually valued the broadcaster at about $30bn.As his Maccabiah triumph shows, the younger Mr Roberts, who first interned at Comcast aged 15, has a competitive streak: his squash gold medal came in 2005 and followed silver medal wins at the four previous games. He played squash while studying at University of Pennsylvania but given his height and slight frame he was put on a weightlifting programme by his trainer, Al Molloy, a coach revered in squash circles.Mr Molloy’s job was to toughen up Mr Roberts who, according to a Sports Illustrated profile from 2000, “had a pretty stroke, but an opponent could get in his head and provoke him to the edge of tears”. Mr Molloy wrote “No Pain, No Gain” on a blackboard in the locker room: the mantra was adopted by Mr Roberts in his professional life.“Aside from my father, no man has influenced me more than Al Molloy,” Mr Roberts once said. “If you’re going to accomplish something in business, you have to be tough, physically and mentally. Al gave me that.”This approach has served him well. In 1990 he was appointed president of Comcast, when the company was generating annual revenues of $657m. Since then, through a series of canny acquisitions, organic growth and the explosion of demand for internet services, revenues have grown to more than $64bn.Not all of his big moves have come off. A $54bn bid for Walt Disney in 2004 that aimed to marry Comcast’s distribution with Disney’s content was rejected by Disney.He had more luck in 2011 when he successfully acquired NBCUniversal, which owns the NBC broadcast network, CNBC, the largest business cable network in the US, and other assets, including the MSNBC news network and Universal Studios.Aside from my father, no man has influenced me more than Al Molloy. If you’re going to accomplish something in business, you have to be tough, physically and mentally. Al gave me thatNBC owns the rights to broadcast the Olympics and it was in Russia, at the Winter Games, that Mr Roberts negotiated the Time Warner Cable deal, outplaying his rival, the so-called “cable cowboy”, Mr Malone.Mr Roberts’ political clout has increased as his company has grown in size. He has played golf with President Barack Obama on Martha’s Vineyard, while David Cohen, Comcast’s chief lobbyist, has held fundraising events at his home for the president.A Philadelphia native, Mr Roberts continues to live in the city. Comcast is headquartered there: Ed Rendell, a former mayor and governor of Pennsylvania, once said the company had become as important to Philadelphia as Coca-Cola is to Atlanta.Its importance to Mr Roberts’ home city – and to the US media landscape – will only increase if the Time Warner Cable acquisition is approved.
360;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-14T07:23:47Z;TWC shareholders hope for benefits beyond Comcast’s bid;;"Hedge fund manager John Paulson says he plans to keep his stake in Comcast if its $42.5bn all-share bid for Time Warner Cable goes through, in anticipation that the deal will be even better for the combined companies than Comcast is promising.Paulson & Co snapped up 6m shares of TWC late last year when takeover rumours began to swirl, at an average price between $115 and $120 per share.That means the fund was sitting on a paper profit of about $160m at close of trading on Thursday, but Mr Paulson says his fund will not move quickly to cash in the gain.“This was just the end-game we had hoped for,” he said. “Comcast is an outstanding company, it was the most logical buyer for TWC, and the deal creates an even more valuable company. My goal would be to swap the TWC stake and then keep the Comcast shares.”Paulson & Co was the first large TWC shareholder to publicly cheer the outcome of a bid battle that began last summer when it first emerged that Charter Communications, the smaller US cable outfit backed by John Malone’s Liberty Media, had made unsolicited approaches to the company.On Wednesday night, Charter’s hostile cash-and-stock offer was trumped by Comcast, which promised annual cost savings of $1.5bn from combining with TWC.Comcast shares fell 4 per cent on Thursday; TWC’s rose 7 per cent, but remained at a discount to the value of the takeover bid because of investor caution about the prospect of a drawn-out regulatory review of a deal that would combine the two largest US cable operators.Mr Paulson predicted that there would be revenue benefits for the enlarged group that were not being factored into Comcast’s pitch to investors. “This is a company that underestimates and overdelivers,” he said.Several other major shareholders agreed, suggesting an enlarged Comcast-TWC company would be able to charge higher prices to advertisers and begin selling telecoms services to new, larger corporate customers.Another institutional investor with shares in both companies said TWC investors “didn’t mind throwing the keys over” to management at Comcast, because of their better record and the hope the new owners could both improve TWC’s network and introduce higher-tech products and services for TWC customers.One top 20 Charter shareholder predicted a volatile period ahead, however, before such benefits would begin to flow.As a keen squash player who won gold at the Maccabiah Games – also known as the Jewish Olympics – Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, knows something about outplaying a competitor at close quartersContinue reading…“First we have to get through a year of regulatory purgatory, including catfights in Washington, followed by the mashing together of cultures and cost cutting that may cause morale issues,” the shareholder said.Noting the 4.1 per cent fall in Comcast’s shares on Thursday, he added: “A lot of ‘hot money’ Comcast shareholders voted with their feet by walking out the door, but the long-term story is still intact.”A Financial Times poll of five shareholders with top 20 stakes in the companies found none that expected the deal to be blocked outright by regulators, although most expected an intense period of political scrutiny.Peter Langerman, at Franklin Mutual Advisers, which has 4.5m TWC shares, said he expected “lots of talk, lots of axes to be ground by various constituencies, but ultimately this deal is not inimical to the interests of the consumer or the viewer”."
361;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-13T22:56:12Z;Comcast and TWC throw down $42bn challenge;;"Comcast and Time Warner Cable threw down a $42.5bn gauntlet to Washington regulators on Thursday, with a deal that would create a pay television and broadband giant nearly seven times larger than any rival US cable operator.The agreed, all-stock offer would bring together the two largest operators in an industry whose traditional video revenues face pressure from rivals ranging from Verizon to Netlflix, but whose growth and pricing power increasingly stems from its grip on America’s broadband infrastructure.The unexpected $158.82 per share offer from Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, wrongfooted a rival bid from Charter Communications, whose $132.50 hostile pursuit of TWC had been backed by “cable cowboy” John Malone’s Liberty Media.Mr Roberts, who conducted negotiations from the snowfields of Sochi, where he is overseeing the Comcast-owned NBC network’s Winter Olympics coverage, defended the deal as one that would create economies of scale that would spur TV and internet innovation.Shares in TWC closed on Thursday at $144.81, up 7 per cent on the previous day’s close but well below the $158.82 per share headline price of Comcast’s offer because of expectations that the deal will face a lengthy antitrust battle.Analysts said the combined company could control about a third of the US pay-TV and broadband markets.Michael Copps, a former Democratic member of the Federal Communications Commission, said the deal would turn the “already oversized Comcast empire into a colossus” that would leave consumers paying more for declining service.“This is so over the top that it ought to be dead on arrival at the FCC,” he said. The House judiciary committee said it would hold hearings and Al Franken, a Democratic member of the Senate judiciary committee, told CNN the TWC acquisition would hurt competition and consumers.But Mr Roberts said his company was prepared to divest 3m subscribers to satisfy regulators.Some large shareholders applauded the deal. Paulson & Co., the hedge fund that owns 6m shares of TWC, branded it a “dream combination” that “delivers full value in an all-stock deal from the most capable acquirer.”Shares in Comcast, which also expanded its share buyback programme to $10bn, ended Thursday 4.1 per cent lower at $52.97, reducing the value of its bid. The offer includes no break fee, raising the possibility of either side walking away.Charter’s shares fell more than 6 per cent. One person close to Charter said it felt “duped” by Comcast’s behaviour, adding. “Why did they wait until we had gone hostile before showing their colours?”Why does Comcast want to drop $45bn on Time Warner Cable?Continue readingMr Roberts said Comcast-TWC would “not reduce competition in any relevant market” because the two companies did not overlap “in any of the same zip codes.”Consumer advocates called the deal “disastrous” for the unprecedented market power a combined company would have over TV, voice and internet services. They fear that the company could increase prices and exert undue influence over people’s access to media.“Americans already hate dealing with the cable gu– — and both these giant companies regularly rank among the worst of the worst in consumer surveys,” said Craig Aaron, chief executive of Free Press, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group. “But this deal would be the cable guy on steroids – pumped up, unstoppable and grasping for your wallet.”Comcast is the largest cable operator in the US with 53m total customer relationships and a $143bn market capitalisation. TWC has about 15m total customers and a market capitalisation of $37.6bn.The companies said the deal would generate operating cost savings of $1.5bn, with half created in the first year.Comcast may have been emboldened to offer an all-share deal, traditionally less appealing to investors than a cash bid, because of the substantial overlap between its shareholders and those of Time Warner Cable. Seven institutions are in the top 10 holders of both companies; 14 investors are common to the top 20 holders of both.Additional reporting by Stephen Foley"
362;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-13T19:04:32Z;TWC battle will test Comcast’s regulatory skills;;"Comcast and Time Warner Cable are already the two most powerful companies in an industry that is unpopular with consumers and critical to America’s digital future. Combining the two to create a pay-TV and broadband giant far larger than any rival is sure to provoke tough scrutiny from regulators, politicians and consumer groups.As Charter Communications, their smaller rival, pursued TWC for six months, some analysts assumed the regulatory hurdles would be simply too high for Comcast to try a bid of its own. Yet the early reaction to its $45.2bn offer was that a deal is possible if the companies are sufficiently patient and creative with the concessions they offer.Comcast’s $30bn deal for NBCUniversal in 2011, which combined the country’s largest television distributor with one of its largest programmers, seemed to face similar obstacles. But its success cemented Comcast’s reputation as an astute political player.David Cohen, the Comcast official who guided the NBCUniversal transaction through the regulatory thicket, is known for his influential Washington connections, including President Barack Obama, for whom he has held fundraising events at his house.The Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal needs antitrust approval from the US justice department or the Federal Trade Commission. It also needs clearance from the US Federal Communications Commission, whose mandate includes the public interest, and from state and local regulators. Hearings in Congress are also likely.But experts said Comcast was starting off on the right foot by offering to give up 3m subscribers, extend open internet access rules to Time Warner Cable customers and offer broadband packages to low-income consumers. Mr Cohen said the companies had not yet discussed which systems would be divested.“It’s very smart of the company to put those offers forward, showing that they are being extremely proactive to mitigate any concerns that regulators might have,” said Helgi Walker, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and a former FCC staffer: “That won’t stop the FCC from asking for more. But it’s a sophisticated approach.”Regulators have blocked some recent deals outright and demanded more concessions before approving others. In an unusual move, the DoJ’s top antitrust official, Bill Baer, recently publicly voiced doubts about the benefits of a mooted Sprint takeover of T-Mobile, which would cut the number of mobile competitors.Comcast and Time Warner Cable emphasised that their networks do not overlap. That means the deal is not a simple horizontal merger, legal experts said, and horizontal mergers are more vulnerable to being blocked by antitrust officials.But content providers, broadcast networks, and others such as Netflix and Amazon which rely on Comcast and TWC to reach viewers may be worried about the power of a larger Comcast.Clashes over rising content costs have led to more than 80 broadcaster blackouts in the past two years, including a month-long CBS blackout for TWC customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas last summer.Comcast will have unprecedented market power over consumers …No one woke up this morning wishing their cable company was biggerMr Cohen said the deal would not have a dramatic impact on its bargaining power with programmers and said only a “distinct minority” of the $1.5bn in estimated synergies from the deal would come from programming savings.He said Comcast could not promise that customers’ bills would decrease, but said consumers would not be hurt by the deal.US cable operators also face growing video and broadband competition from satellite and telecoms providers such as DirecTV, Dish, AT&T and Verizon. They also are battling a rising tide of “cord cutters”, people who cancel pay-TV subscriptions for cheaper online video streaming options.Comcast contends that a combination with TWC will not change the competitive environment because telecoms and satellite rivals would still face the same number of competitors in each market. A combined entity would invest in cutting-edge video and broadband services, added Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive.The deal presented “a lot fewer” competition issues than the NBCUniversal transaction did, Mr Cohen added.Paul Taubman’s retirement lay in tatters on Thursday. The veteran dealmaker, who quit Morgan Stanley in 2012 after narrowly missing out on the top investment banking job, has had little time to watch his beloved Yankees; even less to practise his golf swing.Continue reading“It may sound scary,” he said, but the company would control less than 30 per cent of the multi-channel market in local marketplaces, he argued, “and that’s always been the flashpoint for the government to be concerned.”Comcast’s ambitions to close the Time Warner Cable deal by December may be unrealistic, however. The NBC deal took just over a year to get approved even though it was considered a vertical merger, which is less likely to be blocked by antitrust officials.Consumer advocates lambasted the Comcast-TWC deal, calling it disastrous for consumers. The combination could raise prices for consumers and would put too much control over the media in the hands of one company, said Craig Aaron, chief executive of Free Press, the Washington advocacy group.“Comcast will have unprecedented market power over consumers and an unprecedented ability to exert its influence over any channels or businesses that want to reach Comcast’s customers,” Mr Aaron said.Comcast and TWC rank at the bottom of customer service satisfaction studies by JD Power and others. “No one woke up this morning wishing their cable company was bigger,” Mr Aaron said.The last big US deal to be blocked outright was AT&T’s 2011 attempt to buy T-Mobile USA. People familiar with that deal said AT&T made the mistake of being arrogant, thinking its lobbying power in DC could win over the justice department and the FCC, which both voiced their disapproval.The FCC is now run by Tom Wheeler, a former cable lobbyist who has said he would have approved the T-Mobile deal if AT&T agreed to various new regulations. But a person familiar with the FCC said there were strong reservations about a Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up and the deal would be closely scrutinised."
363;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-13T18:43:52Z;TWC / Comcast valuation: Easy as pie;All-stock mergers must be evaluated on ownership split;There are plenty of dubious ways to evaluate an all-stock merger of the type Comcast and Time Warner Cable have entered into. Capitalised synergies, valuation multiple paid and share price reaction all deserve to be dismissed. The only standard that matters is what revenue and profits the parties are contributing and how that translates into the ownership split.The correct ownership split should be easy to calculate then. Just compare the profits of the two and divide accordingly. Not quite. Imagine the merger of two companies, both with enterprise values of $1bn and profits of $100m. The only difference is that one has equity value of $100m and the other has an equity value of $900m. Clearly, the equity split in the new business should be 10 per cent/90 per cent despite their identical total values.In the Comcast/TWC scenario, Time Warner Cable shareholders are getting 23 per cent of the equity value while bringing 27 per cent of the cash flow, based on 2013 results. But they are not being cheated. TWC carries relatively more debt than Comcast, so its equity holders will not own as much as the cash flow would indicate. Using 2013 numbers for the two groups and after correcting for TWC’s higher debt, TWC should own 23 per cent – just what the deal terms specify.The calculation could vary if different operating metrics (revenue, say) are used. A cruder measure compares market values before the deal (implicitly assuming that the market has correctly valued both companies). On that measure, TWC deserves 21 per cent of the new company.All-stock deals and cash buyouts must be evaluated differently. Because TWC shareholders are not being cashed out, it is false to compare the premium paid to the capitalised value of the synergies.Both set of shareholders will benefit from the synergies so they do not need to be paid for in advance. The bankers have done the maths correctly. Hopefully, the antitrust lawyers have done the same.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
364;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-13T18:37:29Z;Ma Bell should toll for Comcast’s deal;The US needs more competition in broadband, not less;America may be the birthplace of the internet. But when it comes to web access, US consumers get a startlingly poorer deal than those on offer in many later-adopting countries.Over the past decade, while broadband speeds have accelerated and costs tumbled elsewhere in the world, the US has limped along behind. On network speed the US ranks just 16th out of the nations of the OECD, with an average of 27 megabits per second. Japan and the Netherlands are four times as fast. A megabit of capacity costs more than twice as much in the US as it does in the UK.There is nothing inevitable about this slide. It is the product of inadequate regulation. Myopic politicians and lax rulemakers have permitted the stealthy assembly of a market structure that bears more than a passing resemblance to the old “Ma Bell” telephone system that was dismantled by antitrust fiat in 1984.Notionally competing companies have been allowed to carve up the nation, stitching together a patchwork of local monopolies. Relieved of the need to innovate or provide service to win custom, incumbents have sat back. The consumer has been quietly skinned.Now, a deal threatens to unpick all but the final competitive figleaf. Comcast, the number one cable provider, has unveiled a plan to merge with the number two, Time Warner Cable. Together this combine would reach about 30m homes, and secure market-leading positions in the ISP, home phone and video markets.To win regulatory consent for the prize, the partners propose to divest 3m of Time Warner’s 11m customers. This is the equivalent of a multimillionaire leaving a $100 tip in a restaurant. Too often the Federal Communications Commission has let itself be bought off by such pourboires. This time it should steel itself to say no.True, one can argue that the local market structure is already so anti-competitive as to make the merger only a marginal negative for consumers. But there are two reasons to stand firm. One is the reduction in contingent competition that would result from merging the top two players. Comcast, for instance, would no longer be constrained by the worry that Time Warner might tiptoe on to its turf at some point. The second is the creation of a giant with a greater ability to cross-subsidise local markets to stub out or inhibit new entrants in a sector already blighted by weak innovation.But blocking the deal would not cure the underlying malaise. The FCC should view this transaction as a wake-up call and go further.The US broadband market needs a shake-up. Phone companies such as Verizon do serve the same homes as cable companies. But they do not always compete with conspicuous vigour. For instance, Verizon has an agreement with cable providers to cross-sell products where their networks do not overlap. The political skill with which cable companies have defended their turf has been matched only by the susceptibility of municipalities to lobbying.Two things are needed to make the market work better. There should be tougher regulation of pricing and service quality in areas where competition is inadequate. Measures are needed to encourage new entrants. Since many of the problems have to do with archaic local laws, this may mean requiring incumbents to open up their infrastructure.The bigger question is whether the FCC is up to the job. The regulator often seems squeezed between the politically astute cable companies and their friends on Capitol Hill. In November President Barack Obama appointed a new head of the FCC – a political ally, ex-fundraiser and former cable industry lobbyist. How Tom Wheeler handles this deal will say much about his independence – and about Mr Obama’s objectives in appointing him.——————————————-Letter in response to this editorial:Deaf ears on cable competition call / From Mr R Vijayaraghavan

366;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-13T11:30:07Z;Time Warner/Comcast: bizarre love triangle;Why does Comcast want to drop $45bn on Time Warner Cable?;"There are no permanent allies, just permanent interests – as Charter Communications investor John Malone has just been reminded. He thought he had Time Warner Cable cornered. Despite its protests, TWC would succumb to his bid in time. The only possible spoiler, Comcast, had a handshake agreement to assist Charter by acquiring some TWC assets down the line, to help Charter reduce debt. But Thursday, Comcast announced it wanted all of TWC and stepped up with a $159 per share, all stock, offer (Charter’s offer is $132.50 in cash and stock).Comcast was going along very nicely on its own. Its investors will wonder why it would spend $45bn in order to take on years of distracting regulatory back and forth, followed by a tricky integration, before a penny of returns is earned.Comcast is a media conglomerate, ironically resembling Time Warner before it dumped businesses. It is the largest US cable provider with 22m subscribers and owns the NBC broadcast network, cable networks such as E! Entertainment, and the Universal movie studio. In cable, Comcast – unlike TWC – has been a solid operator. Its TV subscribers fell just 1.4 per cent in 2013; TWC’s fell 7 per cent. Comcast’s cloud-based digital video platform, X1, has given it the reputation as the rare innovator in the cable sector.Comcast’s prospects will be of keen interest to TWC’s investors, given that they will own a quarter of the company if the deal gets done. They have three reasons for optimism. An all-stock deal leaves the combined company with financial flexibility to make investments to keep up with Netflix and Apple. If Comcast can manage to wring out synergies and growth, former TWC holders will share in the upside. And if the new Comcast wobbles, the $159 price is 60 per cent premium to TWC’s share price last summer, when deal fever broke out, so they have nice cushion to fall back on.Comcast investors have just one source of comfort: a management team, which has delivered 340 per cent of total return over five years.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
367;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-02-13T09:56:41Z;Cable guys: the two men at heart of giant industry deal;;"Brian Roberts, Chairman and chief executive, ComcastGrey suits, squash and the occasional triathlon – that is the unspectacular image of Brian Roberts, who leads the world’s largest media company by market capitalisation.The son of Comcast’s founder Ralph, Mr Roberts has been president of the company for 24 of his 54 years.One story claims that as a teenager he pointed out a mistake in Comcast’s annual report.Since taking over as chief executive in 2002, he has kept a low profile while transforming the Philadelphia company through aggressive takeovers.The biggest moves to date have been the $50bn acquisition of AT&T Broadband in 2002 and the purchase of NBCUniversal in two stages, in 2009 and 2013.Those moves have given Comcast control of “pipes” leading to more than 30m American households, as well as a stream of high-quality content. NBCUniversal made shows including 30 Rock and now Downton Abbey; Comcast previously failed with a bid for Walt Disney.Nonetheless, Mr Roberts, who owns one-third of Comcast’s voting shares, has emphasised continuity.“My father’s view has always been that in bad times there are great opportunities,” he told the FT after signing the 2009 deal for NBCU.Rob Marcus, Chairman and chief executive, Time Warner CableRob Marcus has only led Time Warner Cable for six weeks – and yet could receive a $50m exit package if the company is sold.A dealmaking lawyer, his appointment was made with one purpose: to ensure the company negotiated the best possible deal.“As much as I’d like to be modest, I am kind of built to manage situations like this,” he said shortly before taking over.Mr Marcus joined Time Warner’s legal team in 1998, shortly before the doomed tie-up with AOL, and rose to become chief operating officer of the spun-off TWC.Last year he was a public face of the company in its spat with CBS over how much cable operators should have to pay to broadcast the network.That dispute caused a blackout of CBS content, which led to many TWC customers cancelling their subscriptions.Mr Marcus has said cable customer numbers would grow again when the US economy leads to faster growth in the number of households.Yet he can imagine life beyond Time Warner Cable.“If I want another job, I’m going to get one. I have no doubt. And it’s going to be a good one,” he said in December."

They closed down 4.5 per cent at $18.74.Skyworks Solutions, the maker of radio components used in the iPhone and iPad, fell as much as 4.5 per cent on opening, and closed down about 1 per cent at $30.05. Peregrine Semiconductor shares were 3.3 per cent weaker.Apple shares tumbled almost 8 per cent to $506.50 after it sold fewer iPhones than forecast in the last quarter, raising fears that demand for the best-selling product might be slowly ebbing. The company sold 51m iPhones in the last three months of 2013, trailing the almost 55m sales Wall Street had expected.Pharmaceutical company Pfizer led the charge on the Dow Jones industrial index, climbing 2.5 per cent to $30.42. Despite reporting a drop in profits and sales last quarter, Pfizer shares were buoyed by an improving outlook for this year. The company forecast sales of between $49.2bn and $51.2bn, better than the $49.5bn expected by analysts.There was encouragement for investors in the US homebuilding sector. Shares of D.R. Horton surged 10 per cent to $23 after the builder almost doubled profits last quarter to $123.3m and it issued a bullish outlook for the market. Shares of rival builders, including PulteGroup and Lennar, were also buoyed, up 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively.Asset manager T Rowe Price was also in demand. Its shares climbed 5.5 per cent to $80.70, as its latest quarterly results provided further evidence of how 2013’s equity rally helped companies in the asset management industry. T Rowe Price said assets under management hit a record $692.4bn.Comcast shares rose 1.6 per cent to $53.35 after the largest US cable provider posted higher fourth-quarter revenue, as it added quarterly cable video subscribers for the first time in more than six years.Royal Caribbean Cruise shares enjoyed a sector rebound, following on from Carnival, with at least two brokerages raising their price targets on the cruise operator’s stock a day after it forecast a stronger-than-expected profit for 2014 as more people signed up for cruises at higher prices in Europe and Asia.The cruise operator’s shares rose 3.4 per cent to $49.66. JPMorgan raised its price target on the stock from $50 to $53, while Investec raised its price target from $53 to $56. Both maintained their ratings on the stock.Corning shares tumbled 6 per cent to $17.10 after the speciality glassmaker said LCD glass prices would decline further in the current quarter, raising concerns about the growth prospects of its television display business, which brings in more than a third of the company’s revenue.Struggling teen apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch gained just under 5 per cent to $36.27. It said that it had separated the roles of chairman and chief executive officer and abandoned a plan aimed at blocking hostile buyout bids.Cliffs Natural Resources shares ended up 2 per cent higher at $19.81 after New York-based hedge fund Casablanca Capital picked up a 5.2 per cent stake in the iron ore producer and urged it to spin off international assets and double its annual dividend.In an overall stock market rebound on Tuesday morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was poised for its first day of gains since January 17.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 90.68 points or 0.57 per cent, to end at 15,928.56. The S&P 500 gained 10.94 points or 0.61 per cent, to finish at 1,792.50. The Nasdaq Composite added 14.35 points or 0.35 per cent, to close at 4,097.96.Additional reporting by Reuters
369;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Comcast records rise in subscribers;;Comcast, the largest US cable operator by subscribers, had an increase in video subscribers during the fourth quarter, bucking a six and a half year trend of losses.The company added 43,000 video subscribers in the fourth quarter, following investments in its X1 and Xfinity high tech television product, up from a loss of 7,000 video subscribers in the same period the year before. The company also increased its tally of broadband and voice customers.The news is a boon for the cable operator as the industry battles fierce competition for TV services from satellite and telecom operators. They are also challenged by “cord-cutting”, where people cancel pay-television subscriptions and turn to cheaper online streaming alternatives, such as Netflix and Hulu.Yet Comcast’s reversal in the video subscriber losses is not expected to last because it typically faces much bigger declines in the second and third quarters. It is instead focused on losing fewer video customers. In 2013, Comcast lost 305,000 video subscribers, 336,000 in 2012 and 459,000 in 2011.“Comcast’s return to positive video subscriber growth, even if it is only for a single quarter, is an unmistakable sign that their days of losing share to satellite are almost over,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research.Comcast is making more money off its existing customers. The average monthly total revenue per video customer in 2013 was $159.61, up 16 per cent from $137.51 in 2011.The news came as Comcast reported a 9.9 per cent increase in net income for 2013. Total revenues were $64.7bn in 2013, up 5.8 per cent from 2012 excluding revenues from the Olympics and Super Bowl. The growth was fuelled by its cable group and NBCUniversal entertainment group.During a conference call on Tuesday, Comcast did not discuss its role in consolidation of the fragmented US cable industry.Time Warner Cable, the second-largest US cable operator by subscribers, is facing pressure from some of its largest shareholders to engage with rival Charter about an offer that it deemed “grossly inadequate”. This week news emerged that Comcast had entered discussions with Charter about which assets it might buy should Charter win its battle for Time Warner Cable.Time Warner Cable, which faced record losses in video subscribers in the most recent quarter, reports earnings on Thursday. The company plans to host an extended conference call with its new chief executive to discuss the company’s strategy.
370;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-01-27T21:04:03Z;TWC’s board hires Centerview to advise on Charter’s $61bn bid;Cable operator directors also consult law firms;Time Warner Cable’s board of directors has hired Centerview, the investment bank, as advisers to help the company assess the merits of Charter Communications’ proposed $61bn takeover of the US’s second largest cable operator.The directors are also talking to a number of Wall Street law firms about providing advice in addition to that already being given to the company, according to people familiar with the matter.The news comes as the New York-based company faces pressure from some of its largest shareholders to engage with Charter about an offer that it has rebuffed as “grossly inadequate”.Independent directors will need to decide whether or not the company should continue to hold out for the $160 a share that its executives have proposed, or negotiate around Charter’s $132.50 a share offer.Shares in TWC have risen about 40 per cent in the six months since news emerged of Charter’s interest in the larger cable operator, and closed at $133.45 on Monday.TWC’s existing advisers include Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company and Citigroup. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the process.It also emerged on Monday that Comcast, the US’ largest cable operator by subscribers, had entered discussions with Charter about which assets it might buy were Charter to win its pursuit of TWC. Comcast is working with Paul Taubman, the veteran dealmaker who left Morgan Stanley in 2012.At Morgan Stanley, Mr Taubman was an adviser to Comcast on its $58.7bn purchase of AT&T Broadband in 2002 and its $16.7bn takeover of NBCUniversal. He was also instrumental in securing the bank’s lifeline from Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group during the financial crisis of 2008.News of the discussions between Charter and Comcast, coupled with pressure from one of TWC’s largest shareholders to engage in talks, sent shares above Charter’s $132.50 per share offer. Charter’s shares rose 4.1 per cent to $136.92.Charter made public its $61bn cash and stock offer, which includes debt, a fortnight ago, citing frustrations in its efforts to negotiate a deal with TWC executives. TWC’s management rejected the offer and said it would not consider an offer that valued the company at less than $160 a share.In the days since, the two companies have engaged in a public battle to secure shareholder support for their respective proposals.Financial advisers to Charter include Goldman Sachs, LionTree Advisors and Guggenheim Securities. BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are also advising Charter. Law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Kirkland & Ellis are representing Charter.All parties declined to comment.Additional reporting by Emily Steel
371;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2014-01-16T11:08:11Z;Internet ruling threatens extra costs for Netflix and YouTube;;Online video viewing has become so pervasive that two companies – Netflix and YouTube – are now responsible for more than half of all US downstream internet traffic in peak periods.The growth of these video services – Netflix now has about 30m US subscribers – has not gone unnoticed by telecoms and cable groups, such as Verizon, AT&T and Comcast, which supply the bulk of internet access in the US.This week, Verizon won a landmark case against the Federal Communications Commission, when a US court ruled that the regulator had over-reached its powers in enforcing so-called “net neutrality” principles. Net neutrality has, until now, ensured that telecoms groups charge the same rates to data and content providers regardless of the amount of data being downloaded or streamed.However, the court ruling could clear the way for online video operators to be charged for the data streamed by consumers on high-speed lines.Whether the internet providers will charge for this access – and hit Netflix and other video providers in the pocket – is up for debate. Netflix declined to comment, but the company, which accounts for about 30 per cent of downstream traffic in the US during peak periods, may find that its popularity with US viewers protects it from unwanted extra costs.The company’s subscription service and its portfolio of original programming – such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black – have won critical acclaim and driven subscriptions. Netflix shares have also recovered strongly following a rocky 2012, more than tripling in value during 2013.Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, said it would be “irrational” for an internet service provider to hit Netflix with charges. Broadband revenues are being driven by strong subscriber growth, he wrote in a research note. They [Verizon] wouldn’t have spent all this money if they didn’t think they could get 5 to 10 per cent revenue growth by charging the people who put data into their pipes. And the biggest data hogs are the video guys“When you look at what consumers are doing with their fatter, faster broadband pipes, you find two key services: Netflix and YouTube.” Mr Greenfield said. “If an ISP said to Netflix ‘pay us for access to our broadband customers or we will slow you down’, and Netflix refuses to pay, the ISP ends up hurting its own customers – and discouraging those subscribers from using the service that is driving them to pay for faster broadband speed tiers in the first place.”But not everyone agrees that the court ruling poses no threat. “Verizon spent tens of millions of dollars on this case,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “They wouldn’t have spent all this money if they didn’t think they could get 5 to 10 per cent revenue growth by charging the people who put data into their pipes. And the biggest data hogs are the video guys.”He expects internet providers to “extract” a fee per gigabyte of data transmitted. “It should mean higher payments by Netflix [to internet providers] and/or higher payments by Netflix subscribers.”Netflix shares fell slightly on Wednesday as investors absorbed the impact of the court ruling, while shares in Verizon and Comcast both rose.Netflix has been working behind the scenes to take pressure off high-speed lines and improve the definition and quality of its video streams. Last year, it began offering cable and telecoms providers “caching boxes” – servers that can be deployed in local data centres and used to cache Netflix programming. These boxes, part of a programme dubbed Open Connect, make it easier to stream higher definition content and reduce the amount of data coursing over high-speed networks. Virgin Media and BT are using the programme in the UK. In the US, Netflix is in discussions with operators, but it is unclear which – if any – will sign up.Netflix and Google are not the only companies supplying large amounts of data to internet users. The Internet Association represents several companies that could also be affected by the challenge to net neutrality – including Facebook – and has taken a tough stance over new charges. Michael Beckerman, its chief executive, warned in a statement that the internet was “an amazing platform” which “should not be taken for granted”.He said member companies supported “enforceable rules that ensure an open internet, free from government control or discriminatory, anti-competitive actions by gatekeepers”.
372;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
373;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Digital film sales resuscitate Hollywood revenue stream;;Digital purchases of movies are increasing so rapidly they will have eclipsed slumping DVD sales by the end of 2014, returning Hollywood’s most important revenue stream to growth, according to one of the largest film studios.Mike Dunn, president of 20th Century Fox home entertainment, told the Financial Times that digital sales were rising each quarter thanks to “early windowing” – releasing films to buy online before they are made available on DVD and Blu-ray.The industry-wide decline in DVD sales has hit Hollywood hard over the past seven years. The big studios – Walt Disney, Universal, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Warner Brothers and Fox – are making fewer movies as a consequence of the decline and trying to rein in production and marketing budgets.But digital sales are increasing fast enough to offset the fall. “I think it will tip this year,” said Mr Dunn.Digital purchases of films rose 50 per cent in 2013 compared with 2012 according to a report released this week by the Digital Entertainment Group, which represents movie studios, retailers and technology groups.New players have joined a market which has been dominated by Apple’s iTunes, boosting sales, the report said. Comcast, the world’s largest cable operator, and Target, the US retailer, launched digital movie services during the year, in which the best-selling titles included Despicable Me 2, Twilight: Breaking Dawn and Wreck-It Ralph. “Comcast has made a meaningful difference,” said Mr Dunn.Digital spending on movies rose to $1bn in 2013, which continues to represent a small fraction of total US spending on home entertainment. Consumers spent $18.2bn on movies to watch in the home during the year, down from the 2004 peak when they spent almost $22bn.The low cost of producing DVDs made them Hollywood’s highest margin business for close to a decade, fuelling a production boom and spiralling salaries for top stars. When sales began to fall studio profits were hit: the industry’s move to Blu-ray, a higher-definition format, stemmed some of the decline and growth in new services, such as video-on-demand, has also helped.However, nothing has grown as rapidly as digital distribution, which has gathered momentum since studios began making movies available to buy online before their release on Blu-ray. “Home entertainment is so critical for Hollywood that if this space shows growth it changes everything,” said Mr Dunn.“Consumers have responded positively to studios introducing early windowing and cloud storage,” said Dan Cryan, senior analyst with IHS, the media research firm. The growth of subscription services, such as Netflix, were also boosting studio revenues, he added.Hollywood studios have had a big presence at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. Several deals have been struck on new distribution formats, such as Comcast, Netflix, Paramount and Amazon agreeing to stream their new high-definition content in the 4K format to Samsung’s new range of televisions.
374;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-12-17T00:51:17Z;When Barack meets Eric, Sheryl, Tim, Dick and Marissa;;President Barack Obama will meet technology leaders on Tuesday morning for a two-hour discussion about everything from the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance programme, to how the industry can address income inequality.Big name tech executives from the eight companies which called on the US government to stop the spy agencies collecting such vast amounts of communications data will be pressing their case home “aggressively”, according to a spokesperson for one of the companies.These leaders include Eric Schmidt from Google, Sheryl Sandberg from Facebook, Tim Cook from Apple, Dick Costolo from Twitter and Marissa Mayer from Yahoo. But the guest list is much broader, from telecoms execs from AT&T and Comcast, to Shervin Pishevar, an Obama fundraiser and founder of start-up fund Sherpa, and even Chad Dickerson, the chief executive of Etsy, the online marketplace for handmade goods.But while pushing for reforms to restore trust in technology is top of the executives’ agenda, Obama has other priorities. He wants to seek ideas from those experienced in running websites to help save his own, the healthcare exchange Healthcare.gov, which has suffered from a very shaky roll-out. A White House official said the meeting will “discuss progress made in addressing performance and capacity issues with Healthcare.gov and how government can better deliver IT to maximize innovation, efficiency and customer service”.With Google and Oracle already among the technology companies who last month committed engineers to help the project, the White House could be asking for more computer geeks on the ground, or looking slightly beyond the immediate problems to how to better deliver large IT projects in the future.The White House also said the president will be discussing ways to partner with the tech sector to grow the economy, create jobs and address income inequality and social mobility – issues which Obama is trying to drive home in almost every meeting. Talks with the tech sector are most likely to focus on education or immigration.Obama recently promoted Code.org’s “Hour of Code” which called on high school students to spend an hour learning to programme computers, telling them it was important to keep America on the cutting edge.“Don’t just buy a new video game, make one. Don’t just download the latest app, help design it. Don’t just play on your phone, program,” he said.Before the NSA revelations, the industry’s most fervent lobbying was for immigration reform. Many of the companies represented at the meeting have leaders or founders who support FWD.US, the pro-immigration reform lobby group, including Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn. Frustrated by the barriers to hiring in-demand programmers from abroad, the technology industry has become a vocal critic of the immigration laws, while reforms have stalled in Congress.As Silicon Valley becomes a target of protests in San Francisco for pushing up rents and alienating locals – with demonstrators blockading a private commuter bus full of industry employees last week – the meeting could also be a chance for the executives to show they are engaged with wider issues across the country. Rather than, as Business Insider claimed “living inside a bubble of tone-deaf arrogance”.
375;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-12-16T13:01:17Z;US cable musters forces to meet upheaval;Speculation grows over consolidation in fragmented sector;For years, cable operators have been at the heart of how television is financed, distributed and viewed in the US. But with new competitors rising and rapid technology changes upending the business, the industry is entering a period of upheaval and possible consolidation.Speculation is rife about consolidation that involves some combination of Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Charter or Cox – the four biggest cable companies in the US by subscribers.Charter Communications, which is 27 per cent owned by John Malone’s Liberty Media, is preparing to make the first move as it readies a formal offer to buy Time Warner Cable, in a deal that would value Time Warner’s equity at more than $36bn.The results of this shake-up will have an impact not just on the estimated 56.4m US households that pay roughly $145 a month to cable operators, according to SNL Financial, but also ripple through to programmers and distributors across the world.The rationale for consolidation is clear. Geographically divided, no one cable operator has national dominance (see chart on left).This has kept cable operators from competing with one another in the past but they are now fending off new rivals. One issue is cord cutting, where people cancel pay-television subscriptions and turn to cheaper online streaming alternatives such as Netflix and Hulu that can appear – just like traditional programming – on internet-connected televisions.Even those who are not cutting the cord are choosing TV services provided by satellite or telecoms operators instead.With new rivals entering the fray sending the demand for television content soaring, there has been a sharp increase in the costs television distributors pay programmers. Negotiations between distributors and programmers are growing increasingly hostile, leading to more than 80 broadcaster blackouts in the past two years.So far, cable operators have met the challenges by charging higher rates and diversifying into broadband, phone and business services. Yet for the industry to compete in the future, some executives argue that consolidation is the solution.The Cable Cowboy – John MaloneNone of this is new to Mr Malone, the 72-year-old chairman of Liberty Media, known as the “cable cowboy”. In the 1980s and 1990s, he led a wave of cable consolidation by lassoing together a series of smaller US cable operators to build TCI, the country’s largest cable company that he sold to AT&T in 1998 in a $48bn deal.Now he is at it again.In May, Liberty Media spent $2.6bn for 27 per cent of Charter Communications, the fourth largest cable operator in the US by subscribers. Mr Malone’s grander strategy soon became clear. Within weeks, Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s chief executive, approached Glenn Britt, the outgoing chief executive of Time Warner Cable, to discuss the possibility of a deal with Charter.The approach was rebuffed but Mr Malone and Charter have continued to circle their target, publicly advocating for the benefits a new wave of consolidation would bring. Charter now is ratcheting up the pressure, planning to send a so-called bear hug letter to its larger rival Time Warner Cable as early as Monday. The offer represents a price between $130 and $135 a share or an equity value of more than $36bn.“When I joined the cable industry way long ago what occurred to me was it was an enormously balkanised business. It was sub-scale and had no ubiquity,” Mr Malone said, adding that consolidation would allow the geographically fragmented companies to pool resources, invest in new technologies and build national markets.“The history of the business is replete with the industry solving its balkanisation and scale problem through joint effort . . . I think that can be done again.”Charter, which has about 5m residential and business customers in a smattering of markets from California to New England and Tennessee to Oregon, also discussed a $25bn debt financing package to help it acquire its larger rival. Charter would need substantial funding to snap up Time Warner Cable.Some analysts caution that while the broader logic for consolidation is clear, a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable would be highly leveraged and leave little margin for error in integrating the two companies. Others caution that Charter should be careful given its 2009 bankruptcy, blamed on heavy debt and under investment.The Target – Time Warner CableIt is no accident that Time Warner Cable finds itself at the centre of the cable consolidation bull’s eye.The second largest cable operator in the US by subscribers, the company is considered the industry’s crown jewel with its 15m customers across the highly sought-after markets of New York and Los Angeles, among other regions.Yet Time Warner Cable’s operations have faltered. In the most recent quarter, Time Warner Cable missed expectations, losing video, high-speed data and voice subscribers. The weak performance, analysts say, could spur a deal.Ironically, its takeover candidate status has sparked shares in Time Warner Cable to soar nearly 40 per cent in the past six months. With shares now trading at about $130, some question whether potential buyers will be willing to pay an additional premium for a company with deteriorating performance– a concern borne out by Charter’s offer of between $130 and $135 a share.Time Warner Cable’s longtime chief executive Mr Britt, who dismissed Charter’s earlier advances, retires from his post at the end of the year after 12 years on the job. Stepping into the position is Rob Marcus, Time Warner Cable’s chief operating officer who started his career as a mergers and acquisitions lawyer. His contract stipulates that he could be paid more than $50m if the company is acquired and his position is terminated.One banker close to the situation said Time Warner Cable had switched from trying to resist a takeover to pushing to get the highest price for a deal. “There is a realisation that it will get done, the business will be sold, it is just a question of to whom and at what price.”During an investor conference last week, Mr Marcus said that the company’s management team is focused on running Time Warner Cable for the long haul and that any deal activity is driven by shareholders’ best interest.“My job is to maximise value for shareholders,” he said.The 800 Pound Gorilla – ComcastEnter Comcast, the industry heavyweight with 52m customers, ownership of entertainment group NBCUniversal and a $172bn enterprise value.Comcast entered the cable consolidation fray after Time Warner Cable reportedly invited the company to consider a deal. Comcast has considered both a solo “white knight” bid for Time Warner Cable or a joint bid with Charter. Charter’s current proposal does not include Comcast, according to people familiar with the process.A Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would create an industry behemoth, controlling a third of the US video subscriber market and a 35.9 per cent share of the US broadband subscriber market, according to MoffettNathanson estimates.While shareholders are likely to support such a deal because it would provide an outlet for its cash, bankers and analysts are sceptical that Comcast could launch a successful bid given the size of the market it would control and the potential for significant regulatory hurdles. Comcast already is under scrutiny following its deal for NBCUniversal that valued the entertainment company at about $30bn and bundles the country’s largest television distributor with one of the country’s largest programmers.That sentiment is bolstered by recent comments from the US Federal Communications Commission that such a deal would probably face regulatory objections.A lawyer, who is not involved in the deal but wished to remain anonymous, said that the response from the FCC would have damped Comcast’s ambition. “They would have seen that and thought the uphill struggle involved was probably not worth the energy required,” the lawyer said.A joint bid with Charter, meanwhile, could dodge regulatory concerns and give both acquirers a boost in scale by dividing Time Warner Cable’s assets. Amy Young of Macquarie Research points out that both Charter and Comcast own networks adjoining Time Warner Cable’s.The Missing Links? – Cox and CablevisionWaiting in the wings are outliers Cox and Cablevision.Cox is the third-largest US cable company with an estimated 6m residential and business customers primarily in the south. The Atlanta-based, privately owned company long has been rumoured to be an acquisition target, but the company insists that it is not for sale and rather is seeking growth.Cox, too, has reportedly considered a bid for Time Warner Cable.Meanwhile Cablevision has largely stayed out of the spotlight. But its strength in the New York metro area, where it has 1.8m customers, will probably make it a hot commodity should other deals go through and industry consolidation begins in earnest. Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter all operate in regions adjacent to Cablevision’s network.Geography matters, because it is cheaper and easier to manage a large contiguous network than having outposts in many cities. New technology advancements also can get a boost. Cable operators, for instance, have been launching hundreds of thousands of new WiFi hotspots. A combined entity could invest more in the initiative as well as give it a more robust promotional push.“If pay TV households get reshuffled and swaps enter into the equation, Cablevision could get broken apart and sold to Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter,” Macquarie’s Ms Young said. She calls Cablevision the “missing geographic link”.The Hit Makers – Television NetworksThe consolidation fervour in the cable business has spread to the television networks that produce programmes and hit shows. Discovery Communications, the owner of the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, has considered a bid for Scripps Networks, home of the Food Network and the Travel Channel.While the consideration is driven largely by ambitions to grow internationally, such a deal also could give programmers more heft in fee and rights negotiations. Discovery and Scripps declined to comment.As cable operators fight back against rising programming costs through consolidation, television networks too are seeking the benefits of scale. Once again, Mr Malone could be stirring up the pot – he is a director on Discovery’s board.Some analysts caution that TV groups such as Discovery and Scripps already exert substantial pricing power and that further consolidation is not likely to help much more.Despite underlying business tensions, television programmers and distributors historically worked together to promote overall growth of the business. Technological changes, however, are forcing those tensions to erupt into frequent, public battles.This summer, for instance, a contract dispute between Time Warner Cable and the broadcaster CBS led the network to become unavailable for millions of customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas for about a month.This wave of consolidation is not limited to US borders. Just last week, Mr Malone’s Liberty Global group was revealed to be in talks with Dutch operator Ziggo. The move came after Liberty paid $23.3bn last year to acquire Britain’s Virgin Media.Additional reporting by Ed Hammond
376;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Charter closes in on Time Warner Cable offer;Proposal priced at low end of expectations as consolidation speculation grows in an industry battling cord-cutting, competition and content costs;Charter Communications is preparing a formal offer to buy its larger rival Time Warner Cable for a price that would represent between $130 and $135 a share, or an equity value of more than $36bn.Executives from the two companies met on Tuesday to discuss Charter’s proposal, said by people familiar with the matter to be “in the low $130s”. Charter is planning to send Time Warner Cable a so-called bear hug letter as early as Monday.The offer price is at the low end of expectations, and significantly short of the $150-$160 range at which Time Warner Cable has been reported to be interested in selling.Time Warner Cable shares, which rose as high as $138 last month amid mounting speculation about US cable industry consolidation, fell to $130.84 on Friday morning, giving the company a market capitalisation of $36.88bn.Rob Marcus, Time Warner Cable’s incoming chief executive, told an investor conference this week that its management team was focused on running the company for the long haul and that any dealmaking would be driven by creating shareholder value.“My job is to maximise value for shareholders, and there’s no way that I would let my personal ambitions, my personal agenda about running the company, get in the way of making the right decision for shareholders,” he said.A possible joint bid between Charter and Comcast, the largest operator in the cable market, had been mooted earlier. However, Charter’s current proposal does not involve Comcast, according to people familiar with the process. Charter, which has a market capitalisation of $13.9bn, has met banks to discuss a financing package of $25bn.Industry analysts have broadly welcomed Charter’s proposed takeover, despite the gulf in size between bidder and target. The smaller group has a stronger recent growth record while Time Warner Cable has faltered lately, suffering subscriber losses in video, high-speed data and voice. In its most recent quarter, Time Warner Cable lost 131,000 customers in total, after 306,000 video subscribers left.“Beyond the scale that a Time Warner Cable deal offers, we believe Charter sees an opportunity to accelerate revenue and free cash flow growth given Charter would implement a different strategy than Time Warner Cable,” Michael Senno of Credit Suisse said on Friday.Speculation about the consolidation of the fragmented US cable industry has been building for several months. Some industry executives, including Liberty Media’s John Malone, have advocated such deals, arguing that it would reduce costs and better position the industry to compete.Cable operators are facing increased pressure in their video businesses from so-called cord cutting, as customers cancel pay-TV subscriptions for cheaper online streaming options, such as Netflix. The industry is also battling competition from satellite TV and phone companies, and rising content costs.All the companies involved declined to comment.
377;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-11-26T17:19:46Z;US cable-TV: customer is king;Pay-TV providers need to focus on customer retention;For all the dealmaking hype, cable television remains a consumer product. Remember that as the industry’s latest round of consolidation unfolds. The Time Warner Cable/Charter Communications buyout saga continues, with Comcast diving into the fray, either as enabler or spoiler.With content distributors proliferating (Netflix, Apple, Hulu) and content providers (cable and broadcast networks such as ESPN and CBS) raising prices, cable companies want the industry to shrink to just a few multi-regional players. They may be right. But before piling on the merger debt, pay-TV providers need to consider customer retention.Banks, bonds markets, sovereign wealth funds, equity investors, Liberty Media and bake sales are all reportedly in line to help Charter (enterprise value: $28bn) acquire TWC ($61bn). Comcast ($172bn) could also help Charter by buying bits of TWC that complement its own business. But Comcast, which just bought out all of NBCUniversal from General Electric, may be cautious. Its shares were already up a fifth this year.TWC’s crown jewel is its big (14m) but shrinking customer base. Charter has just 4m subscribers but board member John Malone and chief executive Tom Rutledge believe that their acumen befits a bigger empire. If so, TWC itself should acquire Charter and install the pair as bosses.To understand why this matters, recall Charter’s history. Heavy debt and under-investment led to its 2009 bankruptcy. Mr Malone’s quarter stake in Charter comes from the vultures who bought Charter debt.Perhaps a beefed-up TWC will be able to push back on content costs. If the smaller company buys the larger, however, the result could be another big debt pile, an LBO-like five times the cash flow of the combined company. This could lead to scrimping on service and system upgrades – a precarious move when cable substitutes such as satellite, wireless, internet and fibre optics are increasingly available.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
378;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-11-23T00:02:38Z;Comcast eyes Time Warner Cable bid;;Comcast, the $130bn market leader in the US cable industry, has waded into the battle to consolidate the country’s fragmented pay-television market, after being invited to examine a bid for Time Warner Cable.The group is weighing either making a solo “white knight” bid for Time Warner Cable, which has a market value of $38bn, or joining forces with Charter, its smaller rival that has been circling Time Warner Cable since the summer despite being far smaller, with a $14bn market capitalisation.Comcast’s role in the process comes after representatives of Time Warner Cable approached the Philadelphia-based group to ask it to make an offer that would rival Charter’s overtures, said a person familiar with the matter.Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, has been closely following the speculation around the sale of Time Warner Cable, but until Friday had not emerged as a potential suitor.Many analysts had assumed that its size could present serious regulatory obstacles to a successful acquisition of another US pay-TV and broadband provider, but a joint bid could allow it to overcome these obstacles by breaking up Time Warner Cable’s assets.People familiar with the situation cautioned that Comcast was not in active dialogue with either Time Warner Cable or Charter.Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment.Charter, whose ambitions are supported by John Malone’s Liberty Media group, its largest shareholder, was not immediately available for comment.Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, told clients that Tom Rutledge, Charter’s chief executive, had said last week that he saw consolidation as being about “running the companies better” rather than primarily about synergies.“There simply aren’t enough synergies [between Charter and Time Warner Cable] to support a reasonable valuation without ‘running it better’,” he added, “and even then, the resulting entity would be frightfully levered” (hence the appeal of a Comcast white knight scenario).Speculation lifted share prices across the sector. Time Warner Cable shares, which started the year below $100, jumped 10 per cent to $132.92 on Friday, reaching their highest level since the company’s 2009 spin-off from Time Warner, owner of CNN, HBO and Warner Bros.Charter shares rose 6 per cent to $134.66 and Comcast rose 4.4 per cent to $49.52.Glenn Britt, who is due to hand over as Time Warner Cable’s chief executive to Rob Marcus at the end of the year, said in October it was “obviously absurd” to portray him as being opposed to consolidation.“Any decision on consolidation hinges on just one question, does it maximise value for our shareholders?” he said.

The news, first reported by CNBC, said shareholders in Comcast had backed the acquisition, and that Comcast had been in contact with FCC antitrust officials.Rival media provider Cablevision also rose, up 5.8 per cent to $15.79.Time Warner Cable is up 43.4 per cent in the past year, but recent reports have indicated that the company is struggling to retain customers, particularly for its TV products. TWC has previously been the subject of takeover rumours, particularly after its outgoing chief executive said the company was open to deals.The uptick from cable providers contributed to a rally that put the S&P 500 up 0.5 per cent to 1,804.75 – a new closing high. The index finished the week 0.4 per cent higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent in Friday trading to 16,064.77, and up 0.7 per cent for the week. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.6 per cent to help the tech index close in positive territory for the week, 0.1 per cent higher.Chipmaker Intel was the weakest company on the Dow on Friday, off 5.4 per cent to $23.87 after the company issued guidance that was below expectations. The company’s investor day, held on Friday, did little to improve sentiment, as analysts pointed to concerns about future revenue and inflated capital expenditure.Healthcare was one of the strongest sectors of the S&P 500 on the week, up 1.6 per cent, after biotechnology company Biogen Idec rose 16.5 per cent to $285.62.Biogen was up 13.2 per cent on Friday on news that the company’s multiple-sclerosis drug will receive market exclusivity in the European Union.Exchange operators were also among the week’s strongest groups, with IntercontinentalExchange up 7.4 per cent, Nasdaq OMX better by 6.8 per cent, and CME Group 5.4 per cent higher.Tyson Foods was boosted by an earnings report that included 2014 projections that were above expectations. Shares were up 10.6 per cent to $31.82 on the week.Retailers were under pressure as earnings and guidance were closely watched ahead of the Christmas shopping season, particularly as deep discounts cut into margins.Shares of Ross Stores were off 5.7 per cent on Friday to $75.67 after the company reported earnings that were in line with estimates, but forthcoming profits that were below analyst expectations.Discount retailer Dollar Tree reported a third-quarter revenue decline and earnings per share that missed expectations. Shares in the company recovered a bit on Friday, but remain 5.1 per cent lower on the week.Video game retailer Gamestop was also the subject of holiday shopping scrutiny after its guidance came in below expectations that have been inflated by the release of new consoles from Microsoft and Sony.Gamestop shares were off 11.8 per cent to $49.86 on the week.Tesla, one of the strongest stocks of 2013, was off 10.4 per cent on the week after a series of car fires spurred a probe from US safety regulators. Shares in the electric carmarker remain up 258 per cent on the year to date.Herbalife shares rose 4.7 per cent to $71.65 on Friday, despite efforts from hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who spoke at the Robin Hood Investors Conference about his short position in the company.The company, which operates as a direct seller of nutritional supplements, is up 117.5 per cent on the year to date.
380;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-10-31T18:09:25Z;Time Warner Cable: house on fire;Talk of a deal intensifies as company loses some broadband users;High-speed internet has been a firewall for US cable companies, protecting subscriber numbers as TV customers cut the cord. But Time Warner Cable’s third-quarter results reveal a company engulfed in flames. Not only did its TV customers storm the exits (after merely trickling out before), it shed some broadband users too. Either its customers do not want to watch Netflix over the internet or, more likely, are switching to Verizon or another provider. So with a chief executive transition pending, and wheeler-dealer John Malone smacking his chops in anticipation of a tie-up, investors are left to wonder if TWC has no choice but to do a major deal.TV subscriber numbers are grim enough. TWC lost 300,000 cable customers in the third quarter and has already lost more this year than in all of 2012. But while internet users came to the rescue last year, this time round they too are deserting the company (24,000 went elsewhere in the quarter). Making the loss more galling, TWC rival Comcast added nearly 300,000 internet subscribers in the same period. Of course, competition differs across regions of the US. But Time Warner’s dispute with CBS could not have helped its already frayed relationship with its customers.Time Warner predicts $2.5bn in free cash flow this year, slightly less than last year. Still, it has managed to deliver a total shareholder return of 27 per cent in 2013. That has been propped up by the possibility of a deal with John Malone’s smaller cable company Charter Communications (TWC’s market cap of $34bn is more than 2 times Charter’s). The knee-jerk reaction is to assume that TWC will jump into the arms of Mr Malone. But given the sizes of the two companies and the weakened negotiating position of TWC, investors should weigh their position based on the probability of a homegrown turnround.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
381;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-10-09T10:16:05Z;Hollywood takes piracy fight to schools; ;"Hollywood movie studios and music labels are taking the fight against illegal content sharing to five-year-olds by sponsoring a new anti-piracy curriculum, which will be trialled in California schools.The curriculum, which will be aimed at elementary schoolchildren in kindergarten to sixth grade, has the support of the Motion Picture Association of America, the Hollywood lobbying group that represents the big film studios, and the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents music labels.The Centre for Copyright Information, which was formed by the MPAA, RIAA and five US internet service providers – Verizon, AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast and Time Warner Cable – sponsored Internet Keep Safe, a non-profit group, to draft the curriculum.Marsali Hancock, president of iKeepSafe, wrote in a blog post that the curriculum would teach “students important concepts of creativity, ownership, attribution, sharing, copyright, and fair use”. It is part of a broader digital curriculum that also explores online safety and reputation. Schools in California will be free to adopt the curriculum as they see fit; iKeepSafe hopes eventually to extend the scheme to other states.Ms Hancock told the Financial Times that the MPAA and RIAA had no influence over the curriculum. “They’re not on my board and there’s no long-term relationship that we have with them.” The lobbying groups were “not shaping what we are creating for educators,” she said.Content piracy is a big problem for the music and film industries, with illegally streamed movies and music hurting sales. Estimates for revenues lost to piracy vary: the MPAA has for the past few years relied on a 2007 study by the Institute for Policy Innovation, which claimed that piracy of film, music, software and video games cost the industry $58bn in annual total output. Other analysts dispute this figure.Media companies have been keen to improve anti-piracy measures since the failure of the Stop Online Piracy Act [Sopa] last year. The bill, and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, had broad backing in Hollywood and would have prevented search engines from directing users to pirated content.However, when technology groups – including Google – campaigned against it and outraged internet users bombarded members of Congress, the legislation was shelved and President Barack Obama eventually withdrew his support.Supporters of intellectual property rights protection hailed the proposed curriculum. “This is a no-brainer,” said Lawrence Iser, an IP lawyer with Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert, who sued John McCain on behalf of Jackson Browne when the US senator used one of the singer’s songs in his 2008 election campaign. “I can’t conceive of who would oppose teaching kids a fundamental aspect of the US constitution, which is copyright,” Mr Iser said.But others expressed concern. “It bothers me that it’s kindergarteners to sixth grade,” said Stephen Smith, an attorney specialising in entertainment law with Greenberg Glusker. “It’s like: let’s get them early and brainwash them.”"
382;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-09-09T22:51:13Z;New head for Universal Studios group;;NBCUniversal has replaced the most senior film executive at its Universal Studios group in a surprise move that follows the studio’s most successful summer in years.Jeff Shell, the former head of NBCUniversal’s international business, has been appointed chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment.He replaces Ron Meyer as chairman, with Mr Meyer – a Hollywood veteran who has managed Universal through several changes of ownership – becoming vice-chairman of NBCUniversal. Mr Meyer has extended his contract until 2017 and will advise executives across the company.NBCUniversal is part of Comcast, the biggest cable operator in the US, and although it derives most of its profits from its cable channels, its film division has recently returned to form after a fallow period, scoring with hits such as Les Miserables, Ted and the Fast and Furious series.Adam Fogelson, the chairman of Universal Pictures, had been widely expected to get Mr Meyer’s job when he retired, with his claim strengthened by a summer that yielded several hits, including Despicable Me 2. Steve Burke, the chief executive of NBCUniversal, said recently that the film would become the most profitable in the 100-year history of the studio.But following the appointment of Mr Shell, Mr Fogelson has parted company with the studio, ending a 15-year association with the company. He will be replaced by Donna Langley as chairman.Mr Burke said Ms Langley had “been a driving force behind Universal’s current successes”. The company added in a statement that Universal was “on track” for a record year at the box office in 2013.Mr Burke said he had been “consistently impressed” by Mr Shell. “Having led NBCUniversal’s international operations for the last two and a half years, Jeff is perfectly positioned to lead our film group at a time when global expansion is more important than ever,” he added.Mr Shell is a former Comcast executive, where he ran its investments in its national and regional television networks. In the past two years he oversaw all of NBCUniversal’s international businesses, which include international television distribution, global television networks and international production.
383;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;BP argues Gulf payouts are ‘inequitable’;;BP has stepped up its fight to curb payments under its compensation settlement for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, arguing that unless the method used for calculating awards is changed, the agreement is illegal.In a filing to the Fifth Circuit appeals court in New Orleans on Friday, BP argued that the interpretation used by Patrick Juneau, the claims administrator, made the settlement “fatally inequitable” – because similar businesses claiming for lost profits could end up receiving “dramatically different treatment”.If the courts continued to uphold Mr Juneau’s interpretation, BP said, then the appeal court should strike the settlement down. It asked for a hearing as soon as possible. The move is the latest by the company to stop the cost of the settlement soaring far beyond its original estimate of $7.8bn.BP has now raised that estimate to “significantly” more than $9.6bn.If the settlement is struck down, it would reopen the prospect of many more years of litigation, which BP had sought to close off by agreeing the deal with plaintiffs’ lawyers last year.It would set the company up for multiple court battles over damages claims, but may also allow it to sue businesses that have received compensation.Steve Herman, one of the chairmen of the steering committee of plaintiffs’ lawyers, described BP’s filing as “tantamount to a giant advertisement urging people to file their claims now”.He added: “Despite the millions spent on misleading ads, when forced to actually be honest about its intentions, BP tells the court that it has no plans to stand by the transparent, objective agreement that it negotiated, signed, and asked the court to approve.”Raising the possibility of throwing out the settlement represents a reversal by BP, which agreed the deal last year and then spent months arguing for it to be accepted.The company now says that, if it is properly interpreted, the settlement would be legal but, as implemented by Mr Juneau, it is illegal.It argues that, under his methodology, the businesses and individuals from the Gulf of Mexico region who say they were hurt by the spill are not sufficiently similar to be covered by a single-class settlement.Businesses are being compensated based on losses calculated using their cash accounts. As a result, claimants that have suffered the same real economic loss could find themselves compensated very differently, depending on the timing of their cash inflows and outflows.“Class membership now turns in large measure on how a particular claimant maintained its books,” BP claimed in its filing. “Uninjured claimants could become members of the class depending on the fortuity of their choice of bookkeeping methods.”The company argues that a Supreme Court decision in May, rejecting an attempted class action against Comcast, the telecoms group, for anti-competitive practices in Philadelphia, sets a precedent that “certification [of a class] is inappropriate where individualised questions of damages predominate over any common issues.”
384;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-08-18T16:39:28Z;Telecommunications industry lobbies to relax privacy rules;;The biggest US cable and telecommunications companies, including Comcast and Verizon, are pushing for a relaxation of privacy rules in Washington that could allow the companies to sell information about their customers’ telephone use and other services.It would allow these traditional companies to be treated equally to Google and Facebook, and not like public utilities.Proponents of the shift, which would strip authority from the Federal Communications Commission and expand the mandate of the Federal Trade Commission, say the move would simplify an antiquated regulatory structure that has not kept pace with the changing media landscape. Traditional media companies face tougher restrictions than their new media rivals even though the services they offer are becoming increasingly similar.But critics contend the change is a ploy by the companies to end privacy oversight by a watchdog – the FCC – that has the authority to limit the kinds of consumer information the groups can sell, and essentially move to a self-regulatory regime. The FTC, which has brought privacy cases against Google and Facebook, is seen by many experts as an agency that has tried to be an effective privacy enforcer but has limited power.“This is a power grab,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocate. “The companies know the FTC is basically toothless. They have Facebook and Google envy.”The move comes amid heightened concern about government privacy policies following a flurry of leaks by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency.The companies seeking the overhaul have a trove of consumer data at their fingertips because they control the “wire” that connects millions of homes to the internet and telephone services. That includes what people watch on television and the phone calls they make. Mr Chester says the companies are looking to profit from the information, just as their new-media rivals can.The regulatory change would require passage of a law in Congress. The effort in favour of the move is being spearheaded by the former Democratic chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Jon Leibowitz, and a former Republican congresswoman, Mary Bono, who co-chair a new industry lobby group called 21st Century Privacy Coalition.The White House last year endorsed a change in oversight rules from the FCC to FTC, but only as part of a broader privacy overhaul. Barack Obama’s close ties to the cable industry were on display last week. On holiday in Martha’s Vineyard, he played golf with Brian Roberts, the Comcast chief executive, and later visited his home.The FTC is considered the chief privacy regulator in the US, but it does not have authority over certain services. It has long supported a change.“It seems gerrymandered to have a carve-out on mobile. Our laws should apply to everyone,” says Maneesha Mithal, a top privacy official at the FTC.Mr Leibowitz argues that a regulatory shift could be a “win win” for all parties.“I think that there’s a way in which this becomes less burdensome for companies and gives more protection for consumers. Maybe real good can come out of it,” he said.“It might result in greater across-the-board protections for consumer privacy well beyond this group because you get a bunch of businesses who are willing to make some pro-consumer commitments.”But Edmund Mierzwinski, the consumer programme director at US Pirg, a privacy advocate, says no consumer could possibly believe the line: “I’m from the phone company and I am here to help you.”“The phone companies want to take state consumer cops off the privacy beat,” he says.Additional reporting by Gabriel Muller in Washington and Paul Taylor and Emily Steel in New York——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Holistic approach to data privacy / From Mr Jon Leibowitz and Ms Mary Bono
385;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Time Warner Cable’s weak results raise talk of consolidation;;Time Warner Cable reported weaker than expected second-quarter results on Thursday, increasing the likelihood of further consolidation in the fragmented US cable industry, one analyst said.Sales for the second-largest US cable operator were below analysts’ expectations, with the company reporting larger than expected losses in video customers and less than half the expected gains in high-speed data servicesTotal revenues increased 2.7 per cent to $5.5bn in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Net income increased 6.4 per cent in the quarter to $481m.US cable operators are under pressure as they attempt to offset losses in video subscribers through selling high-speed data and other services.Liberty Media’s John Malone has touted consolidation to balance out an industry where several smaller groups trail behind Comcast, the largest cable operator in the US.Time Warner Cable results contrasted with Comcast, which lost fewer video subscribers in the second quarter and added 20 per cent more high-speed internet subscribers from the same period in 2012. Comcast reported Wednesday that sales in its cable group increased 5.8 per cent to $10bn during the second quarter.Liberty Media spent $2.6bn for 27 per cent of Charter Communications, the fourth-largest US cable operator. Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s chief executive is reported to have pitched Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, on a deal with Charter.“The fact that Time Warner Cable has been at the centre of that speculation is really an endorsement of the value of our assets in the company we built,” Mr Britt said during a conference call on Thursday. “Consolidation is a worthwhile endeavour, but our objective is and will continue to be to build value for our shareholders.”Sustained operating weakness at Time Warner Cable, highlighted by its second-quarter results, makes a deal more likely, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with Moffett Research. “Now, [Time Warner Cable] is simply a takeover candidate, and its stock price hinges on that and almost nothing else. Today’s results make a deal more likely.”Comcast has said it would be focusing on building its business organically but that it always looks at other opportunities and has a small international footprint.Time Warner Cable announced last week that Mr Britt, 64 would retire at the end of the year. Rob Marcus, chief operating officer, will succeed him as chief executive.Time Warner Cable shares rose 3.6 per cent to $4.13 by mid-morning on Thursday.
386;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-07-12T22:33:30Z;Media groups abandon plans to sell Hulu;;"Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox on Friday ditched plans to sell Hulu, the second time they have done so in the past two years.The media companies, along with Comcast’s NBCUniversal, said in a joint statement on Friday that they would inject $750m of cash into the service which streams television content and movies to tech-savvy US consumers, some of whom pay a monthly fee for a premium version.The three companies each own about a 33 per cent stake in Hulu. However, Comcast, the cable operator, does not have management or voting rights because of its deal with regulators when it bought NBCUniversal.Disney and Fox evaluated a range of investment proposals from parties including DirecTV, the satellite television provider; AT&T, the telecoms company; and Time Warner Cable, the cable operator. Options included a direct sale, a new investment from an outside company, and for Disney or Fox to buy out each other’s ownership stake, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.The decision by the media companies, which for years have squabbled over the future of Hulu, was not because of price – some bids came in at more than $1bn, one person said.Rather, it came down to the fact that Hulu’s value lies in its content distribution rights, and that the media companies would stand to benefit by doubling their effort to build Hulu into the next-generation service for watching online video across a range of devices.Chase Carey, chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox, said: “We had meaningful conversations with a number of potential partners and buyers, each with impressive plans and offers to match. But with 21st Century Fox and Disney fully aligned in our collective vision and goals for the business, we decided to continue to empower the Hulu team to continue the incredible momentum they’ve built over the last few years.”Analysts had cautioned against selling Hulu to a video distributor, such as DirecTV, thereby giving up a valuable new distribution channel the media companies had created, and at the same time losing a bargaining chip in negotiations with distributors over content deals.Launched in 2008, Hulu now attracts more than 30m unique monthly visitors and generated $690m in revenues in 2012. But it faces increased competition from the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple’s iTunes, Google and other digital video services.The $750m investment will be used to buy more video programming, retain and attract talent, and possibly for original programming.Hulu’s shareholders abandoned plans to sell the site in 2011 after attracting interest from parties including Amazon, Dish Network, Google and Yahoo."
387;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-07-10T19:25:17Z;Inside Business: Malone hitches up to broadband bandwagon;Malone is on the prowl for acquisitions;"Five years ago, reporters covering Allen & Co’s annual Sun Valley summit were scrambling around the floor of the lodge where the world’s media and technology leaders gather each July, helping Rupert Murdoch look for his wedding ring.The News Corp chairman filed for divorce last month and the press is now kept at a distance, but otherwise Sun Valley’s rituals are little changed as Herb Allen’s guests regroup near Idaho’s Sawtooth mountains this week.Each sighting of two “media moguls” or “tech titans” talking sparks speculation about what deal they might be discussing. This year, the 286 male and 17 female guests jetted in laden with expectations that they would, for example, sort out Apple’s television strategy; Vivendi’s plans for its Activision stake; and Hulu’s buyer.Sun Valley’s reputation as a hotbed of dealmaking is exaggerated but with dealmaking central to its legend, nobody is more in focus this week than Liberty Media’s John Malone.His companies have been involved in some of this year’s biggest deals, buying Virgin Media in the UK for $23.3bn, taking a stake in Dutch cable operator Ziggo, tussling with Vodafone over Kabel Deutschland and spending $2.6bn for 27 per cent of Charter Communications, the fourth-largest US cable operator.He is looking for the next target already. Last month, he touted Charter as “a horizontal acquisition machine”, saying that consolidation could balance out an industry he likened to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, where too many sub-scale groups trail behind Comcast.Mr Malone is not one to enjoy playing the dwarf, so Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s chief executive, has begun pitching Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, on a deal with Charter. TWC has three times Charter’s subscribers and more than double its enterprise value, and Mr Britt – another Sun Valley guest – seems unconvinced so far.The deal would test Mr Malone’s financial engineering talents, requiring some combination of a dilutive issue of new equity from the highly-rated Charter, an infusion of cash from elsewhere in Liberty’s portfolio, leverage of perhaps five times earnings on the combined company’s balance sheet and a creative use of Charter’s historic tax losses.Liberty may yet pick smaller targets instead, but scale counts in cable. Morgan Stanley estimates a combined Charter-TWC could yield annual savings of $400m-$600m, largely from greater negotiating power with programme suppliers.Consolidation in the fragmented US pay-TV market looks inevitable, and for it to be led by the man who built America’s largest cable company before selling TCI to AT&T in 1999 might seem poetic.Forget the nostalgia, though. Mr Malone’s plans have little to do with what cable was when he earned his “cable cowboy” nickname. “We keep looking at these personalities, but just as important is the business logic [of] becoming the largest TV and broadband distributor,” says Michael J Wolf, managing director at Activate, a strategy consultancy.We keep looking at these personalities, but just as important is the business logic [of] becoming the largest TV and broadband distributorBroadband is the key to Mr Malone’s renewed interest in cable. With profit margins under pressure in video, high-speed connectivity is cable’s growth story.Mr Malone said at his annual meeting last month he is betting that broadband will be “the controlling attribute that drives market share”, even in video, as more programming is delivered “over the top” via internet connections rather than cable or satellite boxes.He sees cable as uniquely positioned to deliver the bandwidth needed by services like Netflix and the cheaper video packages cable companies will offer if they can “unbundle” costly sports channels.But what kind of broadband cowboy would Mr Malone be? He says his vision includes more tiered pricing and charging bandwidth-hungry users of cable’s pipes (such as Netflix) for the capacity they use.Short-term opportunism is mixed in Mr Malone’s long-term vision. Consumer advocates already warn that tiered pricing and usage-based billing will hurt the “little guys”, and we should not assume he can simply replicate his buccaneering cable days. Cable companies now face cord-cutting consumers and competition from the Netflix, satellite and telecom groups, Mr Wolf notes.Even if Mr Malone is just defending his power base this time, however, he seems determined to play a central role in shaping the future of internet access in America and beyond. Unravelling the pay-TV bundle will not happen overnight, but his bet on broadband could affect Sun Valley’s ageing moguls and digital newcomers alike for years to come.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times’ media editorandrew.edgeclife-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness"
388;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-07-08T11:52:15Z;Spending time as a VC;;Venture capitalists spend much of their time exploring ideas and sectors that they end up never investing in. I used to consider this to be ‘wasted time.’ I was wrong.While knowledge is often sector specific, the knowledge gained in one arena provides insight as to why other types of innovations are important. As an example, when I was researching different ways to access the internet (DSL, cable, fibre, mesh, Wi-Fi, etc) across various markets during my summer internship at Union Square Ventures, one particular problem caught my attention: authentication. Authentication is a major factor limiting the number of WiFi access points. It is not technically difficult or cost prohibitive for internet service providers (ISPs) to provide wireless access points city-wide in the areas where they have existing underlying infrastructure. So why don’t they?The answer lies in a fear of cannibalisation. Specifically, ISPs cannot be certain that only paying customers are accessing its WiFi access points and not friends or neighbours of a customer with a “borrowed” password. Why subscribe to a Comcast type service at home if you can instead simply login to a friend’s account to access WiFi, especially if WiFi becomes ubiquitous in your neighbourhood?While cannibalisation is a valid concern for individual ISPs, it unnecessarily restricts the growth of internet access in our society. We must develop a way to encourage innovation and access while still allowing ISPs to remain competitive. The answer may lie in better authentication practices. Better device identification and verification will assuage the cannibalisation fear by ensuring that everyone using a WiFi access point is a paying customer and not a friend with a borrowed password.This example demonstrates how research in one area of interest (internet access) can actually expose another related technical problem (authentication) and an investment opportunity. The next time USV considers investing in an authentication business, I will better understand the reasons why it will be important and, from my experience in the access market, realise the questions we must ask to understand if it will work.Ultimately, there is no ‘wasted time’ — fully exploring one topic often leads to a better comprehension of another. And, with more cross-sector knowledge, you are more likely to recognise the potential of any deal that may arise. This process is particularly important in the venture capital business where VCs try to identify, fund and promote ideas and products before society recognises them.

US broadcast TV stations are a perfect example. Last week Gannett acquired Belo and its 20 stations at a 28 per cent premium for a total price, including debt, of $2.2bn. Gannett’s stock responded by soaring 34 per cent. In three other recent deals, station groups Sinclair, Nexstar and Media General saw their shares jump at least 10 per cent after announcing acquisitions.Local stations are often overlooked in a TV landscape dominated by broadcast networks (such as Disney’s ABC), cable distributors (such as Comcast) and cable networks (say, Time Warner’s HBO). In large markets such as New York, the networks themselves own the local affiliates that distribute their programming. But affiliates in smaller markets are fragmented. The biggest pure-play owners of local affiliate stations, Lin TV and Sinclair, are both below $6bn in enterprise value.The underlying trends in broadcast TV are strong. The highest-rated programming still appears on broadcast networks. TV station revenue in 2009 of $18bn was a quarter less than in 2006 but is projected to reach $32bn by 2018, according to SNL Kagan. And that revenue will be higher quality, as nearly a fifth will come from steady “retransmission” fees – what cable companies must pay stations to broadcast local content. Ads are still the biggest revenue source and two of the buyers, political campaigns and motor dealers, have ramped up their spending in the past year.The case for consolidation is easy – more stations means more leverage in retransmission negotiations. And, under certain conditions, regulators allow two stations in a single market to have common ownership, lowering operating costs.All is well in TV land – but what could pull the plug on a further rally? Leverage is up in a cyclical industry and slicing the fee pie between content creators and distributors is a constant fight.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
390;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-05-24T22:27:09Z;Hollywood insiders among Hulu suitors;;Hulu has attracted initial bids from strategic buyers, private equity groups and Hollywood insiders as owner News Corp, Walt Disney and Comcast look to exit the six-year-old online video service.Hulu, which streams broadcast networks content and movies to tech-savvy US consumers, some of whom pay a monthly fee for a premium version, competes with services including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Apple’s iTunes.Bidding for Hulu got under way more than a month ago when Peter Chernin, former chief operating officer of News Corp, made a formal $500m offer.Since then, a series of new bidders has emerged. Private equity firms including Guggenheim Digital Media and Silver Lake Partners are pursuing Hulu, according to people familiar with the situation.Cable and satellite television providers have also joined the fray. Time Warner Cable and DirecTV have both made offers, these people said.Other reports have included buyout firm KKR as a bidder, as well as Yahoo, which this week bought social media site Tumblr for $1.1bn.Yet as bidding for Hulu heats up, it remains unclear exactly what the future of the company will look like.News Corp, Disney and Comcast power Hulu by streaming their content. As they look for an exit, however, they are likely to take their content with them, then look to license it back to Hulu for a fee.The details of these arrangements will impact the price for Hulu, people close to the process said. One person said Disney may also retain a stake in the company.Hulu was founded in 2007 by News Corp, Disney and Comcast, majority owner of NBCUniversal. Providence Equity Partners later paid $100m for a 10 per cent stake, but last year sold its interest back to the founders. Comcast, the cable operator, has a non-controlling stake in Hulu because the online video service is a competitor to its core business.Efforts to sell Hulu date as far back as 2011, when the owners tried to find buyers but could not field compelling bids despite preliminary interest from Amazon, Dish Network, Google and Yahoo.Hulu’s founding chief executive, Jason Kilar, quit earlier this year after clashing with the founders over the future direction of the company.Yet as Netflix has begun to produce more original content, including the acclaimed remake of the House of Cards series, Hulu has relied on recent broadcast content as its main selling point.Reporting by David Gelles, Matthew Garrahan, Emily Steel and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson
391;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-05-16T23:57:11Z;Dow to fight $1.2bn in price-fixing damages;;Dow Chemical plans to fight a $1.2bn damages award for price-fixing using a recent antitrust ruling in the Supreme Court, it said on Thursday.A federal court in Kansas City, Kansas, on Wednesday confirmed the damages award to thousands of chemical manufacturers and distributors that said they paid excess prices for urethanes, an intermediate product with a range of uses from insulating foam to bowling balls.Dow said in a statement that it had always denied allegations of price fixing, adding the case had been thoroughly examined by the Department of Justice, which closed its investigation in 2007 without bringing any charges.In February, the jury at the trial in Kansas City found that Dow had engaged in price-fixing during 2000-03 that had cost the plaintiffs $400m.That figure is automatically tripled under US antitrust law to give total damages of $1.2bn.Joe Goldberg of Albuquerque-based Freedman Boyd Hollander Goldberg Urias & Ward, the plaintiffs’ lead lawyer, said in a statement: “We are pleased that the federal district court in Kansas has confirmed the verdict of the jury and determined, based on all the evidence, that Dow had engaged in a price-fixing conspiracy with its competitors.”The other alleged members of the price-fixing ring, BASF and Bayer of Germany and Huntsman and Lyondell of the US, had previously agreed to settle their cases for much smaller sums, without admitting any wrongdoing. Bayer paid $55m, BASF $51m and Huntsman $33m.Dow plans to appeal using, among other arguments, a decision from the Supreme Court in March in an action against Comcast, the cable and internet group, brought by cable television subscribers in Philadelphia over its alleged anti-competitive behaviour.In the case, known as Comcast v. Behrend, the Supreme Court ruled on a 5-4 vote in favour of the company, ruling that the customers had failed to present a statistical model that showed they had suffered losses as a result of the specific anti-competitive actions they alleged.Dow argues that the plaintiffs in the urethanes case used the same expert as the Comcast customers, James McClave, and the same type of statistical model, so the result should be the same.The judge at the Kansas City court rejected that argument, but Dow hopes that it will be more effective in the appeal court, and said it was “confident of a favourable outcome”.The case would be heard by the Tenth Circuit court in Denver, Colorado.
392;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-05-01T22:22:01Z;US media groups bank on digital rights;Viacom and Time Warner look to online distribution;Media companies are banking on the prospect that tech firms will continue to pay up for digital rights to their programmes, despite recent warnings from Netflix that it would become choosier in its deals for traditional television content.“With people consuming more and more video all the time, the key to success is pretty simple. If you keep creating the best content, you will keep getting paid better and better as technology improves,” said Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS.Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, echoed that sentiment, saying his company is in an enviable position with its top-tier programming on networks such as HBO becoming more valuable as tech firms become more selective in striking content deals. “We think we’re in the catbird seat from that point of view with all of the [subscription video on demand] buyers,” he said.The comments came as a slew of media companies, including Comcast, Viacom, CBS and Time Warner, reported a mixed bag of quarterly earnings on Wednesday.Comcast reported a 17 per cent jump in net income, with more expensive rates offsetting a larger-than-expected drop in people paying for video subscriptions. Time Warner reported a 23 per cent increase in net profit, with growth in its television group making up for declines in its film and publishing divisions.Viacom’s net earnings plunged 18 per cent, but the company reported increases in both ad and affiliate revenues. CBS reported an 18 per cent increase in net income from continuing operations, fuelled by gains in ad revenues from tent pole events including the Super Bowl as well as a boost in streaming revenues.Media stocks have been lifted this year in large part by a resilient traditional television business that has showed little evidence of people abandoning their cable and satellite video subscriptions to watch programmes via the internet.At the same time, new revenues from syndicating or selling content via digital services have helped prop up the business. At Viacom, for instance, digital licensing revenues have been a consistent bright spot for the past several quarters amid a challenging advertising market. CBS said that its deals with Amazon and Netflix led to 19 per cent growth in streaming revenues during the quarter.But there is uncertainty on how long it can last. Just last week Netflix said it was increasingly focusing on original production rather than broad content deals with other media companies. The company also said that it would let its bulk content licensing deal with Viacom expire.“As we continue to focus on exclusive and curated content, our willingness to pay for non-exclusive, bulk content deals declines,” Reed Hasting, Netflix’s chief executive, said at the time. Netflix said its deal with Viacom would be allowed to expire.Viacom said that it is in discussions with several parties, including Netflix, regarding the digital distribution of its content both on an exclusive and non-exclusive basis. It said there is increased competition for its content from a range of companies. “We continue to see the digital distribution arena as a growing opportunity and one that will be complementary to what we do,” Philippe Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive said in a conference call on Wednesday. “It’s just growing the pie over time.”Licensing revenues will become all the more important for Time Warner as it proceeds with the planned spin-off of its Time Inc and IPC magazine businesses by the end of 2013. That will leave 90 per cent of its profits coming from TV networks such as CNN and HBO, or production such as Warner Bros’ TV studio, Mr Bewkes said.Falling subscriptions cut Time Inc revenues from $773m to $737m in the quarter, however, as the division fell to a $9m operating loss from a $39m operating profit a year earlier after $53m of restructuring costs.
393;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-04-21T13:27:11Z;Dish stresses ad benefits of Sprint deal;;Charlie Ergen, chairman of Dish Network, said his $25.5bn pursuit of Sprint Nextel would allow him to revolutionise the way mobile advertisements are delivered to consumers.By uniting Dish and Sprint Mr Ergen would create the first US company to offer nationwide mobile phone, data and video services. Dish could then use location and content consumption data, among other factors, to deliver targeted adverts, he said.“We think we can target commercials even better on a mobile basis,” Mr Ergen told the Financial Times. “We’ll know where you are with GPS. We’ll know who you call. We’ll know how you spend your money with the phone being a wallet in the future. All that goes together.”Other media companies are working on similar efforts, but despite rising mobile usage, ad dollars for mobile dramatically lag.Mr Ergen’s comments add new clarity to the rationale for his surprise move for Sprint, which would trump the agreed $20.1bn deal for the third-largest US wireless provider by SoftBank of Japan. Sprint’s special committee is evaluating the Dish offer.Mr Ergen said Dish would be a better long-term corporate parent for Sprint than SoftBank. Although SoftBank would bring $5bn in immediate cash to Sprint, Mr Ergen said Dish would generate more cash during the next five years, and could delever its balance sheet quickly.“SoftBank is coming in and solving a balance sheet problem, but at the end of the day it’s still Sprint,” he said.Mr Ergen is pursuing Sprint as Dish’s satellite television business has “matured”. He has accumulated broad swaths of spectrum in recent years, seeking entrance into the mobile phone and data business, but not knowing exactly how.The path forward came in December 2011 when cable television companies including Comcast and Time Warner Cable sold their wireless spectrum to Verizon.“That was an indication that the cable industry was going to stay inside the home, and Verizon was going to stay outside the home,” Mr Ergen said. “Absent that, the cable industry could have gone outside the home. But when they sold their spectrum we realised we had a chance to be a truly unique company.”Mr Ergen also defended Dish’s Hopper ad-skipping technology, which News Corp, CBS and Comcast have sued to block.“There’s no criticism coming from consumers on the Hopper,” he said. “There is criticism from the networks, who rely on a dual revenue stream” of ads and fees from cable operators.“We’re not against a dual revenue stream,” Mr Ergen said, adding that he wanted networks to make ads more targeted.Aereo, the disruptive Barry Diller-backed start-up that delivers broadcast television over the internet, is a threat to satellite television, Mr Ergen said, providing further impetus for a Sprint bid. “If they’re successful they’ll change the dynamics. It would pose a risk to our business model.”
394;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Blackjack player makes big telecoms bet;;Charlie Ergen made waves from Wall Street to Tokyo on Monday when the reclusive billionaire from Colorado injected himself into the dealmaking that is reshaping the US telecoms industry.Offering $25.5bn for Sprint Nextel in a bid that trumps an agreed deal by SoftBank is classic Mr Ergen – brash, unpredictable and ambitious. A former professional blackjack player, he made his name and his fortune by making big bets.In the early 1980s, before most US consumers had cable television, Mr Ergen and a friend founded EchoStar Communications, a satellite services provider. He used EchoStar to launch Dish Network, a satellite television service, in 1996.Dish has grown into one of the largest pay-TV providers in the US, alongside Comcast and DirecTV. Mr Ergen spun off EchoStar’s set-top box unit in 2008. He is now the 37th richest man in the US, according to Forbes, worth an estimated $10.6bn.But with demand for satellite television services looking set to decline, Mr Ergen is attempting to reinvent his business once more. In recent years he amassed wireless spectrum, and is now seeking to put it to use by creating a company that would rival wireless providers such as Verizon and AT&T, and cable operators such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable.“Ergen has always seen around corners,” said one adviser who knows him well.The 60-year-old calls himself a “country boy from Tennessee”, and is known for being austere, travelling cheaply and eschewing the luxurious trappings most billionaires enjoy. His father was a nuclear physicist from Austria who came to the US before the second world war, worked on the Manhattan project, and coined the term “China Syndrome” to describe a nuclear meltdown.
395;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-03-11T17:12:27Z;Rovio taps 1.7bn Angry Birds downloads to create “Looney Tunes for the mobile generation”;;Angry Birds developer Rovio has already become the first app maker to successfully transfer its brand from digital to physical, with all sorts of merchandising and toys.Now the Finnish company is making its most ambitious play yet to become – in its words – a “fully fledged entertainment powerhouse” with the launch of a weekly cartoon series this weekend.Andrew Stalbow, Rovio’s executive vice president for strategic partnerships, told the FT that Angry Birds Toons were “inspired by Tom and Jerry” and would be “Looney Tunes for the mobile generation… fun slapstick humour that everyone will instantly get.”The 52 bird-versus-pigs episodes will be distributed in both new and traditional ways. With 263m active monthly users of its games – from 1.7bn total downloads – Rovio has built an audience that it hopes will watch the cartoons through its apps. A play button will be added to the apps via an update this week. The Toons “channel” will also be available through smart-TV apps for the likes of Samsung, Comcast and Roku.But the series will also air on broadcast TV, through deals with the likes of Cartoon Network and MTV in 12 countries including Australia, Korea, Indonesia, Brazil, India, France and Germany, as well as Rovio’s native Finland (the US and UK seem to be missing from that list at the moment).“We’ve always treated our content as a service and not a product,” Mr Stalbow said, “continually updating, adding more content and levels. This is a very big new feature coming to our games… We are turning our distribution from being just about games to being a video distribution channel as well.”Part of the objective is the “halo” effect that supports the existing Angry Birds businesses, but the Toons series will generate its own income too, through pre-roll advertising and TV distribution revenues, as well as future sales of DVDs and paid downloads.“We have invested a lot into our TV business,” Mr Stalbow said, with a team in Helsinki since the 2011 acquisition of an animation studio, Kombo. “It’s a business we believe will be nicely profitable.”In a twist that must be satisfying for Rovio, one of the first advertisers is console- and PC-gaming giant Activision, which so far has not seen the same level of success on mobile devices as Angry Birds (the others being Sony Pictures, Paramount Pictures and BlackBerry).However, the launch of a new wing to Rovio’s business comes at a time when its dominance of the app stores is starting to come back to earth. As the FT reported last week, free-to-play games such as Supercell’s Clash of Clans have come to dominate the “top grossing” charts on the iPhone, while Rovio’s titles have fallen towards the bottom of the top 100.Outside the Angry Birds franchise, which remains among the most downloaded mobile games, follow-ups such as Amazing Alex have not fared quite so well.Last week’s free-download promotion of the original Angry Birds iPhone app “wasn’t a coincidence”, Mr Stalbow said, as Rovio topped up its audience ahead of the cartoon’s debut. And while the series will initially feature only the original Angry Birds characters, not those from its Space or Star Wars spin-offs, he added that it’s “pretty likely we’ll be looking at new content on top of that pretty soon”.Rovio clearly believes there is more value to be plucked from the Angry Birds brand, as it builds more of a story around its characters. After the series debuts on March 16-17, an Angry Birds movie is planned for Summer 2016, complete with big-name Hollywood producers.“Like everything we do, we have big expectations,” Mr Stalbow said. “We look at this inside our company as a bit of a game-changer for our business.”
396;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-02-27T18:09:09Z;Loans demand signals return of buyouts;;You wait years for a mega buyout deal to come along and then several arrive at once.But from Heinz to Virgin Media, it is not so much clever corporate strategies driving the activity as a reviving global leveraged loan market.In the past three months, appetite for the asset class has grown swiftly, with this week the average price of US loans in the secondary market trading at 97.5 per cent of par value, the highest since 2008, according to Credit Suisse indices.This has allowed companies wanting to issue new debt into the market to do so at the ultra-low yield of 5 per cent, the lowest globally since the financial crisis and down from around 7 per cent midway through last year, according to S&P Capital IQ’s Leveraged Commentary and Data.Demand is being stoked partly by institutional investors looking for something that carries a higher yield than sovereign or high-grade corporate bonds, but that is less risky than equities.High-yield bonds have also performed well as part of this trend.But, at the same time, loans have benefited from concerns about rising interest rates, or at least a tighter monetary policy, in the medium term. Leveraged loans, unlike high-yield bonds, are floating rate and so the yield increases as rates rise.“Bond investors are increasingly concerned about duration risk and, where possible, are increasing their exposure to the loan market as a partial hedge against rising interest rates,” says Bradley Rogoff, head of credit strategy at Barclays.As a result yields have fallen, helping to encourage a raft of new leveraged deals.Liberty Global’s $23.3bn purchase of Virgin Media, Comcast’s $18.1bn NBCUniversal buyout, and the Dell and Heinz go-private deals for $24.4bn and $28bn respectively will all be funded by leveraged loans.“The market is now looking for new paper,” says Andy O’Brien, global co-head of debt capital markets at JPMorgan.“The majority of loan issuance this year has simply been repricings and refinancings.”It is not just institutions stoking demand. Retail inflows into the asset class in the US totalled $2.9bn in January, according to EPFR, the most since May 2011. In Europe regulation means retail investors cannot buy loans.But despite the strong appetite and the return of dealmaking, not everyone is happy.One brewing concern is the potentially detrimental effect the strong market could have on the already-fragile investment-grade bond market. This is because leveraged buyouts typically lead to ratings downgrades for the companies concerned, which makes their investment-grade bonds less valuable.Yields – which move inversely to prices – on Dell’s six-year bond rose from 2.7 per cent to 4.9 per cent in a few days on news of the deal.Bond investors …are increasing their exposure to the loan market as a partial hedge against rising interest rates“All investors tend to pay a lot of attention to leveraged buyouts as they may have an impact on other assets, particularly investment grade bonds,” says Kevin Sherlock, head of loan and high-yield capital markets at Deutsche Bank.The second issue is that the latest rally has been accompanied by an aggressive wave of repricings as private equity firms attempt to turn the lower yields in the secondary loan markets into lower borrowing costs for their portfolio companies.Investors have been fighting back, but with limited success. In Europe, Global Blue, the Swiss shopping group acquired in a leveraged buyout by Silver Lake and Partners Group, managed to reprice €460m of loans a full percentage point lower than originally agreed last summer.“It is a reminder for investors that loans are callable debt,” says Dan Gardner, loan fund manager at M&G.“If there is someone out there willing to do it cheaper, then tough luck.”One final concern is about the ability of the European market to absorb major leveraged loan deals, given that it has shrunk radically since the financial crisis.Loans are callable debt. If there is someone out there willing to do it cheaper, then tough luck [for investors]Increasingly, debt has been financed in the bond markets since 2007.The European leveraged loan market will be particularly tested by the expected $2bn of debt in euros and sterling set to be sold as part of the Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital $28bn bid to take Heinz private.“No one is entirely sure about total available capacity for euro loan deals,” says Eddie O’Neill, head of credit at Avoca Capital.“The Heinz transaction will be a good barometer of capacity given its size.”In a further test this year, it is expected that a UK-based private equity consortium will make a €3.5bn bid for French catering group Elior, which would be continental Europe’s biggest post-Lehman Brothers buyout. EE, the mobile phone operator, is another large deal on the cards.One of the main problems for the European loan market is the dearth of new collateralised loan obligations, which are structured vehicles designed to buy loans.Before the crisis CLOs were the main source of demand for leveraged loans. But by the end of 2013 most will have reached the end of their investment cycle and be unable to buy new loans.Only one new vehicle has been launched since the crisis, leaving the prospect of a funding gap that could make it even harder for deals to get off the ground.Additional reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues
397;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-02-15T20:05:43Z;Primetime arrives in saga of TV takeovers;;Life is imitating art in the cable industry. Two years ago, in an episode of 30 Rock, the NBC comedy about a thinly fictionalised NBC, the characters watched as a Kabletown logo replaced the GE sign atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza. “It’s happening,” Alec Baldwin’s character said dolefully to Liz Lemon, played by Tina Fey, as he mourned NBC’s takeover by a giant cable company.This week, naming rights to the GE building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza passed to Comcast, as the largest US cable operator paid GE $18.1bn to buy the 49 per cent of NBCUniversal it did not already own, along with NBC properties including the studios housed in the art deco tower.The deal was one of a wave of mergers fuelled by obliging credit markets. Warren Buffett’s $28bn bid for Heinz, the $11bn American Airlines-US Airways merger and the $24.4bn Dell buyout have led to predictions of a new surge in dealmaking. Across sixth Avenue from NBC, the Time Life building was shaken by news of a planned spin-off of most of Time Warner’s magazines.But cable is enjoying a particularly notable revival in animal spirits. Comcast’s deal, struck more than a year ahead of expectations, came a week after John Malone’s Liberty Globalmade a $23.3bn offer for Virgin Media, the UK cable operator.Meanwhile, Vodafone is looking at Kabel Deutschland, Germany’s largest cable company, and Charter Communications is spending $1.63bn on Optimum West, a US cable system once called Bresnan that rival Cablevision acquired only two years ago for $1.4bn.Analysts can point to company-specific reasons for each deal, such as Comcast’s fear that NBC’s improving performance would make a buyout costlier in the long run, but sector-wide factors are also playing a role.“It’s a subset of media that benefits from scale,” one media banker says, noting the savings larger cable companies can glean when buying set-top boxes or network technology. “Couple that with the debt markets and an economic backdrop with more clarity and it’s a recipe for transactions with a bit more boldness,” he adds.Low interest rates should allow Liberty Global to price almost $8bn of debt to help finance the Virgin Media deal at yields of less than 6 per cent. “Credit markets have never been stronger for companies like ours,” one US cable executive says.Large telecoms groups are hoping to reverse the long-term decline in traditional voice revenues across Europe with innovative bundled packages of television, high speed internet access and home and mobile phone connectivity, writes Daniel Thomas.The importance placed on these “quad plays” underpins Vodafone’s interest in Kabel Deutschland. That was not a great surprise to many analysts, given clear statements in the past by management that Vodafone would develop its “converged” fixed and mobile network by borrowing, building or buying lines.If it were to buy Kabel Deutschland, Vodafone could also extract cost savings as it would own more of the fixed network that supplies its mobile masts. The emphasis by Vittorio Colao, chief executive, on convergence has increased markedly over the past year, with recent complaints that some European incumbents have refused to open up their networks to Vodafone.It has instead built or co-invested in fibre in Portugal and Italy, while its largest acquisition for several years was the purchase of Cable & Wireless Worldwide in the UK in 2012. Vodafone has also been linked with cable operators such as Ono in Spain and Ziggo in the Netherlands.Vodafone is still regarded by many investors as a purely mobile operator – the part of the telecoms market that has suffered the worst from the economic downturn and regulatory revenue cuts – even though it owns fixed line networks across Europe.Vodafone made fixed line revenues of £1.3bn in the last quarter, almost a third of which was generated in Germany.The UK-listed company could combine its 3.2m broadband and 150,000 TV customers in Germany with Kabel Deutschland’s 8.5m households should any offer succeed.A Berenberg Bank study of 1,000 households in the UK, France and Germany found that demand for bundling services was robust.The German bank’s survey found that “bundling begets more bundling” and that there was a correlation between increased levels of bundling and higher levels of customer satisfaction. That could result in lower potential churn rates.Indeed, customers are also less likely to cancel triple- or quad-play contracts because of the nuisance of replacing all three or four services.Cable companies are also finding it easier to attract capital because investors are more confident that they have a competitive advantage over satellite, telecom and online video rivals. Where cable companies once pitched their own selection of TV channels, now they market themselves increasingly on fast broadband speeds. “Superfast broadband is something most consumers really get in an intuitive way,” one US cable executive says.The Federal Communications Commission says that the average speed US subscribers sign up for has risen about 20 per cent in the last year to 15.6 Mbps, showing consumers’ appetite for faster connections.Analysts say that in Europe the high quality of cable assets in comparison to the digital subscriber line technology that telecoms incumbents typically use will prove a particular advantage as bandwidth-hungry services such as high definition video on demand becomes more popular.“We’ve always been fans of cable,” says Nick Brown, analyst at Espirito Santo. “The cable assets in Europe are of a very high quality and they now have a competitive advantage over the incumbents. Really the only thing the incumbents could do in the long term to defend themselves is invest more heavily in fibre.”In Europe, where cable evolved as a more regulated utility than in the US, average prices for cable video packages are also typically lower – about €30 per month as opposed to the $80-$100 US cable operators charge. The saving in switching to a €6-€7 monthly Lovefilm or Netflix subscription therefore looks less compelling.Fears remain that customers are “cord-cutting” and finding their video by other means. Online video viewing is soaring, with ComScore this week estimating that each month 182m Americans consume 19.2 hours of video on sites such as YouTube, Hulu, Vevo and Yahoo.Yet industry executives argue that cable can coexist with “over the top” alternatives such as Netflix, LoveFilm, Apple’s iTunes, Amazon Prime or Aereo. A new generation of set top boxes is offering on-demand video streaming and other providers’ apps, sometimes harnessing the very internet video services that threaten to take viewers away from traditional cable channels.“We already have the programming relationships, unlike Netflix and Lovefilm, who begin life subscale and have to pay up to create a catalogue of compelling content,” one cable executive says.Comcast’s takeover of NBC is a marriage of distribution and content that contrasts with Time Warner’s decision to spin off its cable business from its TV networks and film studios in 2009. Distributors’ resurgence since then has not come at content owners’ cost. Shares in Comcast have tracked content stocks such as CBS, Time Warner and Walt Disney remarkably closely over the past year.The distributors still face real threats, from the rising cost of programming and weak housing and employment figures to the risk that their lead in broadband speeds will be threatened as the likes of Verizon and BT invest in faster “fibre to the home” technology.But with a market capitalisation of $109bn, Comcast is now America’s largest media company, $10bn bigger than Disney. NBC’s satirists may not approve, but cable now has the tallest tower on the corporate media skyline.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
399;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-02-13T17:58:08Z;Wall St stocks pause after rally;;Comcast shares climbed after the cable provider announced late on Tuesday it had reached an agreement to buy GE’s remaining 49 per cent stake in NBCUniversal and properties including its “30 Rock” studios.Comcast will use its $11.4bn cash as well as loans and debt to finance the deal. Shares in the company rose as high as 8 per cent but gave up gain to close at $4013 and gained 47.7 per cent over the past 12 months.General Electric’s shares also rose, up 3.9 per cent to $23.43, after the industrial group’s chief executive Jeff Immelt said the company would use the cash from the sale to increase its return to shareholders in 2013, and to invest further in its industrial business.Overall, US equity markets closed marginally higher after a volatile session during which the benchmark index dipped in an out of negative territory, as economic and earnings news did little to propel the stock to new highs.In economic news, retail sales growth slowed in January, suggesting consumers were beginning to feel the pinch from the end of a payroll tax holiday. The numbers were in line with consensus forecasts.“Markets have risen considerably over the past few weeks and in the absence of major economic news, we see a little bit of profit-taking, said Paul Zemsky, CIO of multi asset strategies at ING US Investment Management.“With 80 per cent of companies on the S&P 500 having reported already, its unlikely any more earnings news will change the general trend, which came in better than expected,” he added.As the earnings season wraps up with the vast majority of companies having reported, investors were mostly positively surprised by both profits and revenues. Analysts expect revenues at S&P 500 companies to grow 4.5 per cent after two straight quarters of declines, according to S&P Capital IQ, while earnings growth is expected to be 6.6 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,520.33, in a volatile session. Six of the 10 main sectors were in positive territory.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent, falling below the 14,000 level of 13,982.91.John Deere shares slipped 3.5 per cent to $90.68 even though the farm equipment maker reported record profits for the fourth quarter, as demand for its tractors in the US and Canada were driven by high commodity prices.Cliffs Natural Resources shares plummeted 20 per cent to $29.29 after the company announced it was cutting its quarterly dividend by 76 per cent, citing falling iron ore prices. The sharp fall triggered a ban on short selling.Dean Foods dropped 9.2 per cent to $16.70 despite the company swinging to profit and beating estimates as guidance disappointed.Among high risers, FMC Technologies rallied 5 per cent to $50.46, after the largest US provider of subsea gear to the oil and natural gas industry beat expectations for orders last quarter and forecast record orders for the full year.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 per cent to 3,196.88 led by gains in a number of large companies.Amazon shares attracted buyers, with the price rising 4.2 per cent to $269.47 after the largest online retailer announced it was expanding its content licensing agreement with CBS to increase the number of TV series and shows on its Amazon Prime service.Netflix shares also rose, up 4.7 per cent to $186.23. The online video streaming company has launched its own video series, “House of Cards”, which is offered free of charge to its subscribers. The chief executive on Tuesday said the show has been the most watched on Netflix.
400;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-02-13T09:28:46Z;GE boosts coffers with NBCUniversal sale;;General Electric plans to use the proceeds from the $18.1bn sale of its stake in NBCUniversal to Comcast for share buybacks, to cover restructuring costs in its industrial businesses, and to provide a war chest for future acquisitions.Investors welcomed the news, and its shares rose 3.4 per cent in after-hours trading to $23.35, their highest for more than four years.Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, said the deal represented “another strong step forward in our industrial transformation”, helping pay for cost reductions and margin improvements in the group’s manufacturing divisions.GE is being paid a total of $13.4bn in cash for the NBCU stake and associated property, plus $4bn in Comcast debt and $725m in preference shares, which it will sell over time.Most of the cash is being put into share buybacks. GE is increasing by $10bn to $35bn the buyback authorisation. About $12bn of that has been used, leaving a further $23bn to come, of which GE expects to spend $10bn this year.The remaining funds will be used to cover restructuring costs, which GE expects will be about $1bn after tax this year. The accelerated restructuring will deliver cost savings of $2bn through 2014, the company said. Including the effect of share buybacks, cost reductions and profits growth, the disposal will have no effect on earnings in 2013 or 2014, Mr Immelt said.He added that some of the proceeds could also be used for industrial acquisitions, focused on “bolt-on” deals. He has previously said these acquisitions are likely to be in the $1bn-$4bn rangeJeff Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said the deal was positive, but would not make a dramatic difference to GE’s valuation. “It’s very positive that they are streamlining the portfolio and returning cash to investors,” he said. “But it really doesn’t change the earnings outlook.”The large buyback programme follows sustained underperformance by GE’s shares since 2008. At Tuesday’s close of $22.58, GE’s shares were down 34 per cent in five years, compared to a 24 per cent rise for United Technologies.
401;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-02-12T22:13:22Z;Comcast in $16.7bn NBCUniversal buyout;;Comcast will spend $18.1bn to buy GE’s 49 per cent stake in NBCUniversal and properties including its “30 Rock” studios, more than a year ahead of the date planned when GE and Vivendi sold the US cable operator a majority stake in December 2009.Comcast is paying $16.7bn for NBCUniversal, the broadcast, cable channels and film studio business, and $1.4bn for 1.4m sq ft of space at GE’s 30 Rockefeller Plaza building in midtown Manhattan and CNBC’s headquarters in New Jersey.The deal marks the final exit from the entertainment business for GE, which has been involved in radio and television broadcasting off and on since the 1920s.Comcast will get naming rights to 30 Rockefeller Plaza, said Michael Angelakis, its chief financial officer.This marks the third major technology, media and telecom transaction to be announced this month, injecting life into the deals market after a slow 2012.Since the start of February, Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners have launched a $24.4bn buyout bid for Dell, and Liberty Global has offered $23.3bn for Virgin Media.So-called TMT deals for the year to date will top $101bn, the biggest start to the year since 2000, the height of the dotcom boom, according to Dealogic.Comcast acted now because NBCU was, in effect, getting more expensive, people close to the company said.The original agreement for it to buy out GE placed an enterprise value on NBCU of about $37bn but the price for the outstanding stake was based on NBCU’s performance, and the price was going up as the business grew.“I think back to my dad starting Comcast in 1963 and where we are today with Comcast NBCUniversal,” Comcast’s chairman and chief executive Brian Roberts told CNBC. “We’re very proud and excited.”The deal will allow GE to increase its return to shareholders in 2013, and to invest further in its industrial business, said its chairman and chief executive, Jeff Immelt.General Electric plans to use the proceeds from the sale of its stake in NBCUniversal for share buybacks, to cover restructuring costs, and to provide a war chest for future acquisitions“We are very pleased with the investment we have made in NBCUniversal, which generated a return of 14 per cent over more than two decades,” he said.“Most of all, we enjoyed working with the great people of NBCUniversal.”Comcast, which has already invested in Universal’s theme parks and sports rights for NBC, has been emboldened in its bet on combining distribution and content by increasing revenues from areas such as subscription video on demand and advertisers’ interest in reaching sports audiences.“It’s not a big risk because we had so much cash on the balance sheet,” Mr Roberts said.Comcast will use its $11.4bn of cash in the deal. It also generated $8bn of free cash flow last year, up 13 per cent on 2011, Mr Angelakis said.Comcast will fund the deal with $4bn of subsidiary senior unsecured notes issued to GE, $2bn of bank borrowings and $725m of subsidiary preferred stock.Comcast increased its dividend by 20 per cent and said it would repurchase $2bn of stock this year.Comcast stock was up 8 per cent in after-hours trading while GE stock was up more than 3 per cent.Morgan Stanley and Davis Polk & Wardwell advised Comcast. JPMorgan, Weil, Gotshal & Manges, Goldman Sachs, Centerview Partners, and CBRE advised GE.
402;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-02-06T17:50:00Z;Virgin Media: picture puzzle;Boost for executives but less clear investors should be jumping for joy;All things come to those who wait. An entrée into the UK market is finally within the grasp of US cable tycoon John Malone, thanks to an agreed a stock and cash offer by his Liberty Global group for Virgin Media. This is worth around $47 per VM share and puts an enterprise value on the group of about $23bn.But if adding a British asset to LG’s portfolio and overtaking US rival Comcast by customer numbers gives executives a warm glow, it is less clear that investors should be jumping with joy. Start on the Virgin Media side. The per-share offer price is over 20 per cent higher than VM’s undisturbed share price. Sounds respectable enough, even if part comes in non-voting shares. But that equates to an enterprise value which is just 7.5 times 2013 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (adjusting the EV for the net present value of VM’s deferred tax assets, estimated at $2.7bn). That is only in line with the European cable sector average – to which the relatively mature VM business has long traded at a significant discount.For Liberty Global’s investors, meanwhile, they look to be overpaying. The bidder, while singing the benefits of scale, does not pretend that it will change VM’s strategy. Total synergies – usually overstated in such deals – are put at $180m a year. Taxed and capitalised on 10 times that is worth $1.3bn, less than half of the market capitalisation premium being offered.The benefit of VM’s tax assets should already be in its share price, unless Mr Malone has an ingenious trick up his sleeve to extract more value from them. Likewise, the sop of an expanded share buyback programme at Liberty Global should be ignored. That said, with little chance of rival bids, and Mr Malone holding 35 per cent of LG’s votes, the deal should get done. Shareholders on both sides should ask why.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
403;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-01-31T18:47:56Z;House of Cards helps Netflix cut the cord;;The Washington preview screening this week of House of Cards had the air of a typical Hollywood premiere.An audience of political journalists, pundits – even the British ambassador – was shown the first two episodes of the new, $100m series. Guests mingled afterwards with Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright and other House of Cards stars, sipping champagne and nibbling canapés.There is one crucial difference between the series and other expensively produced TV shows featuring A-list film talent more familiar to audiences from their appearances on the big screen. House of Cards, a US political drama, will be aired only on Netflix, the subscription video service, and all 13 episodes will be made available simultaneously around the world Friday.“It’s the first time anyone has done something like this, taking a big-scale production that costs millions of dollars per episode and released it all at once,” Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said in an interview with the Financial Times. Last week in his quarterly letter to shareholders, he hailed the House of Cards launch as “a defining moment in the development of internet TV”.“Two years ago [when Netflix acquired the series] it may have been a big gamble,” he said. “But now that gamble is looking very good because of the growth of internet TV and the quality of the show.”The series is the most expensive original web series ever produced. Directed by David Fincher, who made hits that include The Social Network, Fight Club and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it is based on the 1990 BBC series of the same name. Netflix outbid established premium cable channels – including Time Warner’s HBO – when it acquired the series and, with five other original programmes in production, intends to use new “originals” to retain subscribers – and attract new ones.Netflix and rival online video providers such as Amazon, which also has a subscription service, and Hulu, which is owned by Walt Disney, News Corp and Comcast, hope to capture viewers who are “cutting the cord” with cable and satellite television. Put off by the rising cost of cable subscriptions, which are being inflated by the rising costs of sports media rights, many viewers are seeking cheaper alternatives online.Original production is more cost effective for Netflix and its rivals, said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG, in a research note. “With the cost of exclusive syndicated content escalating as competition builds, success in original programming . . . should help Netflix better manage its spending.” This will allow it to “give up on less important content that it originally paid for to build scale”.The House of Cards launch coincides with a resurgence in Netflix shares, which rose sharply last week when the company said it had attracted more subscribers in the pre-Christmas period than it had expected, taking its global customer base to 33m.Investors have endured a turbulent two years. In the summer of 2011 Netflix shares touched a high of $300, but after a series of missteps, including a botched price increase and rebranding, went into a downward spiral, falling as low as $53. They roared back to life last week, rising 70 per cent, and are now hovering at $165.Mr Hastings said the company was used to the rollercoaster ride. “We went public 11 years ago at $7.50 and promptly traded down to $2.50 so our stock has always been volatile and that takes a strong stomach. But throughout the ups and downs our north star has always been to build the best internet TV network.”When the stock tumbled last year the company was mentioned as a takeover target. Carl Icahn, the activist investor, built a 10 per cent stake and criticised the board. The value of his stake has since increased by more than $600m.Mr Hastings said shifting consumer habits were moving in Netflix’s favour. “As the internet grows, we grow.” He added: “A reason piracy is so big is because people are frustrated . . . they might be able to get the first two or three seasons of a show like Mad Men but not all five. We’re trying to change that.”With Netflix’s biggest bet on original content about to air, relations have even improved with Time Warner, HBO’s parent. The two companies have clashed over the years but Netflix recently struck new content deals for programming made by Turner Broadcasting and Warner Brothers, two Time Warner subsidiaries. “We wrote big cheques,” said Mr Hastings. “It has a habit of improving things.”
404;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-01-31T16:20:31Z;A TV that knows who you are;BSkyB’s plans to tailor advertising to individual viewers could change the economics of the industry;Advertisements for the local curry house, common in UK cinemas throughout the 1970s, are making a comeback. Only this time they will appear on television sets.Within months UK satellite broadcaster BSkyB will start TV’s fightback against the internet with its own “tailored” advertising service. For the first time this will enable TV ads in the UK to be targeted at specific homes based on viewing tastes, household make-up or even postcode.Commercials for people carriers could be shown only to households with children, and ads for top-of-the-range washing powders just to higher-income homes.The move will also allow advertisers to cherry-pick specific geographical areas right down to individual houses on particular streets. Media buyers say this will open up the world of TV advertising to new companies. Think of local takeaway restaurants, for whom TV advertising would have been too expensive, they say. Or even ultra high-end brands, such as Porsche, which have always shunned TV simply because it is too mass-market.“It is [Sky’s] answer to the digital conundrum,” says Anthony Ireson, UK marketing director at Ford. With traditional, “linear” broadcast advertising, “half your marketing is wasted”, he says. “It’s your chance to get rid of [the waste] so you only talk to the people you need to.”Such targeted advertising has been discussed in the TV world for years as the industry has sought to bring the personalisation of the internet to the TV set. In 2008 several US cable networks, including Comcast and Time Warner Cable, set up Project Canoe, a jointly owned company that would sell customised TV ads.That service is now focused on “time-shifted” video-on-demand rather than live TV broadcasts. But within a few months, Sky’s AdSmart will launch with live TV backed by between 30 and 50 different brands, the company says.“We will offer multiple executions to make brands more effective,” says Andrew Griffith, Sky’s chief financial officer. “So the last five seconds of a car ad could go to their local dealer or there could be different executions for the same slot.”AdSmart will work on Sky’s high-definition set-top boxes in the UK, which number 7.3m. Viewers who have not opted out of the service will have ads downloaded via satellite and stored on their boxes. These ads are then – seamlessly to the viewer – overlaid on linear broadcast adverts in line with the brands’ chosen targeting metrics.In addition to its own data on households and detailed information on their viewing patterns, Sky works with companies such as Experian, the credit checking agency, which helps it segment customers by lifestyle and affluence.●A carmaker could show different ads for the same car, focusing on economy or power of the engine depending on the audience. Anthony Ireson, Ford UK head of marketing, says: “If a family watches a lot of Nickelodeon – or tells Sky they have young children – we would serve a Kuga ad later in the parents’ viewing schedule, knowing they are the target audience. Today, we can only buy “ABC1 men” and make an assumption from their programme choice.”●A local restaurantmight see TV advertising as worthwhile now that it would reach just households within its neighbourhood.●In future, the cultural preferences of viewers – whether they watch French art-house films or popular soaps – could represent valuable information for companies selling items such as watches or jeans.In the future it may even seek to tap into viewers’ online behaviour, ac­cording to Sky insiders. So a household’s web searches for mortgages could result in mortgage ads being streamed to the TV set. But such a move would probably raise sensitive privacy issues and Sky says it has no current plans for such a service.What the satellite broadcaster does promise is a big range of targeting op­tions, based on household information, that offer different attractions for various advertisers. “The thing that will be most applied is the lifestyle element – say, targeting people who have just moved into a new home,” says Marc Mendoza, chief executive of media buying agency MPG. “We might want to target them with an EDF Energy commercial”.Paul Rowlinson, head of exchange at media buyer Mindshare, says the ability for TV advertisers to go hyper- local chimes with changes taking place in local communities. “There is a more general consumer trend towards local,” he says, “with markets springing up on the high street and moves towards a more local economy. So anything that allows you to be more direct in targeting this local audience has to be attractive.”For Ford, some of the most valuable opportunities lie in tailoring advertising messages to potential customers through deeper knowledge of the people it is targeting, says Mr Ireson.“When we launch a car we have too many messages,” he says. “For some people it’s about economy, for some it’s about insurance ratings, for some it’s about the technology in the engine. But there’s no point targeting older women about insurance groups.”Further, where homes have web- connected TVs, targeted ads will eventually be able to be interactive, like ads on the web. So, by pressing a button, for example, viewers could request a test drive on the car just advertised.In future, Sky is also looking to tailor ads based on users’ viewing behaviour. So, in addition to targeting ads based on household information, it will look at what they have been watching.Christophe Cauvy, European head of digital at advertising agency JWT, says Sky may have been inspired by Apple, which analyses individuals’ iTunes song choices to come up with different profiles for advertisers. The cultural preferences of viewers – whether they watch French art-house films or popular soaps – will prove highly valuable to many advertisers.“If you are selling salt or a mortgage you may not be interested in what music they are listening to or what they are watching,” he says. “But if you are selling a pair of jeans, a watch or a car, this is going to be very important.”The next debate for advertisers, however, is cost. While some are attracted by the prospects of greater targeting, and therefore less waste, the price has to be right. These sensitive discussions are taking place now.For Sky the hope is that greater targeting will increase advertisers’ return on investment and translate into higher overall revenues. With better targeting, advertisers will pay less overall than for a conventional, untargeted ad break. But they will pay more on a cost per thousand basis.The satellite broadcaster is also hoping to wholesale its service to channels such as ITV and Channel 4 so that Sky homes watching these channels could also receive targeted ads. In return it would want a share of their ad revenues.But rivals have their own plans for launching targeted advertising. Backers of the YouView web-connected TV service, which include the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 in the UK, are looking at introducing software that will enable targeted advertising on the TV set through these boxes, including on live broadcasts.In the meantime, they are focusing on their video-on-demand streaming services as such time-shifted viewing continues to grow.One of the leaders online is 4OD, Channel 4’s video-on-demand service, which has almost 7m registered users in the UK. The channel is now in discussions with ad agencies about a series of ad trials based on more detailed demographic data.About 5 per cent of Channel 4’s ad revenues are already believed to come through its online channel, with these revenues growing at about 30 per cent a year.But live television still dominates. According to Ofcom, the UK media regulator, live broadcasts account for 85 per cent of all viewing. It is easy to see how maximising ad revenues from live TV, rather than time-shifted viewing, could have the most significant impact for broadcasters.
405;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-01-29T18:51:22Z;YouTube to switch on paid-for video;;YouTube plans to start selling subscriptions to some channels on its video platform, throwing the Google-owned site into direct competition with cable television and streaming services such as Netflix.The company has invited a small number of content producers to submit proposals for channels that would charge $1-$5 per month, according to a person familiar with the matter.The paid-for channels would be launched as soon as the second quarter this year, the person said. YouTube, which has until now relied entirely on advertising, plans to take about 45 per cent of subscription revenues for itself and give the rest to the channel producer.“We have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models,” said a YouTube spokesperson. “There are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions, so we’re looking at that.”YouTube has in recent years pushed to make the content on its platform more professional and therefore more attractive to advertisers.To do so, YouTube allowed companies to create dedicated channels and split the advertising revenues, working with the likes of All3Media, Endemol and BBC Worldwide. MondoMedia, a group that produces off-beat adult cartoons, was the most popular channel on YouTube last week with 6m views and has been seen 1.4bn times since inception.YouTube’s shift into premium paid-for channels raises the stakes in the fast-evolving online video sector, which is beginning to resemble the early days of cable television before it grew into a multibillion-dollar business. The YouTube plans were first reported by Advertising Age.The site will face competition from a plethora of subscription services that already exist online. Hulu, which is jointly owned by Walt Disney, News Corporation and Comcast, has 3m subscribers and offers a range of TV programming from US TV networks such as ABC and Fox.Netflix, the world’s biggest online video service, has more than 30m subscribers and will this week premiere its $100m adaptation of the BBC series “House of Cards”.Directed by David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey, the series represents the biggest bet yet on original content made by Netflix or any of its competitors: Hulu and Amazon, which also has a subscription video service, are also producing original content to lure subscribers and differentiate themselves from TV networks and rival online operators.Google started to make a $100m investment in original content commissions for YouTube in late 2011. The funds are provided to film makers in the form of an advance against future advertising revenues.According to eMarketer, a research firm, advertising spending on digital video in the US grew by 47 per cent to $2.9bn last year but is still dwarfed by the $65bn spent on TV ads.Television made up about 40 per cent of total media spending in the US in 2012, according to eMarketer, compared with less than 2 per cent from online video.
406;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Networks join to create Hispanic TV company;;"A $400m merger of three television networks and a special purpose acquisition company is set to create the first publicly traded TV company focused entirely on the US Hispanic population, whose growth and rising buying power is attracting advertisers and media investors.InterMedia Partners, Leo Hindery’s private equity firm, said on Wednesday it had agreed to merge its Cinelatino and Intermedia Español Holdings businesses with Azteca Acquisition, a $100m SPAC founded by Gabriel Brener, owner of the Houston Dynamo football team.The merger will bring together Cinelatino, the top-rated Spanish-language film network on cable television, with two Intermedia Español businesses: WAPA Americas, a cable network targeting Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean Hispanics living in the US; and WAPA TV, the largest broadcast TV network in Puerto Rico’s highly concentrated market.A Nasdaq initial public offering of the new Miami-based company, Hemisphere Media Group, will offer “the only way for the public to invest in a pure-play Hispanic TV/cable network business,” Peter Kern, managing director of InterMedia, said in a statement.Hemisphere is a fraction of the size of the largest Hispanic TV companies in the US: Univision, the broadcast TV ratings leader, is owned by private equity firms and Mexico’s Televisa, while Telemundo, a broadcast and cable rival, is part of NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast and GE.“We think we have a business here that’s unique in the marketplace,” Alan Sokol, senior partner of InterMedia and Hemisphere’s CEO-designate, told the Financial Times, adding that it would be able to use equity, cash and debt to expand through acquisitions after the IPO.He would not discuss potential acquisition targets but said Hemisphere was interested in Hispanic cable channels, Spanish-language content production and distribution, and expanding in Latin America.About 12m US homes subscribe to Spanish-language cable TV channels, which account for 19 per cent of all viewing in Spanish-speaking homes but attract just 8 per cent of all Hispanic advertising budgets.“We still think there’s a huge opportunity gap here between the size of the audience and the size of the advertising pie devoted to that audience,” Mr Sokol said.Current Azteca shareholders will own about 27 per cent of Hemisphere on the deal’s completion, which is expected by April 6, with one vote per share, while InterMedia and other investors in Cinelatino will own about 73 per cent with 10 votes per share."
407;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-01-04T23:08:47Z;Kilar quits as Hulu chief executive;;Hulu, owned by News Corp, Walt Disney and Comcast, is looking for a new chief executive after Jason Kilar announced he was leaving the online video service, one of the biggest in the US.Mr Kilar leaves with about $40m, his share of a $134m “employee equity-based compensation” plan which was triggered by the recent sale of Providence Equity Partners’ 10 per cent stake in the company.The stake, initially purchased in 2007 by Providence for $100m, was redeemed by News Corp and Disney last year following a disagreement between the media companies and the private equity firm over Hulu’s future direction.Those disagreements ultimately led to Mr Kilar’s departure, according to people familiar with the situation. Providence and Mr Kilar were keen to build a standalone business backed by exclusive content but the other shareholders rejected the idea, fearing that giving Hulu exclusive rights to their hit shows would erode revenues from their traditional television businesses.Hulu receives most of its TV content from its shareholders, News Corp and Disney: Comcast also provides content from its NBCUniversal division, but is a silent partner.The differences between Mr Kilar and the shareholders came to a head in recent months, with Mr Kilar pushing for more funds to expand Hulu internationally, according to those close to the situation.Mr Kilar, a former executive with Amazon, wrote in a blog post that he was working with the Hulu board to “ensure there is ample runway” to manage the transition to a new chief executive. Rich Tom, chief technology officer, has also resigned.During his five years in charge, Hulu has evolved into one of the market leaders with more than 3m subscribers. However, despite generating revenues of $700m in 2012, thanks to its mix of subscriber and advertising revenue, the company has never made a profit and has trailed the pace of growth at Netflix, its larger rival.Mr Kilar’s tenure was also marred by disagreements with shareholders. In a 2011 blog post he infuriated News Corp and Disney – which both own US TV networks – when he wrote that “traditional TV has too many ads”. Disney said at the time that Mr Kilar’s views were “personal and clearly not shared by anyone at Walt Disney”.His departure comes at a pivotal point for the nascent online video sector. The US online video advertising market grew more than 46 per cent to $2.93bn last year, according to eMarketer, a research firm. More than 30 per cent of the US population watched TV online in 2012, up from 26.6 per cent a year earlier.Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of News Corp, said in a statement on Friday that Mr Kilar “and his team have done a great job building Hulu into one of the leading online video services available today”. Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, said Disney was “proud of his achievements”.
408;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2013-01-03T20:18:02Z;Al Jazeera to buy Al Gore’s Current TV;;Television economics rather than politics pose the biggest challenge to Al Jazeera’s US ambitions, analysts said after the Qatari news channel bought Al Gore’s Current TV network.The deal, for an estimated $300m-$500m, transforms the distribution for Al Jazeera, whose English language service has attracted online viewers in the US but struggled to win over cable and satellite operators.Current reached 60m of the 100m homes in the US, compared with 4.7m homes for Al Jazeera English. However, Time Warner Cable dropped Current immediately, cutting its reach to 41m homes.People familiar with the situation said Time Warner Cable had been in talks to end Current’s carriage deal for months. Distributors are squeezing smaller channels as the rising cost of premium networks, notably those with sports rights, compresses margins. The new Al Jazeera America, which will feature a majority of US news, must now demonstrate that it can attract a larger audience than Current, which averaged just over 40,000 viewers, analysts said.Its need to buy Current “is emblematic of the challenge of getting distribution”, said Rich Greenfield, a BTIG Research analyst. “At least they’re in homes now. It’s really hard to prove you have an audience without distribution.”Al Jazeera said it was confident of making money. “This was a deeply analysed business decision,” a spokesman said: “This is not an ego play.”The Current deal is the latest high-profile international gambit by an emirate with gas – and cash – to burn. Qatar bought French football club Paris St Germain in 2011, while Al Jazeera last month secured Uefa Champions League football rights in France.The channel has faced scrutiny because of Qatar’s prominent role in the regional turmoil of the past two years, but Al Jazeera executives have dismissed claims that its coverage has been tailored to suit Doha’s diplomatic goals.The Bush administration often accused the channel of carrying anti-American propaganda, and Glenn Beck, the former Fox News host, echoed such views on Thursday, calling Al Jazeera “a Qatar government outlet that ran every terrorist video and hates America”.Mr Beck said his multimedia company had tried to buy Current but had been rebuffed by its liberal owners on ideological grounds. Current had sought offers of $250m-$300m, he said, although another person familiar with the auction put the asking price above $500m, closer to analysts’ estimates.The price range suggests Mr Gore, Bill Clinton’s former vice-president, could make between $50m and $100m from the deal.The New York Times looked briefly at Current, according to one person close to the process.Derek Baine, an SNL Kagan analyst, said the proliferation of channels in recent years had hit distributors’ profits: “We’re going through a point in time where cable operators are dropping channels, not adding them. Margins in video have been going down for years, and they’re getting tired of it.”There had been “just not enough proof there’s going to be an audience” to interest distributors in Al Jazeera to date, he added. Al Jazeera America was “an unproven channel,” he said: “They’re not going to have much time to test the concept” before Current’s remaining distribution deals come up for renewal.
409;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-12-17T13:30:14Z;Sprint seals $2.2bn Clearwire deal;;Sprint Nextel plans to take full control of Clearwire with a sweetened $2.2bn offer for the remaining 49 per cent stake in the US mobile broadband telecoms business it doesn’t already own.Sprint raised its offer for Clearwire to $2.97 a share, from an initial bid of $2.90 a share, which took the deal to a value of $2.2bn. That was, however, still well below the $6 to $8-a-share some shareholders were looking for.The deal, which will provide Sprint with access to Clearwire’s substantial spectrum holdings, has been approved by Clearwire board as well as Japan’s SoftBank, which in October agreed to buy 70 per cent of Sprint for about $20bn.“Softbank is supportive of the merger agreement announced today by Sprint and Clearwire, and believes that, when completed, the proposed transaction will better position both Sprint and Clearwire to bring greater competition and enhanced mobile services to American consumers,” the Japanese company said.Once completed, the transaction will bolster the third largest telecom groups by subscribers in the US market and enable it to compete more effectively with Verizon Wireless, AT&T and Deutsche Telekom”s T-Mobile USA unit.US mobile operators are locked in a race to deliver the next generation 4G mobile broadband services that smartphone and tablet users require. Clearwire’s spectrum will enable Sprint to build a more expansive 4G network based on LTE technology with greater capacity.Clearwire, formed in 2008 by Sprint and a group of technology and cable TV companies as a wholesale wireless data services supplier, has received commitments from Comcast, Intel and Bright House Networks, who collectively own 13 per cent of its voting shares, to vote in favour of the transaction. More traditional institutional shareholders include Highbridge Capital Management and Mount Kellet Capital.The transaction puts Clearwire’s total enterprise value at $10bn, including net debt and spectrum lease obligations of $5.5bn. Shares in Clearwire rose more than 40 per cent last week as news of the deal leaked.Sprint said that the transaction provided Clearwire shareholders with “attractive value”, adding that it would be “uniquely positioned” to use Clearwire’s 2.5 GHz spectrum assets.Dan Hesse, Sprint chief executive, said: “Today’s transaction marks yet another significant step in Sprint’s improved competitive position and ability to offer customers better products, more choices and better services.”Clearwire and Sprint have entered into agreements that provide up to $800m of additional financing for Clearwire in the form of notes which will be exchangeable under certain conditions for Clearwire common stock at $1.50 per share.Erik Prusch, Clearwire chief executive, said: “Our board of directors has been reviewing available strategic alternatives over the course of the last two years…[This] is the best path forward.”
410;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-12-13T19:53:27Z;Sprint / Clearwire – down to the wire;Investors in other US wireless companies should be watching closely;Asking what wireless spectrum is worth is like asking what land is worth. It depends on any number of factors. Where is it? How good is the soil? Who are the neighbours? So it isn’t easy to evaluate Sprint’s offer for the Clearwire shares it does not already own. The $2.90-per-share offer implies a value of about 20 cents for each MHz-POP (a measure of spectrum coverage) of Clearwire’s spectrum, once the company’s debt and the value of its spectrum leasing agreements are backed out.Mount Kellett Capital, which owns more than 7 per cent of Clearwire’s shares, thinks the spectrum is worth 38 cents/MHz-POP, implying that each share is worth $8.50. It argues that this is the value paid by AT&T for NextWave this summer in order to get spectrum of a similar quality.The intrinsic value of the spectrum is not the only factor, however. There is a serious power imbalance between Sprint and minority shareholders such as Mount Kellett. Sprint already owns half of Clearwire, and needs only 75 per cent of the shares to consent to the merger, according to Clearwire’s equity holders agreement. Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Intel financed Clearwire in the hope of fostering wimax, an alternative wireless technology.Those hopes came to nothing, and the three companies now own nearly 16 per cent of the shares – small potatoes for them. Will they fight alongside Mount Kellett?Clearwire is also burning cash ($270m in the first nine months of this year) so there is pressure to get a deal done.Investors in other US wireless companies should watch closely. Should Sprint (and its soon to be majority owner, SoftBank) get control of Clearwire and use it, as expected, to offer wireless data products with low, all-you-can-eat pricing, the competitive repercussions could be significant in an industry where margins are tightening and carriers are trying to raise data prices.Clearwire’s minority shareholders might not be the only ones hurt by Softbank’s ambition.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
411;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-12-11T23:27:43Z;Sprint in talks to buy rest of Clearwire;;Sprint is in talks to buy the 49 per cent of Clearwire it does not already own, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would give the US wireless carrier additional spectrum as it moves to challenge rivals Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile.The talks were preliminary and no deal was guaranteed, these people said, but Sprint was talking with shareholders of Clearwire’s publicly traded stock about buying them out. Minority holders include companies such as Comcast and Intel, and also institutional shareholders such as Highbridge Capital Management and Mount Kellet Capital.Any deal could be complicated by the fact that Sprint is in the midst of its own deal. In October SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications group, said it would acquire 70 per cent of Sprint for $20.1bn.Shortly after, Sprint bought out a small stake in Clearwire to re-establish its majority equity control of the mobile broadband pioneer. However that did not give it full control of the spectrum it covets, which is overseen by a special committee.People familiar with the process said Sprint was approaching Comcast and Intel in hopes of striking a deal, and then would launch a tender offer for the rest of the outstanding shares.Shares of Clearwire rose 12 per cent on the news, to $2.68 each. CNBC said Sprint was in talks with some shareholders about a purchase price of $3 a share.Sprint’s relationship with Clearwire has been a source of analyst speculation and confusion since Sprint helped form the company in 2008 as a joint venture with $3.2bn in capital from a group of technology and cable TV partners including Google, Intel, Comcast and Time Warner Cable.However the US telecommunications market – particularly the broadband wireless market – has changed dramatically since, as have the strategic interests of many of Clearwire’s original investors.This, coupled with Clearwire’s perennial funding needs, has prompted a succession of rumours over the years that Sprint Nextel was poised to take full control of Clearwire.
412;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-11-28T20:29:18Z;Media groups grapple with succession;Boards struggle to find leaders to meet modern challenges;The big succession question at News Corp has been answered, for now at least. No, not the endlessly discussed matter of whether Lachlan, James or Elisabeth Murdoch will one day take the reins from their 81-year-old father, Rupert.The less asked but more pressing question has been who could possibly follow Roger Ailes, the polarising genius behind Fox News, whose ability to charge cable and satellite distributors ever growing carriage fees has driven the recent growth in the Murdoch empire.The cable networks division that Fox News spearheads made $3.3bn in operating profit last year. But Mr Ailes is 72, and his contract was due to come up next June, raising the question of who else could maintain its unique brand of polemic and keep the market leader on top.Thankfully, News Corp has found someone to fill his shoes: Roger Ailes. A new contract will keep him at the network until after the 2016 presidential election.Other news organisations have been grappling with the succession question. Jim Walton, CNN’s president, is stepping down at the end of the year after tripling earnings but failing to reverse a ratings decline. Analysts struggled to think of choices to succeed him, and a protracted search suggested that Time Warner, CNN’s owner, was having similar trouble. It has reportedly picked Jeff Zucker, who ran all of NBCUniversal before Comcast took over.CNN is hardly alone in the media sector as it struggles to find internal leadership candidates. Companies from the magazine sector to the music business have picked up the habit of looking outside when they have a vacancy at the top: after a decade of digital disruption, too few media executives have unblemished records of success or foolproof recipes for the future.More common is to hear boards ask whether Google, Apple or some other tech company might have someone who could walk in and give their struggling media company instant digital credibility. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt hired Linda Zecher from Microsoft last year and McGraw-Hill this year picked Buzz Waterhouse, an IBM veteran, to run the education business it is now selling.Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, Penguin and education businesses, has chosen John Fallon, a long-term insider, to follow Dame Marjorie Scardino after 16 years as chief executive officer. But there have been few simple internal successions in media, not least in hard-hit print publishers.Mr Murdoch turned to executives from News Corp’s pay-television businesses to run his UK and Australian newspapers and is about to name a head of the publishing company they sit within. The New York Times had to look across the Atlantic to find its new chief, only for Mark Thompson to become the focus of investigations into events on his watch as director-general of the BBC. His successor at the BBC lasted 54 days.Jack Griffin lasted less than six months at Time Inc, Time Warner’s magazine arm, after a clash of styles. Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner’s CEO, then hired somebody who, like Mr Thompson, had no print experience, choosing Laura Lang for the digital advertising understanding she had gleaned running Digitas, part of Publicis.Unsurprisingly, boards with successful CEOs are reluctant to let them go. Maurice Lévy, Publicis’s CEO, extended his contract in 2010 and Mr Bewkes has just signed a deal to stay at Time Warner until 2017. This is looking like a trend: in October, Walt Disney asked Bob Iger to stay on as CEO until 2016 and CBS gave Les Moonves an extension until 2017. All are successful, but this hardly indicates that boards are working hard to develop a new generation of digital leaders.The media sector has always had specific challenges, from the prevalence of controlling families to the need for CEOs to understand both commercial and creative imperatives. But if succession problems persist, they will have costly consequences, weakening investor confidence. The challenge for media boards and investors is to improve internal succession planning. Hoping that one person can do everything expected of a modern media CEO may be unrealistic. Splitting the chairman and CEO roles makes good sense in any sector but media companies also need more digital deputies and chief operating officers who can bring needed new skills while rounding out their experience to be ready for the top job.Meanwhile, fans of News Corp succession speculation can look forward to it being split next year. Its entertainment and publishing arms will need two executive teams and two boards. If Mr Murdoch wants to double down on his bet on family succession, he could put Lachlan on one and James on the other.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times’ media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness

The shares dropped 6.4 per cent to $91.93 on Monday, however the stock is still nearly 45 per cent higher since January.Rivals Cablevision and Comcast also fell, losing 1.5 per cent to $16.53 and 0.5 per cent to $37.43 respectively. Traditional cable service providers have been losing custom to internet streaming companies such as Netflix and Hulu.US equities closed higher after a volatile session a day ahead of the presidential election. In the 2008 election, in which Barack Obama defeated John McCain, the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent on the eve of the election.As stocks see-sawed, traders weighed different outcomes from the presidential and congressional elections on “fiscal cliff” negotiations which, if unresolved, would have significant economic consequences.“The markets are in a cautious and indecisive mode,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.“Investors will not want to make any asset allocation decisions until after the elections. They will wait to see the composition of the Congress and what is the future of the monetary policy,” she added.Randy Frederick, managing director of Active Trading & Derivatives at Charles Schwab, agreed that markets would trade sideways amid light volume until the results of the presidential and congressional elections are known.“Markets are more concerned about uncertainty than anything else. But once we have the results and regardless of who wins, we believe markets will rise in the last two months of the year,” Mr Frederick said.On Monday the ISM services index in October came in at 54.2 – indicating growth, albeit slightly slower than in September.The CBOE Vix index of implied volatility rose 3.8 per cent to 18.2, highlighting nervousness among traders. The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent higher at 1,417.26, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher, by 0.1 per cent to 13,112.44.The utilities sector was the worst performer, falling 1.7 per cent.Shares in FirstEnergy, whose 1m customers in New Jersey still do not have power, after Hurricane Sandy, fell 3 per cent to $42.60. Consolidated Edison, which provides electricity and natural gas in the New York metropolitan area, also fell 2 per cent to $58.The Nasdaq Composite Index traded in and out of positive territory and closed 0.6 per cent higher at 2,999.66.Nasdaq’s biggest component, Apple, opened with strong gains, but pared that early advance to trade 1.4 per cent higher at $584.80 on news that it sold 3m iPad mini tablets over the device’s debut weekend.Among the best performers on the S&P 500 was E-Trade, which rose 4.3 per cent to $8.76 after it said it planned to sell $1.3bn worth of 5- and 7-year senior notes in order to retire previously issued debt with higher interest rates.Dover rose 4 per cent to $61.91 after the manufacturer announced a $1bn share buyback programme as well as plans to sell some non-core units.Media company CBS rose 2.4 per cent to $34.01 after being upgraded by analysts at Barclays and Evercore.Anthony DiClemente at Barclays wrote that a pullback in the CBS share price over the past two months presented a buying opportunity.“Given its increasing exposure to recurring affiliate fees, growing demand for syndicated content, and digital distribution opportunities, CBS fundamentals are less exposed to cyclical advertising revenue than many investors assume.”“As such, we are willing to pay a higher multiple than we would have paid for CBS a few years ago when the business was more cyclical,” Mr DiClemente wrote.Among losers, McGraw-Hill, owner of the rating agency Standard & Poor’s, saw its shares drop sharply after its rating unit was found to have misled investors by the Federal Court of Australia. The ruling could pave the way for legal action in Europe. The stock dropped 4 per cent to $52.24 on Monday amid high volume.Shares in rival rating agency Moody’s also fell sharply, by 3 per cent to $46.60.Research In Motion, maker of BlackBerry smartphones, rose 2.2 per cent to $8.90 and has gained 18.7 per cent since the start of October.After the market closed, Express Scripts said analysts’ forecasts for its 2013 results were “overly aggressive”, citing a weak business climate.

414;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-11-05T19:42:55Z;Comcast and TWC – willing and cable;There is more to these US groups than subscriber growth;The rally in US cable stocks has been strong, steady and sensible. The shares of the two largest companies in the space, Comcast and Time Warner Cable, had both returned about 40 per cent more than the broader market during the past year as of the end of last week. The outperformance is eminently reasonable. Comcast and TWC, with more than 30m customers between them, have delivered revenue growth ahead of US output. In their most defensive business – providing households and businesses with internet connections – subscriber growth has been rock solid.Things might look a bit different this week, however, after TWC reported its third-quarter results. Internet subscriber additions were hardly terrible, at 85,000 – but this was fewer new customers than in the third quarter of last year. This follows three quarters of increasing additions. At Comcast, by contrast, customer additions have been accelerating for several quarters, including the third. And TWC has lost significantly more pay-TV customers in the past year than Comcast, despite starting from a much smaller base. It looks, suddenly, like Comcast is the better way to ride the ageing cable rally. Comcast’s NBCUniversal content business, which contributes a quarter of profits, is prospering, too.TWC’s third-quarter numbers should not be blown out of proportion. Its combination of growth, defensiveness and a reasonable if not bargain valuation (16 times this year’s earnings, a bit cheaper than Comcast) remains attractive. It is also an exceptionally generous company with investors: during the past year it has returned almost every penny of its free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Comcast has returned only a little more than half of the cash it has churned out. This may, however, represent another point in Comcast’s favour. If the internet subscriber growth story tails off, it can placate investors with more payouts. TWC has already pulled that lever about as hard as it can.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
415;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-09-26T16:22:32Z;Televisa – Tech’s Mex;Mexican media conglomerate is a tale of many parts;Televisa, the Mexican media conglomerate, was built on telenovelas and is itself a tale of many parts and characters. Those new to the drama will be struck by two themes: the pace of expansion, and profitability. The company’s various production and distribution businesses have high margins, fast growth, or both.The TV broadcasting business generates lots of cash. Revenues are not growing but the company sells content to pay-TV networks across the Spanish-speaking world and to Univision in the US (in which Televisa has a 30 per cent economic stake). These revenues are growing at a clip that Disney or Viacom can only envy. The cable and satellite distribution businesses are growing at double-digit rates, too, well ahead of US and European operators.Yet the shares have missed out on the big rally that has gripped big-cap media stocks globally, including Televisa’s vertically-integrated peers News Corp and Comcast.What is the problem? Televisa is investing heavily in cable infrastructure. Investors may be dismayed to see cash from its capital-light content business spent on capital-intensive distribution.There is a deeper worry, too: incipient competition with Carlos Slim’s Telmex. Regulatory wrangles are preventing Telmex from distributing video over its huge fixed-line telephone infrastructure but these will not last forever. Accentuating the threat of profit-killing competition, Televisa entered Mr Slim’s home turf when it bought half of mobile provider Iusacell SA last year.Televisa’s ability to predict long-term changes in the structure of the Mexican media market may not be much better than investors’. But it could give them a much clearer sense of its capital allocation plan over the medium term.How long will capital expenditure remain elevated? How much further investment in the mobile telephony business should be expected? The company has not said. Televisa has a good story to tell. It needs to make the plot simpler to follow.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
416;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-09-23T20:07:05Z;Liberty Global – willing and cable;Bid to consolidate European market linked to industry retaining central role;"Is the cable business the same everywhere? Consider the case of the largest European operator, Liberty Global, and the largest US player, Comcast. The market, apparently, sees the two companies as mirror images: the stocks have moved up arm in arm over the past two years; they trade at nearly identical multiples of enterprise value to forward earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation; and their free cash flow yields are within 1 percentage point of each other.The companies are very different, however – even without Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal, which put it into the content creation business. Margins are not too far apart, with much higher revenues per user in the US balanced somewhat by lower European programming costs, and both return plenty of capital to shareholders.The dramatic difference is that Liberty also loads debt on its balance sheet to buy up smaller cable operators – its stated strategy is to consolidate the highly fragmented European cable industry. Last week’s deal to acquire the half of Belgium’s Telenet it did not own for $2.5bn follows the $4.5bn purchase of Germany’s KBW in 2011 and $5.2bn for another German operator, Unity Media, in 2009.Comcast operates in a highly consolidated market, due in large part to the efforts of John Malone, Liberty’s chairman, in past decades. There simply are not many little competitors for it to buy.Is the market right to put the same value on these disparate companies? This depends on the returns that Liberty can wring from its acquisitions over time. Mr Malone made his investors a great deal of money consolidating the US market. Whether he can do the same in Europe depends on whether cable can retain its central and lucrative place in European media distribution. Owning Liberty Global shares is a leveraged bet that it will.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
417;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-08-23T22:35:21Z;Verizon spectrum deal gains approval;;Verizon Wireless cleared the final hurdle in its bid to acquire valuable spectrum from a group of US cable TV operators as the Federal Communications Commission conditionally approved the $3.6bn deal as well as separate transactions involving Leap Wireless and T-Mobile USA.The deal between Verizon Wireless and the cable companies, which was also approved by the US Justice Department last week, had been opposed by some rivals and politicians because of concerns about its impact on competition and an associated cross-marketing agreement under which Verizon and the cable companies will resell each others’ services.In a move that was widely seen by analysts and others as an attempt to blunt opposition to the transaction and win regulatory approval for the deal, Verizon Wireless subsequently announced that it would sell some spare spectrum to T-Mobile USA if its deal with the cable companies was approved.In approving the deal the FCC did, however, impose a number of other conditions on the transaction including a requirement that Verizon meet goals for introducing services using the new spectrum and that it offer data roaming to competitors at fair prices – conditions that Verizon Wireless accepted.“This purchase represents a milestone in the industry and we appreciate the FCC’s diligent work to review and approve the transaction,” said Dan Mead, president and chief executive officer of Verizon Wireless. “We will work aggressively to ensure that we put this previously unused spectrum to use quickly to benefit customers.”Under the terms of the main transaction, Verizon Wireless, the largest US mobile operator by subscriber numbers, will acquire nearly 20MHz of spectrum from SpectrumCo, a joint venture that includes cable operators Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and BrightHouse, and additional spectrum in the same band from Cox Communications.Verizon Wireless will use the new spectrum to extend the rollout of its 4G wireless broadband network based on LTE technology. Meanwhile Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit, the fourth-largest US mobile operator, will use the spectrum it is acquiring from Verizon Wireless to compete more effectively against it larger rivals and expand the planned introduction of its own LTE network.
418;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-08-16T16:56:05Z;Verizon Wireless spectrum deal approved;;US regulators approved a $3.6bn purchase of spectrum by Verizon Wireless from a consortium of cable operators while imposing some conditions on an associated and controversial cross-marketing deal between the companies.The agreement represents a significant victory for Verizon Wireless, the largest US mobile operator by subscribers, which needs the spectrum to expand its 4G broadband data network, and the cable companies, which include Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Bright House Communications which want to be able to offer mobile phone service in addition to their video, internet and fixed voice services.It comes despite opposition to some aspects of the deal from rivals and some lawmakers who feared it might reduce competition, particularly in areas where Verizon Communications, which together with Britain’s Vodafone group owns the Verizon Wireless joint venture, and the cable companies both offer TV and broadband internet services.These concerns centred on a cross-marketing agreement between the companies under which the cable companies plan to sell Verizon Wireless mobile service to their customers, while Verizon will offer cable TV services to its customers. Both sides have been involved in what were described as “fluid” negotiations over this issue in recent weeks.Under the terms of the proposed agreement, Verizon will be required to divest some of its wireless spectrum, including spectrum that it had already conditionally offered to sell to T-Mobile USA, the Deutsche Telekom mobile unit. T-Mobile USA will use the spectrum to expand its own planned 4G network using LTE technology.As part of the agreement the Department of Justice has negotiated a consent agreement with the companies under which they have agreed to limit the scope of their co-marketing and resale agreements.“By limiting the scope and duration of the commercial agreements among Verizon and the cable companies while at the same time allowing Verizon and T-Mobile to proceed with their spectrum acquisitions, the department has provided the right remedy for competition and consumers,” Joseph Wayland, acting assistant attorney-general in charge of the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, said in a statement.“The Antitrust Division’s enforcement action ensures that robust competition between Verizon and the cable companies continues now and in the future as technological change alters the telecommunications landscape.”The agreement with the DoJ clears the way for the Federal Communications Commission to also approve the deal. “I believe the commission should now approve this transaction, and I will be circulating a draft order to my colleagues that would do so,” said Julius Genachowski, the FCC chairman in a statement.Commenting on the agreement, David Cohen, executive vice-president of Comcast, said: “We appreciate the timely completion of the antitrust review by the government of the proposed sale of spectrum and associated commercial agreements between Verizon Wireless, Comcast, and the other cable companies.“And, we are pleased that the consent decree that we have negotiated with the Department of Justice preserves the most important goals of the agreements, including Comcast’s ability to market Verizon Wireless services throughout our footprint in order to offer our customers a wireless option, Verizon Wireless’ ability to market our products in virtually all of our footprint.”Time Warner Cable said the agreements with Verizon Wireless are good for customers by providing more choice and convenience.“We’re pleased that the Department of Justice preserved the most important consumer benefits of the agreements in its approval,” the company said in a statement. “We now look forward to prompt action on the part of the FCC.”The Free Press, a non-partisan media public interest group, urged government regulators to address potential monopolistic environment that most consumers will face when selecting broadband services.“This concession doesn’t deal with the deep structural problems in the market for at-home broadband service. There is still no meaningful competition – and that will mean higher prices for everyone,” Joel Kelsey, a Free Press policy adviser, said in a statement.
419;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-08-07T22:11:44Z;US cable companies – that vision thing;The big four have steady TV businesses and growing broadband franchises;With the economy looking ready to slump and bond yields excruciatingly low, this is the time to own defensive stocks. Alas, it is not always clear which stocks those are.Take the US cable companies. They might not look safe, for two reasons. First, ever the most reliable way to cover one’s, ah, downside is not to overpay, and the cable players are not especially cheap. Following a strong rally, the four companies that rule the industry – Time Warner Cable, Comcast, Cablevision and Charter – trade between 16 and 20 times this year’s earnings estimates, a few notches above the market.Second, defensive stocks are defined as having extremely stable core businesses. And the biggest business in cable, distributing television programming, is considered wobbly. Customers are learning to watch TV over the internet, the argument goes.Yet all four companies have now reported second-quarter earnings, and, once again, while there was a drop in TV customers, it amounted to a slow trickle rather than dangerous leak. TV subscribers at the big four fell by about 400,000, off a 42m base, from the first quarter. But this is less than was lost in the past two second quarters.Video margins are under pressure too, as programming costs continue to grow faster than flattish TV revenues. Happily, high-speed internet subscriptions are making up the difference in both sales and margins. Total revenue growth is in the mid-single digits and margins are steady at three of the four companies (Cablevision is having company-specific problems).These companies have surprisingly steady TV businesses and growing broadband franchises. They generate cash. Except for highly-indebted Charter, they pay solid dividends. The shares are a bit pricey. But in an uncertain, low-yield world, safety isn’t free.

420;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-08-03T00:30:56Z;AT&T in three deals for spectrum;;AT&T is to acquire spectrum from three companies including NextWave Wireless, which it will acquire for $600m in cash.According to Federal Communications Commission filings, AT&T has applied for approval to acquire additional spectrum from Comcast, the US cable TV operator, and from Horizon Wi-Com, a small Miami-based mobile broadband company. AT&T declined to comment on the report.Like other mobile operators in the US, AT&T needs additional spectrum to accommodate the rapidly growing data requirements of its smartphone and tablet-owning customers. To meet these demands, AT&T, which operates the second-largest mobile network in the US by subscriber numbers, is building a new 4G network based on LTE technology.The acquisition price of NextWave, a wireless spectrum holding company, includes $25m for its shares and an additional $25m if certain conditions are met. The deal sent the shares, which trade over the counter, soaring from 25 cents at Wednesday’s close to $1.29.NextWave, which was spun out from Qualcomm in 1995 and at one stage filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, holds licences in the Wireless Communication Services and Advanced Wireless Service bands.WCS spectrum was first auctioned in 1997, but has not been used for mobile data because of government restrictions designed to avoid possible interference with satellite radio transmissions in adjacent spectrum bands.In June, AT&T and Sirius XM, the US satellite radio operator, filed a joint proposal with the FCC that the two companies argue would enable the spectrum to be used for mobile internet services while protecting the adjacent satellite radio spectrum from interference. The FCC is reviewing that proposal.On Thursday AT&T said the proposed WCS rule changes and NextWave acquisition “represent an alternative approach to creating additional wireless network capacity to help support skyrocketing wireless data usage on smartphones and tablets”.If approved, the company said it would begin initial deployment of WCS spectrum for added 4G LTE capacity in approximately three years.Earlier this year, after its $39bn takeover bid for T-Mobile USA was blocked by regulators, AT&T acquired additional spectrum from Qualcomm.Meanwhile, Verizon Wireless, the largest US mobile operator by subscribers, has also been trying to bolster its spectrum holdings and is seeking regulatory approval for the purchase of spectrum licences from a group of cable TV companies including Comcast.That deal has been held up because of concerns expressed by some rivals and members of Congress about an associated cross-marketing agreement between Verizon and the cable companies. Regulators are expected to rule on the deal this month.
421;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-08-01T20:54:36Z;Knight Capital leads losses in 33% fall;;US equities turned negative after the Federal Reserve signalled it would provide no further easing following its latest policy meeting.Wednesday’s tensions were punctuated by unusual algorithmic activity in the morning session that sent trading volumes soaring and triggered wild price fluctuations on several stocks.Knight Capital Group, the market-making and trading firm, lost a third of its market capitalisation after the company advised clients to execute trades elsewhere because of “technology issues”. Shares plummeted 32.8 per cent to $6.94.The S&P 500 struggled higher as the day opened but fell as much as 0.5 per cent before paring back some of its losses. The benchmark index closed 0.3 per cent down at 1,375.34.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 0.3 per cent lower at 12,977.13, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,920.21.Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, noted that many observers were already expecting the Fed to take action next month rather than in August because the most important issues facing markets remained in Europe.Market commentator Mike Ingram of BGC Partners also continued to focus on European monetary policy, noting: “Supportive statements from the leaders of France and Germany have helped to maintain the momentum and create the expectation that we are about to see some game-changing move in the ongoing eurozone crisis saga.”No single sector dominated on Wednesday as trading patterns fluctuated throughout the day. By the market’s close, nine out of 10 sectors on Wall Street were in negative territory.In healthcare, Humana rallied 4.8 per cent to $63.91. The shares traded at an all-time low on Tuesday after the US health insurance company lowered its full-year outlook.In materials, DuPont, one of the world’s largest chemical companies, saw its shares rally in the morning session after it was reported that Monsanto’s $1bn suit over patent infringement would go to a jury. However, the stock gave up most of the gains to close 0.5 per cent higher to $49.94,United States Steel added 4.6 per cent to $21.61 while Dow Chemical rose 1.8 per cent to $29.30.One of Wall Street’s best performers on Wednesday was Frontier Communications, whose shares rose 10.7 per cent to $4.34. The phone and internet provider to consumers and businesses in rural and small towns beat analysts’ earnings estimates.The telecoms sector continues to be Wall Street’s strongest performing sector, with the S&P telecom index gaining 20 per cent in the year to date.Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, rose 3 per cent to $33.55 after reporting a 6 per cent increase to $9.9bn in cable revenue over the second quarter. The largest US cable network by market capitalisation has gained more than 40 per cent since the beginning of the year.Direct rival Time Warner, which owns television networks such as HBO, reversed earlier losses to rise 1.2 per cent to $39.60, despite missing earnings estimates.The automotive sector was also in the spotlight as carmaker GM is due to release earnings on Thursday. GM shares traded 0.2 per cent higher at $19.66, while rival Ford lost 2.2 per cent to $9.04.The industry was buoyed by strong second-quarter sales news from Chrysler, which saw a 13 per cent rise in sales in July, its best performance in that month in the past five years.GM and Ford, however, did not fare as well over the month, reporting a 6 per cent and a 4 per cent drop in US fleet purchases, respectively.In other earnings news, Harley-Davidson shares fell 3.6 per cent to $41.67 after reporting better than expected earnings, but the group lowered its outlook for the year’s second half.There was grim news from MasterCard, which saw its shares decrease by 2.2 per cent to $427.20 after it reported worse than expected net revenues and it issued a warning of a worldwide slowdown in consumption.In technology, Facebook and Zynga continued to hit record lows. Shares in the social networking site fell 3.8 per cent to $20.00, while the games manufacturer slid 4.8 per cent to $2.81.Bank stocks were mixed. Bank of America closed 1.6 per cent lower at $7.22, Wells Fargo added 0.3 per cent to $33.90 and JPMorgan Chase was unchanged at $36.00.
422;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
423;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;NBC shows perfect logic but a prime time farce;Doing something ridiculous takes its toll on the broadcaster’s credibility;This weekend, NBC kicked off its expensive coverage of the London Olympics by cutting out the part of the opening ceremony that commemorated the victims of the July 7, 2005 bombings, in favour of a soft soap interview with Michael Phelps, the record-breaking swimmer. Then, when Phelps swam (and lost) the next day, it waited eight hours to televise him in action.What, if anything, goes through the minds of people who make such decisions? We know because the broadcasting network that has infuriated me and others, by refusing to broadcast popular events live, has been honest. It thinks that Americans are interested in live US athletes, not the foreign deceased, and it needs to recoup the $1.2bn it laid out on the London rights.As a result, NBC’s coverage of the Olympics has been less like a sports broadcast than a surrealist farce in which the characters affect to know less than the audience. The US men’s relay team “must have a great chance tonight”, opined an NBC swimming expert one night during the primetime broadcast. “No, it finished hours ago and they came second,” I replied from my sofa.Like all farces, this one has impeccable internal logic. NBC, an advertising-funded network owned by Comcast, a cable operator, makes far more money when its viewers watch big events in primetime. The London timezone – on the Greenwich meridian – means that it risks advertising dollars by showing events live.Yet it remains a farce. Doing something so ridiculous, no matter how ingeniously it may be justified on financial grounds, takes its toll on NBC’s credibility. The Olympic movement’s charter calls for “the widest possible audience in the world for the Olympic Games”. NBC is seeking the most valuable possible audience in the US, which is not the same thing.As a long-time Olympic broadcaster, it is used to being slammed for its primetime rationing. Bob Costas, NBC’s anchor, erupted in pre-emptive irritation on the topic at an event in June. “It’s a lot easier if you’re writing for newspaper X to say, with righteous indignation, this is some sort of outrage …It’s a simple, straightforward business decision that has now been modified, I think, in an enlightened way.”The modification is to allow anyone with a cable subscription to watch any event live streamed via the internet to a computer or mobile device. This sort of works: I had repeated problems signing on with my subscription and the site is highly confusing and parochial, but it provides basic feeds. NBC can boast that it is showing 3,500 hours of Olympic sport, although it has only 272 of coverage on NBC itself.It still feels quaintly antique, as if we live in a world where Americans gather each night to be informed by Walter Cronkite on CBS of daily events. Brian Williams, NBC’s nightly news anchor, has had to tell his own viewers to look away from the screen if they do not want to know the outcome of races that are still to be shown. It reminds me of watching BBC Grandstand’s football coverage in the 1970s.The BBC, along with most other broadcasters, has entered the 21st century and is showing events live, including 24 streams of coverage on the iPlayer. It does, of course, have the timezone advantage, along with a terrific business model – television owners have to pay the licence fee by law. Since it carries no advertising, it has no incentive to impose a delay.So far, those of NBC’s critics who have taken to Twitter to complain, under the #NBCfail hashtag, are a vocal minority – Guy Adams, of The Independent newspaper, was so vocal that he was temporarily suspended by Twitter for disclosing an NBC executive’s email. “[NBC’s coverage] was annoying the hell out of me and I thought who on earth would do this, but then I looked at the figures,” says a US media executive.By the numbers, NBC is doing just fine. It gained an average of 38.5m viewers in primetime at the weekend, which is hardly Super Bowl territory – 111m people watched that last year – but is a record. Amassing a very large audience for an international and unpredictable sports event is not easy – “it is a very difficult property in lots of ways”, says one media buyer.NBC’s model tilts heavily towards primetime. According to SQAD, a company that analyses advertising rates, NBC is being paid about $700,000 per 30-second advertisement in primetime, compared with $100,000 in daytime, when most of the events are actually taking place. At these rates, it is hardly surprising that all its efforts are going towards keeping viewers in suspense.But it is frustrating for those who want to watch live and it is not obvious why NBC couldn’t show races twice on television, like a normal network.“My guess is that those people who watched it online came and watched it again,” Mark Lazarus, chairman of NBC Sports told Sports Business Daily of Phelps’ losing race. Well, yes, that sounds like a reasonable guess.Not only does this charade make NBC looks silly but it also conflicts with the spirit of “Olympism”, about which the International Olympic Committee makes a song and dance. Indeed, some of the blame has to be shared with the IOC, which could easily enforce its principles by writing into the auctions for broadcasting rights a requirement that key contests are shown live.It avoids that because the value of US broadcasting rights, to which it has become addicted, could fall and broadcast accounts for half the marketing revenues that largely support the movement. But if the Olympics have come to rest on a long running media farce, something is awry.john.gapper@ft.com
424;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;NBC cheered by Olympic viewing figures;;Comcast’s NBCUniversal is predicting that it should break even on its coverage of the London Olympics, thanks to better than expected viewership and ad sales.The US broadcaster, which paid $1.18bn for the US media rights to the Games, previously predicted a $200m loss. Audience ratings five days into the London Olympics are 30 per cent higher than forecast. Advertising sales for the Games topped $1.2bn.“We are five days into a 17-day event, so by no means concluded at this point, but we are off to a very, very successful start,” Steve Burke, executive vice-president of Comcast and chief executive of NBCUniversal, said during a conference call.The London Olympics mark the first Games for the US broadcaster since it was acquired by Comcast in January 2011. Before the acquisition, NBCUniversal consistently lost money every two years on the Summer and Winter Olympics, Mr Burke said.Comcast has agreed to pay $4.38bn for the US media rights to the next four Olympics and said that the strength of the London Games should pave the way for the company to reap long-term benefits in Comcast’s cable and television businesses.“Given the trends, we stand a chance to make money on future Olympics,” Mr Burke said. “We feel great about what London is showing us the Olympics are capable of doing and long-term, we are delighted to have the asset.”Mr Burke’s remarks came as Comcast reported a second-quarter profit despite lacklustre results at NBCUniversal, thanks to strength in the company’s cable business.Net income attributable to Comcast was $1.34bn in the second quarter, up 32 per cent from the same period last year. Earnings per share jumped 35 per cent in the quarter to 50 cents, beating a consensus estimate of 48 cents.The largest US cable network by market capitalisation continued to stem the loss of video subscribers and sold more high-speed internet connections and services to business customers. Weakness in NBCUniversal’s broadcast television and film units dragged down total revenues 0.8 per cent in the television and film group.The quarter does not include results from the London Games.To bolster this year’s broadcast, Comcast and NBC are making a concerted effort to tie the businesses together to promote the Games and showcase other parts of the company, such as its new digital video technologies and sports cable television network. NBC is presenting 5,535 hours of coverage across its television and digital channels, for instance, including using new technologies to live stream every athletic competition for people who have cable subscriptions.Comcast shares were up about 3.8 per cent in midday trading to $33.78.
425;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-07-29T18:26:13Z;World’s top executives query strategy;;After months of relentless pressure from British business leaders for more effective growth-promoting measures, David Cameron may have been hoping for some respite as Britain stages what the prime minister calls “the greatest show on earth”.Instead, many of the world’s top executives who are in London to enjoy the Olympics and network with heads of state and politicians – a kind of Davos with javelins – are asking the same questions as their British counterparts.What, they ask privately, is the British government doing to boost confidence in the flagging economy? How is it preparing for the impact of break-up of the euro? And why, as one US financier put it, is the UK “killing its bankers” instead of supporting the City?The Olympics has brought leaders of the world’s largest companies to London, including the heads of Cisco, Google, Toyota, Citigroup, Tata, Nestle, Mitsubishi, Comcast, Johnson & Johnson, Hutchison Whampoa, Bharti, Reliance and Huawei.Dozens of ministers, along with Boris Johnson, mayor of London, have been mobilised to entertain up to 4,000 business leaders and policy makers attending Olympic events.However, the foreign chiefs have little interest in the coalition’s political problems, its U-turns or the pressures on George Osborne, the chancellor. Many have a limited grasp of measures the government is taking, such as the “funding for lending” scheme to boost bank credit and steps to increase private sector investment in infrastructure.But they see the big picture and are anxious - particularly if they have big investments in the UK. “Demand is going down and tax revenues are falling. You have got to change course,” said one US inward investor.Many want Britain to play a bigger role in finding a solution to the eurozone’s problems, which have huge implications for companies across the world, and some note that Europe - and the UK - face the same problems as many corporates.“I think the challenge is countries have to find a way to cut costs and grow at the same time and that’s the trick,” said Jeff Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, who is in London for the games, which GE sponsors. “To a certain extent, companies have to do the same thing, and that’s what Europe is going to have to confront in the next few years.”This is frustrating for the government, which believes Britain is suffering from the eurozone’s problems rather than ones generated at home.“Britain is back open for business,” the prime minister told 200 global business leaders at Thursday’s global investment conference. He insisted the government was delivering what business wants, including competitive tax rates, credits for research and development and incentives for entrepreneurs.Downing Street was pleased with the outcome of the conference, believing it helped to promote Britain to sovereign wealth funds looking for long-term infrastructure investments.Ministers were encouraged that companies such as Cisco and Toyota saw Britain as a hub for their global businesses, attracted by factors such as low company tax rates, a favourable tax regime for capital investment and a “patent box” to encourage innovation.However, recurring criticism of Britain’s choked airports and immigration controls have resonated in Downing Street along with concerns from international investors about an anti-banking sentiment developing in the UK.The coalition’s task in presenting Britain as “open for business” has been undermined in the eyes of foreign companies by relentlessly bad national accounts data. Since the coalition came to power, output has shrunk 0.3 per cent, with output in private services and manufacturing declining faster than predominantly public sector parts of the economy.However, there are also worries that some policy makers care more about reputation management, their public profile and promotion to more important positions than the good of the economy.Particular concern has been expressed over the role of Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, in the resignation of Bob Diamond, former chief executive of Barclays, leading foreign companies to question whether such arbitrary use of power adds significant political risks to any investment in Britain.The fierce battle to succeed Sir Mervyn next year has also seen some of the potential candidates for the job adopt radical positions that are making some business leaders nervous. After Paul Tucker, BoE deputy governor, was severely embarrassed by his 2008 email to Mr Diamond describing him as “an absolute brick”, most candidates have pointed out how tough they would be on banks.Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, and a candidate to become governor, pointed out the importance of the City for the economy, but his two speeches recently will be remembered more for the radicalism of his economic views and his call for banks to rebuild trust with their customers.Additional reporting by Pilita Clark● Ministers could be heading for a row about one policy the Treasury thinks will stimulate growth: further reforms of the planning system. The coalition compromised on reforms last year after fierce resistance from conservation groups such as the National Trust. Reports over the weekend suggested George Osborne, the chancellor, wanted another round of planning liberalisation to encourage construction companies to develop land, but one Whitehall official said Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, would oppose such a move.
426;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-07-25T20:11:26Z;NBC books record $1bn in Olympic ads;;Comcast’s NBCUniversal has booked a record $1bn in national television and digital advertising sales for the London Olympics, paving the way for the broadcaster to recoup the $1.18bn it paid for US media rights to the games.NBC is planning its most extensive broadcast of the games to date. Kicking off with the opening ceremony on Friday night, NBC will present more than 5,535 hours of coverage across its television networks and digital properties. NBC will live stream every athletic competition – or 3,500 hours – to the web. For the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, NBC live streamed 2,200 hours online.The US broadcaster said its digital offerings have bolstered ad sales, but that it still had capacity for further adsDigital sales this year are more than $60m, about three times more than in 2008. NBC’s total ad sales for the London Games have been $150m higher than during the Beijing Olympics.“The proliferation of our digital, mobile and tablet Olympic content, including the decision to live stream all sporting events, played a vital role in reaching this extraordinary milestone,” said Mark Lazarus, chairman of NBC Sports Group.The news comes amid a protest from the online group unPAC over the airing of political ads during the Games. More than 15,000 people have signed an online petition lobbying NBC not to broadcast ads from super-Pacs and other special interest groups. Restore Our Future, a group supporting Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, has bought $7.2m in local ads to run during the London Olympics.NBC said the $1bn national ad sales figure did not include super-Pac ad spending.“We are applying our normal advertising standards to all Olympics ad buys and evaluating these requests on a case-by-case basis, as we do every day with all our networks,” it added in a statement.
427;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-07-25T18:48:24Z;MGM plans to make IPO comeback;;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood studio behind classic films such as The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind, plans to return to the public markets, less than two years after emerging from bankruptcy.The studio said in a regulatory filing that it had “submitted a draft registration statement on a confidential basis” to the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding an initial public offering.No other details were given and the studio declined further comment. However, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are known to be advising the company on its IPO plans.A successful IPO could cap the return of MGM after several years in the wilderness. The studio has one of the largest film libraries in Hollywood and owns the rights to popular franchises such as James Bond and the Hobbit.But the company fell on hard times after a highly leveraged buyout, the financial crisis and the industry-wide collapse of DVD sales left it short of funds.MGM’s troubles began with the $5bn purchase of the studio in 2004 by a consortium made up of Sony, TPG, Providence Equity Partners and Comcast.The deal loaded the studio with debt just as the DVD market went into sharp decline. When the credit crunch took hold in 2007, the group found itself unable to pay its debt obligations or raise money to finance new films, which would have helped it sell its older library titles.A protracted sales process ended with the company filing for bankruptcy and the appointment of new management. Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, two former executives with Spyglass Entertainment, were appointed co-chairmen and co-chief executives of MGM.The company is currently owned by a mix of hedge funds, banks and other debtholders, who converted their loans into equity when the studio filed for bankruptcy protection.Since emerging from bankruptcy at the end of 2010, MGM has made significant progress. JPMorgan arranged $500m of loan finance to enable the company to resume film production and MGM struck a deal with Warner Brothers to produce a film version of The Hobbit, which will be released at the end of 2012. It has also produced a remake of the 1980s action film RoboCop, which comes out next year.But its biggest movie is the new James Bond film – Skyfall – which will be released at the end of 2012. The future of the long-running series was in doubt when MGM’s financial problems began. But the return of the English spy in a film MGM is making with Sony Pictures will be a boost to the studio and its IPO hopes.

Suddenlink had already repaid about 85 per cent of the investors’ money through refinancings.Mr Kent said Suddenlink would continue to look for acquisitions as the fragmented US cable industry consolidates further to find savings, economies of scale and benefits from sharing investment in technology across a larger business, but added that it had no immediate targets.Raymond Svider, co-chairman and managing partner of BC Partners, said it had been attracted by the cable industry’s defensive characteristics and Suddenlink’s “world-class infrastructure”.Suddenlink is approaching the end of a $350m three-year network upgrade programme and expects falling capital expenditures to boost its free cash flow in the coming years.The largest publicly traded US cable operators such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable have been holding back from acquisitions, raising expectations that consolidation in the industry will be led by companies backed by private equity firms and other financial groups.LionTree Advisors, a division of EM Securities, and Goldman Sachs advised Suddenlink. Credit Suisse advised BC Partners and CPPIB.
429;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-07-13T18:27:30Z;Disney still has star potential;Film scheme projections leave Dina Iordanova in the dark;Tax avoidance schemes of the rich and famous – recently exposed in this newspaper and others – have led to me to take a closer look at film investment. Not to avoid any tax, I should stress, but to understand how anyone makes money out of movies.Back in April, for example, the FT reported on Eclipse, a scheme that allowed members to claim tax relief on loans they took out to acquire distribution rights to two Disney films: Enchanted and Underdog. These rights were then leased back to the film producer for a payment spread over a 20-year period.I wonder about the scheme because film has a limited shelf life: depreciation happens fast and, with few exceptions, leaves little residual value.Take Underdog, released on March 8 2007. According to online database Box Office Mojo, its lifetime gross so far is about $65m. While not a bomb, critics have described the film’s performance as “a far cry from a box-office hit”.Enchanted launched on November 21 2007. It currently boasts a box office take of about $340m.So, together, the two films have earned about $405m. After offsetting production costs of $118m, that means they have made £287m so far.In film industry terms, however, they are already “second run” and mainly rely on auxiliary revenues. As Disney material, they could probably squeeze another $100m from the marketplace. But to get to the $754m (£503m) that Eclipse paid in 2007 for their exploitation over 20 years, they still need to earn another $467m – an average of about £19m for each of the remaining 15 years of the deal.I wish I knew more about the revenue and depreciation assumptions used for the Eclipse Film Partners deal. My common sense – and understanding of the film industry – suggest they used projections that are out of line with industry averages. No wonder the deal has attracted scrutiny.But all the coverage of the story prompted me to look at shares in Disney itself.Counting cash is a key exercise in assessing companies’ balance sheets, and Disney clearly understands how to generate it. Pocketing $754m in upfront cash for the perishable merchandise package of Underdog and Enchanted is a great achievement. As a result, I am considering buying into Disney on a dip, either by purchasing stock on the open market or via The Walt Disney Company Investment Plan – a share purchase and dividend reinvestment scheme for private investors.Everything seems to be in favour of such a move. Disney’s share price chart looks better than most companies’: the uptrend since October 2011 has been unaffected by recent jitters. With the share price up by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 months, and recently hitting new highs, there is a momentum investing case for buying. With the annual dividend up by 50 per cent, there is a value case, too.Besides, Disney is as diversified as an income investment trust. It spans the world, with operations in Brazil, India, China and Europe. It spans the sectors too, from publishing and digital media, to TV networks (ABC), consumer products, retail, and entertainment. It has done deals with digital companies such as Netflix, Comcast, and Hulu. It benefits from the popularity of computer animation, through Pixar. It owns the Marvel franchises . . . and so much more. I am enchanted by it!Dina Iordanova is an active private investor, writing about her own investments. She may have a financial interest in any of the companies, securities and trading strategies mentioned.
430;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-07-11T22:43:54Z;Facebook goes for gold in Olympic coverage;;Facebook is teaming up with broadcasters across the globe on coverage of the 2012 London Olympics, underscoring the powerful role that the internet and social media is playing in this year’s Games.The social networking site on Wednesday announced a partnership with Comcast’s NBCUniversal. The US broadcaster will post Olympics-related news, interactive polls, photos and other exclusive content to Facebook. The partnership does not include payments.Facebook is also collaborating on Olympics programming with other international broadcasters, including the BBC. The British broadcaster plans to live stream coverage of the Games on Facebook.The London Olympics is expected to be the most social and digital Games to date. While social media existed during past Olympics, audiences have flocked to Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites in large numbers in recent years to consume media and chat about current events. Facebook now has more than 900m users, compared to 100m during the last Summer Olympics in 2008.Broadcasters, the International Olympic Committee and marketers are incorporating several social elements into their Olympics plans in attempts to spur interest in the Games among younger viewers and capitalise on the chatter surrounding the event.The IOC is working with several social media outlets, including Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, the location-based social application, and Weibo, the Chinese social network. The official mascots for the games, Wenlock and Mandeville, have their own accounts on Facebook and Twitter.To squeeze the most out of their expensive Olympics sponsorships, marketers are preparing social extensions for their ad campaigns. Visa, for instance, is tapping Facebook and Twitter for its global marketing campaign to encourage fans to cheer for the athletes it sponsors.Broadcasters see social media as a viable channel to drive a bigger audience to tune into their traditional television coverage. The Facebook-NBC partnership will influence on-air coverage, for instance, with Facebook employees working with NBC producers to create programmes about the results, athletes and other stories.“This is a new generation of the Olympic fan, and we really want to reach them,” John Miller, head of NBC Sports Agency, said at a press event this month.But there are limits. NBC, which paid $1.18bn for the US media rights to the London Olympics, is live streaming every Olympic event on the web, or more than 3,500 programming hours, but will not broadcast live video of the Games to Facebook.
431;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-07-04T16:57:22Z;‘The Young Turks’ muscles in on news;;Before Cenk Uygur switches on the television or checks news sites for the day’s headlines, the host and co-founder of the progressive online news show The Young Turks, scans Twitter and Facebook.He is looking for the stories about politics and pop culture that are generating buzz but that mainstream media outlets are likely to ignore.Hours later, Mr Uygur slams his fist against a desk and shouts about those topics during his daily programme, which is fast becoming one of the most popular news shows on the web.“Cenk is killing it today … exposing lying scumbags,” a viewer posted to Twitter on Monday during the two-hour live programme, which spanned issues ranging from Arctic drilling to Scientology and the crisis in Syria. That show drew more than 10,000 views and thousands more comments on YouTube.The Young Turks offers a window into what could be the future of news programmes. As traditional cable news networks struggle to retain viewers, The Young Turks is attracting an audience of young viewers who, when news breaks, think first to turn to social media and the internet rather than their televisions.“[When we started the show] the thought was that online video was eventually going to challenge TV and eventually merge with TV. That is exactly what has happened,” says Mr Uygur.Outlets such as The Young Turks are posing a threat to traditional cable news networks, especially as younger consumers are more likely to seek out free news online, reluctant to subscribe to cable television services and less loyal than traditional viewers to particular programmes.Aggregate television viewership for the three major cable news channels in the US – Time Warner’s CNN, News Corp’s Fox News and Comcast’s MSNBC – was almost flat in 2011 following double-digit declines in 2010, according to the Pew Research Center’s State of the News Media report. The three networks have all registered average season-to-date declines in primetime ratings this year among 18- to 34-year-old viewers, according to research firm Nielsen.While the list of news websites that receive the most traffic has tended to include the same mix of players during the past few years, The Young Turks, in partnership with the cable news network Current TV, has elbowed its way into the top ten online news and information video sites. It attracted 2.9m unique US video viewers in May, according to ComScore.The Young Turks has been years in the making. More than a decade ago, Mr Uygur quit his job as an attorney to start a cable access show. The Young Turks made its debut with a satellite radio show and now airs daily online and on Al Gore’s cable network Current TV.Giving The Young Turks a boost is its partnership with YouTube. It was one of about 100 channels to receive funding from YouTube last year and now ranks among the top performing channels on the site.The show has a bare-bones style that lacks the slick production of traditional cable news outlets and costs a fraction of theirs to produce. The Young Turks works with partner companies to sell ads, and revenues are still low. It expects revenues to be about $2m to $3.5m this year, up 50 per cent from last year.The Young Turks, analysts say, is likely to benefit from the news events of the 2012 political cycle, with the presidential election coming up, and will face challenges maintaining momentum with its fickle audience, analysts said. To stay fresh, the network is in the midst of launching a series of new channels beyond hard news and politics to explore subjects such as sports and celebrity.“It is clearly having a resonance in the culture, but is it the flavour of the year? Or does it sustain itself and continue to grow?” says Ken Doctor, a media analyst with Outsell. “That is the internet culture. Things go way up and then they can fall.”
432;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-06-25T20:17:13Z;Shazam targets Olympic social media buzz;;Shazam, the popular UK-based music recognition app, is capitalising on the digital and social media buzz surrounding the 2012 London Olympics via a new partnership with Comcast’s NBCUniversal.Under the deal, viewers watching the event on five NBC television networks will be able to use the app on a smartphone or tablet and instantly unlock related information, such as stats about athletes. The app will identify the relevant event by “listening” to the TV broadcast. People also can take polls and share content on Twitter and Facebook.Many analysts argue that this year’s Olympics will probably be remembered as the first “social media Games”.While Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites existed during the last Games, the number of people using social media has exploded in recent years. Facebook now counts more than 900m monthly active users and athletes and celebrities, meanwhile, are active on Twitter and other sites.Programmers and marketers have taken note and are ramping up their social coverage for the Games. The International Olympic Committee has built an “Olympic Athletes’ Hub”, where visitors can discover and follow athletes on Twitter and Facebook. Olympic sponsors increasingly are considering an athlete’s social media presence before selecting them to appear in ad campaigns. Broadcasters, such as NBC, also are planning expansive coverage of the Games on Facebook, Twitter and photo sharing app Instagram.The partnership between Shazam and NBC comes as the broadcaster is trying to ramp up viewer attention and squeeze the most out of the $1.18bn it paid for the US media rights to the London Olympics. In the internet age, when people are not willing to wait for broadcasts, the broadcaster is planning its most-expansive digital and social media coverage of an Olympic Games to date.For the first time NBC will live stream every Olympic event on the web, amounting to more than 3,500 programming hours – or the equivalent of about 145 days.Social media and tools such as Shazam could provide an important link and drive more buzz for the Games, industry executives said. In the US, 86 per cent of smartphone owners and 88 per cent of tablet owners report using their device while watching television at least once during a 30-day period, according to measurement firm Nielsen.Founded in 2002, Shazam is best known for its music recognition capabilities but recently has branched out into television and advertising. In May, Shazam announced a deal with UK commercial broadcaster ITV to create Shazam-enabled ads during the final of Britain’s Got Talent.
433;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-06-22T14:09:33Z;Letter from Lex: broken models;Microsoft unveils its new tablet and others fix broken models;The phrase broken windows used to conjure up images of urban vandalism and zero tolerance. Now it is more likely to bring Microsoft to mind. In an effort to revive its most important product, Windows software, the US tech giant unveiled its Surface tablet computer, but there are still big questions about pricing and functionality.Microsoft was not the only company looking for a new model. Both Verizon and Comcast have introduced new rational pricing plans to prevent customer arbitrage, but that strategy might result in cut-throat discounting wars. In Asia, Hon Hai and Sharp’s LCD alliance may lead to a way to regenerate Japanese tech has-beens and allow lost-cost producers to move to higher-margin businesses. In telecoms, Dutch group KPN continued to defend its less-than-stellar past model – while trying unsuccessfully to wring value from its German operations – as it opposes advances from Carlos Slim’s América Móvil.Elsewhere it was about British engineers and flying machines. UK engineering turnround specialist Melrose revealed it was in talks to buy German meter-maker Elster while Invensys saw its share price rise and fall after disclosing a takeover approach by Emerson Electric. Meanwhile Ryanair made its third bid in six years for rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus and the founder of Brazilian airline Gol unexpectedly announced he would step down next month.Finally in consumer goods, US drugstore Walgreens agreed to pay $6.7bn for a 45 per cent stake in UK pharmacy-based retailer Alliance Boots while both Procter & Gamble and Danone warned of lower earnings ahead. But perhaps the most intriguing deal of the week involved several independent-minded billionaires with one selling media assets – Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp offering A$2bn for James Packer’s Consolidated Media – in order to place bets on a gambling company. Oh and then there was Greece and Spain, but you may have already read about their broken models somewhere before.John Casey, Lex Publisher
434;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-06-18T19:00:12Z;Mobile data prices;Transparent price plans might start cut-throat discounting;"Fiddling with pricing is a game telecoms and cable companies can never stop playing. They plough fixed investment into infrastructure and programming, then charge for services with vanishingly small incremental costs of delivery. Consumers, for their part, are always looking to pay the incremental cost (roughly nothing) for the services, rather than the total cost. And finally competitors want to price below total cost to take share.Last week Verizon made a significant move, introducing wireless plans that in essence eliminate the longstanding practice of charging separately for voice minutes and data. Customers will pay a fixed fee per device, and for however many gigabytes they use. So it will not be possible for consumers to arbitrage cheap data against expensive minutes by, say, using an unlimited data plan and a Skype account to talk on the cheap. Other telcos are expected to follow Verizon’s lead.In cable (TV and data), meanwhile, Comcast’s announcement last month that it would charge overage fees to customers who use masses of data, rather than simply throttling back their data connections, has been widely seen as a step towards tiered pricing based on volumes. This would be a legitimate way for the distributors to defuse another consumer arbitrage: using a video-streaming service, such as Netflix, rather than their TV packages.Verizon and Comcast both earn single-digit returns on invested capital. Companies that depend on their networks, from Netflix to Apple, make returns many times higher. Surely rational pricing, based on volume, can help close this gap? Perhaps; but rational price plans are transparent. Consumers paying as they go may see little difference between providers. The problem of consumer price arbitrage may end up being replaced by the problem of cut-throat pricing.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
435;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-05-25T21:25:19Z;Dish;The TV distribution industry has a dilemma: its customers dislike ads but its suppliers depend on them;All Americans are in Dish’s debt. The satellite TV distributor has solved the great challenge of modern life: that of dragging your fat, greasy hand out of the bag of crisps, picking up the remote for the digital video recorder, and fast forwarding through the ads. Free at last!Dish’s “Hopper” set-top box automatically records the entire primetime line-up each night and saves it for viewing later, advertisements removed. Three of the companies that produce that programming (News Corp, Comcast, and CBS) have greeted this breakthrough with a lawsuit, alleging that it amounts to an unauthorised video-on-demand service pushing stolen programming. This could undermine the “quality of primetime programming” by undercutting the advertising revenues that support it.Advertising is crucially important to TV. PwC estimates that in 2011 46 per cent of TV revenues came from advertising, as opposed to fees and subscriptions. At Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, the proportion is more than half, due to its strong presence in broadcast TV. Plenty of consumers use DVRs already, but only about an eighth of primetime programming is watched on delay, though that is growing, according to Nielsen data. So making delayed (and adless) viewing easier is a direct threat to the content producers’ business models.The lawsuit, in the long run, matters less than how the TV distribution industry decides to manage a fundamental tension. Its customers do not like ads. Its suppliers depend on them. Of course, the simplest way to resolve the tension would be delivering adless TV, charging more for it, and passing the added revenues back to the programmers. But what if consumers, confronted with the real cost of television, decide it is not worth the money?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
436;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Scrutiny of Verizon spectrum buy urged;;Herb Kohl, influential chairman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, has urged regulators to “carefully scrutinise” plans by Verizon Wireless to acquire valuable wireless spectrum from a consortium of US cable television companies.He warned that the deal, which includes a controversial cross-marketing agreement, “raises serious competition concerns”.“Without reaching any final judgment as to the legality of these transactions under antitrust laws or the Communications Act, I believe these transactions present serious competition concerns, which should be examined closely by your agencies,” said Mr Kohl, a Democrat, in a letter sent to Eric Holder, the US attorney-general, and Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communication Commission.The FCC is currently considering whether to approve the acquisition of the spectrum by Verizon from a group of leading cable TV companies including Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks and, separately, Cox Communications.The justice department is examining marketing agreements between Verizon and the cable TV companies which form a separate part of the transactions.Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between Verizon Communications and Britain’s Vodafone, is the largest US mobile network operator by subscribers. Opponents of the proposed deal, which include consumer groups and competitors, have expressed concerns about the impact on competition of both the spectrum acquisition and the joint marketing arrangements.The antitrust subcommittee held hearings on the proposed transactions in March and Mr Kohl noted in his letter that after the hearings, Verizon announced that it would put some of its unused 700Mhz spectrum up for sale should its $3.9bn deal with the cable companies be approved.While Mr Kohl, whose opposition to AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit last year ultimately helped sink that deal, does not call explicitly on regulators to block the Verizon transactions, his comments will increase pressure on US regulators to take a particularly close look at the deal and perhaps impose stringent conditions should it be approved.In considering the deal, Mr Kohl urged both the FCC and justice department to consider whether selling a valuable chunk of spectrum to the country’s biggest wireless provider would harm competition. “Spectrum acquisitions can be a strategic tool employed by dominant wireless carriers to entrench their market position and suppress competition,” he said while urging regulators to consider whether such transactions are in the “public interest”.“Your agencies made the correct decision to preserve competition by your courageous decision last year to block the AT&T/T-Mobile USA merger,” he said. “We must be especially vigilant this year to ensure that this transaction does not jeopardise a competitive wireless market for consumers that your agencies recently worked so hard to preserve.”If the FCC does approve the spectrum purchase, Mr Kohl said the agency should require “appropriate divestitures where needed to prevent Verizon Wireless from gaining excessive levels of spectrum concentration, thereby ensuring consumers have the benefits of a fully competitive wireless marketplace”.Despite Mr Kohl’s concerns about the deal, Verizon said it remained confident the transactions would be approved. “The issues raised by Mr Kohl are being thoroughly examined in the reviews by the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission,” Thomas Tauke, Verizon executive vice-president, said in a statement. “While Mr Kohl’s letter recounts the arguments reviewed at the Senate hearing, it is another indication that this transaction is on the road toward approval this summer.”
437;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-05-21T21:04:29Z;US cable operators to link wireless networks;;Five of the largest US cable TV operators agreed to link their WiFi networks together, creating a nationwide system of more than 50,000 WiFi hotspots that their customers could use as an alternative to the mobile data networks run by traditional telecom operators.The agreement between Bright House Networks, Cablevision, Comcast, Cox Communications and Time Warner Cable was announced as the US cable industry’s annual NCTA show opened in Boston and will enable their customers using smartphones, PC tablets and other mobile devices to access each other’s high-speed metro WiFi networks using a single login.To simplify access, the cable partners have created a new network name, “CableWiFi”, for subscribers to use when accessing the WiFi hotspots outside their home market. Initially WiFi users will sign on to using the same credentials as when accessing their providers’ WiFi networks, but users will soon be able to have their devices auto-connect to the internet when they are within range of a participating hotspot.While a few cable operators already have limited WiFi roaming agreements, this is by far the most extensive tie-up and positions the participating cable companies to step up their battle with traditional telecommunications companies and position WiFi as a more viable alternative to 3G and 4G mobile networks.“We believe that WiFi is a superior approach to mobile data, and that cable providers are best positioned to build the highest-capacity national network offering customers fast and reliable Internet connections when away from their home or business broadband service,” said Kristin Dolan, Cablevision’s senior executive vice-president of product management and marketing.“We’ve built an extensive WiFi network in our own service area and see real value and potential in other leading providers joining with us to extend that connectivity to major markets across the country,” Ms Dolan added.“We have long been the leading providers of high-speed internet services in our customers’ homes. Through our rollout of WiFi and the benefits of this collaboration we greatly increase the value and reach of our high-speed internet service, providing access to broadband outside the home and in cities across the country,” said Rob Marcus, Time Warner Cable’s chief operating officer.“While the announcement is not a surprise – many investors thought they already had – the strategic implications are profound,” said Craig Moffett of Sanford Bernstein. “The unique usage characteristics of wireless networks leave the door open for a potentially very disruptive WiFi-first service.”The first implementation is already complete as Bright House Networks and Cablevision launched “CableWiFi” alongside their branded WiFi networks in the New York City area and central Florida earlier this month. Over the next few months, the “CableWiFi” network name will be added by each of the cable companies to their branded WiFi hotspots.The agreement among the cable companies comes as the big four US nationwide mobile operators – Verizon Wireless, AT&T Mobility, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA – struggle to meet the rapidly growing mobile data demands of smartphone and PC Tablet users.As part of their strategy for dealing with this “data tsunami”, most mobile operators have begun looking for ways to “offload” mobile data on to alternative networks including their own and others’ WiFi networks.
438;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Hulu goes for original series to win adherents;;Hulu, the internet video operator owned by Walt Disney, News Corp and Comcast, is launching 10 original series aimed at younger viewers who are deserting television for online platforms.The company, which was set up five years ago as a counterweight to Google’s YouTube, has built a subscriber base of about 2m with a library of programmes that have already aired on US television.But like Netflix, a larger service with close to 25m subscribers, Hulu sees its future in original programming. “We want to offer exclusive shows and make original TV programming that speaks to a passionate group of fans,” said Andy Forssell, senior vice-president of content for Hulu.The launch of the new series from directors including Richard Linklater and Kevin Smith comes amid shareholder friction about the future of the company. Providence Equity Partners, one of Hulu’s investors, is in discussions to sell its 10 per cent stake: it wants Hulu to grow more quickly and build a presence online with exclusive rights to hit shows.Providence bought its stake for $100m, valuing the company at $1bn, and wants a sale price of about $200m. It has found itself at odds with the media companies that are the other shareholders in Hulu. Walt Disney, through its ABC network, News Corp, through its Fox subsidiary, and Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, supply Hulu with much of its programming, providing hits like Modern Family, Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock.Disney and News Corp do not want Hulu to cannibalise revenues from their broadcast TV operations or erode the growth of their online video sites. They have resisted giving Hulu exclusive rights to content, which has caused the company’s management considerable frustration.Some of these disagreements came to light last year when Jason Kilar, Hulu’s chief executive, posted a blog that excoriated the traditional network TV business model, saying “traditional TV has too many ads” while boasting that Hulu’s advertising was “two times as effective as traditional TV video advertising”.One shareholder at the time told the FT Mr Kilar was “obviously disconnected from how the majority of America watches television”.Since then Hulu’s growth has also been curtailed by a push to “authenticate” its viewers by proving they subscribe to a pay-TV service. Subscribers to Dish Network and Verizon’s cable TV services can watch shows on Hulu the day after they have aired but other users have to wait more than a week.Providence’s desire to sell its stake in Hulu was influenced by the authentication push, according to people familiar with the situation. Other cable companies are also discussing viewer authentication with Hulu, which could further depress the number of people turning to the site instead of to their TVs.
439;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-05-17T16:09:19Z;US cable;‘Dumb pipes’ they may be – but this industry remains very big and very profitable;The US cable industry is very big and very profitable. The four large publicly traded cable companies – Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, and Charter Communications – have an aggregate enterprise value of nearly $200bn. They face limited competition, have high and stable margins and spew out cash. Yet they are accused of being “dumb pipes” – mere distributors with little power over suppliers or customers.The description fits if you consider only video distribution, which represents about half of the cable operators’ revenues. The reasons can be debated (Competition from telecoms and satellite companies? Cord-cutting? Low household formation?) but video subscriber growth is in unmistakable decline. And pricing power seems to be slipping: growth in revenue per video customer at the big four has slowed recently. And even as video revenue has flatlined, the cable companies’ programming costs have been growing a few points faster than inflation. A nasty squeeze.But these are not video companies, of course. They are video/data/voice companies. Their chief advantage is that one set of competitors (telcos) only offers video in select markets, and another (satellite companies) cannot offer data or voice. And combined revenue from all services is still growing in the mid-single digits at the big four, though the pace of growth did slacken a bit in the first quarter. The important driver is data, which now accounts for about a fourth of the companies’ revenues. As long as data subscribers keep growing at 6 per cent or 7 per cent (as they have been during the past year) and a bit of extra revenue can be wrung out of business services and advertising, the cable model will keep working. Data subscriptions will eventually hit saturation, too – the big four have 36m data subscribers, up 4m in only 2 years, as compared to 42m video subs. That will leave price increases as the last, and hardest, route to revenue growth. But until that day comes, these pipes are plenty smart enough.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
440;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-05-07T17:48:47Z;US networks eye English-speaking Hispanics;;ABC, the Walt Disney-owned US broadcaster, has confirmed plans for a joint venture with Univision, the country’s largest Spanish-language television group, to launch a 24-hour news network aimed at English-speaking Hispanics.The unnamed network will compete with English-language cable news channels such as CNN, Fox News and MSNBC, as well as a Spanish-language TV market led by Univision and Comcast’s Telemundo that is due to expand with the launch of MundoFox by News Corp.The venture is the latest attempt to capitalise on the rapid growth in the Hispanic population, which the 2010 Census found had grown 40 per cent since 2000 to 50m. Hispanics now account for 16 per cent of all US citizens, and are expected to reach 30 per cent by 2050.Hispanics’ buying power will expand from $1tn in 2010 to $1.5tn in 2015, or 11 per cent of the nation’s buying power, according to the Selig Center at the University of Georgia Terry College of Business.The new channel will launch in 2013, missing the potential ratings boost of November’s presidential election, although it will launch digital content this summer. “The Hispanic electorate is going to be a swing vote in many swing states,” said Cesar Conde, president of Univision Networks.ABC News and Univision News said they would share resources, suggesting that both companies could find savings, and would focus on “the issues most relevant for US Hispanics” including jobs, healthcare, immigration and education. Mr Conde said he expected the channel to appeal to a broad audience.For ABC News, the venture offers the chance to refresh a declining broadcast news market by reaching a younger audience. The Pew Research Center found in 2010 that the average evening news viewer was 53. Univision estimates that its average primetime viewer is 36.Mr Conde noted that Univision had launched nine new Spanish-language cable networks in 18 months, but highlighting the growing number of Hispanics favouring English may present risks.Univision is expected to tell advertisers at an “upfront” presentation next week that they are wrong to think they can reach Hispanics through mainstream English-language shows.David Lawenda, president of advertising sales and marketing, told the FT before Monday’s announcement that Univision had 48 of the top 50 primetime programmes for bilingual Hispanics.“We’ve been an afterthought after [advertisers] have accomplished their general market goals, but we’re at the tipping point now. This is the new American reality,” he said.“We’re encouraging [media buyers] to take 10-15 per cent of their English language billings and shift it over to Univision,” he said. English networks’ appeals for double-digit price increases at a time of flat or falling ratings was “the definition of insanity,” he added.
441;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-05-02T21:45:21Z;Comcast sees rise in broadband customers;;First-quarter earnings from Comcast highlighted the largest US cable network’s changing business mix, with growth in high-speed internet connections and services to business customers more than offsetting a fall in video subscribers.Comcast reported earnings per share of 45 cents, up 32.4 per cent compared with the first quarter of last year, which included just two months’ contribution from NBCUniversal, the television and film group acquired in January 2011.Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive, highlighted a 439,000 net increase in high-speed internet subscribers as “significantly” outpacing competitors’ growth in broadband customers.The smaller business services unit, with revenue up 37 per cent in the quarter, had become “a significant engine for growth”, with further opportunities to sell to mid-market companies “still largely ahead of us”.Analysts were disappointed, however, by a 37,000 drop in video subscriber numbers. Mr Roberts said the fall reflected the impact of price increases, adding that a focus on improving technology and service should allow Comcast to make “steady progress” in attracting video subscribers.“If investors focus on the basic video number – as they so often have in the past – they’ll be missing the forest for the trees,” Bernstein Research analysts said, highlighting Comcast’s strength in broadband, gains in average revenue per user and market share gains in business services.Net income for the group jumped from $1.04bn to $1.45bn on revenues up 22.7 per cent to $14.9bn.Cable revenues rose 5.7 per cent while NBCUniversal, in which General Electric still has a minority stake, reported an 18 per cent gain in pro forma revenues, helped by $259m from airing this year’s Super Bowl, the most watched US television event of the year.Steve Burke, the executive vice-president in charge of NBCUniversal, acknowledged that its US broadcast network, home to The Voice, was “underperforming our peers”.If it could close the gap with ABC, CBS and Fox, there were “hundreds of millions of dollars worth of opportunity just getting to average in that business”, he said.Increased programming and marketing costs for NBC’s primetime schedule led to an operating cash flow loss in the broadcasting business, but Comcast highlighted growth at its Universal film studio and theme parks including a Harry Potter attraction in Orlando.Shares in Comcast closed down 0.6 per at $30.42 in New York.
442;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Providence in talks to sell Hulu stake;;Providence Equity is in talks to sell its 10 per cent stake in Hulu to other shareholders in the group in a deal that could value the online video operator at up to $2bn.The private equity group paid $100m for its stake in Hulu four years ago, joining Walt Disney, News Corp and NBCUniversal, now part of Comcast, as owners of the company.Providence last year led calls for a sale or initial public offering of Hulu but the IPO did not generate sufficient investor interest and a protracted auction failed to generate satisfactory bids.Talks between Providence and its partners in Hulu, which were first reported by Bloomberg, are ongoing but one person familiar with the negotiations said the price tag for the Providence stake would be “significantly less” than $200m.The company was initially created by its media group owners to operate as a counterweight to YouTube, giving audiences a legitimate outlet to watch professionally produced television content.Hulu has a vast library of content, with programmes such as Modern Family, House and Saturday Night Live winning fans from a generation of young people who have no interest in paying for a costly cable TV subscription.But growth of the site has been held back by tensions between Hulu’s management and its shareholders: the media groups that own Hulu supply it with most of its content but have been reluctant to agree to exclusive long-term programming deals.Jason Kilar, Hulu chief executive, also angered the company’s investors and their network television subsidiaries such as ABC and Fox with an infamous blog posting last year in which he said “traditional TV has too many ads”.Those tensions have not prevented Hulu from amassing about 2m subscribers, although this is far fewer than Netflix, its biggest rival. It has also launched its service internationally, with Japan the first market chosen for expansion.The move to sell the Providence stake comes a week after the firm invested $200m in The Chernin Group, the entertainment and digital media company Peter Chernin founded after leaving News Corp in 2009.Mr Chernin and Jonathan Nelson, chief executive of Providence, told the FT the venture would focus on media assets in the US, as well as emerging markets such as India.News Corp and Walt Disney declined to comment. Comcast and Providence could not be reached for comment.

Sykes has been named to the management committee,” Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and chief executive, said in a memo distributed to the bank’s employees.“Gene has played a vital role in strengthening our investment banking franchise, particularly with respect to many of the most significant companies in technology and media,” Mr Blankfein added.Mr Sykes has worked on deals including Comcast’s $38bn purchase of NBCUniversal last year, and advised Disney in its $7.4bn buyout of computer animation specialist Pixar.He also specialises in healthcare, working with Genentech during its acquisition by Roche.Mr Zaoui, who announced his departure from the New York-based bank last week, was also a member of Goldman’s managing committee. Mr Zaoui was the first European investment banker to sit on the management committee in Goldman’s history.A spokesman for Goldman confirmed the content of the memo.
444;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-04-18T21:06:39Z;Verizon to sell wireless airwaves;;Verizon Wireless, the largest US mobile network operator, offered to sell spectrum worth billions of dollars if regulators approve its proposed purchase of airwaves in another band from a group of cable companies.Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Britain’s Vodafone, insisted that the offer to sell the airwaves, which cover dozens of major cities across the US as well as several smaller and rural markets, was not linked to its difficulties winning Federal Communications Commission approval for the deal with the cable companies and an associated spectrum purchase from Leap Wireless.It characterised the proposed sale of some of the spectrum it acquired in a 2008 government auction for $4.4bn as a “rationalisation”. However, the company has faced opposition from rivals including Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS to its controversial $3.9bn deal with Spectrum Co– a joint venture of Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks – which also includes an agreement to resell each others’ services that its opponents claim would hamper competition.Verizon Wireless, which is in the midst of rolling out a new 4G high-speed data network based upon LTE technology, said that the sale of these licences in the 700 MHz “A” and “B” bands “is contingent on the close of Verizon Wireless’ pending purchases of AWS licenses from SpectrumCo which is jointly owned by Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Bright House Networks, Cox and Leap Wireless”.The company would hold on to the “C’’ band spectrum it bought in the same auction. Analysts noted that the retention of “C” block spectrum in the 700Mhz band and the purchase of the cable spectrum would enable Verizon to continue its LTE rollout, while the sale of the other airwaves might blunt criticism of the cable company deal which the FCC has been studying since the start of the year.“Both blocks will be used for LTE, giving the company a spectrum advantage over the rest of the industry,” said Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse in a note to investors. “It would have been some time before they would have needed the A&B block. By selling it, they diffuse opposition to the SpectrumCo transaction from other carriers as well as political pressure.”US mobile network operators including AT&T, Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit and Sprint Nextel face a spectrum shortage because of the surging use of data-hungry smartphones including Apple’s iPhone. As a result, Mr Chaplin added that the sale of the Verizon Wireless 700 MHz spectrum was likely to attract considerable interest.“We believe all carriers will have an interest in this spectrum, so it is unlikely to go cheap,” he said. “Those with the greatest need include MetroPCS, T-Mobile and Leap.”
445;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Telemundo chief flags up US ads disparity;;Spanish-language channels in the US are getting only half the advertising revenues they should, according to the new chief executive of Telemundo, the second largest broadcaster in a Hispanic television market that is becoming more crowded.“Hispanic television media get 8 per cent of the viewership on average on a single day and only 4 per cent of the total advertising [revenue],” Emilio Romano told the Financial Times, six months after Comcast’s NBCUniversal unit named him to run the network in Miami.“That means we’re getting only half of what we deserve,” he said. Telemundo has traditionally battled Univision, the Hispanic market leader, for advertising budgets, but faces new competition as News Corp plans to launch a free-to-air Spanish-language network this autumn with RCN Television of Colombia.Univision and Telemundo, which will make its “upfront” pitch to advertisers on May 15, have seized on data from the 2010 census showing that the US now has more than 50m Latinos, up 40 per cent since 2000.Their growing spending power is attracting more advertisers, but many brands remain unsure about how to reach an increasingly bilingual audience.Univision and ABC News have held talks to create a 24-hour cable news channel targeted at Latinos who favour the English language, and Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecoms magnate, has announced plans for Ora TV, an online network in English.“Competition will always make us better,” Mr Romano said: “Having Rupert Murdoch join our market makes us very proud.” He added, however, that Telemundo had “a huge advantage” having built up its production studios to produce 2,500 hours of network programming a year.In March, Telemundo said average primetime audiences had grown 10 per cent in the first quarter to a record 1.25m viewers.Mr Romano said 14m “Spanish-dominant” US Hispanics were Telemundo’s core market, but the other 36m alternated between Spanish-language and English-language channels.“We took the decision to cater to that 36m in Spanish as well. They might go to the general market to watch a reality show or a comedy such as The Voice or 30 Rock [on NBC] but if they want to watch something that culturally brings them back to the safety of their home environment they’ll watch a novela on Telemundo,” he said.“We’re convincing more and more advertisers that the best way to get their message across is in the language and context that has a stronger emotional connection to the US Hispanic culture,” he added.Telemundo has been at a disadvantage to Univision, which takes much of its content from Televisa of Mexico, the world’s largest Spanish-language content creator, but its studios in Miami, Mexico and Colombia have narrowed the gap. “Our novelas are produced with an eye on the US Hispanic market,” Mr Romano said.The investment in content has made Telemundo the second-largest syndicator of Spanish-language programming in the world, selling to more than 100 countries to build international revenues to almost 15 per cent of its total.
446;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-03-27T19:26:40Z;Microsoft: Xboxing clever;The user base is meaningful. The question is how to make profits long-term;"There may never be another business that spews money like Microsoft’s near monopoly on operating systems and office software for personal computers. So, faced with the PC’s slow decline, Microsoft has invested in many new ventures, from internet search to phones. But none is more important than Xbox.The gaming console has a worldwide installed base of 66m. There are also more than 40m “Xbox live” subscribers who play games with peers over the internet; many pay $50 a year for the premium version. All of this resulted in Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division generating $1.3bn in operating profits last year, or about 5 per cent of Microsoft’s total, with mid-teen margins. And all this despite the fact that Microsoft’s phone business – likely a lossmaker – is included in the same segment.Future growth is expected to come outside of gaming, though. The Xbox console is seen as a way for Microsoft to “own the living room”, becoming the home entertainment hub. Yesterday brought an announcement that Xbox’s premium subscribers in the US would be able to access Comcast’s Xfinity pay-per-view service, HBO Go and Major League Baseball content using Xbox as an interface, the latest in a series of such partnerships including British Sky Broadcasting, the BBC and Lovefilm in the UK.The Xbox user base is meaningful, and Microsoft’s investments in search and the Kinect voice and motion controller position it to offer a slick interface. The question is how to make the business profitable in the long term. Xbox takes others’ content, distributed over others’ networks, and makes it easier to find and use. Competitors in this role include TiVo, Roku, Sony and Apple. Many of these options are already low cost. It will be a nasty fight for the living room and it is not entirely clear what the spoils will be.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
447;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-03-21T21:46:12Z;Critics attack $3.6bn Verizon spectrum deal;;The pending $3.6bn acquisition by Verizon Wireless of spectrum from a consortium of cable companies would harm consumers and stifle innovation, cementing a duopoly in the US wireless market, critics of the deal have told legislators.The deal between Verizon Wireless and SpectrumCo, a joint venture of Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, was announced last year. In addition to the licence transfer for the spectrum, Verizon and the cable television providers agreed to new joint marketing arrangements.Verizon Wireless, the largest wireless operator in the US, says it will use the spectrum to enhance its service at a time of spiking data usage thanks to new devices including smart phones and tablets.But critics, speaking before the Senate judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the deal would be bad for consumers because it would make Verizon even more dominant in the wireless market, while reducing the likelihood of competition between telecommunications and cable providers.“These agreements simply represent a deal between these companies to stay out of each others’ way in perpetuity,” said Joel Kelsey, policy adviser for Free Press, an advocacy organisation. “And they send a clear signal to Wall Street that the largest wireless and cable companies are aligned together.”Steven Berry, chief executive of the Rural Cellular Association, called the deal “insidious”, saying it would have “a disastrous impact on competition”.US regulators have recently intensified their review of telecoms deals, leading to the collapse of AT&T’s proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA. The deal between Verizon and the cable companies was announced just weeks before the AT&T/T-Mobile deal fell apart.Executives from Verizon Wireless and Comcast faced questioning from Democratic senators on the committee. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin said he hoped to assess whether the deals “amount to a truce between one of the two largest phone companies and over 70 per cent of the cable industry”.The senators raised concerns that the deal would undermine the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was designed to enhance competition between telecoms and cable TV companies.But Randal Milch, Verizon general counsel, maintained that the spectrum transfer was necessary as demand for wireless services grow. “We’re currently in a critical situation,” he said. “Customer demand for mobile bandwidth is growing faster than spectrum [is being made available].”David Cohen, Comcast executive vice-president, said his company would not stop competing with Verizon’s FiOS television service. “These bundles provide consumers with more choice and convenience and increased competition,” he said.The Senate subcommittee does not have the power to approve or deny the spectrum deal. In questioning, the senators did not seem to suggest the deal would get derailed, but instead focused on what conditions might make it more consumer-friendly. The Senate committee may make recommendations to the Department of Justice, which has the power to approve the deal. The Federal Communications Commission must also approve the spectrum transfer.

Using the internet to deliver it doesn’t change that;There may be places where the internet fairy waves her wand and makes life better, for free. But she won’t be sprinkling her glittering dust on the TV business. A “virtual” TV network – one that delivers channels over the internet – will leave the industry’s economics unchanged. One can only hope that Intel, which is reportedly in talks aimed at developing such a network, understands this.The reasoning is simple: it costs money to make a TV show and to deliver it. Neither of those costs is reduced by replacing the traditional cable, satellite, or telco delivery with the internet. Bernstein Research points out that 95 per cent of US TV viewing hours are devoted to programming from seven big companies (Disney, Time Warner, News Corp, NBCUniversal, Viacom, CBS and Discovery). They have no reason to give their content to an internet TV network for less than they charge incumbent distributors such as Comcast, DirectTV, and Verizon.Any internet infrastructure that would deliver the new service is owned by those same distributors, which would lose revenue if customers drop their old-fashioned TV subscriptions. The distributors are, thus, unlikely to be enthusiastic about the idea. Faced with the reality, they will increase broadband prices to protect their massive infrastructure investments. The argument (offered by Netflix, among others) that broadband prices should reflect incremental rather than total costs is naive. Return on assets at these infrastructure businesses is already in the low to mid-single digits.So Intel, Google, Apple or anyone else will struggle to deliver TV at a cost lower than the current options. Of course, internet TV may include so many added bells and whistles that millions of set-top boxes loaded with Intel chips, or Apple TV’s, or some still-to-be imagined gizmo, will be sold. Now that would be magical.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

And there are lots more than three. Apple was first to the idea that delivering media over the internet might be good way to sell something else – in its case, gadgets. Years after the iTunes store made the iPod indispensable, other companies are still intent on turning a similar trick. Google thinks buying or streaming media will sell ads. This week it rebranded the Android store, to be known as Google Play, with greater emphasis on music, movies and books. Meanwhile, Amazon thinks that doing this will help it dominate all internet retail.But these leviathans will not be able to split the business between them. In music, there is Pandora Media and Spotify to contend with, among others. Video is tougher still. Netflix has 24m US subscribers, Hulu is popular, and Walmart is taking a stab with Vudu. Nor are the pay TV players standing idly by: Comcast, Verizon and Dish are all offering new streaming services. Results from the publicly traded streaming companies do not make the business look terribly appealing in its own right. Netflix boosted its revenues by close to 50 per cent last quarter, but its content costs are growing faster still and its expansion plans are expected to produce a bottom line loss in 2012. Pandora announced on Tuesday that, surprisingly, it will also make no profits in the upcoming year, despite doubling listener hours in 2011, and the stock then lost nearly a quarter of its value.The big internet companies must, in this crowded field, use their media services to distinguish and support their core businesses. It will not be easy. Superior selection makes a difference, as do lower prices. But both of these can be matched by a competitor willing to spend money. And why should consumers commit to one provider? One can, with increasing ease, flick back and forth between Amazon, Apple and Google. And it will only get easier.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
450;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-03-06T19:59:02Z;Verizon under pressure to reveal deal details;;Opponents are ratcheting up pressure on Verizon Wireless and a group of large US cable TV companies to disclose details of their agreement to sell spectrum worth $4bn to the telecoms operator and cross-market each others’ services.The opponents, which include Sprint Nextel, Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit and DirectTV and the Rural Telecommunications Group on Tuesday asked the Federal Communications Commission to “stop the clock” on the informal 180-day review process until Verizon and its cable TV partners provide access to full details of their cross-marketing arrangements, claiming them to be anticompetitive.Verizon and the cable companies deny this. At the FCC’s request last week, they made public some documentation about their commercial arrangements, but redacted information that they described as commercially sensitive.“Those redactions, which the applicants describe as ‘related to pricing, compensation and marketing strategies’, make it impossible to understand the full ramifications of the documents or to evaluate their relationship to and effect upon the proposed transactions,” the opponents said in their letter to the FCC.Opposition to the proposed deals between Verizon and Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks and Cox Cable has grown since they were first announced in December.Like AT&T’s now abandoned $39bn bid for T-Mobile USA, the proposed Verizon transaction highlights the pressure US mobile operators are under to acquire new spectrum in order to accommodate the surge in mobile data usage triggered by smartphones like Apple’s iPhone and Android-based handsets. Verizon is seeking spectrum to roll out its 4G mobile broadband network based on LTE technology,The spectrum crunch has also driven other moves, including the acquisition of spectrum by Dish, the US satellite TV operator. Last week, it won FCC approval for its recent spectrum purchases, but was denied immediate approval of a waiver that it would have needed to use its purchase to build a terrestrial wireless broadband network and substantially increased the value of the airwaves.

Verdict: 3/5For cinema fans, the appearance on screen of an animated Hollywood studio logo usually signifies the end of promotional trailers and the start of the feature film.This week, audiences watching new films from Universal Pictures, part of Comcast, the US cable group, will get a first look at its new logo, designed to commemorate the studio’s 100th anniversary.The 24-second clip features a variation of the stirring Jerry Goldsmith score that has been the studio’s hallmark. The music accompanies a sweeping view of the globe, lit up by pinpricks of light from cities as darkness falls across the planet. The shimmering Universal logo then appears, curving around the globe in a font that hearkens back to Hollywood’s golden age.Like the logo that appeared before Universal films of the 1930s and 1940s, the updated version is slightly tilted. This is hardly groundbreaking stuff, but then Universal was not looking for anything radical: according to Ron Meyer, president and chief operating officer of Universal, the company wanted to “create a new logo that reflects our future while honouring our past”.As the studio behind films such as Spartacus, High Plains Drifter and Schindler’s List, Universal has a long and glittering history.The logo clearly nods to that past, insomuch as it can: whether it reflects a future that includes Battleship, Universal’s big movie this summer which is based on the board game, is another matter."

One supposedly significant milestone after another falls: Dow hits 13,000, the Nasdaq’s 2007 high, Apple’s $500bn valuation. But there is a non-voodoo message here too – we’ve simply had a serious rally.A little reflection would not hurt. What we make of this latest burst of prosperity depends heavily on how it is measured, and it pays to avoid complexity. So take a highly liquid and transparent group of companies from a range of industries: the 50 biggest US companies by market capitalisation. The members of this sample have added $1.2tn in market cap since many indices bottomed on October 3 last year, a 23 per cent gain, according to Capital IQ. The gains have been very evenly spread. Yes, Apple is a large contributor, but strike it out and the remaining 49 are still up 22 per cent. Only one of these 50 companies has not notched up gains during the rally: Amazon, burdened with both a dizzying valuation and declining margins. And the best performers of the 50 are diverse. The likes of Citigroup, Comcast, Occidental Petroleum, Walt Disney and Home Depot have risen by more than 40 per cent. If one sector stands out, it is the banks – the six in the sample grew their market caps more, in aggregate ($167bn) than Apple did ($150bn).The underperformers have more in common. They are mostly defensive stocks. Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Bristol-Myers Squibb all had single-digit percentage gains. They would have lagged even if their performances were adjusted to include their considerable dividends. If holders of these sedate names are feeling regret, it will probably be replaced by a sense of relief if the winter of our market content is made unglorious summer.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

That was the best close for the index since June 2008.The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly topped 13,000 for the first time since 2008, but ended the week at 12,982.95, for a weekly gain of 0.3 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,963.75, as Apple, which accounts for more than a tenth of the index, climbed 4 per cent to $522.41, just five dollars short of an all-time high. The world’s largest public company bowed to pressure from investors to give shareholders greater influence over the election of directors.Although all three major US indices are now at multi-year highs, investors were far from exuberant.Fund flow data continued to trend negative. Domestic equity funds suffered a second successive week of outflows, according to data from Lipper. Equity funds have seen net redemptions year to date, despite a rally that has now seen the S&P 500 climb 8.6 per cent.Investors of a statistical bent are focused on the transport sector of the Dow Jones, which has fallen 3.8 per cent in February, even as the broad index has climbed 2.2 per cent. Higher oil prices are weighing on the sector, but “Dow theory” suggests transport stocks are a leading indicator for the rest of the index, because they are the first to feel the effects of economic slowdown.“Sentiment is becoming more worrisome,” noted Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, who has advised clients to take profit.Tech stocks have been the driving force behind the rally in the S&P 500, significantly outperforming the broad index since last April. That trend continued this week, despite a poor performance by computer-markers.Dell shares fell 4 per cent to $17.43 over the week, and its larger rival Hewlett-Packard tumbled 10 per cent to $26.64. Both companies saw earnings fall for the quarter ended January 31, while HP also saw a 7 per cent decline in revenue compared to the same period in 2010.“In general, the easy margin expansion related to PC supply chain re-engineering is behind the company, suggesting more volatility in operating margins and earnings going forward,” Richard Gardner at Citigroup said in a note.Shares in Salesforce.com surged on Friday after the company, which provides cloud-based software to businesses, reported a jump in revenue in the quarter ended January 31.Shares climbed 11.2 per cent over the week to a nine-month high of $143.64. Shares had sold off in the final quarter of 2011, after the company’s previous quarterly results showed revenue momentum slowing. But the stock has now rebounded 40 per cent this year.“These…results undeniably refute the concerns in Q3 that momentum in the business is slowing,” Walter Pritchard at Citigroup said in a note.Walmart fell 5.9 per cent to $58.79 as a second consecutive quarter of US sales growth was not enough to drive profit growth. Fourth-quarter earnings fell steeply, as the world’s largest retailer by revenue discounted heavily to attract customers.Margin compression resulting from promotions and raw material costs was a feature across the consumer staples sector.Shares in Safeway fell 8.8 per cent to $20.93 over the week as profits at the supermarket chain fell, despite a rise in same-store sales.Mass market retailer Target also reported a fall in net fourth-quarter income and a decline in gross margins, although investors were braced for poor figures and shares climbed 4.9 per cent to $55.22.First Solar share slumped 16.5 per cent to $35.58, approaching their lowest price since the solar panel manufacturer’s 2006 debut, after the German government announced plans to cut solar energy subsidies by 30 per cent.Sears Holdings rallied 25.3 per cent to $68.31, even as the department store chain reported a fourth-quarter loss of more than $2bn. Investors instead focused on the turnround plan announced by Edward Lampert, the company’s chairman and a significant shareholder, which is set to begin with the $270m sale of 11 stores in April.Netflix shares suffered their third consecutive weekly decline, having rallied almost 75 per cent in January. It fell 8.4 per cent over the week to $111.67, after Comcast announced plans for a rival video-streaming service. Netflix shares remain up 61 per cent for the year, however.MetroPCS climbed 16.2 per cent to $12.01 after reporting a sixfold increase in fourth-quarter profit. The pay as you go mobile phone network has challenged larger rivals by offering customers attractive rates, but it also showed strong cost discipline in the fourth quarter, cutting back on phone subsidies and marketing costs.

After the market closed, HP announced its own results and shares fell almost $1 more in after-hours trading as revenue missed estimates.Hard disc-drive manufacturers, whose main customers are personal computer makers, also fell.Seagate Technology was off 1 per cent to $26.45, and Western Digital fell 1.7 per cent to $39.56.Elsewhere, US stocks lost ground, with the S&P 500 index closing down 0.3 per cent to 1,357.66, as investors continued to pick over the Greek bail-out package.However, the benchmark US index remains 6 points off its post-financial crisis closing high, despite a soft turn in global manufacturing data.“Just three months ago, had such reports of a patchy outlook for growth emerged, the euro and stocks globally would have taken a spanking,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.Banks bore the brunt of the selling, with the financial sector of the S&P 500 falling 1.3 per cent, significantly more than any other.Morgan Stanley was down 2.8 per cent to $18.73, and Citigroup fell 3 per cent to $32.36.Bank of America fell 2 per cent to $7.95, with shares set to lose ground again this week, having suffered their first weekly loss of 2012 last week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 12,914.83.The transportation sector of the Dow fell 0.7 per cent and is now down almost 4 per cent for the month.“Dow theory” suggests the transportation sector is a leading indicator for the rest of the index, as transport stocks tend to feel the effect of rising energy prices first. The Nasdaq Composite index was off 0.5 per cent to 2,933.17, as Apple, which accounts for more than a 10th of the tech-heavy index’s market capitalisation, slipped 0.4 per cent to $513.04.Newfield Exploration fell 12.7 per cent to $36.88 after the oil and gas explorer missed fourth-quarter earnings expectations, and wrote down reserves.Its rival, Chesapeake Energy, fell 2.4 per cent to $24.03 despite fourth-quarter earnings almost doubling from the same period in 2010. Analysts focused on revenue, which did not climb as much as expected.Exploration and production companies are grappling with decade-low prices for natural gas, and Michael Hall at RW Baird warned on Wednesday that prices could fall to as low as $2 per million British thermal units after the mild winter.But Range Resources climbed 2.9 per cent to $66.10 as the natural gas producer saw fourth-quarter production increase 16 per cent compared to the same period in 2010.Homebuilder stocks fell despite a Bureau of Labour Statistics report that showed an increase in employment in construction in December, compared to a year earlier. Investors appeared to focus instead on sales data of existing homes, which climbed less than expected in January.PulteGroup fell 3 per cent to $8.33, and DR Horton 0.1 per cent to $13.93. Netflix fell 4.3 per cent to $112.40 after a report that Comcast will launch a rival video on-demand service.Gannett rose 4.2 per cent to $15.61, as the newspaper owner said it will raise its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 8 cents.Walmart retreated 2.5 per cent to $58.60, as investors continued to react to a decline in fourth-quarter profit for the retailer, which had seen shares fall 4 per cent on Tuesday. Shares have tested, but not broken through their 100 day moving average, which would be a bearish indicator for chartist investors.Mosaic gained 3.3 per cent to $58.80 after the fertiliser producer settled a dispute with the Sierra Club, an environmental campaigning group, allowing Mosaic to resume production at a Florida phosphate mine.Shares in Intuit, which provides business accounting software to businesses, hit an all-time high of $62.33, before closing at $60.92, for a gain of 5.9 per cent, after strong second fiscal-quarter results.Shares in Vivus surged 90 per cent to as much as $20.12 in after-hours trading, after an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration voted overwhelmingly in favour of approving the company’s weight-loss pill Qnexa, which would be the first new obesity drug in 13 years. The FDA is not required to follow the panel’s recommendation.
455;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-02-21T20:55:23Z;Comcast adds Netflix-style streaming service;;"Comcast has launched a new product for its 22m US pay-television subscribers that will give them access to a similar library of shows and movies to that offered by services such as Netflix.The move is an attempt by Comcast to use its scale to thwart potentially disruptive digital video distributors including Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.Called Xfinity Streampix, it will make a vast library of shows and movies available through customers’ existing cable television interface, as well as computers, mobile devices and gaming consoles. The service will be free for some existing Comcast television subscribers and cost others $5 per month. Netflix’s streaming only service costs $8 per month.Netflix last year passed Comcast as the largest subscription video service in the world, with more than 23m customers. But Comcast has been slowing its pay-TV subscriber losses, and analysts now expect it to begin growing its video customer base later this year.Streampix will supplement Comcast’s existing on-demand offerings, which include 75,000 shows and movies. Content from Disney, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros and NBCUniversal will be available through the service. Comcast last year became the majority owner of NBCU in a bid to find synergies between content and distribution.The service is another move to advance TV Everywhere, the industry-wide initiative to make more television content available online. “Streampix is another step moving TV Everywhere forward by giving customers access to an even greater library of popular choices to watch,” said Marcien Jenckes, general manager of video services at Comcast.The news came as Comcast announced plans to distribute four new minority-owned cable channels, fulfilling a pledge made to regulators as it was seeking approval for its takeover of NBCUniversal in 2010.They include Aspire, a channel launched by basketball star Earvin “Magic” Johnson that promises “enlightening, entertaining and positive programming” for African-American family audiences; Revolt, a music-themed channel from Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip hop entrepreneur; and BabyFirst Americas, aimed at Hispanic families’ young children, from Constantino “Said” Schwarz, a veteran of Spanish language television.“They want to get behind these growing audiences,” said John Fogelman of FactoryMade Ventures, which is working with Hollywood director Robert Rodriguez on a general entertainment network for second- and third-generation English-speaking Latino audiences called El Rey.He would not disclose the terms on which Comcast was offering distribution, but said: “They’ve made them so competitive that they’re setting us up [to succeed].”"
456;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Comcast-NBCU merger pays dividends;;Comcast has raised its dividend and authorised another $6.5bn in share buy-backs thanks to a 30 per cent rise in annual free cash flow at the largest US cable operator.The company said it would lift its annual dividend by 44 per cent to 65 cents per share and that it intends to repurchase $3bn in stock in 2012. The increased returns to shareholders were broadly in line with analysts’ expectations. Its shares were 5.2 per cent higher in mid-afternoon trading.The company has completed its first full year as majority owner of NBCUniversal, the TV network, film studio and theme park group, which made Comcast the latest big media company to bet on a successful combination of content and distribution.Fourth-quarter revenues rose 3 per cent to $15bn on a pro forma basis, with full-year revenues up 4.7 per cent at $57.7bn. Comcast lost 17,000 pay television customers in the quarter, beating analysts’ expectations of 125,000 lost subscribers. It was able to increase revenues for the division by 1.3 per cent to $4.9bn thanks to price increases and premium product sales.It also added 336,000 high-speed internet customers, increasing revenues for the unit by 10 per cent to $2.2bn. So-called cord cutting trends are reshaping the cable industry as more customers choose to do without pay television, but view fast internet connections as a necessity. Comcast said it was reducing capital expenditures with new scale efficiencies and was able to maintain a broader network for a lower cost and lower equipment pricing.But Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett said the lower-than-expected losses in the group’s pay-TV business could point to a return to positive growth thanks to Comcast’s strong product offering and an early recovery in the number of new households being formed.“The psychological importance of video subscriber strength, not just for cable but indeed for the whole pay TV sector, cannot be overstated,” Mr Moffett said. “The fear of cord cutting is fading, and with it, so is the core bear argument.”NBCU revenues rose just under 1 per cent for the quarter, driven by higher distribution fees at its cable networks, which include USA, Bravo and E!. Revenues at the NBC broadcast network continue to suffer as advertising sales lag with poor ratings. Film revenues fell due to lower home-entertainment sales. Theme park revenues rose on the back of the Harry Potter attraction in Orlando.Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, pointed to a series of investments the company has made in NBC, including new shows for the broadcast network, a series of expensive sports rights deals, and the purchase of the entirety of the company’s Orlando theme parks. “Some of these investments are already paying off and others will pay off over time,” he said.As an example of the success of content and distribution working together, Mr Roberts said ratings for Smash, a new NBC show, were 20 per cent higher in Comcast markets than in markets served by the competition, thanks to cross promotion.
457;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-01-29T17:57:49Z;Comcast’s bet on NBCU begins to pay off;;When cable operator Comcast bought 51 per cent of NBCUniversal, the television and film group, many in the media industry doubted the marriage would be a happy one.Valuing NBCU at $30bn as it was separated from General Electric, the deal represented a bold bet by Comcast that it could successfully unite content and distribution. If it did so, it would succeed where its peers had failed, transforming the buttoned-down Philadelphia cable guys into bona fide media moguls.But critics worried the two companies had impossibly different cultures, with Comcast’s numbers-oriented discipline contrasting with NBCU’s creative culture. Analysts were wary of the acquisition, which made the enlarged company more complicated to assess.The deal, which closed a year ago this week, is still in its early stages. Yet there are already signs Comcast is applying the same strategic acumen to its new content assets that helped make it the largest cable operator in the US.It has invested in new original programming, with shows such as The Voice, in an effort to turn round the struggling broadcast network. It secured critical sports rights at a cost of billions of dollars a year. And it has shown a willingness to redouble investment in businesses with which it was unfamiliar, such as films and theme parks.“We want NBCUniversal and Comcast to work well together,” says Steve Burke, chief executive of NBCU, in an interview with the Financial Times. “That is happening now.” Mr Burke, a longtime Comcast executive, was hand picked for the role by chief executive Brian Roberts.Upon taking over, Mr Burke quickly put his own team in place. He replaced 10 of the top 18 executives at the group and 26 per cent of the top 150. He sought to improve morale by giving business-unit heads more autonomy and increasing content budgets.Chief among Comcast’s priorities is the revival of the NBC broadcast network, which trails CBS, Fox and ABC. To spearhead this effort Comcast recruited Bob Greenblatt from Showtime, the premium cable network, to oversee NBC Entertainment. Ratings have not yet picked up but Mr Greenblatt’s first full season of shows will come on air later this year. It is also looking to improve performance at Telemundo, its Spanish-language broadcast network.If ratings do increase, NBC will benefit from more advertising and could begin to collect meaningful retransmission fees – the dues cable operators pay to carry broadcast networks – areas where at present it lags behind. “We think there’s more upside with broadcast than with any of the other businesses,” Mr Burke says.An array of new sports rights deals will also help NBC. Mr Burke successfully negotiated to retain the Olympics, the National Football League, the National Hockey League and golf’s PGA Tour.The rights come at a price. The Olympics cost more than $1bn per games and the NFL increased fees by 65 per cent. NBC will pay nearly $1bn a year for the rights to broadcast American football. Yet it was able to extract new concessions, including a primetime game on Thanksgiving.Content from all these deals will also be used on the new NBC Sports cable network, an effort to compete with ESPN, the profitable cable network owned by Disney. And instead of losing money on the Olympics, as it had in years past, Comcast says it expects its sports deals to break even or make a profit.In perhaps Comcast’s most surprising move of the year, it bought the stake it did not own in the Universal Orlando theme park from Blackstone for $1bn. The arm accounts for 20 per cent of NBCU’s operating cash flow thanks to its Harry Potter attraction.For Comcast, the deal was the culmination of a decade-long desire. In 2004 the group made an unsolicited $66bn bid for Disney but was rebuffed. Comcast was not dissuaded.Nor did it think twice as it watched Time Warner, another big media company to bet on synergies between content and distribution, disassemble itself, spinning off AOL and Time Warner Cable to focus on more profitable television and film businesses.Nonetheless, some remain wary of these precedents. Comcast shares are up 13 per cent since the deal’s close. Yet analysts point to pure play content companies such as CBS, which is up 40 per cent, and Time Warner, which is up 18 per cent.“They seem to be doing the right things but I remain fundamentally sceptical of content and delivery synergies,” says James Ratcliffe, analyst with Barclays Capital.“This is still primarily a cable company, and if the cable company does well you don’t want the NBC Network and other NBCU assets to overshadow the cable unit’s good results,” says Stefan Anninger, analyst with Credit Suisse.However, an early sign of potential synergies has come with The Voice, a singing competition hosted by pop stars Christina Aguilera and Cee Lo Green, which airs on NBC. Comcast made exclusive content from the show available to its cable subscribers and cross-promoted it on other channels. Ratings for the show were 40 per cent higher in Comcast homes than the national average.“Distribution and content work better together than separately,” says Mr Burke. “We know it works.”
458;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-01-24T00:04:36Z;News Corp to launch US free-to-air Spanish network;;"Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp is making a pitch for the 50m-strong Hispanic population in the US with plans to launch a free-to-air Spanish-language television network this autumn in partnership with RCN Television Group, the Colombian broadcaster.MundoFox, announced on Monday, it will go up against Univision, the private equity-owned market leader in Spanish language television in the US, and Telemundo, part of Comcast-controlled NBCUniversal.Both companies, as well as a list of smaller Spanish-language cable channels, have seen strong ratings and revenue growth as America’s Hispanic population has expanded in numbers and buying power, attracting rising interest from advertisers.News Corp’s Fox International Channels division gave no details about the scale of its planned investment. Talks with local affiliates to secure distribution were under way, it said, as it predicted that the new network would be carried on stations covering three-quarters of all US households.MundoFox faces intense competition for content ranging from rights to sporting events to telenovela dramas. Executives said it would take bulletins from NTN24, RCN’s 24-hour news channel, and told the Associated Press it would be “editorially independent”.The new network will air shows from RCN, which made the Betty La Fea series on which Ugly Betty was based; Fox Deportes, the Fox cable sports channel for Hispanic audiences; and Shine, the independent production company built by Elisabeth Murdoch and bought by her father’s company last February.Hernan Lopez, president and chief executive of Fox International Channels, likened the plans for MundoFox to News Corp’s launch 25 years ago of the Fox broadcast network in competition with ABC, CBS and NBC, and said the new network would have “a similar sensibility” to the network that now airs Glee, House, American Idol and X Factor.“There is an increasing demand for quality Spanish-language content in the US from both viewers and advertisers,” he said: “It would be a missed opportunity not to provide an alternative for the 50m-plus Latino viewers who currently have limited options in Spanish-language broadcast television.”It was unclear how the venture would affect programmes supplied by RCN to existing US Hispanic channels. “RCN has provided the main Hispanic networks in the US with much of their primetime content for over two decades,” said Gabriel Reyes, its chief executive: “We now plan to maximise our capabilities and bring an increasing variety of fresh and innovative productions directly to Spanish-speaking viewers.”Colombian media reported that Mr Murdoch made a flying visit to the country last September to stop in at local Fox production facilities."
459;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-01-18T23:28:59Z;Cuban retunes his TV channel to music;;Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, has struck a deal with Anschutz Entertainment Group to rebrand his HDNet television channel as a live music and entertainment network.The deal will see Mr Cuban form a joint venture with AEG, Ryan Seacrest Media and Creative Artists Agency, relaunching HDNet as AXS TV. Mr Cuban told the Financial Times that the channel would do for live music and entertainment programming “what ESPN SportsCenter did for sports”.AEG is one of the biggest venue owners in the world, operating facilities such as the Staples Center in Los Angeles, as well as the 02 arena in London. Mr Cuban, who made his fortune when he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7bn in 1999, said the channel would broadcast live music coverage from venues across the US.AXS would “go beyond the concerts” with other live entertainment programming, such as behind-the-scenes interviews with top performers, he said.The channel will be available in 35m US homes, after Dish Network, the satellite provider, struck a deal to carry AXS, alongside other distributors, such as DirecTV, Comcast and Verizon.The deal gives AEG a stake in a new TV brand and a platform to boost its ticketing operation, which it recently launched in competition with Live Nation Entertainment. AEG opposed the 2010 merger of Live Nation and TicketMaster, which created the industry leader in concert ticket sales, and recently launched AXS.com, its own ticketing service, which has so far been limited to a couple of its US venues.The participation of Mr Seacrest and CAA should boost AXS’s celebrity credentials. CAA represents some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, while Mr Seacrest, the host of American Idol, has become a significant figure behind the camera as well as in front of it. His company produces reality shows such as Keeping up with the Kardashians. “Nobody has his paws on pop culture like Ryan,” said Mr Cuban.CAA said AXS would become a “new distribution opportunity for artists and content creators”.Mr Cuban will run the relaunched channel, which will retain a weekly show presented by Dan Rather, the former CBS news anchor. HDNet was aimed at young males but the rebranded channel will be targeted at a broader audience, Mr Cuban said. “We see this as an opportunity for anybody interested in pop culture.”AXS is one of Mr Cuban’s portfolio of business interests: since selling Broadcast.com he has acquired the Dallas Mavericks, which last year won the NBA Championship, bought the Landmark cinema chain, and launched a film production company.
460;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Hulu to spend $500m on programming in 2012;;Hulu, the online video site owned by Walt Disney, News Corporation and NBC Universal, plans to spend about $500m on programming this year to bolster its library as cable television operators beef up their own competing online services.The company’s 2012 budget is a $200m increase on the $300m Hulu spent on programming in 2011.Jason Kilar, Hulu chief executive, wrote in a blog post that the company’s dual revenue model of advertising and subscription fees meant it could pay more for content than other online subscription services. “We believe our approach will enable us to secure more valuable content for our users and to secure content in more attractive windows than would otherwise be possible,” he wrote.Hulu generated about $420m in revenues in 2011, an increase of 60 per cent on the previous year, while the company’s Hulu Plus subscription service “materially exceeded our plan”, Mr Kilar wrote.Hulu is attracting more than twice the number of new subscribers each day when compared with last year, Mr Kilar added. Hulu Plus now has 1.5m subscribers, which compares with more than 20m subscribers at Netflix, a rival service which offers a subscription DVD service, as well as online video streaming.Hulu’s owners put the site up for sale last year but despite receiving several offers that valued the company at more than $1bn, they decided not to sell. “We were moving too fast to say we did not need to own an asset like this,” Jon Miller, chief digital officer at News Corp, told a panel at this week’s Consumer Electronics Show.Hulu’s dual revenue model differentiated it from Netflix, he added. “Dual revenue streams work in the media business.”Netflix and Hulu dominate online video viewing in the US but, after years of delay, services launched by cable and satellite operators finally look capable of eating into their lead.FT tech writers upload their viewsComcast, the largest cable operator in the US, recently struck a 10-year extension to its carriage agreement with Walt Disney, a deal that gives new online rights for programming from Disney’s cable networks, including its ESPN sports network and The Disney Channel. This programming is free to watch for authenticated Comcast subscribers on devices such as the iPad.HBO Go, the online service launched by Time Warner’s HBO channel, has also attracted viewers, with its app downloaded more than 3m times. Showtime, a HBO competitor, has launched its own online streaming service, which is available to authenticated subscribers of the premium cable channel.HBO last week stopped selling discounted discs of its programming to Netflix, in the latest sign of an intensifying rivalry between the two companies. Netflix will be free to buy the discs of shows such as Boardwalk Empire from retailers.
461;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-01-10T17:00:04Z;Dish bids to stem subscriber decline;;Dish Networks has unveiled a suite of new products and refreshed branding as it attempts to stem a sharp decline in subscribers who have abandoned the satellite television provider due to superior offerings from competitor DirecTV and cable operators such as Comcast.Joe Clayton, chief executive of Dish, the US’s third-largest satellite provider with 14m subscribers, said he aimed to transform the company’s “cheap” image to that of a premium products provider.“We’re trying to change the image of the company,” said Mr Clayton ahead of the company’s presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show. “The weakness that our company has had over the last couple of years is in our communication to the public. In the past our image has been one about cheap, cheap, cheap. We’re more than that.”As part of these efforts, Dish has unveiled a high-definition digital video recording system that it says is among the most advanced in the industry. The Hopper system will be accompanied by smaller Joey boxes, using the Australian term for kangaroo, which will deliver Dish services to multiple televisions in a single home.Yet it will take more than savvy marketing and products to lure back customers, and analysts remain unconvinced. Dish lost 111,000 customers in the third quarter, and 134,000 in the quarter before that. But the company has managed to increase revenue per user, boosting third-quarter revenues to $3.6bn and net income to $319m, both up from the same time a year earlier.Benjamin Swinburne, analyst for Morgan Stanley, remains sceptical about Dish’s ability to win back customers as it faces stiff competition in the “increasingly difficult” US pay-television sector where “over time, we expect slow but steady [subscriber] declines”.Other Dish offerings designed to entice consumers include free SiriusXM radio stations through Dish devices, and expanded access to HBO content. But these features will be costly for Dish, and Mr Clayton warned they may be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher rates.“Like every other pay-TV provider, we’re concerned about the programming costs,” he said, pointing to NBC’s $4.83bn bid for the Olympics. “Who knows how much of that will be passed on. It will get to a point of diminishing returns.”Mr Swinburne pointed to Dish’s unused wireless spectrum as a valuable asset whose worth increased sharply after Verizon’s $3.6bn acquisition of the SpectrumCo assets last month. Mr Swinburne said Dish’s spectrum could be worth as much as $8.5bn, compared with the $2.8bn Dish paid for it last year.Dish is also looking to leverage its $320m acquisition of the failed Blockbuster video rental chain last year by offering it as a streaming video service for $10 per month, to compete with Netflix’s $8 a month service. “Blockbuster is somewhat tainted, according to Wall Street,” Mr Clayton said. “But consumers still use it.”Mr Clayton’s hope is that Dish’s technology platform, along with some services, will stop customer losses. “We have a long history of being first in technical innovation,” he said. “The problem is that we never told anybody.”

Apple has been no friend to Adobe in recent years, with the late Steve Jobs vocally refusing to allow its Flash web plug-in onto any iDevices.Deloitte has acquired a mobile applications developer, Übermind, for around $40m, according to GeekWire. The Seattle-based agency is joining Deloitte’s business technology consulting unit in what Übermind describes as a “left brain meets right” merger. The deal highlights the growing importance of mobile commerce, with Übermind developing apps and back-end processing for the likes of Target, Amtrak and even Apple itself.A simple typographical error seems to have been behind Twitter‘s mistaken verification of a spoof Wendi Deng Murdoch account.

463;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-01-04T22:32:37Z;Comcast strikes 10-year deal with Disney;;Comcast, the largest cable operator in the US, has struck a deal with Disney that will significantly boost its digital offerings and guarantee it access to ABC, ESPN and other television networks for at least another 10 years.The value of the deal was not disclosed, however television networks in recent years have demanded sharply higher fees from cable operators.Given the length of the contract and the number of channels and other services included, one person close to the deal said it would be worth “multiple billions” to Disney.The long-term distribution agreement will give Comcast some predictability over its programming costs at a time when popular channels, especially those with live sports, are commanding sharply rising fees. ESPN, Disney’s sports cable network, is the most expensive network for cable operators to carry, costing nearly $5 per subscriber per month. Comcast has about 22m television customers.“It’s smart to lock in the long-term rate,” said James Ratcliffe, analyst with Barclays Capital. “But Disney fully appreciates the value of ESPN and has never been in the business of giving it away cheaply.”Comcast once tried to acquire Disney, making an unsuccessful $54bn offer for the company in 2004. But last year Comcast succeeded in acquiring NBCUniversal, the entertainment conglomerate that competes with Disney in broadcast and cable television, film and theme parks.Comcast will also make Disney’s content available through various online platforms, advancing the industry’s “TV Everywhere” strategy, which aims to make cable programming available on laptops and tablet computers.ESPN, the Disney Channel and other cable networks will be available on mobile devices, such as the iPad, for authenticated Comcast subscribers. The move is likely to be followed by the launch of similar services with Disney’s other cable and satellite partners.“This is a pretty good example of the industry doing some smart things, giving consumers what they want and adding more value to a cable subscription,” said Jonathan Weitz, partner at IBB Consulting, which works with television companies.Proponents of TV Everywhere are likely to take comfort in the size and length of the Comcast-Disney deal. Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner – and a vocal supporter of TV Everywhere – recently told the Financial Times that some cable operators “were not doing well” at promoting the service.“It’s part of a strategy that Comcast has been most explicit about, which is making sure that if customers are paying a subscription, they can consume that content anywhere they want to,” said Mr Ratcliffe.Neil Smit, president of Comcast Cable, said the deal “embraces the future of entertainment” with its digital provisions.“This agreement is unprecedented in our industry,” said George Bodenheimer, president of ESPN. “It reinforces the value of the multichannel subscription and takes full advantage of new technologies.”Yet the price of the deal is expected to erode Comcast’s margins. Mr Ratcliffe expects revenue per video subscriber to grow at 2.25 per cent this year, while programming costs per subscriber grow by 7 per cent.“The balance of power is with the programmers who have must have content,” he said. “And ESPN is must have content.”
464;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-01-04T19:16:11Z;US election has multicultural message for brands;Pay attention to the changing demographics of the electoral map, writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson;After the quadrennial US election ritual of polls, caucuses and primaries began in Iowa on Tuesday, filling television, tablet and smartphone screens with instant punditry, one group of executives should be watching what unfolds between now and November carefully.Media and marketing have always been heavily influenced by elections. There is the obvious boost to advertising revenues: Morgan Stanley analysts expect that half of this year’s growth in US ad spending will come from campaign money, double the impact of the Olympic Games. Moody’s estimates that political ad revenues could be up 9-18 per cent this year from 2010.News organisations hope, too, for a lift as they unveil this season’s gimmicks and multimedia advances. (CNN used holographic “Weebles” to illustrate how caucuses work, while the Washington Post is scouring Twitter to measure the mood.)More important, though, is the impact on marketing. Madison Avenue often hires campaign veterans and watches elections obsessively for insights into how big corporate campaigns should be run or troubleshooting tactics PR firms can use.For first-time candidates, election campaigns are like product launches. For incumbent presidents, they can be tricky rebranding campaigns. Early primary states are like test markets for tactics that also reflect and accentuate bigger shifts shaping the media of the day.Since the 1960 debate when John F. Kennedy looked more telegenic than Richard Nixon, marketers have seen the value of mastering the latest media technology. In the digital age, politicians have learnt the internet’s grassroots fundraising power, the allure of speaking unfiltered to voters through blogs, the value of “free media” when TV news picks up cheap YouTube videos, the importance of search engine optimisation and the mobilising effect of email lists, text messages, Facebook and Twitter. All of these discoveries have influenced big brands’ marketing tactics.It is too early to be sure what media lessons 2012 will hold, but the early signs are that candidates retain as much faith in television as do Super Bowl advertisers. Barack Obama’s digitally groundbreaking 2008 campaign spent plenty on TV, too, including a headline-grabbing 30-minute ad, yet Rick Perry, the biggest spender on Iowa TV ads, came in fifth on Tuesday.This year’s big media lesson may be more about demographic than digital shifts. Political campaigners are masters of the demographic “micro-targeting” that marketers find increasingly valuable.After “soccer moms” and “hockey moms”, the swing-voters in focus this year are “Walmart moms”. Paying attention to the giant retailer’s customers is sensible for any brand, but as Latino Decisions, a polling organisation focused on Hispanics, puts it, it is rash to ignore “the growing population of mamás – Latina moms.”There are now more than 50m US Hispanics, or 16 per cent of the population. Yet the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies found that more than half of America’s largest brands still target less than 1 per cent of their budgets to Hispanic consumers. Marketers such as Walmart and Procter & Gamble no longer treat Hispanic marketing as its own silo, but the 5 per cent of brands that spent the most targeting them saw the fastest revenue growth.Multicultural voters tipped the scales for President Obama in 2008, the Census Bureau found, and population trends suggest that they could be decisive again this year. Newt Gingrich’s Spanish-language website, NewtPresidente.com, hails “la importancia de los hispanos en estas elecciones”, and the New York Times reported that conservative campaign groups have launched “an aggressive program of outreach to Hispanics”.America’s largest Hispanic broadcaster, Univision, and its Comcast-owned rival Telemundo, which hosted one of the Republican debates, are seeing strong advertising growth as the spending power of Hispanic consumers begins to sink in. Both score ratings victories over English-language broadcast networks such as Fox and NBC with increasing frequency.“There is no doubt both parties understand they cannot win the election without having at least 33-35 per cent of the Latino vote,” says Isaac Lee, president of Univision News. The same is true for brands looking to win market share.US Hispanics are an increasingly diverse and bilingual group – Univision News has journalists covering this campaign for “English language Latinos” for the first time – but marketers need to understand these complexities much better.If social media helped elect the president in 2008, multicultural media will be as important in 2012. Media and marketing executives looking for lessons need to pay as much attention to the changing demographics of the electoral map as to candidates’ splashy digital innovations.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
465;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2012-01-03T17:17:16Z;Intense scramble for US mobile telecoms spectrum;Attention focuses on one of the most fiercely competitive industries in the world;AT&T’s failed $39bn bid for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit, coupled with a string of successful deals in recent months, has refocused attention on one of the most pressing issues facing the US mobile telecoms industry – the scramble for spectrum.When Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, announced the abandonment of the T-Mobile USA bid last month, he said: “The actions by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block this transaction do not change the realities of the US wireless industry.“It is one of the most fiercely competitive industries in the world, with a mounting need for more spectrum that has not diminished and must be addressed immediately. The AT&T and T-Mobile USA combination would have offered an interim solution to this spectrum shortage. In the absence of such steps, customers will be harmed and needed investment will be stifled.”Since then, AT&T has completed a separate deal to buy spectrum from Qualcomm for $1.93bn, increasing its total spectrum holdings to around 81.1 Megahertz, according to calculations by Bernstein Research. That transaction should help ease immediate concerns about spectrum shortages as AT&T rolls out its new LTE broadband wireless network. But industry insiders say the US mobile industry needs access to much more spectrum if it is to continue to innovate.“Spectrum is the backbone of the wireless industry – without it, the applications, speed, devices and other innovations of the wireless ecosystem could be in jeopardy,” says the CTIA, the US mobile industry trade group.As evidence, it points to reports from the wireless carriers themselves. For example, data usage on AT&T’s network – the first to host Apple’s popular iPhone handset – grew by more than 8,000 per cent from 2007 to 2010.Industry executives say this data growth will continue, fuelled by the increasing use of smartphones which consume on average 26 times the amount of bandwidth as an ordinary mobile phone, and other wireless data devices including PC tablets which are even more data hungry.“We estimate that in the first five to seven weeks of 2015, we will carry the same amount of mobile data traffic on our network that we carried in all of 2010, as customers continue to ‘mobilise’ everything,” AT&T says.While some argue that dire warnings about a looming spectrum crisis are overblown, the Federal Communications Commission, the main industry regulator, strongly disagrees. “The spectrum crunch is very real,” says an FCC official.Julius Genachoski, FCC chairman, has made the need to free up an additional 500 Megahertz of spectrum one of the policy centerpieces of his ambitious National Broadband Plan. As part of the plan, the FCC is seeking Congressional approval for one of its most hotly debated initiatives – the use of so-called “incentive auctions,” sharing the proceeds of the sale of up to 120 Megahertz of unused TV spectrum with the current owners.Mobile operators themselves are taking steps to secure additional spectrum. While AT&T was mulling over the future of its T-Mobile USA bid earlier this autumn, rival Verizon Wireless announced a $3.6bn deal to acquire unused airwaves from SpectrumCo, a coalition of US TV cable companies that includes Comcast and TimeWarnerCable. Then a few weeks later it unveiled a deal to buy additional spectrum from Cox Communications for $315m after Cox decided to abandon its own wireless phone initiative.As part of these deals, which Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research has described as, “in some ways the most important telecom transactions I have seen in 20 years,” the cable companies will also resell Verizon Wireless services.Mr Moffett describes Verizon’s cable spectrum purchases, which must still be approved by the FCC, as “a strategic masterstroke for Verizon in that it takes an enormous step towards a wireless duopoly, but does it with far less regulatory friction than AT&T’s [failed] transaction to buy T-Mobile USA.”If approved, Verizon will emerge with the best spectrum position in the industry and a very deep position in the 700 Megahertz band, considered “beachfront” property in the mobile industry because it is the most suitable spectrum for mobile broadband in dense urban areas.Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator by subscribers which recently renewed its wholesale agreement with Clearwire, has acknowledged that it will also need more spectrum as it pushes ahead with its 4G network rollout and its partnership with LightSquared looks increasingly uncertain.However, T-Mobile USA is in perhaps the most difficult position. Although the fourth-largest US mobile operator will receive some new spectrum as part of the break fee agreed between AT&T and Deutsche Telekom, the company has said it will need to acquire more spectrum before it can build the LTE network that it needs to compete with its three larger rivals. LTE is the next generation wireless broadband data standard which is supported by most leading telecoms operators in the world.Now that Verizon has tied up the cable companies’ spectrum, it is unclear where that spectrum might come from, and whether as a result, T-Mobile USA will be forced into another, perhaps less contentious merger or partnership.LightSquared, funded mainly by Philip Falcone’s Harbinger Capital, is struggling to overcome GPS interference issues before it can launch its planned nationwide wholesale LTE network. That leaves Dish Network, the US satellite TV operator which is awaiting regulatory approval for its purchase of 40 Megahertz of spectrum, as perhaps the most likely partner for one or other of the US mobile industry leaders – or perhaps a “tier two” regional operator – in their scramble for spectrum.

Doug Morris, the Sony Music chief executive who launched it two years ago while running Universal, told the Financial Times its revenues had risen from about $50m in 2010 to about $150m this year, and should hit $300m in 2012.Rio Caraeff, Vevo chief executive, added: “We’re on track to reach profitability in the first half of next year.” Vevo has paid out half of its revenues to music companies, performers and songwriters, or $100m to date, he added.Mr Caraeff said he had talked to existing cable networks. “We’ve been approached domestically and internationally about buying them or partnering with them,” he said. “I don’t rule out having a traditional channel.” Vevo is also talking to cable operators including Comcast and Time Warner Cable about services for connected televisions, he added.Vevo is laying the groundwork by developing more original shows. It produced 200 hours of programming this year by recording concerts and other events, and is looking to increase that next year with six to eight original shows, based on 30 pilots in production.But Mr Caraeff said he was conscious of the significant investment such a move would require. “We’re not in the marketplace trying to buy distressed cable assets,” Mr Caraeff said. “That’s not for the faint of heart or wallet. that’s hundreds of millions of dollars.”Vevo is working on an application for Microsoft’s Xbox game console, and is planning features that will let viewers for the first time pick a genre or artist, and watch a continuous stream of related videos.“We see a lot of people looking for a passive, personalised experience,” Mr Caraeff said. “They don’t want to make their own playlists, they just want the latest stuff playing.”That feature will come to Vevo.com when the site is redesigned early next year, making Vevo more like the original MTV.Moving Vevo to televisions “changes everything”, said Mr Morris. “Why aren’t we going to become the MTV of this world? It’s just a matter of time.” It is also is in talks to supply MTV with videos.Vevo, which gets three-quarters of its audience but a fraction of its advertising from outside the US, is chasing bigger international revenues, with plans to launch in Brazil, Italy, France, Spain, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months.

He was 77.A force in San Francisco civic life, Mr Hellman was best known in his later years for rallying around local causes, from education to pension reform to the arts. He won broad public affection for founding and funding a free three-day bluegrass music festival, hosted annually in the city’s Golden Gate Park since 2001.“He gave so much of himself to so many and we are all the richer for it,” said Emmylou Harris, 12-time Grammy winner and a friend and collaborator of Mr Hellman’s .Mr Hellman was the co-founder of San Francisco-based equity firm Hellman & Friedman, with partner Tully Friedman, since 1984. The firm made notable investments in Levi Strauss & Company, taking the San Francisco jeans manufacturer private for $1.6bn in 1985, the largest takeover of a public company at the time; and the Nasdaq stock market, buying a 15 per cent stake in 2001 then selling it for a substantial profit in 2007. The firm manages $25bn in capital, according to a company statement.Mr Hellman began his career on Wall Street, joining Lehman Brothers in 1959 and eventually becoming its president in 1973. In 1977, he went to Boston to start a venture capital firm, one of the first in the industry, which invested in start-ups including Apollo Computer, Continental Cable, which is now Comcast, and Apple.“He always set his own course and did things in his own way,” said Philip Hammarskjold, chief executive of Hellman & Friedman. “Warren taught us not only to be better investors but to be better people.”Mr Hellman gave to a variety of philanthropic and political causes. He funded a local ballot measure aimed at reforming San Francisco’s pension system and bankrolled the launch of a nonprofit online news site, The Bay Citizen, in 2010.An avid music lover, Mr Hellman learnt to play the five-string banjo later in life and toured throughout the US with his band, The Wronglers.He founded and sponsored the free outdoor Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in San Francisco, calling it “a selfish gift”. The festival has attracted performers including Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch and Robert Plant, as well as emerging musical groups, and draws more than 750,000 attendees each year.Last week, Mr Hellman learnt that the city’s park commission renamed Speedway Meadow, the section of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park where the festival is held every year, “Hellman’s Hollow”.Mr Hellman is survived by Chris, his wife of 56 years, his four children, Frances, Tricia, Mick and Judith, 12 grandchildren and one great grandchild."
468;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-12-16T22:11:53Z;Comcast chief to pay $500,000 antitrust fine;;Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, has settled charges with the US justice department that he violated reporting requirements when he acquired more than $100m in voting shares in the company over a two-year period. He will pay a $500,000 civil fine.The justice department’s antitrust division filed a civil lawsuit in US District Court alleging that Mr Roberts violated requirements to notify authorities before acquiring voting shares, which were part of his compensation package. The fine was limited to $500,000 because the violation was “inadvertent and technical …and was apparently due to faulty advice from outside counsel”, according to a Federal Trade Commission statement.Once Comcast realised that the shares had not been reported in documents prepared by an external company, it contacted authorities in August 2009 and submitted a corrective filing. Mr Roberts, who is also the cable company’s chairman, has held more than $119.6m in Comcast stock since 2007.“Comcast and Mr Roberts appreciate the acknowledgement by the Federal Trade Commission that this was a technical and inadvertent violation that was self-reported, promptly corrected and did not involve any financial gain to the company or to Mr Roberts,” Comcast said.“We take very seriously our obligations to comply with all aspects of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and, working with our lawyers, we have put in place additional safeguards to ensure that an inadvertent violation does not occur in the future.”Mr Roberts admitted to inadvertent violations of the same rule in 1999 and 2000, but was not charged, according to the FTC.The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is an antitrust regulation requiring any investor that might acquire a substantial stake in a particular security to file a notification with the federal government. The reporting limit was $59.8m at the time of Mr Roberts’ violation in 2007 and is currently $66m.Comcast this year completed its acquisition of NBCUniversal, giving it the NBC broadcast network, the Universal Pictures film studio, theme parks and additional cable television networks. Though growth in its core pay television business has slowed, it remains the largest cable operator in the US. In its most recent results, Comcast reported a growing high-speed internet customer base, increasing internet revenues by nearly 10 per cent.It has also shown a willingness to invest in its new NBC assets. This week, Comcast along with two other broadcasters struck a $24bn deal to broadcast the National Football League until the end of the 2022 season.Additional reporting by David Gelles
469;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-12-16T17:22:19Z;Cablevision shares tumble after resignation;;Shares in Cablevision, one of the largest cable television operators in the US, were down as much as 15 per cent after the surprise resignation of Tom Rutledge, the chief operating officer widely considered to be the company’s most important executive.“No company in our telecom, cable and satellite coverage universe [was] as exposed to key man risk as Cablevision,” said Craig Moffett, Bernstein Research analyst. “[Mr Rutledge] is in our view the hands-down best executive in the industry.”Mr Rutledge worked under James Dolan, chief executive and son of chairman and founder Charles Dolan. The Dolan family in effect controls the publicly traded company through its extensive holdings of voting and nonvoting shares.But it was Mr Rutledge who was credited by Wall Street for orchestrating Cablevision’s growth in recent years. He has maintained Cablevision’s market share in New York while facing stiff competition from Time Warner Cable and Comcast, and oversaw the spin-offs of both Mad Men producer AMC Networks and the Madison Square Garden Group.“Tom Rutledge has played a key role in driving and shaping Cablevision’s success over the last decade, applying a rare combination of technological vision and operational excellence that has delivered results,” James Dolan said in a statement on Friday.Yet Cablevision has struggled to grow this year, largely because it has managed to achieve high product penetration in its core markets. “Unfortunately, Cablevision is indeed a victim of its own success,” Mr Moffett said in a note last month.Cablevision, which serves customers in New York and other nearby states, has performed poorly compared with its peers over the past year. Even before Mr Rutledge’s departure, shares in the company were down 60 per cent over the past year. Shares in Comcast, the largest US cable operator, are up 8 per cent this year, while Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable operator, has seen its shares dip 3.5 per cent.Mr Rutledge had recently renewed his contract with Cablevision, and analysts speculated he may have either had a falling out with the Dolans or be in line to lead Charter Communications, which is looking for a new chief executive. John Bickham, Mr Rutledge’s longtime deputy, also recently left Cablevision.The management shake-up prompted some analysts to suggest that Cablevision might be a candidate for a takeover. But Mr Moffett said that Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two most likely buyers, were unlikely to pursue the asset. Comcast is still working to integrate its acquisition of NBCUniversal this year, while Time Warner Cable is known as a disciplined buyer.Miller Tabak analyst David Joyce downgraded Cablevision from “buy” to “neutral” on Friday, saying “the heavy lifting has been done by Rutledge” and predicting that the stock would stabilise lower after taking an initial hit.“Everything I hoped for when I came to Cablevision has come true,” Mr Rutledge said in a statement.
470;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-12-14T23:58:05Z;NFL strikes $24bn deal with trio of broadcasters;Games rank among the most popular broadcasts;The National Football League has renewed its deals with three big free-to-air US broadcasters in a move that will cement its games as the most popular, and most expensive, programming on television today.The NFL will earn an estimated $24bn over nine years as CBS, Comcast’s NBC and News Corp’s Fox continue to show games through to the 2022 season, an unusually long duration for such deals that signals the importance of live sports to the broadcast networks.The networks will each pay the NFL between $950m and $1.1bn a year starting in 2014. Those fees come on top of existing deals the NFL has with ESPN, owned by Disney, and DirecTV, the satellite television provider. Taken together, the NFL is poised to take in about $6bn from broadcast rights each year, starting in 2014.“ The National Football League is the greatest television property in the world,” said David Hill, chairman of Fox Sports Media Group.The deals, when added together, represent an increase of nearly 65 per cent over the current agreements. Earlier this year, ESPN extended its contract for the NFL’s premiere Monday Night Football programme at a cost of $15.2bn for eight years, a 70 per cent increase over its previous deal.Prices for sports rights have been rising quickly as live events continue to be a big draw for viewers and advertisers in the age of on-demand shows and Netflix. Yet the fees have become so high that many wonder whether such deals make economic sense.“The rights fees are rising surprisingly fast,” said Adam Chase of Dow Lohnes, a law firm specialising in sports and media. “I’m not so sure they will be anything other than pure loss leaders.”NFL games consistently rank among the most popular broadcasts each week they air, according to Nielsen. “The NFL will beat anything,” said Mr Chase. “It is the most DVR-proof, the most – ‘you need to see it when it happens’ – thing there is. Nothing takes the place of live sports.”The agreements will also see the Super Bowl rotate among the three free-to-air broadcast networks. This year’s Super Bowl between the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers was the most watched US programme ever, drawing 111m viewers. “No other franchise delivers ratings the way an NFL game does,” said Les Moonves, CBS chief executive.The NFL is the only one of the major US sports leagues that makes so much of its content available on free-to-air networks. “These agreements underscore the NFL’s unique commitment to broadcast television that no other sport has,” said Roger Goodell, NFL commissioner.The deals do not cover international rights to air the NFL. “It’s tough to say why America loves football so much,” said Mr Chase. “Especially when no other country does.”
471;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-12-05T20:04:06Z;Verizon carves new landscape with spectrum deal;;"Until last Friday, US telecoms operator Verizon Communications appeared to be the sworn enemy of cable companies such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable.Verizon, already the largest US mobile operator by subscribers through its Verizon Wireless joint venture with Britain’s Vodafone, had been pushing into the cable operators’ territory, offering high-speed internet services, and even its own television service.But last week sworn enemies suddenly became friends, as Verizon Wireless agreed to buy $3.6bn of spectrum owned by a joint venture of Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks known as SpectrumCo. The deal will allow Verizon to bolster its wireless services with new spectrum, which is used to transmit voice and most importantly, data.That alone would have been a significant coup for Verizon. While rival AT&T’s quest to add spectrum through the $39bn proposed acquisition of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit has become bogged down in a legal battle with the government, Verizon’s deal achieves a similar objective for a fraction of the cost.The spectrum Verizon is acquiring will enable it to rapidly expand the rollout of its fourth generation network and provide it with the headroom to accommodate the next generation of data-hungry smartphones.But Verizon and the cable companies didn’t stop with a mere transfer of spectrum licenses. Instead they announced extensive reselling arrangements that will allow Comcast and Time Warner Cable to offer their customers Verizon Wireless service. And in markets where Verizon does not yet have its own television product, it can resell cable services from Comcast and Time Warner Cable.The result is a reshaped competitive landscape where cable and telecoms companies will be competing in some markets, but co-operating just miles away. Commenting on the announcement, Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett titled his note: “The End of the World as We Know It”.Ever since AT&T announced its planned acquisition of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile unit nine months ago, Verizon Communications has remained carefully aloof from the debate over the merits of the proposed $39bn deal.Now as AT&T struggles to keep its deal afloat in the face of regulatory opposition, Verizon has produced an acquisition of its own.The driving force behind both deals the growing appetite for wireless spectrum. While wireless communications was mostly about voice calls and text messages, there was generally enough spectrum to go around.But the advent of data hungry smartphones and tablet computers has sent a shockwave through the industry. AT&T saw data usage surge after the iPhone was launched in 2007.While the company has tried to accommodate this surge in demand by upgrading its network technology, it admits that it has struggled to keep pace.The acquisition of T-Mobile USA would provide it with the spectrum it says it needs to improve its services.However, the US justice department believes the deal would reduce competition and stifle innovation, while the Federal Communications Commission believes that the benefits of the deal are outweighed by the negatives.While AT&T has temporarily withdrawn its application to acquire T-Mobile USA’s spectrum licences, the DoJ’s case will be heard in court in February.Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest US cable companies, now have the nation’s leading wireless provider as a partner; one of the main benefits of the deal for them is that it puts to rest speculation that they were poised to build or acquire their own wireless networks.“We’re not going to go out and acquire a wireless player, so it gives us access to the wireless player we feel is the best out there for a long time,” Neil Smit, president of Comcast Cable, said at the UBS Media Conference on Monday.The deal also highlights the different strategies that the US wireless telecoms groups are adopting to deal with what they perceive to be a looming spectrum crunch driven in part by the success of smartphones.US regulators are seeking to free up additional spectrum for wireless communications, but it could be several years before that is available for auction. Verizon Wireless clearly believed it could not afford to wait.As several analysts noted, the spectrum purchase should ensure that Verizon can continue to deliver what it has positioned as a premium network experience to smartphone and tablet PC users.The deal also has knock-on effects for other cable and telecoms companies. Dish Networks, the satellite TV provider, is sitting on a large swath of valuable spectrum. With SpectrumCo’s licenses now accounted for, that makes the Dish assets more valuable. “It makes Dish’s spectrum all the more scarce,” said Stefan Anninger, a Credit Suisse analyst who put a value of about $8.6bn on the Dish spectrum.For Clearwire, another spectrum holder, the deal is a mixed bag. Comcast, which had provided Clearwire’s wireless data service to 35,000 of its customers, will phase it out in favour of Verizon. But just as Dish’s spectrum is now more valuable, so too is Clearwire’s.While no one is disputing Verizon’s savvy in buying the SpectrumCo assets, some analysts wonder if Comcast and Time Warner Cable might have given away too much to a company that remains a competitor.“If cable’s future becomes increasingly entangled with the wireless space, we wonder if an agreement with a company such as Verizon, who’s long term interests may not be aligned with cable’s, makes the most sense,” said Mr Anninger.“It’s too early to tell, but with so many deals and technologies unfolding in the wireless space, we wonder if it might have made more sense for SpectrumCo to keep its wireless space bargaining chip for a bit longer.”"
472;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-12-02T19:18:56Z;Verizon Wireless in $3.6bn spectrum deal;;Verizon Wireless is set to acquire a significant swath of wireless spectrum for $3.6bn, potentially reshaping the US telecommunications market at a time when surging smartphone use is putting new demands on the nation’s wireless infrastructure.The deal for the spectrum, which allows wireless companies to transmit telephone calls and data to mobile phones and tablets, is a coup for Verizon, already the largest wireless carrier in the US, and gives it valuable new capacity that it can use to increase the strength and breadth of its services.The spectrum is owned by a joint venture of three cable companies, Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, known as SpectrumCo.The deal, which Verizon said had been under discussion for months, may also throw a spanner into AT&T’s pending acquisition of T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom, currently under regulatory review.As part of the agreement, Verizon and the cable operators will cross-sell each other’s products, forming powerful new alliances that will offer video, internet, landline and wireless services from a single provider.“This is much, much bigger than just a spectrum sale,” said Craig Moffett, a Bernstein Research analyst. “It will completely reorder the competitive landscape.” Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone, said: “It is great spectrum for us …continuous and nationwide.”The SpectrumCo licences have been largely unused at a time when demand for wireless offerings is increasing rapidly.Verizon in particular is scrambling for more capacity as more of its customers use data-hungry devices such as the iPhone, which the company began supporting this year. “This move suggests their needs are perhaps greater and more immediate than previously thought,” said Jonathan Chaplin, a Credit Suisse analyst.Some analysts thought AT&T and Deutsche might pass T-Mobile’s spectrum to SpectrumCo as a way to smooth over antitrust concerns and allow their deal to proceed. But Verizon’s proposed acquisition takes that option off the table. “It leaves T-Mobile on the outside looking in,” said Mr Moffett.Regulators will still scrutinise the deal, with the Federal Communications Commission having to approve the transfer of spectrum and the Department of Justice conducting an antitrust review.The last big spectrum sale in the US was AT&T’s $1.93bn purchase from Qualcomm, which regulators tentatively approved last month, setting a potential precedent for the Verizon deal. “It’s difficult to figure out what regulators are going to object to,” Mr Moffett said.The deal also puts to rest speculation that cable operators such as Comcast might build their own wireless network, although Comcast and Time Warner Cable will have the option to offer their own branded wireless offerings using Verizon’s network after four years. “With this deal, the cable industry tacitly acknowledges that they cannot do wireless on their own,” said Miller Tabak analyst David Joyce.Tuna Amobi, S&P Capital IQ analyst, said the sale represented a “fairly attractive price”, noting that SpectrumCo acquired the licences at a 2006 FCC auction for $2.4bn.Comcast will receive $2.3bn, Time Warner Cable will gain $1.1bn and Bright House will get $189m.Additional reporting by Paul Taylor in New York
473;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

Players were fighting for more flexibility in their contracts and potential rewards for top tier stars.Players, who had been receiving 57 per cent of league revenues, will now split so called “basketball related income” evenly with team owners. That amounts to a reduction in overall player salaries of about $300m a year, or $3bn over the agreement’s expected 10-year framework.The shift in balance is meant to correct imbalances in the league, which lost $300m last year, and saw teams such as the Miami Heat spend lavishly on stars while smaller market teams were unable to afford the best players.The agreement struck over the weekend will settle the lawsuit players filed against the league earlier this month. Players and owners still have to approve a new agreement on several issues relating to drug testing and minimum player age.“This was not an agreement that was easy for anyone,” said NBA deputy commissioner Adam Silver. “Owners came in having suffered substantial losses and feeling that the system wasn’t working fairly across all teams, and I certainly know players had strong views about expectations in terms of what they should be getting from the system. So it required a lot of compromise from both parties.”Media groups including Comcast, Time Warner and national advertisers will be relieved as they now seem unlikely to face any major disruptions to their programming and advertising plans.The deal will also come as a relief to Madison Square Garden, the home of the New York Knicks and the local television channel that broadcasts many Knicks games. MSG is heavily reliant on the NBA’s success, and saw its stock downgraded by analysts after the union disbanded and the season seemed in jeopardy.Previous sports leagues that have cancelled games because of labour disputes have sometimes found fans in an unforgiving mood when games resume. But early reactions on Twitters suggested fans were pleased with the agreement.When President Barack Obama, an avid basketball fan, was asked what he thought about the deal on Saturday, he reportedly gave a thumbs-up and said: “Good deal.”
475;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-11-20T18:13:12Z;Prospects darken for AT&T’s merger hopes;;When Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, triumphantly announced a definitive agreement to buy Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA business for $39bn in cash and stock eight months ago, most industry analysts thought it was all over bar the shouting.AT&T, the largest US telecoms group by revenue, was so confident of winning regulatory approval for the deal when it was negotiated that it agreed to pay a break up fee of $3bn in cash together with another $3bn-$4bn in other assets including spectrum.But all that changed on August 31 when the US justice department filed an antitrust suit to block a deal that would have created a new mobile industry market leader in the US with more than 130m subscribers, just ahead of Verizon Wireless, the joint venture between Verizon Communications and Britain’s Vodafone group.Today most analysts think there is a less than 50:50 chance that the deal will be completed, unless significant concessions are made ahead of a court hearing in February. Some only give the deal a 20 per cent chance of completion. Bankers suggest that in order to be sufficient, such concessions would have to be significant and include perhaps the sale of spectrum to Metro PCS or another second tier mobile operator.Robin Bienenstock, an analyst at Bernstein Research, says that if the suit goes to court the deal is almost certain to be stopped given a relatively straightforward legal case based on national competition grounds.AT&T and T-Mobile USA, the fourth-largest US mobile network operator, say despite the challenges they remain committed to the deal and plan to fight the DoJ suit which is due to be heard in Federal court in February. Both AT&T and Deutsche Telekom also insist, at least in public, that there is no “Plan B” contingency plan should the deal not be completed.Glenn Lurie, president of emerging devices and resale at AT&T, said during a Morgan Stanley conference in Barcelona this week that he was still confident the deal would succeed. “I fully expect the deal to be done,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “We are confident that we are going to get that done. It is very important to us from a network and spectrum perspective.”But since the antitrust suit was announced, AT&T has increasingly positioned the purchase of T-Mobile USA and its 33m-strong customer base as the “rescue” of an ailing company orphaned by its German parent.“Over the past two years, T-Mobile USA has been losing customers despite explosive demand for mobile broadband,” AT&T said in a statement this week. “T-Mobile USA has no clear path to 4G LTE, the industry’s next generation network, and its German parent, Deutsche Telekom, has said it would not continue to make significant investments in the United States.”For the moment, all Deutsche Telekom will say is, “we still expect the transaction to be approved because we think our reasons for it are good. This deal is good for customers and the market in the US.”But as analysts point out, as long as Deutsche Telekom and AT&T are locked in a legal battle with the US government, Deutsche Telekom is bound by the “best efforts” terms of the deal to neither discuss the possibility of a “Plan B” nor pursue alternative negotiations with any third party.“This enforced silence and legal limbo is a very long way from a comfortable position for Deutsche Telekom, as it remains the reluctant owner of an asset that is deteriorating rapidly in an increasingly difficult US,” said Ms Bienenstock and Craig Moffett of Bernstein in a recent research note.But some analysts believe recent actions by T-Mobile USA have been driven in part by a tacit recognition that the deal is in trouble. In particular they note that T-Mobile USA has stepped up its advertising and introduced a potentially disruptive $30-a-month pre-paid pricing plan.In addition, they suggest that once Deutsche Telekom is free of legal constraints, an alternative deal might emerge. Some believe T-Mobile USA could merge its spectrum with Dish Network, the leading US satellite TV operator, to form a new 4G mobile operator. Another option might be to buy spectrum from a group of leading US cable TV operators, or consider some form of combination with them, ahead of an initial public offering of a combined entity.Fuelling such speculation, analysts note that Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest US cable TV operators, together hold a 20MHz block of spectrum covering about 80 per cent of the US in exactly the same band that is already held by T-Mobile USA.“A deal would give the cable industry a neat answer for 4G,” say Berstein’s Bienenstock and Moffett, “and would provide a clear exit from their spectrum holdings in a way that would satisfy the Federal Communication Commission’s desire to crack down on spectrum “warehousing”.For the moment, there is no evidence that either side of the AT&T-Deutsche Telekom deal are considering such a “Plan B”. But the longer the deal remains in limbo, the more likely that is to change.
476;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Indian TV mogul hopes to channel US viewers;;Subhash Chandra, the Indian media pioneer behind the Zee TV channel, is making a $250m bet that he can get American viewers and advertisers interested in Indian-style alternative therapies and “wellness” programming.The investment will go towards original and acquired programmes for Veria Living, a US cable and satellite channel and website focused on yoga, holistic treatments and healthy eating, and represents the largest such investment by an Indian media group in content for the US market, he said.Mr Chandra, the Essel Group chairman who began his entertainment career more than 20 years ago with one Mumbai amusement park, is using his family’s money, rather than the budget of Zee TV, which is 51 per cent family-controlled. He launched the Veria channel in 2010 with a $100m investment.Part of the new funds will be used to rebrand the channel from Veria to Veria Living to help explain its positioning more clearly to US viewers.“This is the only health and wellness channel in the US,” said Mr Chandra, who practices Vipassana meditation. “This country [the US] produces about 25,000 masters degree holders every year in Ayurvedha [traditional Indian medicine]. They will get a voice, as will the tens of thousands of practitioners in the US.”Veria has had trouble persuading the largest US cable operators, including Comcast and Time Warner Cable, to carry the channel, however, which is now available through Dish, Verizon FiOS and Frontier Communications in just 10m of the 80m US TV homes. Mr Chandra said he hoped to be in 35m-40m US homes by the end of 2012.“Big cable companies were not as receptive as we would have expected,” Mr Chandra said, but Veria was now talking to “all the big cable operators” and to newer digital distributors. Online channels, from YouTube to Hulu, have begun to provide a more viable home for specialist programming, from cricket games for Americans of Indian extraction to documentary films that struggle to get cable distribution.Extra distribution will be critical for Veria to get the Nielsen ratings advertisers demand and to reach Mr Chandra’s goal of the channel breaking even within 24 months.Mr Chandra’s bet on the US market comes at a time when growth in Indian cable TV has slowed. Although no longer growing at 30-35 per cent per year, at 14-15 per cent it still exceeds the growth in US pay-TV and continues to attract investment from large US media groups. India has the world’s third-largest number of homes with pay television, at about 100m, serviced by more than 450 channels.Groups including Disney, NBC, Time Warner, and Viacom have committed several billion dollars to India’s entertainment industry over the past two years.Mr Chandra said the multitude of competitors in India’s television market were losing a combined $3bn a year, making Zee TV “one of a handful” of profitable operators.Margins across the Indian pay-TV market are among the lowest of any emerging market because of rising costs, competition and reliance on legacy analogue networks.These losses would force the industry to consolidate, Mr Chandra predicted, saying that this “cleaning up” would bring annual growth back to the 30-35 per cent rate within three to five years.KPMG India expects the number of TV households in Asia’s third-largest economy to exceed 156m by 2015. India is also expected to overtake China as the largest pay-TV advertising market in Asia by 2017 with $5.6bn in net revenues, according to Media Partners Asia.
477;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-11-11T18:16:35Z;Viacom to switch from NYSE to save fees;;Viacom will change its market listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Global Select Market in a move the media group said would save it significant listing fees.The parent company of Paramount Pictures and MTV has a market capitalisation of $26.2bn and is one of the largest companies in the media sector. It follows rival News Corp, which switched from NYSE to Nasdaq in December 2008.Both class A and class B shares will begin trading on Nasdaq on December 1. Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom and CBS, controls 80 per cent of Viacom’s class A voting shares while holding just 7 per cent of its total equity.Viacom reported net earnings of $614m for the fourth quarter on Thursday, boosted by rising cable television revenues and the success of the latest Transformers film.The two exchanges compete fiercely for listings, and increasingly so since NYSE began targeting web companies, winning listings for LinkedIn and Pandora, that used to be Nasdaq’s exclusive domain. Nasdaq has most recently won Groupon and Zynga.The competition is largely based on marketing opportunities and services, since US stocks can trade in any market and the two exchanges no longer have unique ticker symbols. Four-letter tickers can list on NYSE, and one-letter tickers can list on Nasdaq.Neither Viacom nor Nasdaq would discuss the details of the promotional package but Nasdaq agreed to spend $5m-$8m in advertising on News Corp properties when it switched listings in 2008.Among media groups, Disney, Time Warner and CBS still trade on NYSE, while Viacom will join News Corp, Comcast and Discovery Communications on Nasdaq. Other media groups that have made the switch include Liberty Media and DreamWorks, which is currently promoting Puss in Boots on the large digital billboard Nasdaq owns in Times Square.“Every time Viacom walks out of their offices in Times Square they see our tower. We’re in their face every day,” said Bruce Aust, head of listings at Nasdaq.Mr Aust also said that Viacom wanted to be a member of the Nasdaq 100 index, as did Vodafone, which switched in 2009.Nasdaq still trails behind NYSE by number of companies switching to its exchange this year, with Viacom being the first, while 11 companies have moved from Nasdaq to NYSE. NYSE has stolen some media groups, including Imax, the cinema technology provider.Nasdaq says many switches to their market come in the fourth quarter, since companies have already paid their listing fees on NYSE for the year. The largest companies by shares outstanding – a tier that includes Viacom – pay a higher fee on NYSE, up to $500,000, versus a $99,000 cap for all companies on Nasdaq.
478;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-11-08T11:43:31Z;US pay-TV: don’t touch that dial;Will the internet do to pay TV what wireless phones did to landlines?;"Americans average five hours of TV viewing per day. If time is to be left for work and sleep, old ways of watching must decline as new ones arise. Heavy investment in internet video by Amazon, Google and Netflix surely spooks executives at pay TV companies. Their nightmare scenario: the internet does to pay TV what wireless phones did to landlines.Third-quarter results from the largest TV distributors should ease fears about mass cable-cutting. The big cable companies – Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, Comcast, and Charter – all lost video subscribers, but the declines were lower than in the year-ago period. Telecoms companies AT&T and Verizon added TV customers, and the satellite company DirectTV had a bumper quarter for subs, driven by American football, more than offsetting nasty losses at rival Dish. Nor does competition from the internet seem to be causing price pressure: revenue per user was up across the industry.Still, total 2011 sub growth for cable companies is likely to be less than 1 per cent. Perhaps the internet is stealing marginal subscribers. In any case, the game has hardly begun. There are still fewer viewing options on the internet – pay TV has a virtual lock on sport, for example. And content producers will work to ensure that cable and satellite distributors keep getting the best stuff first, because that is where the money is, for now. They see the internet primarily as a new way to earn revenue from back catalogues.What will happen if, as the options available on the internet increase, viewers leave pay TV in greater numbers? One likely outcome is that broadband access (also sold by the cable and telecoms companies) will get pricier. Video already consumes more than half of internet bandwidth; as that grows, someone will have to pay for it.

479;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast loses more pay-TV customers;Further evidence of trend reshaping cable industry;Comcast, the largest US cable operator, suffered an ongoing loss of pay-television subscribers but gained high-speed internet customers in the third quarter, in a continuing trend that is reshaping the cable industry.Overall revenues rose 51 per cent to $14.3bn thanks to the addition of NBCUniversal, the television and film group acquired at the start of the year, but on a pro forma basis revenue growth was just 5 per cent.“Cable had an outstanding quarter, led by continuing strength in high-speed internet and business services,” said chief executive Brian Roberts. “This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of improving customer metrics, including increased year-over-year high-speed internet customer additions.”Comcast increased revenues from internet serves 9.8 per cent from the same time a year earlier and showed a 40 per cent improvement in business service revenues. “Business services is becoming a significant driver of our growth with annualised revenues approaching $2bn,” said Mr Roberts.However revenues from pay-television were roughly flat and income from telephone subscribers was below analyst estimates. “Despite the challenges in voice, the customer growth metrics looks solid to us,” said Stefan Anninger, Credit Suisse analyst.Overall growth in cable division revenues of 5 per cent was “in line to a touch weaker than our expectations, but in line with consensus and we think very satisfactory,” said Mr Anninger.The NBCUniversal division, which includes the NBC broadcast network, cable networks including MSNBC and USA, and the Universal film studio, reported 4.6 per cent revenue growth to $5bn. “We continue to make progress towards a successful integration,” said Mr Roberts.The cable networks, which contribute the majority of NBCU’s earnings, saw revenues rise 12 per cent to $2.1bn, driven by a 10.2 per cent increase in distribution revenue and a 9.5 percent increase in advertising revenue.“Cable networks drive the profitability of NBCU,” said Mr Roberts, adding that Comcast was investing in new programming and that the results “underscored the strength of the core cable networks business.”The NBC broadcast network continued to struggle but managed to increase revenues 2.9 per cent thanks to higher content licensing revenues. Filmed entertainment revenues declined 7.8 per cent because of weak theatrical releases, but home entertainment revenues were up on the domestic release of Bridesmaids and the international release of Fast Five.When Comcast acquired NBCUniversal analysts questioned whether a cable company would successfully manage the Universal theme parks and eyed them as candidates for potential disposal. But following Comcast’s $1bn purchase of the 50 per cent of Universal which it did not own from Blackstone in June, the theme parks division saw 9 per cent revenue growth in the quarter.Comcast said advertising trends remained strong at the national level but showed weakness on the local level. It also said that ads for the National Football League’s Super Bowl, which will be on NBC next February, were already 90 per cent sold out.
480;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-10-27T16:29:25Z;Time Warner loses TV and voice subscribers;;Time Warner Cable, the second largest cable operator in the US, said it lost pay-television subscribers and voice customers in the third quarter, news that sent shares down more than 8 per cent in early trading.Profits were down about 1 per cent on higher costs, though total revenues were up 3.7 per cent to $4.9bn from the same period a year ago.However, analysts zeroed in on the softening of the company’s subscriber base.“Time Warner Cable’s [third quarter] results are middling, at best,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Bernstein Research. “Subscriber numbers are vaguely disappointing, particularly in phone, where residential net additions went negative for the first time but also in video, where the promised year-over-year improvement in net additions was there, but was marginal.”Time Warner Cable is the first of the big US cable operators to report earnings, and its results could foreshadow similar losses of pay-TV customers for Cablevision, which reports earnings on Friday, and Comcast, the largest cable operator, which reports next Wednesday.While low household formation and a weak economy are weighing on pay-TV subscribers, the continued losses may reignite concerns about so called “cord-cutting”, in which people opt for cheaper online options such as Netflix and Hulu.Time Warner Cable said it lost 128,000 video customers in the quarter, news that follows similar losses in the second quarter, which was the first that the overall pay-TV industry lost subscribers.The company also said it lost voice customers, which surprised analysts. Stefan Anninger, analyst at Credit Suisse, said the loss of phone customers was “somewhat worrisome although we need to better understand today’s result. We would have expected to see better demand.”The loss of video and phone customers suggests the company will look to its high-speed internet business for future growth. Glenn Britt, Time Warner Cable chief executive, has endorsed this view, calling broadband his “anchor product”.“Broadband is a powerful service for which there appears to be unquenchable consumer thirst,” said Mr Britt. “We have a great story here. We’re winning share while increasing [average revenue per user].”The company gained 89,000 residential broadband customers in the quarter, with revenues from the segment up 7.8 per cent to $1.12bn.“Weak results in video and phone leave broadband as the growth engine that, more than ever, is carrying the company,” said Mr Moffett of Bernstein Research. “Happily, [high speed data] has broad shoulders. If broadband is to be asked to carry the company, it seems more than capable of doing so.”Benjamin Swinburne, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the results “reflect a maturing business in a tough economy with a high level of competition, while at the same time consistent profitability, strong [free cash flow] and return of capital levels”.
481;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-10-19T21:32:19Z;Beaten at the buzzer;;Negotiations went down to the wire on October 10 as the National Basketball Association and its players’ union worked to avert the loss of regular season games, which were scheduled to begin on November 1.When NBA commissioner David Stern finally announced the collapse of the talks and the cancellation of the first two weeks of play, a deal between the league and players – who are in dispute over how to split $4bn in revenues – was portrayed as a near miss. Had a deal been achieved, it would have been one of the great last-minute victories for the sport.But despite this public gamesmanship, almost no one who was familiar with league operations believed that a deal was in range. Indeed, for the past few months, the league’s television partners and advertisers – as well as the league itself – had been working behind the scenes to develop contingency plans that accounted for the partial or entire loss of the NBA season.“Most people anticipated that the season would not start on time,” says Jason Maltby, head of national broadcast TV buying for Mindshare, a media planner. “The majority believe that you’re not going to see any regular season in November or December.”Now that at least the first two weeks of the season have been cancelled, the contingency plans are churning into action. The television networks that carry NBA games – ABC, ESPN and TNT – are working to fill holes in their programming. Advertisers are reassessing what to do with their dollars now that the NBA’s desirable demographic will not be so easy to reach.And the league itself is trying to maintain its own operations – including a website, the NBA television network and a robust retail business – and image.“It’s kind of a mess,” says Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.The NBA says it will lose hundreds of millions of dollars due to the cancellation of the first two weeks of play. Local businesses and arenas will feel the effects, too, as fans take their dollars elsewhere. So far no jobs are on the line, according to companies dependent on the NBA. But that could change if the lockout drags on.Media companies are likely to have the most to lose. Mr Swinburne estimates that Madison Square Garden Company, owner of the arena of the New York Knicks as well as the cable network that airs many of their games, could lose about $100m in near-term earnings if the entire season is cancelled.Labour disputes between sports team owners and players can rival the fiercest on-field competition. But as each side works to win concessions from the other – usually in the form of a higher split of league revenues – they risk alienating the fans that pay their bills.After the Major League Baseball strike halted parts of the 1994 and 1995 seasons, fans expressed their displeasure as attendance plummeted 20 per cent when play resumed.At the New York Yankees opening day game, a small crowd turned out, with one fan holding a sign that read: “$hame On You.”The National Hockey League, meanwhile, became the first professional sports league to cancel an entire season in 2004-5. Players were criticised for being greedy, while owners were pilloried by fans for not reducing ticket prices.In previous lockouts, the dissatisfaction has lasted for a few seasons. But in the end, most fans flock back to the games they love.The NBA’s ability to attract marquee advertisers illustrates the influence sports programming has on television today. Networks are willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars for the exclusive rights to air live games. But when those games are unavailable, the networks can be left with much less profitable airtime.The good news for television networks and advertisers is that the first two weeks of the season are traditionally slow ones. “It’s not until you get deep in the season, when you get double headers and national games, that it weighs more heavily on national advertisers,” says Mr Maltby.Yet the advertisers who committed to show commercials during games now face the choice of moving that inventory to other programming or, in some cases, getting their money back.Analysts say ESPN, the all-sports cable network owned by Disney, is well positioned to retain advertising dollars. Because it has other sports programming, it can reach a similar demographic with different shows, even if they are not about basketball.“We started over a year ago and carefully pieced together a contingency plan in the event this occurred,” says John Papa, ESPN vice-president of programming and acquisitions. “It’s a bit of a jigsaw puzzle, with all of the moving parts.”The plan consists mostly of airing college football and college basketball in November, working with advertisers to reshuffle their previously committed advertising.For networks that do not feature sports only, such as TNT, the cable network that shows a mix of sports, dramas and movies, dealing with the delay is a bigger challenge. “It’s not as simple as putting on new sports programming,” says Mr Maltby.Thanks to the NBA’s slow start, the network was only scheduled to carry six games during the first two weeks of the season, and 12 to 18 during all of the fourth quarter. However, during the playoffs, TNT carries 40 games in 40 nights.Contracts between the NBA and TV networks are confidential, but sources familiar with the arrangements say there are provisions for networks to recoup the licensing fees for any missed games, as well as any lost advertising revenues. This should minimise the financial impact on big media companies.“Similar to the NFL lockout earlier this year, we expect all rights fees paid by the network to the League would ultimately be refunded, with interest, over time and would not have any P&L impact,” says Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital.Most vulnerable is the NBA’s own channel, which is carried by some cable operators. It shows about 90 regular season games and six to nine playoff games. “If you don’t have those games, what are you running?” asks one person familiar with the network.Other potential victims are the regional sports networks in cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston and New York. These local networks often carry games that are not picked up by either the big networks or the NBA channel. If they do not have the games to show, they may not be able to command the lucrative affiliate fees from cable operators that make up about 80 per cent of their revenues. News Corp and Comcast, which both own regional sports networks, could be particularly vulnerable.The more pressing concern for the NBA, however, may be a fundamental erosion of support for the game in the medium to long term. A protracted work stoppage could weigh on the league’s brand at the very moment it has hit its stride.The league is coming off a banner year with its best TV ratings in a decade. With marketable US superstars such as LeBron James and Kobe Bryant vying for championships and a burgeoning international audience in China and Europe, the NBA has much to lose if it cannot reach an agreement with its players.“When you come off a season like last year when you had incredible storylines, you never want to give up that momentum,” says Mr Maltby. “It is almost a no-win situation at a certain point. Players don’t play, they don’t get paid. Arenas are empty, owners lose money, and there’s no basketball.”
482;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-10-10T16:49:42Z;Netflix drops plans to split DVD and online;;Netflix has buckled under pressure from investors and customers to make one of the most high profile US corporate strategic u-turns in recent years, backing off from a controversial plan to split its mail-order DVD and its online streaming media businesses.The move is the latest twist in four months of dramatic announcements and corporate restructuring from the company, during which customers and commentators have pilloried Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings over the changes.Richard Greenfield, analyst at BTIG, called the move a “necessary reversal of a bad decision”.Shares in Netflix had fallen 60 per cent since July, as investors and analysts reassessed the company’s long-term prospects. Netflix traded up modestly in midday trading, but the finished the day down 4.8 per cent to $111.62.“They’ve completely alienated their customers at a time when there are strong new threats,” said Shahid Khan, a consultant with MediaMorph. “I don’t think their stock is ever going to recover.”Mr Hastings last month said he would separate the mail-order business, which is declining, into a new company, called Qwikster, and keep the growing online streaming business as Netflix.com. But on Monday Mr Hastings completed an about-face.“There is a difference between moving quickly – which Netflix has done very well for years – and moving too fast, which is what we did in this case,” he said.The plan to split the company followed a price increase in July that caused Netflix to lose at least 1m subscribers. Mr Hastings on Monday said there would be no more price increases.Analysts said the introduction of Qwikster and its quick demise ranks among the more spectacular debacles in recent business history.“This doesn’t quite rise to the same level of self-destruction as New Coke [when Coca-Cola briefly tried a new formula in 1985],” said Adam Hanft, a brand strategist who works with media and technology companies. “But it’s pretty close.”Mr Hanft drew a comparison between former Apple chief executive Steve Jobs, who died last week, and Mr Hastings: “It points to how sure-footed Apple is in understanding consumer behaviour, and how Netflix has lost its way.”As Netflix works to attract new customers and retain existing ones, it is having to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new content deals with television and film studios such as Fox, AMC and DreamWorks. Those costs continue to rise, and negotiations between Netflix and Starz, the premium cable network that owns rights to films by Walt Disney and Sony Pictures, recently broke down.Netflix is also facing fresh competition from the likes of Amazon, which will include a free trial of its Amazon Prime streaming media service with each new Kindle Fire tablet it sells, starting next month. Hulu, the streaming service, is up for sale and has attracted bids from Google and Dish Network.The turmoil has prompted a fresh analysis of the company’s value. “In the long run if they go all digital, the economics may not work,” Mr Khan said. “The whole love affair with Netflix is, if not over, at least tainted.”

Last week, it unveiled a new look for its Video Unlimited service on the PlayStation 3 console that it said gave a more visual and intuitive way of discovering content in its library of more than 40,000 films and TV episodes.As internet-connected televisions become more common through built-in WiFi, wired connections or links to web-enabled set-top boxes, a fierce battle is being waged among makers of television sets and Blu-ray players, console makers, cable and satellite providers and other set-top box manufacturers to sell hardware and streaming content to consumers.IMS Research forecasts that 5.9bn transactions for internet content in the living room will take place in 2016, up more than tenfold from the 563m expected this year.Microsoft’s Xbox Live service also has an advantage over competitors in offering more live programming, particularly for sports. There is easy switching between games, music and video and Microsoft is touting the social features of sharing details of online activities.
484;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-10-05T22:21:13Z;Confessions of a cord cutter;;Like most US children, I grew up watching a lot of television. Saturday cartoons led to after-school specials. Before I knew it, classic sitcoms such as Cheers and Seinfeld were helping me make sense of the adult world. And dramas like The Sopranos and Sex and the City were popular in college, where HBO’s gritty shows appealed to newly independent minds.Later, I subscribed to pay-TV services wherever I lived. Whether it was RCN in Washington, DC or Comcast in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the regional cable companies that control the US market were happy to keep me supplied with a steady supply of ESPN (for sport), CNN (news) and MTV (music).It was an expensive habit. The average premium cable subscription costs about $100 per month. But I never gave it much thought. In the US, cable TV is seen as a basic utility, as fundamental to domestic life as running water.However, when my wife and I moved to New York this year, we decided to try life without it. We figured that between work, a frenetic social calendar and Manhattan’s myriad artistic offerings, we would be pretty busy. And even in San Francisco, where we had paid Comcast $2,400 over two years for a top-of-the-range cable package, we had not watched that many programmes on a regular basis.TV was the entertainment option of last resort, not the centre of cultural life. We decided that if we wanted to watch something at home in New York, we would turn to the web.We still had our 42in Samsung LCD high definition TV set. So, with a DVD player, an Apple TV – which for $99 lets us buy shows from iTunes and access our Netflix account – and some unwieldy wires, we set out to bring the best of the web to our living room.The TV industry dreads people like us. The prospect that consumers might stop buying expensive pay-TV packages in favour of online content – so-called “cord-cutting” – has had the media world on edge for years now, thanks to a heady combination of new tech alternatives and the pressure on US household spending.The second quarter of this year was the first in which the overall number of pay-TV subscribers in the US fell, and lingering concerns about price-sensitive consumers and the plethora of online options has instilled fear in a naturally bullish sector.TV everywhere: To bring TV content to the web, the industry is working to make most shows, and even some live TV programming, available for existing cable subscribers. Progress, however, has been slow.New digital distributors: Online video options such as those provided by Netflix, Amazon and Hulu make it easy to cut the cord. But so far they are also proving a boon to content companies, which are selling shows to these websites for hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The challenge for the TV companies is to manage the new model without cannibalising its traditional structure.Cheaper cable packages: Pay-TV is expensive. So in a bid to make it more affordable to more consumers, some cable operators are beginning to offer cheaper packages that do not include expensive channels such as ESPN.The concern, according to Nomura analyst Michael Nathanson, is that “the emergence of online video distributors like Netflix would lead to the death of the media industry …the killing of the fabulous pay-TV ecosystem that has been very, very good to all.”When I recently told George Bodenheimer, president of ESPN, that I had cut the cord, he looked genuinely distressed.He has reason to be worried. Most households pay for ESPN even if they are not sports fans because cable companies sell “bundles” of channels.By bundling channels, cable operators keep their revenues up and spread the wealth to content companies. The content companies use that money to invest in new programming. At the same time, distributors and content companies are selling demographically targeted advertising. It is this cycle that keeps the entire TV business churning along.But if cable companies have fewer subscribers, cable channels will have shrunken subscription and advertising revenues. That will mean less money to invest in shows and a diminished product that could lead to even fewer subscribers. If enough people start to cut the cord, the economic model supporting the TV industry could quickly fall apart.In some ways, it is easier than ever to cut the cord. In recent years, high-quality content has found plenty of homes online. From free sites such as YouTube and Hulu to pay sites led by Netflix and Hulu Plus, thousands of shows and movies are now available to stream, with new premium content being developed for the web, for instance by YouTube. Apple’s iTunes Store offers most new releases to rent or buy for a few dollars each.Content companies are keenly aware of this. “We are concerned that cord-cutting is going to be a problem,” said Mike Hopkins, Fox’s president of affiliate sales, in a recent interview. “The more you enable it by putting content out there for free without any tether to a pay-TV subscription, the bigger that danger becomes.”The good news for Mr Boden­heimer and his fellow media moguls is that so far, pervasive cord-cutting is still some way off. Despite the second quarter’s modest dip in subscribers, macro­economic factors – including low household formation – may have had more of an impact than tech-savvy penny-pinchers.“It is safe to say that the worries over cord-cutting have now been fully traded in for fear concerning the macro­economy,” Mr Nathanson says. In fact, he notes that many content companies are finding new incremental revenues by selling old content to companies such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.The bad news for the media industry is that it is early days, and this problem is not going to go away. Despite the industry’s best efforts to preserve the value of pay-TV subscriptions, it does not take much effort to find most of what is available on TV online for free or just a fraction of the cost of a pay-TV subscription.Recent episodes of series such as Saturday Night Live and Glee are free on Hulu.com. Popular cable shows such as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from Comedy Central and SyFy’s Alphas, are available online shortly after they air. And with our $10-a-month Netflix subscription, we were able to watch full seasons of older shows including Lost and Arrested Development.We have missed some programmes. The best shows on TV are often found on premium networks such as HBO and Showtime, which have invested heavily in productions and have been judicious about not offering their content on the web for non-subscribers.It was especially painful to give up live sports. For a few months I found myself at the local pub every time there was a game that I wanted to watch. We fixed that problem by buying a $40 digital high-definition receiver, which allows us to watch the four broadcast networks – ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox – for free in HD. Recognising TV’s central place in civic life, US lawmakers have made broadcast TV an inalienable right, mandating that they be carried free-to-air.As well as giving us access to live football, basketball and baseball games, this has allowed us to watch the new autumn shows on the nights they air and make water-cooler talk about big budget productions such as Terra Nova and Pan Am.It takes some organisational acumen to arrange the various cords, remote controls and boxes beneath our TV set. Another big drag is that we have to be proactive in choosing what to watch – one of the great luxuries of traditional TV is that something is always on.And our new-found independence from TV could easily change if we had kids. Nickelodeon, the children’s channel owned by Viacom, is still required viewing, and I would not want to deprive our kids of essential developmental material such as SpongeBob SquarePants.But as cord-cutters, we are not alone. Most of our friends – busy, young, urban professionals – do not pay for TV either. And while it can take some effort to navigate, the web has grown up and now offers a fully fledged rival to the traditional TV experience.Yet some near-term cost savings for viewers could have long-term consequences for the quality of shows, whether on TV or online. If cord-cutting does ever catch on in a big way, studio revenues could shrink, making it harder to finance the shows that are so alluring to watch, whether on 42in screens or on iPads.As one TV executive recently told me: “If everyone cuts the cord, there will be no more premium shows to watch.”
485;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-10-05T17:21:23Z;Hulu to stream Spanish language TV in US;;The large Hispanic population in the US will soon be able to watch many of their favourite shows online as Univision, the most watched Spanish-language channel, will make much of its content available on Hulu, the online video site.The multiyear deal, under which Hulu will pay an undisclosed sum for the content, will represent the first time a significant number of Spanish-language programmes will be available for online viewing in the US, where there are now more than 50m Hispanics, representing a burgeoning new market for media companies.“There hasn’t been long-form premium Spanish-language content available online,” said Andy Forssell, senior vice-president of content acquisition for Hulu. “This is hugely untapped potential.”Some Univision content will be available for free on Hulu.com, while much of it will be made available only on Hulu Plus, the company’s $8-a-month pay service.Hulu is a joint venture of Comcast’s NBCUniversal, News Corp’s Fox division, Walt Disney and Providence Equity Partners, founded four years ago. Earlier this year, the company said it was open to a sale.Univision is the most popular Spanish-language television channel in the US, and the fifth most popular channel overall, after the four broadcast networks of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.“Many people in the US don’t understand the market power of this segment and Univision’s place in that world,” said Mr Forssell.Because Univision’s content has not yet been available online, Tonia O’Connor, its president of distribution sales and marketing, said she anticipated pent-up demand from the increasingly tech-savvy Hispanic demographic. “Given Hispanics’ technology and entertainment usage, we think there’s tremendous potential,” she said“Our content has not been available since its broadcast, so there is going to be significant demand to access this content on the web.”Hulu will integrate Univision content into its existing site, rather than developing a new Spanish-language hub. Mr Forssell also said he would look to supplement Univision content with Spanish-language shows from other content companies.Comcast’s NBCUniversal, one of Hulu’s owners, also owns Telemundo, the second-largest Spanish-language channel in the US and maker of many of the most popular telenovelas, such as La Reina del Sur.Hulu and Univision said the arrangement only covered streaming in the US. Univision also said it had the rights to distribute all its content, including shows it licences from Televisa, the Mexican media company.

Chrome’s global average user share for September was 23.6%, while Firefox’s stood at 26.8%. IE, meanwhile, was at 41.7%, according to data from StatCounter, which predicts that Chrome will overtake Firefox by December.Microsoft is planning to offer online pay-TV services from Comcast and Verizon through its Xbox Live service on its games console, according to Bloomberg. Microsoft has been in talks with almost two dozen providers of music, sports, movies and TV shows in the US and Europe, and may announce an expanded Xbox Live streaming service as soon as next week, sources tell Bloomberg.Concerns are rising over the future for a $12bn plan for Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn to produce iPads in Brazil, Reuters reports. The plan, first announced in April by President Dilma Rousseff on an official visit to China, has run into difficulties due to stalled negotiations over tax breaks and Brazil’s structural problems – such as a lack of skilled labour – government sources have told Reuters.From the FT:
487;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-09-19T13:50:14Z;Tyco set to split three ways to lure suitors;;Tyco International, the US industrial conglomerate, said on Monday that it planned to split itself into three publicly listed parts, a move that could make it easier for suitors to buy the standalone companies.The company is the latest conglomerate to break itself apart in an attempt to expose unrealised value. In the past year, ITT, Fortune Brands and Sara Lee have all adopted split-up strategies.Investors broadly welcomed the plans with Tyco shares rising 2.4 per cent to close at $44.75, giving the company a market capitalisation of about $21bn.However, credit rating agencies were cautious. Both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s placed the company under review for a possible downgrade, noting that the split-up could leave debt holders with claims on smaller companies with less diverse revenues than at present.Analysts said the break-up could make the component companies attractive takeover targets. In recent months Tyco has been linked to takeover attempts by a number of industrial groups, but the sheer size and complexity of the company has stumped suitors.Ed Breen, chief executive of Tyco, said the move was the “next logical step for Tyco”. Over the past five years or so, the company has slowly broken apart a conglomerate structure built since the 1960s.In 2007, after one-time chief executive Dennis Kozlowski went to jail for securities fraud, Tyco split itself into three units: Tyco Healthcare, which is now known as Covidien, Tyco Electronics, now called TE Connectivity, and Tyco International, the industrial portion of the business.In the latest reshuffle, Tyco International will become three separate and slightly lopsided businesses: a US-based residential security company centred around its ADT brand, a non-US-based flow control products and services group and a Switzerland-based commercial fire and security business.“In an environment desperate for growth, we see strategics [have] a bit more urgency [to do deals], and this puts Tyco now squarely in the middle of what should be a ramp in activity,” Stephen Tusa, with JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients.Jeff Sprague, with Vertical Research Partners, in a note to clients identified AT&T, Comcast and Verizon among the potential buyers of the ADT business. He added Schneider Electric, United Technologies and Siemens could be potential buyers for the fire and security business while General Electric or UTC might find its flow control business attractive.The ADT business will have revenues of about $3bn and about 16,000 workers. The flow control business will have about $4bn in revenues and about 15,000 employees. The commercial fire and security company will have $10bn of sales and 69,000 workers.On a conference call Mr Breen told investors that the businesses would be better placed to succeed on their own because they had very little overlap in customers or end markets and “operate with very distinct business models, each with different capital investment needs and growth profiles”.Tyco intends to facilitate the deal by issuing tax-free stock dividends to Tyco shareholders. The company expects the transactions to be completed in about a year, subject to shareholder approval and other conditions.Completing the deal, however, will be costly. Tyco expects one-time transaction costs to total $700m including debt refinancing and restructuring, although that will be partially offset by lower interest expenses and some operational advantages.Tyco was advised by Goldman Sachs and Lazard.
488;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-09-08T23:27:39Z;ESPN extends NFL contract in $15.2bn deal;;ESPN has extended its contract with the NFL by eight years in a $15.2bn deal that keeps live American football on Walt Disney’s sports cable television network.The deal covers ESPN’s prized Monday Night Football slot, one of the network’s most lucrative series and an enduring hit with brands and advertisers keen to target young male consumers.The contract, which starts in 2014 at the end of the current deal and runs to the end of 2021, represents a substantial increase on the previous deal, reaffirms the value of marquee sports properties in a fragmenting media landscape.“On face value, this agreement is about 70 per cent higher on a per year basis than the previous agreement, which averaged $1.1bn per year,” said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst with Nomura.ESPN is paying for a broader portfolio of digital rights to be included in the contract, including 3D distribution on the network’s new 3D channel.ESPN subscribers will also be able to watch live Monday night games on their iPad tablet computers or other mobile devices.The deal also includes international rights to several countries outside the US. ESPN said it would broadcast Monday Night Football and other regular season football games, playoffs and the Super Bowl in 30m households in 144 countries, including Brazil, the Caribbean, Africa, Israel, Australia and continental Europe. “We’ve secured cable’s most valuable television franchise, along with an enhanced international package of year-round multimedia rights,” said George Bodenheimer, president of ESPN and ABC Sports.The NFL contract is one of several high-profile sports rights deals to have been completed this year that underscore the soaring value of live sport to broadcasters and advertisers. ESPN recently captured the live rights to Wimbledon tennis, outbidding NBC, which had broadcast the Championships in the US for the past 43 years.Comcast, NBC’s new owner, has also been aggressively buying sports rights to build up Versus, its sports cable channel – an ESPN competitor.Comcast and NBC recently outbid Disney and ESPN for the rights to the next four Olympic Games, starting in 2014, and extended their ownership of rights to US ice hockey, agreeing to pay the National Hockey League governing body more than $2bn over 10 years.ESPN owns the live rights to most of the big sports in the US and has contracts to broadcast NBA basketball and Major League baseball, alongside its American football coverage.
489;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-09-07T20:11:23Z;Hulu owners should take the money and run;Online content is still a rocky road to profitability;While advisers in other sectors anxiously watch the latest twitches in global financial markets, technology bankers still look confident about the depth of potential bidders’ pockets. Speculation that Yahoo could again become a target after Carol Bartz’s unceremonious exit is a reminder that cash is not an issue for most would-be buyers.In this context, the auction for Hulu, the US online video site founded just four and a half years ago, has attracted offers of $1.5bn-$2bn from Amazon, Dish Network and Yahoo itself. Apple, DirecTV and Microsoft looked at an earlier stage, and according to an AllThingsD report corroborated by one person familiar with the auction this week, Google is still hovering, indicating albeit vaguely that it could offer substantially more in exchange for sweeter content agreements.Yet not everyone is convinced that Hulu’s owners should sell. Hulu was founded by NBC and News Corp’s Fox network in 2007 as an advertising-supported online outlet for their television programming. Providence Equity Partners invested $100m months later, valuing the fledgling service at $1bn, before Walt Disney, the owner of ABC, took a stake in 2009.Its revenues have grown fast, helped by last year’s launch of Hulu Plus, an $8-a-month subscription tier with a wider array of content. Jason Kilar, chief executive, has said that revenues could hit $500m this year, nearly double last year’s $263m.It has been helped by bigger trends. Analysts at eMarketer expect US online video advertising revenues to grow by 52 per cent to $2.16bn this year.But that growth has presented Hulu’s media owners with a dilemma. Its success depends on the quality of the content it offers, but the more shows ABC, Fox or NBC make available online, the more they alienate the cable and satellite companies that pay most of their bills and the retailers still selling their DVD box sets.NBC’s takeover by Comcast, which agreed to take a back seat at Hulu to satisfy regulators anxious about a cable company dictating the future of online video, has only highlighted that tension. Comcast, Providence and Disney are now seen as sellers, but News Corp is said to be on the fence.Hulu is a rare digital success for content owners. For years, critics mocked music companies for not setting up their own download site, letting Steve Jobs’ 99-cent tracks dominate the market at iTunes.Quite apart from the financial returns, which have exceeded expectations, Hulu has given the networks more of a say in how their content is consumed online. Rich Greenfield, media analyst at BTIG, calls the idea of selling now “a mistake of epic proportions”. A mishandled sale certainly risks further empowering a technology giant such as Google, Amazon or Apple just when content companies are fretting that they are already too influential.In the same breath, however, Mr Greenfield notes that media companies have “utterly failed at building their own digital assets”. There are broader questions about media groups’ ability to invent the digital future in-house, and about the sustainability of Hulu’s success under its current ownership.Now, no one is pressing record labels to set up their own digital music store. Instead, the music industry is finally seeing glimmers of growth as competition to iTunes flourishes from alternatives such as Spotify and Google Music. Vevo, the labels’ music video venture with Google, has given them an income stream and a measure of control over online content.The lesson of the past decade has been that content owners’ attempts to keep everything in-house, or to favour one digital distributor, rarely work and rarely last. Hulu has many challenges to crack. It is only at the start of its international expansion plans, and advertising is still an unsatisfactory revenue stream for professional online video.It would undoubtedly benefit from the online advertising clout, mobile device savviness and international brand strength of an Amazon, Google or even Yahoo. The ideal outcome for media companies would be to have three or more strong competitors bidding against each other for their content. Selling to Google, for example, would create a strong counterweight to Netflix and Amazon.Hulu always looked like a temporary solution, a stepping stone to the TV Everywhere promise of making a full programming array available to subscribers on any device, any time.That people are talking about a valuation in the billions of dollars is a remarkable achievement, but joint ventures rarely last. Already, the conflicts of interest are showing. Hulu’s owners should take the money and run, reinvesting it in content that will cut through the digital clutter.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s Media Editor
490;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-09-06T18:14:31Z;Antitrust chief stressed negotiation at DoJ;;After two and half years heading the antitrust division of the US Justice Department, Christine Varney left for private practice only weeks before the DoJ’s momentous move to block AT&T’s $39bn purchase of T-Mobile USA.Now, in her first week as a partner at New York-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore, she has a message for prospective clients as they seek to deal with government antitrust lawyers – be willing to negotiate.“The most common approach that I’ve seen parties take, that I don’t think is fruitful, is to stonewall the government because you don’t want to negotiate against yourself,” Ms Varney told the Financial Times. “The earlier you engage on the government’s concerns, the more likely you are to be able to dispel them and the more quickly you will get to resolution, if they are credible.”With AT&T pledging to make its case in court, Ms Varney will not be drawn on the deal. While closely involved, she departed before the parties began moving towards last week’s denouement.But the DoJ’s quick decision to sue is among the most significant for antitrust enforcement under the Obama administration, which promised a more aggressive stance after the laisser faire years under President George W. Bush.A speedier review was among her goals on joining the division in 2009, she says.“When you dedicate that amount of person-power and analysis to a transaction, in most instances you do not need an 18-month process. We tried to make efficient decisions in all matters,” she says, noting May’s move to block Nasdaq OMX’s attempts to buy NYSE Euronext.Opinions vary about her time at the DoJ. Some applaud her willingness to consider creative solutions, while other practitioners accuse her of overturning decades of well-established practice.Either way, with the White House yet to nominate a successor and her deputy Sharis Pozen now at the helm, her approach should persist for now.Ms Varney, a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, styles herself as pragmatic.“I was interested in setting a course where the division was willing to block any deal that met the criteria of substantially lessening competition, while at the same time recognising that there can be solutions,” she says. “It’s not a binary decision, to block or to let the deal go.”That included a flurry of so-called conduct remedies, which govern companies’ behaviour after a deal’s close.Comcast agreed to license programming as part of its tie-up with NBC Universal, while Ticketmaster committed to share software and open up ticketing at venues in buying Live Nation – both instances where companies were active in countering government concerns.“We found enough credible evidence that this would be anti-competitive and I was prepared to block it,” she notes of the former deal. “Comcast and NBC, to their credit, said: ‘We understand your analysis and we are prepared to address the issues you’ve raised.’ It could have gone the other way. They could have said: ‘We disagree.’”Small deals also provoked unusual results. Having challenged the $3m acquisition of a Virginia poultry processing plant by George’s, the chicken company, the DoJ acquiesced, provided the company installed a special freezer and deboning equipment.“There is obviously a threshold for what is an appropriate use of government resources,” says Ms Varney. “But the size of the deal does not drive the antitrust analysis. If a deal is anti-competitive, the government should approach it with the same amount of rigour.”At Cravath, her diary is filling up despite US ethics rules that bar her from representing clients before the DoJ for two years.The firm already has a highly rated antitrust group, despite no Washington office, and Ms Varney’s move up the east coast is a long-promised concession to her husband of 27 years.“There are already a number of clients who are eager to get the benefit of her insight and experience,” says presiding partner Evan Chesler. “She is going to be quite busy from the time she arrives.”So will the lawyers she leaves behind. However, Express Scripts controversial $29bn purchase of rival Medco will be considered by the FTC.Ms Varney bats away talk of friction between the bodies. Nor does she see a notable rise in companies in relatively consolidated industries opting to take a punt on antitrust approval.“It has always happened over the course of history,” she says. “Sometimes companies, as you would say of people, are not very self-aware.”
491;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:22:32+0000;Political tinge to DoJ’s move to block AT&T;;The announcement by the Department of Justice on Wednesday challenging AT&T’s takeover of T-Mobile USA came with much of the usual criticism of such deals – that it would lessen competition and hurt consumers.But the decision was also delivered with a political tinge, with James Cole, the deputy attorney-general, saying: “We see this as a move that will help protect jobs in the economy, not a move that’s going to in any way reduce them.”He said: “The general experience with mergers is that there is what’s called efficiencies, which is redundancies when the two companies come together, which usually reduces jobs, in our experience.”Coincidentally or not, such a rationale dovetails perfectly with the agenda of the Obama administration, which is focused on how to create, and protect, jobs, at a time of persistent high unemployment.The timing took some by surprise, as did the DoJ’s decision not to proceed in concert with the Federal Communications Commission.“It looked like the process was still midstream in terms of document production at the FCC,” said Andrew Lipman, partner and head of telecoms practice at Bingham McCutchen.The usual practice in recent antitrust cases has been that the parties discuss potential objections, with the DoJ and FCC offering possible remedies to be met for the deal to go through.The DoJ under Christine Varney demonstrated a willingness to negotiate substantial and creative agreements as part of waving deals through, including in Ticketmaster’s acquisition of Live Nation and in Comcast’s purchase of NBC Universal.This approach prompted some critics to accuse the DoJ of being soft on antitrust issues. Ms Varney left the DoJ in early August.In February 2009, Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticketing service, looked to acquire Live Nation, the world’s biggest promoter of concerts, a deal approved with provisos.In January, Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal to create a $30bn media business was approved by the DoJ, also with heavy remedies. For example, Comcast’s rivals retained access to NBC Universal’s programming.Analysts said the DoJ clearly wanted to send an early signal to the market that it was going to fight the AT&T merger. It is unusual in a merger of this size and complexity for the DoJ to move so quickly to block it.“Maybe this signals the DoJ doesn’t believe in any solutions, or it wanted to get out in front of AT&T and start negotiations with increased leverage,” said Makan Delrahim, former deputy assistant attorney general for the DoJ antitrust division during the George W. Bush administration.AT&T had tried to sweeten the deal by pitching the extra services it would provide across the country. But the DoJ came to the conclusion that it “could obtain substantially the same network enhancements … if it simply invested in its own network without eliminating a close competitor”.AT&T is expected to fight the DoJ’s assessment that the merger would create “higher prices, fewer choices and lower-quality products for mobile wireless services”. But a year-long litigation process has the potential to do serious damage to both companies involved in the deal.Other commentators were more sceptical about the impact of the DoJ’s announcement. “I don’t think this makes a lot of difference,” said David Balto, of the Center for American Progress and an antitrust lawyer. “This just means they are going to resolve the merger issues as part of litigation, it doesn’t change deal dynamics at all.”
492;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Clearwire shares jump on investment talk;;Shares in Clearwire jumped 30 per cent amid reports that the company’s existing shareholders, which include Sprint Nextel and leading cable television companies, are considering a new round of investment or a buy-out of the cash-strapped US wireless broadband data network operator.The discussions, first reported by Bloomberg, are believed to be focused on raising sufficient new funds to enable struggling Clearwire to continue the roll-out of its 4G wireless network and make the switch from WiMax technology to a rival 4G technology called LTE favoured by most mobile network operators.“The structure of such a deal is unknown at this point but could include cable companies providing financing to Sprint to buy out Clearwire or direct financing for Clearwire,” wrote Stefan Anninger, an analyst with Credit Suisse, in a note to investors.“At this point, it is also unclear how large a deal would be. Clearwire’s market cap is about $2bn but it also has funding needs of about $1bn or more.”Jonathan Chaplin, another analyst with Credit Suisse, said: “Apparently one option that has been discussed is that the cable companies would contribute their spectrum, their Clearwire stakes, and possibly some cash in exchange for an equity stake in Sprint [possibly as much as 20 per cent]. If this occurred, Sprint would have a 65 per cent stake in Clearwire.” Sprint would then probably end up acquiring the rest of Clearwire’s equity, he said.Clearwire has said it needs to raise about $1bn to finance ongoing operations and said that the switch to LTE will cost about $600m.Neither Sprint Nextel nor Clearwire have acknowledged the discussions. Cable TV company Comcast also declined to comment. The discussions are not thought to involve Clearwire itself at this stage.One possible outcome of the talks, which are said to be at an early stage, would be for Sprint Nextel, which owns a 54 per cent stake in Clearwire, to buy the shares it does not already own, perhaps with additional funding from its cable partners, led by Comcast and Time Warner Cable.Such a move would also provide Sprint Nextel with access to Clearwire’s extensive spectrum portfolio at a time when mobile data usage is soaring, driven mainly by smartphones.Similarly, the cable companies, led by Comcast, are keen to continue to offer wireless service through Clearwire to enhance their bundled voice, data and video services.However, such a deal might further complicate Sprint Nextel’s relationship with LightSquared, which is building a rival 4G wholesale network based on LTE. Sprint Nextel recently signed a network-sharing deal with LightSquared, which is backed by Harbinger Capital.Dan Hesse, Sprint Nextel’s chief executive, has promised investors that the company will soon lay out its strategy for competing in the 4G market against Verizon Wireless and AT&T, which are both building LTE networks.AT&T’s proposed $39bn purchase of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit has highlighted the growing shortage of spectrum in the US market.
493;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-08-16T20:30:51Z;Google secures place in US viewers’ homes;;Google’s efforts to get into the television business have so far fallen flat.Its much-hyped Google TV initiative, launched last year, fizzled out amid poor consumer reviews and a lack of partnership with the big cable operators.But with the acquisition of Motorola Mobility on Monday, the internet company has bought its way into tens of millions of US living rooms.Motorola Mobility is the second-largest maker of the set-top boxes that US cable operators lend out to subscribers, and Google is poised to control the manufacturing of the boxes, and critically, the software that runs inside them.This new role for Google will put it into a complicated and potentially uncomfortable relationship with cable operators such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable.“Google will become not only a potential competitor, but also a major vendor, and potential source of set-top box innovation,” said James Ratcliffe, Barclays Capital analyst.When it was launched, Google TV was seen as a potential threat to cable operators. The product allowed users to access internet content through their televisions, providing them with an alternative to the expensive monthly packages cable operators provide.Google may yet continue to pursue this strategy. To build the original Google TV, the company partnered with Logitech, another hardware manufacturer. It will now have the capacity to build a similar device in-house, which will compete with other devices that bring internet content on to televisions such as Apple TV and Roku.Yet Google is now poised to become a big provider to the cable operators it is trying to disrupt. Motorola Mobility makes the most set-top boxes in the US, after Cisco. While cable operators are trying to develop multi-vendor strategies, they are still dependent on big suppliers such as Motorola.The American Cable Association, representing small cable operators, issued a statement saying it would review the deal to understand the impact on the cable set-top market. ACA said the market has been a source of frustration for many small cable operators “long beholden to the Motorola-Cisco duopoly”.ACA added that it was not clear whether the transaction would make the situation better or worse and that it “will want assurances from Google that it is committed to the cable business model and won’t use its market power to run roughshod over smaller cable operators”.Google’s acquisition comes at a time of significant turmoil in the set-top box market, however. As cable operators move to internet-based delivery of content, they are rethinking the software that lets users browse channels and record content, and working to incorporate applications and internet content into the TV experience.“There’s going to be a significant amount of change on the set-top box and the software that runs inside of it,” said Imran Shah, managing partner at IBB Consulting.With its next-generation Xfinity software, Comcast is moving towards a cloud-based software system that will allow it to maintain more control over the operating systems and include applications such as Twitter and Facebook.However, analysts and executives said Google could initiate much needed innovation in the set-top box arena, which has not developed as rapidly as other technologies.
494;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-08-09T22:13:16Z;Sports network boosts Disney’s performance;;An improving consumer environment helped Walt Disney deliver a stronger-than-expected performance from its theme parks and cable networks, which powered the media group’s third-quarter profits past analysts’ expectations.Revenues for the three months to July 2 increased from $10bn to $10.7bn, while net income rose from $1.33bn to $1.47bn.While the recent downgrade of the US credit rating by Standard and Poor’s has triggered broader market turbulence, Bob Iger, chief executive, said Disney’s businesses had not been affected. “In the past few days, we haven’t seen any change in the performance of our parks and resorts, advertising and consumer-facing businesses,” he said.ESPN, Disney’s sports cable network, was a standout performer, although advertising revenue was flat, with higher rates offset by the absence of the football World Cup, which occurred in the comparable quarter last time.ESPN is the market leader in sports broadcasting and added exclusive deals to broadcast Wimbledon and Pac-10 college sports during the period. However, the network is facing increased competition – notably from a revitalised NBC, which was recently acquired by Comcast, the cable operator.Comcast has bought the US rights to four Olympic Games, beginning with the winter games in 2014, for $4.38bn and recently struck a deal to broadcast the National Hockey League. Mr Iger said the company was not going to overpay for sports rights as competition increased. “In both cases, we made bids that made economic sense for ESPN,” he said.Advertising rates increased at Disney’s ABC television network, in another sign of a strengthening economy, although these improved rates were offset by lower ratings for the network’s programming.Disney’s global network of theme parks has long been seen as a bellwether of consumer confidence. The division reported increased revenues and a 9 per cent lift in operating income to $519m, driven by the performance of Disney’s parks in California and Florida – although there were decreases at the Tokyo and Paris parks.The Tokyo park was closed temporarily during the period after the Japanese earthquake and tsunami.The performance of the cable networks and theme parks offset a relatively uninspired quarter from Disney’s film studio. Mr Iger said the division had enjoyed “strong creative success” but the films released during the quarter – Cars 2 and Thor – were unable to scale the heights reached by Toy Story 3 and Iron Man 2 in the comparable period last year.However, the fourth instalment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series – Disney’s summer blockbuster – became only the eighth film to generate $1bn in global box office receipts.Disney shares had fallen $0.49, or 1.4 per cent, at $34.21 in after-hours trading.

496;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-08-06T00:38:54Z;Digital deals boost Viacom profits;;Robust third-quarter results for Viacom, the media group behind MTV and Paramount Pictures, have capped a week of strong earnings for the television and film industry, even as shares in many of the sector’s companies have fallen with the broader market.Double-digit gains in revenues and net earnings at Viacom were driven by growth in the fees that cable operators and digital distributors pay to carry Viacom’s shows and movies. Revenues for the quarter were up 15 per cent to $3.77bn, while net earnings were up 33 per cent to $574m from the same time a year earlier.Viacom has joined CBS and NBC in growing more willing to sell programming to new digital distributors such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.“These new digital deals come with very high margin and fortunately for us, there was a lot more room for incremental growth from these types of deals, both in the US and internationally,” said Philippe Dauman, chief executive of Viacom. “We are talking with a number of new partners who are entering the digital distribution arena.”Such deals, which can be worth $100m a year each, helped Viacom for the quarter.“This is the first example of a cable network business demonstrating clear and significant revenue potential from online distribution of largely library content,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne.Mr Swinburne said Viacom and other media groups will continue to derive increased revenues from such deals. “While these revenues will probably be lumpy, consistent with our ‘connected TV’ thesis, there is likely to be more ahead as new entrants emerge, including moving from library sales to live linear streaming,” he said.The long-term concern among analysts and media executives is that as Netflix, Amazon and other digital distributors have access to more content, consumers will cancel their subscriptions to cable and satellite operators. But in the last quarter, media groups have shown they can benefit from the new competitive landscape.“Right now, we’re in this goldilocks scenario where the media companies are picking up loose change by relicensing old catalogue content,” said Craig Moffett, Bernstein Research senior analyst. “At least so far they believe there is no cannibalisation on their core subscription business.”Viacom said revenues for its TV networks, which include MTV, BET, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, were up 16 per cent to $2.4bn for the quarter. Paramount Pictures revenues were up 13 per cent for the quarter to $1.4bn.CBS, Time Warner, Comcast, Discovery Communications and DirecTV all posted strong quarterly results this week as content owners benefited from new bidders at the table, and consumer demand for cable and satellite subscriptions proved robust.But media stocks were down for the week as investors punished shares particularly exposed to volatile consumer spending. “Right now people are selling stocks indiscriminately,” Mr Moffett said. “A lot of that relates to simple selling indices, especially the consumer discretionary index.”
497;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Discovery and DirecTV increase profits;;Television networks and operators continued a strong run on Thursday as Discovery Communications and DirecTV both reported second-quarter increases in revenues and profits.The results follow a week of similarly robust results from CBS, Time Warner and Comcast, reflecting a rebound in advertising and the rising value of premium original television content.Discovery, the group behind cable networks such as Animal Planet and the Oprah Winfrey Network, reported $1.07bn in revenues for the quarter, an 11 per cent rise from a year earlier. Net income was $254m, a 20 per cent gain, excluding one-off items from a year ago.DirecTV, the satellite TV broadcaster, saw revenues for the quarter increase 13 per cent to $6.6bn, driven by strong growth in Latin America. Net income increased 29 per cent to $701m. But DirecTV added fewer US subscribers than expected as telecommunications companies such as Verizon took market share, causing the stock to fall in midday trading.
498;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-08-03T21:19:02Z;US equities turn positive;;US equities managed to steer clear of an eighth-straight decline, as a late-session rally in technology shares powered the end of the streak.The IT sector led all S&P 500 groups, adding 1.2 per cent. The move was primarily driven by sharp gains by MasterCard and Visa, the payment processing networks.Shares in MasterCard jumped 8.5 per cent to $323.90, after touching a record high of $325. Its arch-rival Visa added 4.7 per cent to $87.48.MasterCard reported earnings of $4.76 a share, well above estimates of $4.23 a share. It said payments on its debit card network surged as consumers used more cash and less credit to make purchases.Tech groups that cater to businesses also saw gains. Juniper Networks, which sells computer networking software, added 3.7 per cent to $23.59. F5 Networks rose 3.5 per cent to $93.35.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 0.9 per cent to 2,693.07, leading the big indices.Strong earnings have been greeted with scepticism by many traders because of reduced labour costs. A survey by Challenger & Gray on Wednesday showed a 59.4 per cent jump in lay-offs this July versus last year, while May showed only a 5.3 per cent rise.But that has actually given a lift to technology groups, the best-performing sector in the past month.The broader S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 1,260.34. It rebounded all the way from 1,238, its low on the day, and also a new low for the year. Its closing level is still below its 200-day moving average, but above the 1,250 level that bordered its overall uptrend since March 2009.Technical analysts said it remained to be seen whether these gains were a bear market correction or the resumption of a bull market trend.“We broke the lows of June, we broke lows of March. You don’t get moves like that without the occasional bear market correction,” said Walter Zimmerman, strategist at United-Icap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the poorest showing, adding just 0.3 per cent to 11,896.44. Selling of large-cap industrial groups suggested “long-term investors were betting on a slowdown”, said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet.The Dow’s steepest decliner was Caterpillar, the manufacturer of heavy equipment. It fell 0.9 per cent to $96.28. Chevron, the global exploration and production group, slipped 0.7 per cent to $102.76.Energy shares were the worst-performing sector, falling 0.6 per cent. Marathon Oil, a refinery group, paced fallers, dropping 5.1 per cent to $27.63.It was downgraded by analysts at Credit Suisse from “outperform” to “neutral”. They pointed to second-quarter earnings of 96 cents that missed forecasts of $1.02, and macro uncertainty. The price of crude oil fell sharply in the US and abroad, with WTI and Brent both seeing drops of 2 per cent on Wednesday.“We believe investors will probably wait for a record of execution … and that looks some way off in these markets,” Credit Suisse said in a note.Positive corporate news provided additional lift. Quanta Services, which provides construction services to power plants, jumped 10 per cent to $18.85 after it raised its full-year revenue forecast to as much as $4.6bn from $4.4bn, citing a strong pipeline of projects likely to be completed as regulatory gridlock ends.Insurance and risk management groups XL Group and Marsh & McLennan also jumped, both citing second-quarter profit boosts that topped analysts’ forecasts. XL shares rose 8.7 per cent to $21.77, while Marsh added 3.4 per cent to $29.45.Media group Time Warnerfell 1.3 per cent to $33.57 after it reported earnings of 60 cents per share. That topped estimates but advertising revenues grew by less than forecast, according to an analyst at Citigroup. “Revenues …were above our estimate,” said Citigroup, “but most of the beat came from films”.Comcast, the cable TV provider, added 0.2 per cent to $22.77. Its earnings similarly topped estimates, at 42 cents a share versus the 40 cents forecast.The maker of Sam Adams beer, Boston Beer, dropped 2.3 per cent to $86.65. It reported a big jump in profit in the second quarter, but lowered its full-year outlook, citing rising input costs. It said it would attempt to pass on price increases to consumers later this year.
499;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
500;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Time Warner/Comcast: strategy matters;Investors have tossed both into the same consumer/media bucket;The market sometimes paints with a broad brush. Consider US media leviathans Time Warner and Comcast, which both reported results on Wednesday. Revenue grew by a 10th organically at both, ahead of expectations, and both beat on earnings. But similarity in the results should not obscure the great strategic difference.Time Warner changed from being a content-and-distribution conglomerate and became a television, film and publishing pure-play when it spun off Time Warner Cable in March 2009. Comcast, which was formerly a cable distribution-heavy company, moved in the opposite direction with the acquisition of just over half of NBCUniversal at the beginning of 2011 (it is set to buy the rest over time). Over a third of revenue now comes from television and film.Investors seem indifferent whether they prefer dull and boring or shooting for the stars. The stability and steep capital costs of the distribution business stand in sharp contrast to the volatility and high margins of content. The market also has failed to decide whether integrating the two adds value. Comcast currently enjoys a slightly higher forward price-to-earnings multiple but, on other measures, Time Warner gets the edge. Share price performance has been broadly similar. From the market top in 2007, total return is only about 10 per cent better at Comcast.A range of explanations may apply. The most powerful is simply that correlation between stocks increases when macroeconomic concerns dominate, as in recent years. In such conditions, investors are no longer discerning and simply toss both into the same consumer/media bucket. This is a humbling thought for the executives who agonise late at night over their strategic options – and for those investors who think strategy matters. But over time, it probably will.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
501;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-08-03T14:35:02Z;Comcast bet on NBC Universal pays off;Integration plan offsets pay-TV sales fall;Comcast’s bet on integrating media content and distribution showed early signs of paying off as the largest cable operator in the US, which recently bought the NBC Universal entertainment group, posted higher revenues and earnings for the second quarter.Overall revenues were up 50.5 per cent to $14.33bn, with net income up 15.6 per cent to $1.02bn.The company’s cable business, which includes pay-TV, high-speed internet, phone and business services, posted revenues of $9.34bn, up 5.6 per cent from the same time a year earlier. High-speed internet revenues were up 10 per cent to $2.19bn, while business services revenues were up 42 per cent to $435m.Comcast shares were barely changed in mid-morning Wall Street trading at $22.75, amid a depressed market.“This business has solid momentum, and we are continuing to build its capabilities for future growth,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive.But the company’s number of pay-TV subscribers continued to decline, falling 265,000 from a year ago. Comcast’s video subscribers remain an essential part of the business, contributing $4.94bn for the quarter. However despite the subscriber losses, revenues were up on fewer customers thanks to new premium cable packages.“Overall, the results look solid, with video net adds weaker than expected,” Credit Suisse analyst Stefan Anninger said in a note. “But NBCU [joint venture] results were stronger than expected.”Comcast closed its majority acquisition of NBC Universal earlier this year, and the television, film and theme park group posted strong pro forma results. Overall NBCU revenues were up 17 per cent from a year earlier to $5.17bn, with cable and broadcast networks up thanks to higher advertising demand.The Universal film studio posted revenues of $1.25bn, up 21 per cent from a year earlier, thanks to theatrical hits such as Fast Five and Bridesmaids.“NBCU results were solid,” said Mr Anninger. “The film unit’s release schedule, drew [revenues] above our [estimates] and the broadcast unit also performed well.”Mr Roberts cautioned investors that continuing to invest in content will require Comcast to take bets by investing in costly content.“This will be some hits and misses and a bit more volatility,” he said. “But I continue to believe that our timing was just right as we have benefited from a much stronger advertising market since we signed the agreement.”Comcast also said it was committed to its theme parks division, which saw revenues increase 22.5 per cent to $147m for the quarter. In June it agreed to buy the 50 per cent of its Universal Studios Florida venture that it did not own from Blackstone for $1bn.
502;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Comcast rebrands cable sport network;;Comcast is rebranding Versus, its cable sports network.To be called NBC Sports Network starting next year, the move positions Comcast to compete more directly with Disney, which owns ESPN, the leading sports media group.Since completing its acquisition of NBC Universal this year, Comcast has indicated it will develop a strategy to compete with ESPN.In June, it paid $4.38bn for the US broadcast rights for the Olympics from 2014 to 2020, and Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, has said he is committed to developing the company’s sports programming.
503;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T17:44:25+0000;Internet launches new episode for TV groups;;The internet was supposed to be bad for the television business. Free online content was going to steal eyeballs away from TVs, depriving networks of their advertising base and cable operators of subscribers.But television has not gone the way of the music business, which has suffered as a result of the web.Mainstream shows produced by the big networks are the most popular content online, and the cable operators are now streaming shows to computers and tablets.Last week, a flurry of new agreements between networks, cable operators and digital video companies revealed a surprisingly dynamic marketplace, where the rules of the US television business are being rewritten on the fly.Television and film studios are cashing in as they sell their content to a growing pool of buyers. Netflix, the leading digital film and TV subscription service, is being challenged by new entrants such as Amazon and Walmart. And cable operators are taking more aggressive steps to protect their business models from the threat of digital competitors.The proliferation of online video choices is resulting in paydays for TV networks and film studios.NBC, ABC and CBS have found new appetite for their huge back catalogue of programmes.In the past week alone, Netflix and Amazon struck deals with CBS and NBC Universal for the rights to stream shows and films such as 90210 and Notting Hill over the internet.“Digital media distribution is an incremental boon to core film [and] TV studio economics,” said Barclays Capital analyst Anthony DiClemente. “Media content owners like CBS continue to benefit from the simple laws of supply and demand.”Mr DiClemente believes Amazon will pay CBS $100m over less than two years, and that CBS is receiving $200m from Netflix for a two-year deal. Other networks and film studios are striking similar deals with online distributors, finding new value in their old shows, and he believes more deals with the likes of Google, Microsoft and Facebook are on the way.Netflix, with more than 25m subscribers and a vast library of content, is at the forefront of digital distribution.The company, which ruled itself out of the running to buy Hulu last week, bolstered its library and its international prospects when it struck a licensing deal with CBS that would see some of the US network’s programming streamed in Canada and Latin America.Netflix also struck a licensing deal with Televisa , Mexico’s biggest broadcaster, covering about 3,000 hours of telenovelas and other programming.It has exclusive licensing deals with several Hollywood studios, including Paramount Pictures, and is in talks with DreamWorks Animation, the company behind Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, to stream its content when its pay-TV deal with Time Warner’s HBO expires in 2013.But Netflix, once perceived as unassailable, is being challenged by a growing range of well-armed competitors.Amazon is offering online TV shows and films, Google is developing its own TV strategy, although it has had a rough start, and Walmart is investing in Vudu, its on-demand online film service.“Those are companies that have a lot of cash to compete with Netflix,” said Jonathan Weitz, partner at IBB Consulting.Amazon is coming on the strongest. On Thursday, the group struck a deal with NBC Universal to show films including Elizabeth, a move that follows its deal with CBS.The heavy spending by Amazon, Netflix and others is a growing worry for cable operators such as Comcast.After the biggest US cable operators posted an increase in subscribers last quarter, executives and analysts proclaimed that the threat of new digital distributors such as Netflix was overblown.Then last week, Time Warner Cable reported a loss of 16,000 video subscribers in the second quarter.In the strongest sign yet that networks are wary of undermining their core business model, Fox, the broadcast network owned by News Corp, last week took steps to limit the amount of free content it makes available online.
504;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Tech heavyweights line up to woo Hulu;;Apple, Yahoo and Google are among potential suitors lining up to join a bidding war for Hulu, the streaming video service offering access to popular television shows, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times.Representatives of Hulu have been meeting with interested buyers including those companies in recent days, the people said, adding that the site’s owners, including Walt Disney, Comcast, News Corp and Providence Equity Partners, hope to raise more than $2bn.One person who has examined Hulu’s books cautioned, however, that the valuation would depend on the length of exclusive content supply deals its current owners were prepared to offer.Hulu had considered an initial public stock offering at that valuation a year ago, but usage has doubled since and advertising has grown substantially. The company says it is on track to reach $500m in revenue this year.Key to that trajectory has been the addition of the paid subscription service Hulu Plus , which launched since the IPO was scrapped and is approaching more than 1m subscribers at $8 a month. Hulu is understood to be offering a guarantee of five years’ continued access to the major networks’ shows.“We are extremely encouraged by the ramp of this business,” Jason Kilar, Hulu chief executive, wrote in a recent corporate blog. “As Hulu Plus increases in scale and scope, we believe significantly more dollars in aggregate will move to the content community than has historically been the case in the industry.”The transfer from media companies to a technology concern would end potential conflicts among the broadcast and cable co-owners. Comcast recently bought NBC Universal, putting it into more direct competition with the owners of ABC and Fox.It would also allow Hulu to reach consumers on more devices, as an increasing number of people watch video on smartphones and other gadgets.Google sees Hulu as a complement to its YouTube video offering, while Yahoo is also expanding its video presence and creating new original web-only shows as it tries to gain a larger internet audience to compete with Facebook and other sites for advertisers.Apple, which said this week it now has $7bn cash on hand, has seen less growth in its Apple TV business than had been hoped and is looking to bring more mainstream content to that platform, an area of keen interest for Steve Jobs, chief executive.All three potential bidders declined to comment.The people involved in the process said that it was still in its early stages and that the companies had not yet been asked to submit letters of intent to bid.
505;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T17:39:23+0000;Media stocks drag Wall Street lower;;News Corp lost ground as the furore over alleged phone hacking at one of its British newspapers deepened while US stocks were largely flat as investors paused for breath following the strongest rally for two years last week.The media group was down 3.6 per cent to $17.47, one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P 500 index, as David Cameron, British prime minister, said he was backing a public inquiry into allegations of phone hacking at the News of the World.This was the first big share price move since the latest set of allegations surfaced and comes as News Corp is attempting a full takeover of BSkyB, the UK satellite broadcaster. The stock is still up 20 per cent over the year, however.The fall weighed on the S&P media index, which was down 0.9 per cent.In other news from the sector, there were reports that the owners of Hulu – which includes Walt Disney, News Corp and Comcast’s NBC Universal – were committed to selling the video streaming service. Shares in Disney were down 1 per cent to $39.57 while Comcast fell 1.9 per cent to $25.49.But despite these losses, the benchmark S&P 500 index was flat at 1,339.22 overall as traders were reluctant to place large trades ahead of crucial employment data on Thursday and Friday.“The markets are probably just going to bounce around a bit until the employment report later this week,” said Yu-Dee Chang, chief trader at Ace Investment Strategists. “But the report is likely to surprise to the upside and I think the markets will continue up from there.”Sentiment on Wall Street was not helped by the largely disappointing economic news in the session.Data from the Institute for Supply Management indicated that US non-manufacturing business had expanded less than expected last month.The ISM index showed a reading of 53.3 in June, which was below the 54 expected by economists and down from 54.6 a month earlier. A reading above 50 signals expansion.Separate figures from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement consulting firm, showed an 11.6 per cent rise in planned job cuts in June to 41,432 from May’s 37,135. This was a potential worry given the non-farm payrolls report coming out on Friday.Financial stocks were the worst performing as the sector continued to suffer from news in the previous session that Moody’s had downgraded Portugal’s debt to “junk” status.Bank of Americawas down 2.5 per cent to $10.73 while Morgan Stanleylost 1.9 per cent to $22.72.The S&P financial index was down 0.6 per cent but is still up 4.4 per cent from the lows of last week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,626.10, helped by slight gains in the industrial, material and retail sectors. Urban Outfitters was up 5.6 per cent to $30.75 while Caterpillaradded 1.5 per cent to $110.08.The Nasdaq Composite crept up 0.3 per cent to 2,834.02.Many analysts were still confident that the markets would march higher in the second half of this year – even despite the 5.6 per cent gains last week – as they believe that the US economy will start to pick up in the next few months from the “soft patch” of the last few months.We “expect a second half recovery for the equity market,” said analysts at Citigroup. “Strength from corporate America and some resolution on southern European and US debt concerns should lead to equity market gains.”In other news, General Motors was up 1.1 per cent to $31.19 after Morgan Stanley added the carmaker to its “best idea” list, saying share-price declines have made US carmakers more attractive.Walgreen, the pharmacy chain store, was up 1.5 per cent to $43.38 after reporting that same-store sales had risen by 4.8 per cent in June, which was well above analysts’ estimates of 2.2 per cent growth.Shares in Tesorowere up 4.1 per cent to $24.10 after Barclays Capital upgraded its rating on the oil refiner, saying its restructuring will help it outperform peers over the next few years.It has now been just more than two years since the start of the US economic recovery. Of the stocks to gain ground since the end of June 2009, Netflix, the DVD subscription and online video streaming service, is up 603 per cent and Wynn Resorts, the US casino operator, has risen 397.7 per cent.
506;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-07-05T23:08:55Z;ESPN wins rights to show Wimbledon;;ESPN has bought the live US media rights to screen Wimbledon tennis in a $400m deal, becoming the first cable channel to win one of the most coveted properties in sport.The 12-year deal, which ends NBC’s 43-year run of broadcasting The Championships in the US, is indicative of big changes that are sweeping through the US media landscape. Cable channels, such as Walt Disney-owned ESPN, are increasingly competing with the national broadcasting networks for marquee programming.ESPN’s winning bid will also be a blow to Comcast, NBC’s new owner, which has been aggressively buying sports rights to build up Versus, its own sports cable channel.Comcast and NBC recently outbid Disney and ESPN for the rights to the next four Olympic Games, starting in 2014, and recently extended their ownership of rights to US ice hockey, agreeing to pay the National Hockey League more than $2bn over 10 years.Under its new Wimbledon deal, which starts in 2012, ESPN will show all matches live, irrespective of the timezone in the US. NBC has over the years been the focus of criticism for delaying broadcast of certain key matches, such as last week’s men’s semi-finals. ESPN will show all matches, with some re-aired in full later on ABC, Disney’s broadcast network.The value of the deal was unclear although Sports Business Journal, which first broke news of the talks between ESPN and the All England Lawn Tennis Club, estimated the current contract with NBC was worth $13m a year over four years.“Over the next 12 years, we’ll work closely together to move coverage of this great event forward with live coverage on television and using all the latest technologies and screens,” said George Bodenheimer, president of ESPN and ABC Sports.Ian Ritchie, chief executive of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, emphasised the increased live coverage promised by the deal, which would “consolidate our US media rights under the auspices of a single partner. This new agreement will bring increased live coverage of The Championships”.ESPN already owns the live rights to most of the big sports in the US, showing NBA basketball, American football and baseball. The company has also made a concerted international push, launching a UK-based operation and buying live rights to some English Premier League matches, as well as acquiring rights to cricket.

508;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Intel’s back-to-the-future breakthrough;;Intel announced a breakthrough for its Atom processors at The Cable Show in Chicago this week, with the operator Comcast including them in its set-top boxes for the first time.However, it appears Comcast is going back to a previous processor generation for its device, casting doubt on whether this is quite the advance that Intel claims.The new Comcast box, made by Pace, has a 90-nanometre Pentium M-based CE3100 Atom chip inside, introduced back in 2008, rather than the current generation 45nm CE4200. The set-top box includes a new guide and user interface designed to make Comcast’s TV service more interactive, personal and social.“While I don’t want to belittle the achievement of Intel deploying the first x86 processors into the cable [set-top box] market, I was so surprised by the announcement that I called Intel to make sure it wasn’t a typo,” said Stephen Froehlich, senior analyst with IMS Research’s Consumer Electronics group, in a note.“Intel and Comcast have been working together on this project for several years, and developed the market trial set-top-box on Intel’s first [consumer electronics system-on-chip],” confirmed an Intel spokesman I contacted by email.However, Mr Froehlich says this could well mean that the box, known as the Xfinity Spectrum DVR, is only for the market trial in Augusta, Georgia before one intended for a mass rollout is introduced around the middle of next year – and that should include the latest Atom processor. He adds that problems integrating software for internet-protocol TV with the hardware is causing delays to rollouts across the industry.Intel has had more success with internet service providers in Europe to date in getting its Atom processors into living room devices. Bouygues Telecom and Free in France have adopted them in their set-top boxes and Telecom Italia in Italy.Erik Huggers, head of Intel’s Digital Home Group, told me in a phone interview the Comcast deal “legitimises our mission in the digital home, ” with Comcast buying into Intel’s “smart TV” vision of internet connectivity, new operating systems and applications and increased computing horsepower coming to TVs and set-top boxes.He said Intel’s European partners were shipping tens of thousands of boxes a day and there were more deals in the pipeline.“Comcast is the real milestone to my mind – they are the largest service provider in this country and they are going to come out with some new innovations,” he said.A Comcast executive in Chicago told Bloomberg News the new box meant getting the best chip and the best processor to the consumer.That doesn’t seem to be the case with the chip being used in the initial trials in Augusta, but consumers in the rest of the US may reap such benefits in the future.
509;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-05-30T21:44:15Z;US looks at takeover guidelines shake-up;;The US justice department is considering a shake-up of the guidelines used in approving takeovers of US companies, pointing to a possible shift in antitrust policy under the Obama administration.The DoJ is considering revising the so-called merger remedies guidelines to reflect developments in antitrust practice, said people with knowledge of the moves.The update is expected to include a greater discussion of behavioural or conduct remedies, which impose changes on how a business operates on an ongoing basis, they added.US antitrust policy has long had a strong preference for structural solutions, such as the sale of parts of a business. Both the DoJ and the Federal Trade Commission have tended to avoid behavioural remedies, in part because of the manpower required to enforce such agreements.But some antitrust experts argue that the DoJ, under the leadership of Christine Varney, has become more creative in its application of behavioural remedies.The agency approved Google’s purchase of travel search company ITA but imposed conditions, including a requirement to license ITA’s software to airfare sites on reasonable terms and to continue to fund development of that product.Others counter that the agency merely had a run of so-called vertical mergers to consider, where conduct agreements more often form part of the solution.Vertical deals include when a company attempts to consolidate its supply chain or buys a complementary rather than competing businesses. While the imposition of an information firewall in such deals is not unusual, the DoJ has gone beyond that in recent cases, say experts.Those include the approval of Comcast’s takeover of NBC Universal, which involved an agreement to license content to online competitors.The DoJ declined to comment.More high-profile deals are finding themselves at the mercy of competition regulators, as the recovery in mergers and acquisitions activity allows the two antitrust agencies to develop their thinking under the new administration.Nasdaq this month walked away from its bid for NYSE Euronext, after the DoJ said it would sue the stock exchange to stop the deal.AT&T faces a lengthy review in its $39bn deal for T-Mobile USA, while Avis and Hertz are battling over which car rental company will be allowed to buy smaller rival Dollar Thrifty.The DoJ last week moved to block the acquisition of TaxACT, a tax preparation software provider, by H&R Block. It also this month filed a lawsuit to stop VeriFone’s purchase of Hypercom and sought to block a $3m deal by George Inc to buy a Virginia-based chicken processing plant.
510;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-05-20T00:02:00Z;NBC Sports chairman steps down;;Dick Ebersol, the head of NBC Sports and one of the most influential men in the television business, is stepping down after failing to reach a new agreement with Comcast, which recently took over NBC.Mr Ebersol has been president of NBC Sports since 1989, during which time he brought the Olympics and the National Football League to the network. His abrupt departure comes after he was unable to satisfactorily renegotiate his salary with Comcast.The large contracts Mr Ebersol negotiated with sports leagues and the International Olympic Committee came to embody a decades long inflation in sports rights fees. He will leave at a time when sports programming is more important than ever to TV networks, and several large contracts are up for grabs.Mr Ebersol was named chairman of the NBC Sports Group this year, after Comcast obtained majority ownership of NBC Universal from General Electric. The newly formed group included NBC’s existing sports programming and Comcast’s sports-related networks, including the Golf Channel and Vs.Many in the TV business have speculated that Comcast is planning to take on ESPN, the sports group owned by Disney. Mr Ebersol was seen as a key asset for that push and his departure has clouded plans for such a venture.Mr Ebersol will not now travel to Switzerland next month to bid for the rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.But according to a source close to NBC Sports, Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, will make the trip to demonstrate the company’s commitment to winning the rights to broadcast the Games.For all his influence, Mr Ebersol leaves NBC Sports with a patchy record.He brought in Major League Baseball but let it go as ratings slipped. But he also let the National Basketball Association broadcasts go to ESPN, only to see NBA ratings soar.His most enduring success is the development of Sunday Night Football, the NFL’s only game at that time and consistently one of the highest-rated shows each week during the football season.NBC employees said they were “shocked” by the news and that there was no indication that relations between Mr Ebersol and Comcast were under strain.
511;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-05-19T21:34:23Z;US networks vie for $18bn in ad contracts;;Criminals, housewives and dinosaurs will dominate the all-important autumn schedules at the big US TV networks, a blend that has advertisers jostling to secure commercials during the best programmes.The so-called “upfronts”, at which cable and broadcast networks debut their new shows to advertisers and media buyers, have taken over some of the biggest theatres in Manhattan this week.CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox will each sell billions of dollars’ worth of advertising based on these events, as will cable networks such as ESPN and Turner’s TBS and TNT.Advertisers are poised to commit more than $18bn on the basis of the upfronts, a reminder that even as online advertising grows, TV still accounts for the lion’s share of ads business.“We’ve seen a lot of optimism surrounding the television business,” said Barclays Capital analyst Anthony DiClemente. “It should be a lucrative upfront season.”CBS, the network with the highest ratings for several years, is expected to secure more than $3bn in commitments from advertisers, according to analysts, with shows including reality staple Survivor and well-worn crime dramas including CSI and The Mentalist.Fox, owned by News Corp, has the most-anticipated new show in Terra Nova, a science-fiction epic that involves time travel and dinosaurs.Produced by Steven Spielberg and starring cast members from the Avatar movie, the show embodies the increasing overlap between television and Hollywood. Fox is expected to sell $2.11bn in upfront advertising across its line-up.Overall, the big four broadcast networks are expected to take $9.23bn in upfront sales, a 7.5 per cent increase from last year.For the first time, the cable networks are likely to sell as much as or more than the broadcast networks. Credit Suisse analyst Spencer Wang says upfront sales for the cable networks could rise 12 per cent.In a bid to show their growing influence, many cable networks organise upfront presentations to rival the elaborate shows typically put on by the big four broadcast networks.Scripps Networks, which includes the Food Network and the Travel Channel, took over the Cipriani ballroom near Grand Central Station.ESPN, which commands strong advertising rates, thanks its highly rated sports programming, held its upfront at the Best Buy Theatre in Times Square.Networks said they were increasing their programming budgets and investing more heavily in original scripted content.Discovery Communications, owner of TLC and Animal Planet, is set to increase its programming budget from $600m to $1bn.Comcast, which recently bought NBC, said it planned to invest an extra $300m on programming in a bid to revive the network, which has lagged behind in the ratings for years.A renewed emphasis on the Hispanic market was in evidence at several networks. The focus on Spanish-language programming, from ESPN Deportes to CNN en Español, was an acknowledgement by media groups of a large demographic shift in the US.However, many of the shows on display will inevitably be cancelled within months of their debuts, due to poor ratings.“It doesn’t seem terribly different this year,” said Brian Hughes, vice-president of audience analysis at MagnaGlobal, a forecasting group. “There’s a pretty high percentage that do fail.”Media buyers are nonetheless more optimistic than they have been in years.“Two years ago the world was coming to an end – it has now come back,” said Gary Carr, executive director of national broadcast for TargetCast. “The mood is better, and there will be an increase in spending.”Movie studios, auto manufacturers and telecommunications are typically the first companies to sign major contracts with the networks, said Mr Carr.Prices are being driven up by a number of factors, including the proliferation of entertainment options that are drawing eyeballs to online entertainment. “All of that fragmentation bodes well for primetime network shows,” said Mr DiClemente.“The harder it becomes to reach a big audience, the more advertisers will pay to do so when they have a chance.”While some advertisers may cringe at the high prices premium shows are commanding, they can expect to pay 15 to 25 per cent more than upfront prices if they wait to buy ads on the so-called “scatter market”, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne.Advertisers and media buyers braved persistent rain in New York this week to get a glimpse of the new Fall line-ups. They were rewarded by celebrity sightings as stars came out to promote their shows. Ashton Kutcher, who is replacing Charlie Sheen on CBS’s Two and a Half Men,Yet just as some shows will fail to generate high ratings, some of the upfronts fell flat. Turner Broadcasting, which owns TBS and TNT, had an upfront marred by technical glitches so severe that many advertisers walked out.And while NBC is investing in new shows, it put on a notably austere upfront. Instead of renting out Radio City Music Hall, as it has in previous years, it opted for a ballroom at the Hilton Hotel. The stars that did appear were all local, suggesting that the network had cut back on travel and lodging budgets.People close to NBC said it was a sign that Comcast, the network’s new owner, was already seeking to inject a sense of frugality previously foreign to the glamorous world of primetime television, where image is everything.
512;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-05-12T00:06:01Z;FCC official joins Comcast after backing takeover;;A Federal Communications Commission official who recently voted in favour of Comcast’s takeover of NBC Universal is to join the newly integrated company.Meredith Attwell Baker was one of four FCC commissioners who in January approved the combination of Comcast, the country’s largest cable operator, and NBCU, the television and film studio, after a lengthy review.Only one FCC commissioner voted against the deal.In her new role as senior vice-president of government affairs for NBCU, Ms Baker will be in charge of lobbying the government on issues pertinent to the company, such as piracy and labour relations. While Comcast said that it co-ordinated its governmental relations efforts, it said Ms Baker would not be directly lobbying for the interests of the cable operating ­company.Ms Baker criticised the FCC in her comments accompanying the Comcast NBCU decision, saying that the organisation’s “approach to merger reviews had become excessively coercive and lengthy” and that the FCC “exceeded its limited statutory bounds” by setting onerous conditions on the new company.Her appointment drew swift criticism from public interest groups. “This is indicative of the way Washington so frequently works, when high-powered government officials are able to cash in their knowledge and connections,” said Dave Levinthal, spokesman for the Centre for Responsive Politics. “It’s a revolving door straight to the political influence ­industry.”Ms Baker was appointed by Barack Obama, US president, in 2009 and signed an ethics pledge in which she accepted more stringent conditions than had appointees of previous administrations.Comcast said Ms Baker would not be able to contact the FCC regarding the Comcast NBCU merger and would not be able to lobby any executive branch official for the remainder of the Obama administration, including during any potential second term for the president. Ms Baker will, however, be able to contact members of Congress.“She’s still going to be able to play a very prominent and notable role in determining the lobbying strategy of Comcast, which has traditionally been aggressive,” said Mr Levinthal. “With her on board, they will be even more influential.”Comcast said talks between Ms Baker and the company began several months after the FCC approved the deal on January 18. When negotiations began, Ms Baker contacted the FCC’s legal team and recused herself from further matters regarding Comcast.
513;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-05-05T01:43:56Z;Sports viewers boost TV ad revenues in US;;"Rising audiences for sports events are driving a rebound in advertising revenue across US broadcast networks and cable channels, as they approach the annual “upfront” season where media buyers strike deals for new programming.Comcast, Time Warner, News Corp and CBS each cited the effect of sports programming on first-quarter earnings. Time Warner and CBS were boosted by their NCAA college basketball partnership, while News Corp’s television profits quadrupled thanks to advertising on its Super Bowl broadcast and National Football League playoff games.Comcast, the largest US cable group, said ratings improved for National Hockey League games on its newly acquired NBC network, and for its cable sports channels Versus and the Golf Channel.Executives warned that they were alert to the increasing cost of sports rights, however. Sport was “a double-edged sword”, said Chase Carey; costs were a challenge but sport’s appeal only increased when viewers had more channels to choose from and could skip advertising on non-live programming.Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, signalled upcoming National Football League and Olympics contracts were in his sights but he was wary of overpaying.First-quarter revenues at Comcast’s cable networks rose 13.3 per cent. It said “extremely strong” rates for last-minute “scatter” advertising augured well for the upfront period.Advertising revenue at Time Warner increased by 20 per cent in the first quarter, driven by a 31 per cent increase at Turner, and it said scatter advertising pricing was up 20-30 per cent from the last upfront period.News Corp said advertising on domestic cable channels had risen 14 per cent, after CBS said on Tuesday that broadcast advertising was up 12 per cent and scatter pricing up 40 per cent.The advertising revival is making media owners more confident about spending on content. Jeff Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, said investment in programming such as HBO’s new series, Game of Thrones, was “paying off”. Stephen Burke, chief executive of Comcast’s NBCUniversal division, said it would invest $200m in the core NBC broadcast business this year.Media owners were more confident about digital technologies. Mr Bewkes said subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix would complement rather than replace cable or satellite television, but emphasised Time Warner would supply them mostly with older shows. Mr Carey also said Netflix could boost “under-exploited” content libraries.Time Warner’s film studio Warner Bros announced acquisition of Flixster, a social network for film fans, which Mr Bewkes said it would use “to dramatically improve the consumer proposition of owning digital movies”, in partnership with other studios."
514;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-05-04T00:38:57Z;Comcast continues to lose cable customers;;Comcast lost 39,000 cable television subscribers in the first quarter, a development likely to add fuel to the debate over so-called “cord cutting”, when consumers give up pay television subscriptions in favour of online offerings.Comcast’s video subscriber count slipped to 22.76m, almost exactly matching that of Netflix, the DVD subscription and film streaming service, which has 22.8m US customers. Netflix, however, charges just $8 to $15 per month, compared to an average of $71 per month for Comcast.The 3 per cent dip in overall video subscribers was less than analysts expected and marked the company’s narrowest loss in years. It came as the company gained internet and voice subscribers and benefited from the integration of NBCUniversal for the first full quarter.And Comcast managed to squeeze more revenues out of fewer customers. Video revenues were up 1.7 per cent to $4.9bn.Overall, Comcast, the cable and entertainment conglomerate, reported first-quarter revenues of $12.1bn, a 32 per cent increase from the same time a year earlier. This is the first quarter the company is reporting integrated results after its takeover of NBCUniversal, which closed in January.Net income for the quarter was $943m, up 9 per cent from a year earlier. Earnings per share were 34 cents, beating analyst estimates of 32 cents.In an unusual move, Comcast is to hold its earnings conference call on Wednesday morning, the day after it reported earnings. A company spokesman said this was a one-time occurrence, designed to give investors and analysts more time to examine the integrated results.Comcast gained 418,000 high-speed internet customers, and revenues from this offering were up 8.8 per cent to $2.1bn. Comcast also gained 260,000 voice customers, and revenues from this service were up 6.5 per cent to $860bn.NBCUniversal, which includes the company’s cable television stations, the NBC broadcast network, the Universal Pictures film studio and theme parks, reported overall revenues dipped to $4.35bn from $4.9bn last year when NBC generated $782m from programming around the 2010 Winter Olympics.Excluding the Olympics, NBC broadcast revenues were up 4.3 per cent thanks to stronger advertising revenues. NBC’s cable networks, which include MSNBC and Bravo, saw revenues jump 13.3 per cent to $2bn.“The performance of NBCUniversal was led by our cable networks, which posted strong growth across the board,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive. “While we’ve only been operating the NBCUniversal businesses for three months, we’re encouraged by a seamless integration and we are working diligently to invest and build value for our shareholders.”Comcast’s takeover of NBCUniversal marks one of the boldest bets in the media and entertainment business in years, combining the biggest cable company in the US with the group behind some of the most influential television and movie programming.
515;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-04-26T08:54:13Z;New subscribers help Netflix to double profits;;Netflix added more than 3m subscribers to its DVD subscription and film streaming service and pledged to strike more exclusive content deals as it reported a doubling of first-quarter profits.The company has drawn level with Comcast, the largest cable television operator, with 23.6m subscribers to its video service.Much of its growth will depend on international expansion. Reed Hastings, chief executive, in his quarterly letter to shareholders, said Netflix planned to expand into two new markets, following its recent launch in Canada.Netflix has added 800,000 subscribers in Canada and wants to bring its streaming service to other countries to capitalise on growth in online video viewing.It expects to incur $50m-$70m of operating losses in the second half of the year related to a second international market and will explore launching in a third territory in early 2012 given the “high probability of success” in the second market, it said.Netflix is shifting its spending from posting DVDs to subscribers to acquiring new content for its streaming service. “We believe that DVD will be a fading differentiator, given the explosive growth of streaming,” Mr Hastings wrote.Netflix has struck several deals with US broadcast and cable networks, buying full series of popular TV shows such as Mad Men and Glee.It has also taken its first step into original content with the acquisition of rights to screen the US remake of the BBC’s House of Cards before the series is aired anywhere else. The group, which could spend $100m on the House of Cards deal, said it was on the lookout for more exclusive content.“Ideally, we’ll license two or three similar, but smaller, deals so we can gain confidence that whatever results we achieve are repeatable,” wrote Mr Hastings.The company denied that it was responsible for “cord-cutting”, the term given to people who cancel their cable TV subscriptions in favour of online alternatives.“The data show that Netflix is a supplemental channel” to pay television, Mr Hastings wrote. “While Netflix is likely to show huge growth again this year, we think …cord-cutting will be minimal to non-existent.”Revenues for the three months to March 31 rose from $493.7m a year ago to $718.6m. Net income was at the top end of expectations, increasing from $32.3m to $60.2m. Earnings per share rose from 61 cents to $1.14.The shares fell $12.82, or more than 5 per cent, to $239 in after-market trading on investor concerns over whether growth could be sustained.

517;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-04-21T21:39:24Z;Financial arm drives GE earnings growth;;General Electric, the industrial group, beat expectations with a 48 per cent rise in underlying earnings in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by another strong performance at its GE Capital financial services unit.Pressure on margins at the company’s industrial businesses, particularly for energy equipment, was offset by GE Capital’s rebound from the effects of the financial crisis.GE’s shares closed down 2.2 per cent to $19.95 on Thursday.Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, said the results showed that the company had “emerged from the recession a stronger, more competitive company,” adding that its leadership “remain confident in GE’s 2011 framework”.The company also announced the third increase in its dividend in the past year.The results follow strong reports other US industrial groups including United Technologies, Honeywell and Eaton, all of which raised their guidance on expected earnings for the year.GE also reported that its tax rate, a subject of controversy in the US following claims that the company paid no federal taxes last year, had risen sharply.Pre-tax profits from continuing operations more than doubled to $7.4bn, up from $2.8bn in the equivalent quarter of 2010, but the provision for tax payments rose even faster, from $443m to $3.9bn, because of tax payable on the sale of a 51 per cent stake in NBC Universal to Comcast.That left net income from continuing operations up 48 per cent at $3.51bn, and diluted earnings per share also up 48 per cent at $0.31.Keith Sherin, chief financial officer, said he expected the tax rate for GE’s industrial businesses to be about 20 per cent for the year as a whole, and GE Capital’s rate to be in the “mid teens”, compared to 17 per cent for the industrial business and a substantial tax benefit recorded by GE Capital in 2010.As has been the case in recent quarters, the strongest contribution to profit growth came from the rebound in GE Capital, where profit more than tripled to $1.84bn thanks to lower provisions for losses.In the first quarter, GE Capital exceeded the maximum of 40 per cent that Mr Immelt has targeted for its proportion of the company’s earnings, providing a little over half of group post-tax earnings. The company expects that proportion to drop back to the 40 per cent range for the year as a whole.The group’s industrial businesses, which Mr Immelt has tried to stress as more important to the group’s future, posted organic revenue growth of 5 per cent, to $20.4bn, but pre-tax profits were up only 1 per cent, at $2.98bn.Mr Sherin said that in aerospace and other markets where GE matched other US groups, such as United Technologies and Honeywell, it had benefited from the same global market strength.However, some GE divisions, particularly energy infrastructure, generally see pick up demand later in the economic cycle.Energy infrastructure, which includes gas and wind turbines for power generation and equipment for oil and gas production, was the weakest division: profits fell 7 per cent to $1.38bn. The company said prices had been under pressure for wind turbines, and new acquisitions had also squeezed margins.GE has been aggressively adding to its energy equipment business, buying companies including Dresser and the well support unit of John Wood Group. The acquisition announced in March of Converteam, a manufacturer of power conversion equipment, will bring total spending to about $11bn.Mr Sherin said the company planned no more large deals for the rest of 2011.The quarterly dividend was raised by 1 cent to 15 cents a share, payable to shareholders on the register as of June 20. It is still less than half the peak quarterly payment of 31 cents before the financial crisis in 2008.The stock has added 7.4 per cent in value over the past year, compared to a 10.4 per cent rise for the S&P 500 index.
518;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-04-11T22:01:16Z;Telemundo hit taps US Hispanic market;;"A big-budget telenovela has given Telemundo, the self-confessed underdog of Spanish-language US television networks, record quarterly ratings and a platform from which to highlight the way Hispanic audiences are changing the country’s media landscape.La Reina del Sur, which runs until May, has brought in up to 3.4m people an episode, increasing the Comcast-owned network’s 18-49 year-old audience by 40 per cent in primetime. Some nights, Telemundo has notched up rare victories over Univision and English language networks among men aged 18-34.In the process, it has created a valuable property for Telemundo to sell on digital platforms and in international markets.Telemundo’s record ratings come as early census results show that the
US Hispanic population exceeds 50m people. Other media companies are paying attention, with News Corp’s Fox Networks recently announcing plans for a Hispanic entertainment channel called Nat Geo Mundo.“We’ve been evangelising this for years [but] it was up to this point theoretical,” says Don Browne, Telemundo’s president since 2005.As it prepares for “upfront” presentations to advertisers on May 17, La Reina del Sur has given Univision’s far smaller rival a valuable case study in the growth of Spanish-language viewing.Based on a best-selling book and with a known lead actress in Kate del Castillo, La Reina del Sur was “an easy sell” to advertisers, Mr Browne says. The show’s success has already boosted pricing for ads sold in the scatter market and the company expects price increases “in the mid-teens range” in upfront ad sales.In recent weeks, Telemundo has announced product placement deals and online partnerships with big brands including L’Oréal, T-Mobile, Burger King and Chevrolet.The success of La Reina del Sur represents “a coming of age” of a strategy Telemundo launched six years ago, after its 2001 acquisition by NBC Universal, says Mr Browne, a non-Hispanic CBS and NBC news veteran who covered the Falklands War and joined Telemundo after running NBC’s station in Miami.“We were essentially a failing [programme] acquisitions company,” he says. The larger Univision had locked up programmes from Mexico’s Televisa, the world’s largest Spanish language producer, leaving Telemundo to buy from smaller suppliers such as TV Globo in Brazil.NBC invested in creating a studio system for Telemundo “to control our destiny”, Mr Browne says. After “the trial and error of becoming a content provider”, it produces more than 1,000 hours of novelas a year, and 3,000 hours of other programming, making it the world’s second-biggest Spanish-language content distributor.Mr Browne forecasts that the 62-episode La Reina del Sur will be “enormously profitable”, thanks to a combination of upfront financing from Antena 3 of Spain, repeats on its Mun2 cable channel, and “off the charts” international sales to Televisa and others.Telemundo usually recoups about half of its production costs through international sales, which grew by close to 40 per cent in 2010, a year when there was “low double-digit” growth in total revenues and operating profit was the second best in the company’s history.Comcast took control of NBC Universal in January, and the heavily-marketed serial has also excited Telemundo’s new owners about the Hispanic market, Mr Browne says.Telemundo’s task now is to prove that the boost from one hit series can last. “These are people who’ve never tuned in to Telemundo before,” Mr Browne says: “This has an enormous halo effect.”Advertisers, however, have yet to fully catch up with America’s Hispanic population, he adds. “Its economic power and political power is expanding, but it’s also changing the face of television in America.”"
519;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-04-07T23:18:34Z;Google considers bowing to oversight;;Google is close to bowing to government oversight for the first time in order to win approval for a big merger, a move that would allow it to complete its controversial $700m purchase of US travel technology company ITA Software.The development comes just as arch-rival Microsoft is on the brink of escaping the close scrutiny of US regulators for the first time in nearly a decade, a watershed moment in its own dealings with the competition authorities.Google has been discussing terms for weeks under which regulators would let the ITA acquisition go ahead, and an agreement could be delayed further or the internet company could decide to abandon the deal altogether rather than make concessions, two people familiar with the talks cautioned.Under the terms being discussed, the company would agree to license some of its travel technology to internet companies, airlines and others for a set period of time, according to these people. ITA’s technology is used by many leading airlines and online travel sites to handle flight bookings, and Google’s plan to buy the company has stirred concerns about whether it would continue to license it on the same terms.A consent decree with the US Department of Justice, laying down requirements for future licensing, would bring continuing official oversight, although limited to a narrow part of Google’s business.Agreements that impose ongoing monitoring by regulators are relatively rare, although a similar arrangement was put in place recently when Comcast bought NBC.Microsoft reached its own consent decree with the Department of Justice in 2002 after a legal battle that at one stage led a US judge to order a break-up of the company. The agreement, which included requirements for Microsoft to license out some of its own technology to rivals, is due to expire on May 12.Google’s rivals have been agitating in Washington for months for a more extensive antitrust investigation of the company, echoing a similar review already under way in Europe, and the expected end to the ITA negotiations has aroused renewed speculation about whether regulators will use the moment to hint at wider interest in the search company.However, in spite of an expression of interest from a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, which has handled other Google cases, and a fuller inquiry launched by the state of Texas, it is unclear whether either the DoJ or the FTC are preparing to follow Brussels in digging deeper.
520;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-03-27T14:52:19Z;Writing is on the wall for ‘customer care’;;On the lavatory wall of a colleague’s flat in Hong Kong hangs a framed letter. It is written on HSBC notepaper, and dated January 22, 1998. “Dear Sir,” it begins. “Please note that we have had occasion to return your cheque due to insufficient funds in the above account. This state of affairs is most unsatisfactory and the practice of issuing cheques without first ensuring that there are sufficient funds to meet them must cease forthwith, otherwise it will be necessary for your account in our books to be closed.“Yours faithfully, P. Mandal, assistant manager customer deposits, Bangalore branch.”In displaying this letter in such a prominent place, my colleague was seeking to amuse his visitors with its Indian-English verbosity. In reprinting it here, I have a grander purpose. For all its stiff wording, it is the best letter to a customer I’ve ever seen. It sums up everything that used to be good about banking, but which has got hopelessly lost. Indeed, if all bankers still behaved like P. Mandal, there would have been no financial crisis.For him, banking was a solemn matter, where prudence was all- important. In his world, there was none of the dodgy stuff that all banks now routinely engage in: pretending the customer is king while fleecing them if they go into the red, and investing their money in incomprehensible and ruinous financial instruments. Instead, recalcitrant customers were given a thorough telling off – which made them behave better. My colleague tells me that he has, indeed, ceased his unsatisfactory behaviour forthwith: he has not bounced a cheque since January 1998.It all makes one wish P. Mandal had been transported from Bangalore to the London HQ and made chief executive instead of Sir John Bond. The Indian banker would never in a million years have agreed to the £9bn takeover of Household, the US subprime lender it bought in 2002. He would have cast one eye over the loan book with its millions of dodgy customers who could not afford their mortgages and said he wanted nothing to do with them.But it is not just his prudence I like. It’s his writing style, too. Though somewhat pompous, it is short and to the point. And despite its threatening message, it is immaculately polite. “This state of affairs is most unsatisfactory” is a delightful and useful phrase that deserves to be rehabilitated at once.The same day I was inspecting the walls of my colleague’s lavatory so approvingly, I was e-mailed an exchange that had just taken place between an FT reader and Comcast. She had sent a brief message to the cable operator complaining that she couldn’t find out how to get her mobile phone bill itemised. The reply was everything the lavatory letter was not: disingenuous, unintelligent, emotionally incontinent, unhelpful and miles too long.“We are very glad to have you as part of Comcast family,” it began, unpromisingly. The idea that in signing up for an account with a mobile phone operator, one is not merely agreeing to share its airwaves but to share its genetic lineage is most disturbing.The e-mail continued “ . . . and it is our privilege to provide you an exceptional and unparalleled customer service”. This is even worse – a combination of excessive bowing and scraping with excessive boasting, without conveying any meaning at all.“Thank you for bringing this billing concern to our attention, Elizabeth”, it goes on. “Elizabeth”? How dare they? P. Mandal would have had a stroke at such fresh familiarity.“Rest assured that we will properly address the concern by making sure that the best resolution will be provided to suffice your overall satisfaction . . . ”I’m getting restive even typing this drivel out and so you will have to believe me that there are 500 more words of the same, including further apologies, further congratulations and wishes that Elizabeth have a nice day – without actually solving the problem in hand.“We appreciate that you took time out from your busy schedule to share your concerns,” it said. But if they thought her schedule was busy, why did they think she would have time to read so much guff?Finally, the sign off: a first name and a title, Comcast customer care specialist. At last, something with meaning. The author of this reply has proved herself a specialist in “customer care” – a virtuoso at apology and making all the most fashionable noises. The only problem is that there is no need for specialists in this area. Customers don’t want “care”. They just want their bills itemised.lucy.kellaway@ft.com
521;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-03-23T19:59:45Z;US deal remedies offer hope to AT&T;;Conventional wisdom in Washington is that big corporate mergers are harder to get past regulators when the Democrats are in power, but President Barack Obama’s administration has shaken this assumption.Instead of blocking major deals outright it has sought to heavily modify them. For this reason, analysts in Washington are largely sanguine about the chance of AT&T’s proposed $39bn acquisition of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA division securing clearance from the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission.On Mr Obama’s watch, two of the largest and most controversial deals for decades have been approved but with heavy “remedies”, or conditions which must be met by the companies for the transactions to obtain regulatory clearance.“One significant difference between this and the previous administration is that under Bush the DoJ was much more likely to [let a deal] go through unfettered, or challenge it and block it,” says John Taladay, an antitrust lawyer at Howrey. “They weren’t as likely to cut deals. The [Obama] administration has been a little more inclined to accept partial remedies to let deals go through.”Michael Sohn, a leading antitrust lawyer at Davis Polk, agrees. “I believe it is harder to clear a merger without remedies now than it was during the prior administration,” he says.The Obama administration’s record bears this out. In February 2009, two of the largest companies in the global concert business announced plans for a tie-up. Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticketing service, looked to acquire Live Nation, the world’s biggest promoter of concerts. There were specific concerns about the combination of ticketing and promotional services, and it was initially condemned by various lawmakers and musicians.The DoJ eventually approved the deal but with a number of provisos, including the stipulation that the merged entity could not retaliate against any venue owner that chose another company’s ticketing services, and firewalls to protect data flows between the combined businesses.Live Nation also had to divest its ticketing business, Paciolan.In January, Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal to create a $30bn media business was approved by the DoJ but only with heavy remedies. For example, Comcast’s rivals retained access to NBC Universal’s programming.These cases stood in contrast to the easy passage of the two most high-profile mergers during George W. Bush’s years in office. In March 2006, the DoJ approved Whirlpool Corp’s $1.8bn acquisition of Maytag without asking for remedies. A year later, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio merged to form a $13bn company, again approved by the DoJ with no remedies.“The DoJ has seen a pretty significant change,” says Mr Taladay.He adds that Christine Varney, head of the antitrust division at the DoJ, has a very different agenda to her Bush-nominated predecessor, Tom Barnett. “She made it very clear coming in that …she intended to be much more aggressive and we have seen an uptick in investigations of monopolistic practices.”But there has also been criticism that the Obama administration has toned down its initially strong antitrust rhetoric as it tries to avoid criticism of damaging the economy by stifling business.With AT&T’s offer to buy T-Mobile USA, analysts believe the regulators could require divestments of customers or radio spectrum in markets where both companies are in strong positions.These could be expensive remedies, but analysts say that is not at all a worry for the current administration.“The Bush administration didn’t want to impose costs on companies, but I think Varney is willing to impose some costs in order to keep regulatory oversight,” says Mr Taladay.However, the takeover of T-Mobile USA could assist with President Obama’s efforts to increase broadband availability. AT&T is pledging, alongside the $39bn deal, to invest in expanding its high-speed mobile broadband network to cover 95 per cent of the US population.This may be AT&T’s strongest card to play during its talks with the regulators.
522;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-03-22T00:27:15Z;Rajaratnam trial focuses on Clearwire call;Moody’s analyst testifies buy-out was secret;Raj Rajaratnam discussed the details of Intel’s planned $1bn investment in wireless broadband company Clearwire the day after the chipmaker’s board approved the transaction and weeks before the deal was publicly announced, according to recordings of phone calls played at his trial.The calls were between Mr Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group accused of insider trading, and Rajiv Goel, a former member of Intel’s treasury group, on March 20 2008, in which they discussed the deal terms. The day before, Intel’s board had approved the investment by Intel Capital, the firm’s investment arm, in a Sprint Nextel tie-up with Clearwire.In one recording, Mr Goel asked: “Did you digest the information I gave you?”Mr Rajaratnam and Mr Goel discussed Intel’s $1bn investment, the terms of the deal and names of other strategic investors, including Google and Comcast. They also discussed that Clearwire’s board would consist of 13 members. None of the information, an Intel executive testified, was publicly disclosed.Mr Goel, who prosecutors allege improperly tipped off Mr Rajaratnam about Intel earnings and the investment in Clearwire, has pleaded guilty.Defence lawyers for Mr Rajaratnam focused on several news articles and analyst reports in late 2007 and early 2008 that discussed the potential Sprint-Clearwire deal and Intel’s $1bn investment.Terence Lynam, a lawyer for Mr Rajaratnam, asked: “This deal was all over the press?” The defence has maintained that Mr Rajaratnam made trades based on his own research and not inside information.Sriram Viswanathan, an executive with Intel Capital, testified that the stories were “speculation”.The line of questioning, comparing market speculation with company announced facts, is emerging as a big factor in Mr Rajaratnam’s defence.Mr Lynam showed that Clearwire’s stock rose 25 per cent after one news article reported that Sprint and Clearwire were in advanced talks for a deal with financing from Google, Intel and Best Buy.“The stock market doesn’t sit around and wait for public announcement,” said Mr Lynam. “Money managers have to connect the dots, right?”Mr Viswanathan said that before the deal was announced “it was far from clear” that one would be done. The Clearwire deal was announced several weeks later on May 7 2008.Prosecutors have asked the judge to prevent the defence’s use of an audio recording of Ian Horowitz, a Galleon employee, in which he denies having knowledge of having inside information about Cisco System’s acquisition of Starent. The recording was obtained by Adam Smith, a Galleon employee who has pleaded guilty and was trying to record Mr Horowitz in January on behalf of the government.Mr Smith is expected to testify for the government. Mr Smith speculated to the government that Mr Rajaratnam’s source may have been a Cisco employee who used to work as an analyst with Prudential.The defence also seeks to use denials by Joe Liu, who is unidentified, to the FBI that he was part of an insider-trading scheme. A lawyer for the defence also intimated that there is a similar question about evidence related to Goldman Sachs.Prosecutors have alleged Mr Rajaratnam conspired with Mr Liu to obtain information about Synaptics’s earnings before they were announced in January 2009. Mr Rajaratnam’s team has said the information Mr Liu gave to Mr Rajaratnam was already public.Earlier on Monday, Margaret Holloway, an analyst at Moody’s, testified that she received a call on July 2 2007 from a Hilton employee who told her that private equity firm Blackstone Group had agreed to acquire the company. She said that immediately after the call, she told Deep Shah, a junior analyst, about the deal so he could amass information for a committee to assess the impact on Hilton’s creditworthiness.Ms Holloway testified that after she told Mr Shah about the deal, Hilton’s stock price “started to creep up”.Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Shah tipped Roomy Khan, a former Galleon employee, who in turn told Mr Rajaratnam about the takeover. Ms Khan has pleaded guilty and is co-operating. Mr Shah was charged with insider trading. He had denied wrongdoing and remains a fugitive.Prosecutors allege that Mr Rajaratnam bought 400,000 Hilton shares on July 3 and sold them for a $4m profit. Blackstone’s intention to acquire Hilton for $26bn at a 40 per cent premium was announced after market close on July 3.Michael Starr, an attorney for Mr Rajaratnam, referred to six reports published in 2007 in which analysts suggested that Hilton could be sold amid wider hotel consolidation. They also showed that Hilton’s board voted to eliminate its protections against a takeover in March 2007, indicating that the company was readying itself for a sale.Galleon was also increasing its position in Hilton from 250,000 shares valued at $8.9m at the end of March 2007 to 475,700 shares worth $15.9m by the end of June. Mr Starr attempted to show that Mr Rajaratnam could have had multiple reasons to trade the stock.
523;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-03-17T03:13:30Z;Comcast appetite for park assets tested;;Comcast must decide within three months whether to buy Blackstone out of the Universal Orlando joint venture, in the first test of the cable group’s appetite for the theme park assets it acquired when it bought majority control of NBC Universal in January.Blackstone has informed Universal City Development Partners, the venture that operates the Universal Studios Florida and Universal’s Islands of Adventure parks, that it has triggered a clause giving Comcast the first right of refusal over its 50 per cent stake.Buying full control could cost Comcast $2bn, according to Barclays Capital’s $3.9bn valuation of the park operator. Should it decide not to exercise its option by a deadline of June 12, a “drag-along” provision gives Blackstone the right to seek another buyer for the park within 270 days.“We are studying the proposal and considering our options,” NBC Universal said.Most analysts believe it is more likely that Comcast, which owns Universal Studios in Hollywood outright, would allow a sale rather than buy Blackstone out of the parks.“Given that the theme parks business is the part of the NBCU portfolio least likely to generate synergies with Comcast’s cable operations, we would view a [sale] as the best outcome,” Barclays Capital said.A strong year, boosted by the opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter last June, may increase the parks’ appeal to potential buyers. Paid theme park admissions jumped 40 per cent in the last six months of 2010, more than reversing a 5 per cent decline in the six months before the attraction opened.The joint venture reported net income of $148m on revenues of $1.1bn last year.Any transaction may be complicated by the venture’s consultancy agreement with Steven Spielberg, the director of films from Jaws to Indiana Jones, which pays him a share of revenues that amounted to $23m last year.Mr Spielberg can terminate the agreement from 2017, and would be entitled to a one-off payment of $160m to $290m should he do so, the company said in a filing this week.Should control pass to a third party, the parks could lose the right to use Universal’s name and intellectual property, requiring it “to re-theme certain rides and attractions, which would be expensive and time consuming,” the filing says. However, these would be locked in for 30 months after any change of control.

525;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-03-14T17:13:52Z;AT&T imposes usage caps on fixed-line broadband;;AT&T, the US telecommunications group, is to introduce data usage caps for its fixed line broadband customers – a move that accelerates the shift towards usage-based pricing and which could eventually slow the rapid growth of internet video and deter consumers from dropping their traditional TV subscriptions.AT&T’s decision to impose caps on its wired broadband service follows similar moves by other broadband providers including Comcast, the largest US cable TV operator, which imposed usage caps on its broadband service in 2008 but rarely if ever enforces them.From the start of May, AT&T’s existing DSL customers will have monthly allowances of 150Gb (gigabytes) while customers connected to AT&T’s fibre optic U-Verse network will be able to download up to 250Gb gigabytes of data before facing additional charges.“Only video can drive that kind of usage,” noted Craig Moffett of Sanford C. Bernstein in a note to clients. While noting that the caps are high, and the number of customers likely to be affected initially is low he added, “still, the importance of the move cannot be overstated.”If consumers exceed the monthly limits three or more times AT&T said they will be charged at $10 for every additional 50Gb. The company said the new policy will only affect a small percentage of it customers – roughly two per cent – who the company claims use a disproportionate amount of bandwidth.AT&T already caps data usage on its wireless service. Last year, the company revised its smartphone data pricing scrapping its unlimited plan and instead offered customers the choice of a 2Gb service for $25 a month or a $250Mb (Megabyte) service for $15 a month. Customers who exceed those limits are charged for the additional usage.Mr Moffett said he expects the cable operators, which account for the majority of broadband connections in the US, to follow AT&T’s lead and to introduce pricing plans that include download limits for lower end broadband packages.American families watch an average of 157 hours of video every month and each hour of standard definition video accounts for about 1Gb of data download – high definition video is about twice as data hungry.Mr Moffett said the AT&T caps appear set at levels designed to encourage consumers to watch lots of video online, but discourage those considering substituting “over-the-top” online video for traditional ‘linear video’ like TV broadcasts.He said the AT&T move signals that if consumption patterns change and web video begins to substitute for linear video, then the terrestrial broadband operators will simply adopt pricing plans that preserve the economics of their physical infrastructure.“Of course, any move to preserve their own economics has far-ranging implications. Any move towards usage based pricing doesn’t just affect the returns of the operators, it also affects the demand of end users.”
526;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-03-08T23:14:17Z;Pace drops as big US order is deferred;;Shares in Pace lost a fifth of their value as the set-top box manufacturer admitted that a big US customer had decided to defer a large order until 2012, which would limit revenue growth this year.The company, which overtook last year Motorola and France’s Technicolor to become the world’s biggest maker of television set-top boxes by shipments, said the customer had decided to wait for next generation technology, meaning that sales would not be accounted for in 2011.The shares fell 20 per cent to 176.4p as investors reacted badly to the contract deferral, which only emerged in an analyst conference call after Pace had released full-year results. There was no mention of the deferral in the results statement itself.Analysts were also concerned that growth appeared now to be coming mainly from businesses acquired recently such as 2Wire. The California-based broadband router maker was one of three companies Pace bought last year.Ian Robertson, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, said that while Pace pointed to 2011 revenue growth on a par with last year at about 17 per cent, it was apparent that sales in the core set-top box business would be flat.Neil Gaydon, who took over as chief executive in 2006, said conditions across all the company’s markets were positive and that Pace expected to benefit from the push into hybrid internet-enabled pay-TV where it serves customers such as Comcast and AT&T.Pace, which was fined by the Financial Services Authority in 2005 in part for failing to reveal in its results that a trade credit insurance agreement had been withdrawn, said it was disappointed by the market reaction, adding that it had delivered “clear revenue guidance for 2011” and a strong set of results.Analysts said the share-price reaction was overdone but there were lingering fears that Pace’s customers in the pay-TV market would in time be squeezed as, increasingly, consumers downloaded TV programmes and videos over the internet from companies such as Google and Netflix.Pre-tax profits were up 1.7 per cent at £71.1m on sales that rose 17.7 per cent to £1.3bn. Earnings per share fell from 17.2p to 16.1p.Pace proposed a final dividend of 1.45p, resulting in a full-year pay-out up 45 per cent at 2.175p.Pace – which works with more than 160 operators to create digital, high definition, 3D and hybrid set-top boxes – shipped 22.2m devices over the course of the year, up 29 per cent.Additional reporting Masa Serdarevic

528;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-02-24T21:34:20Z;Al-Jazeera in battle for US coverage;;"Al Anstey, managing director of al-Jazeera English, entered Comcast’s Philadelphia headquarters on Wednesday with four cardboard boxes. Inside were printouts of 13,000 e-mails the Doha-based news channel had received, urging the US cable company to carry its signal.The visit was part of a tour that the English language arm of Qatar’s state-funded al-Jazeera Arabic TV network embarked on this week.Mr Anstey, who plans to plant trees to atone for this use of paper, met Time Warner Cable and Cablevision in New York before flying to Washington and the west coast for similar meetings.The broadcaster has collected 40,000 e-mails from Americans who want to view the channel. The support reflects a concerted campaign to use the heightened interest in news from the Middle East and north Africa to tackle al-Jazeera English’s long-standing difficulties in getting US distribution.Al-Jazeera’s US reach extends only to Washington; Burlington, Vermont, and Toledo, Ohio. Just 2m homes in a nation where 115m homes have televisions. Cable companies, Mr Anstey argues, have been put off by political “misconceptions” about its Arabic sister channel.Donald Rumsfeld complained in 2004, when he was US defence secretary, about al Jazeera’s “vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable” coverage of Iraq. Marc Ginsberg, a former US ambassador to Morocco, wrote last month that the Arabic service was more “a fiery instigator of public opinion and less an impartial reporter of it”.But since protests broke out in Tunisia, then Egypt, Bahrain, Libya and beyond, the English language service has seen an eruption of interest. Viewers to its website surged 2,500 per cent at the peak of the unrest in Egypt, and have remained about four times the usual rate. Half of the traffic has come from the US and Canada.Mr Anstey and his team have leapt on the opportunity the crisis has presented. Echoing 1984’s “I want my MTV” campaign, al-Jazeera has peppered its reports with the slogan “Demand al Jazeera in the US”.A social media campaign has won it more than 400,000 Facebook fans and 240,000 followers on Twitter. About 150,000 people subscribe to its channel on YouTube, which the site listed as its 10th most-viewed channel yesterday.The broadcaster has also made its video stream available for free to US broadcasters that lacked its reporting resources in the Middle East.The priority for the channel, which has 1,000 staff, is “to get our content out there”, not to make a lot of money from it, says Mr Anstey, a former head of foreign news at ITN in the UK. He will not disclose what fees al-Jazeera English is seeking from Comcast and others, but says he wants recognition for the integrity and in-depth nature of its coverage.That coverage has faced “very significant challenges”, he says. Three staff members were detained in Egypt, its Cairo bureau was attacked, its signals have been jammed and its website has been hacked.Mr Ginsberg claimed the Arabic channel’s “anti-authoritarian editorial bias” has long angered Arab rulers, and Qatar’s rulers are thought to have faced pressure from diplomats in the region to rein in al-Jazeera’s reporting. Mr Anstey insists that he has seen no interference from Qatar, however.To succeed in the US, he must overcome lingering preconceptions about the channel and the preconception that US viewers care little about international news. On this, he says, recent events give him confidence: “Every bit of evidence we’ve seen contradicts the idea that Americans are not interested in the rest of the world.”Asked what he is most proud of in al-Jazeera’s coverage, he recalls Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian ruler, saying shortly before he fled that he would not stand down: “We just turned up the sound on the protesters in Tahrir Square. You didn’t need much other analysis of what it meant to the people on the ground.”"
529;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-02-16T23:01:06Z;S&P 500 reinvigorated by tech strength;;US stocks bounced to 30-month highs after strong earnings from Dell and a spate of deal activity in the retail and pharmaceutical sectors.Dell led gains after reporting that its fourth-quarter net income had jumped by 177 per cent on last year.The computer maker also posted earnings of 53 cents a share, far surpassing the 37-cents-a-share forecast by analysts. This sent the stock up 11.9 per cent to $15.56, a nine-month high.The news buoyed related stocks. Hewlett-Packard was up 2.1 per cent to $48.99 while Apple gained 0.9 per cent to $363.13. The S&P technology sector was up 1 per cent.That helped the S&P 500 close 0.6 per cent higher to 1,336.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 12,288.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent higher at 2,825.56.The S&P has now doubled since March 9 2009 when the index reached its intra-day nadir of 666.79.Back in the last cyclical low for the S&P in 2002, the index took more than five years to double. This time it took less than two years.In that time, the financial sector has bounced back 175 per cent, the industrial sector has gained 146 per cent while technology stocks have rallied 134.5 per cent.“Back then, we were pricing in Armageddon, whereas right now we are pricing a recovery,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.Also helping to lift sentiment in the markets was a spate of deal activity.Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceutical group, agreed to pay $20.1bn in cash, or $74 a share, for Genzyme in the biggest takeover in the pharmaceutical sector since 2009. Genzyme was up 1.1 per cent to $75.09.Elsewhere, Family Dollar Stores was up 21.1 per cent to $53.25 after Trian, an investment group, made an offer for the discount retailer of $55 to $60 per share, valuing the company at up to $7bn.This is the latest in a series of mergers for Wall Street over the past few weeks. On Monday, General Electric announced an energy acquisition worth $2.8bn. On Tuesday NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, confirmed a merger with Deutsche Börse, the German exchange.The previous weeks saw Ensco, the UK oil services provider, saying it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn while Danaher, the US conglomerate, agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn. Rumours are swirling that Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is in talks with Starbucks over a potential partnership. Green Mountain has gained almost 30 per cent in February to $42.72.Economic news in the session was mixed. Data showed that US home construction had risen 14.6 per cent in January to its highest level since September, in a positive indicator for the downtrodden housing sector. But these numbers were boosted by multi-family homes, a volatile part of the housing market.Separate figures showed that industrial production had unexpectedly fallen 0.1 per cent in January, short of the 0.5 per cent rise expected. But this was mitigated by a rise in manufacturing output, which increased by 0.3 per cent. “More important than the aggregate figure was the report that manufacturing output increased,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Elsewhere, producer price index data showed that wholesale prices in the US had climbed during January to their highest in more than two years, raising possible worries about inflation.Investors were somewhat cheered as minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee showed officials more optimistic about the strength of the US economy. The GDP outlook was revised upwards.In earnings news, Abercrombie & Fitch was up 7.6 per cent to $57.46 after reporting that its profit almost doubled in its fiscal fourth quarter. The clothing chain said business had improved in the US and that overseas revenue had continued to grow.Deere, the world’s biggest tractor maker by sales, rose 2.4 per cent to $95.86 after reporting that earnings had more than doubled in the first quarter.Comcast, the largest US cable provider, reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and said it would raise its dividend by 19 per cent and increase is share buy-back programme. This sent its shares up by 4 per cent to $25.13.
530;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast to raise dividend after strong earnings;;Comcast, the largest US cable provider, said it would raise its dividend by 19 per cent to $0.45 a share and increase is share buyback programme by 75 per cent to $2.1bn on the strength of strong full-year and fourth-quarter earnings.Fourth-quarter revenue increased 7 per cent to $9.7bn, driven by high sales of premium television, internet and voice packages, and strong ad sales on its cable networks, which include Golf and E!. Net income was $1.02bn in the quarter.“Comcast delivered exactly what investors were hoping for, strong fundamental results and an increase in the company’s return of capital program,” said Credit Suisse analyst Stefan Anninger.Philadelphia-based Comcast won approval for its takeover of NBC Universal last month and chief executive Brian Roberts said the first quarter of this year would mark “an exciting new beginning for this company.”Results that include the performance of NBC Universal, which include cable and broadcast television properties, theme parks and film studio, would begin in the first quarter of this year, when the company next reports earnings.Mr Roberts said the company’s greatest opportunity would be to make more of NBC’s television channels. “The cable channels are in fantastic shape,” said Mr Roberts. “The biggest opportunity over the next few years …is the NBC network, where we have some real strength in NBC news and some real weakness in NBC prime time.”Comcast said it lost 135,000 basic cable customers in the quarter, mainly to satellite television providers and rival cable operators.That was down from nearly 200,000 lost cable subscribers from a year earlier, and suggested that widespread “cord cutting” — when customers cancel pay television service in favour of online alternatives — was not a serious threat for now.Instead, Comcast added 292,000 high speed internet customers, what Bernstein Research senior analyst Craig Moffett called “by far the most important operating metric.” As consumers turn to the web for more of their entertainment, companies including Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Verizon and AT&T are vying to provide high-speed internet access.New guidelines from the Federal Communications Commission in December left the door open for companies to start charging users based on how much bandwidth they use. Mr Roberts said Comcast was deploying an infrastructure that would allow for such pricing models, including “meters” that allow customers to see how much bandwidth they are using, but added “we don’t have plans right now for usage based pricing.”Shares were up more than 3 per cent to $25.
531;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-02-10T06:01:51Z;Regulators take wrong path on Comcast-NBC;;"On January 18 as expected, the Federal Communications Commission approved a huge deal that let the Comcast Corporation acquire NBC from the General Electric Company. This deal has been attacked by various consumer advocates as a “Comcastrophe” for tolerating an unholy marriage between a major media company and a huge cable and internet company.Compared to this heated rhetoric, the position of the FCC looks like a model of government sobriety. In good middle-of-the road form, the FCC praised the merger because it would “increase local news coverage to viewers; expand children’s programming; enhance the diversity of programming available to Spanish-speaking viewers; offer broadband services to low-income Americans at reduced monthly prices; and provide high-speed broadband to schools, libraries and under-served communities.”Only then does the other shoe drop: the FCC assured a nervous public that its consent decree contains safeguards to insure that other online video distributors (OVDs) gain access to NBC programming. The deal should, of course, go through. But here is why it was unwise:First, the worry about “high” concentration misses an essential point that I have emphasised elsewhere. This merger is vertical, not horizontal, and thus does not increase market concentration at either the content production or distribution stage. So before imposing these cumbrous restrictions, we should first ask why Comcast would forego profit opportunities its own distribution network gets from independent producers. Or, conversely, why NBC would not provide other distribution networks with its content?Perhaps this merger can’t deliver all the goodies that the optimists predict. But the real question goes not to the merger’s business acumen, but to its antitrust pedigree. Critics fear that Comcast could remove desirable channels or jack up prices. But no company has that kind of market power in a dynamic marketplace. A decade ago, critics prophesised that the AOL/Time Warner merger would dominate information markets. We know how that turned out.Second, it may make good sense for Comcast and NBC to accept the conditions of the deal. But it makes little sense for the government to impose them. Make no mistake about it, this consent decree turns the Department of Justice into the monitor of a quasi-public utility regime dedicated to some version of net neutrality. The deal binds NBC to a comprehensive non-discrimination regime where it has to deal with all OVDs who request its content. Market transactions for these sharing arrangements are complex affairs that must take into account the nature of the content, the sequence of the broadcasting, the peculiar geographical and demographic features of the market, plus multiple other factors that no outsider quite understands.No system of forced purchasers can afford to ignore these differences. Yet, at the same time, no system of regulation knows really how to manage them. The core obligation under the decree is to provide any qualified OVD – i.e., one with at least one deal with an independent third-party or “peer” company – with terms that are “economically equivalent” to those that NBC provides to one of its own preferred customers. What counts as economically equivalent turns on knowing what counts as “comparable,” which unhelpfully covers content that is “reasonably similar in kind and amount” to content received from peer institutions.Third, any public utility-type system imposes heavy administrative demands on the regulator and regulated alike. Once the negotiations break down – as they surely will – the parties have to resort to a specialised, compulsory arbitration regime to settle on price, content and terms. Until these arbitrations gain traction, savvy parties won’t settle if they think (as one side will, and both might) that they can get better terms through arbitration. Yet, the rapid changes in content and technology make it hard to conclude even bellwether settlements. Needless to say, NBC might want to stonewall these negotiations, which is why the decree contains a huge reporting apparatus with extensive record-keeping obligations on Comcast/NBC, opening another window for potential government attack on Comcast/NBC. As there is no real way to limit the number of “qualified” OVDs asking for a piece of the action, the DoJ could easily find itself knee-deep in investigations.Fourth, the consent decree creates poor incentive effects for all parties. Having to share new content without unfriendly outsiders could lead NBC to redirect or curtail its production to limit that risk. Sly OVDs could exaggerate their losses to get better terms. Constant government oversight could lead Comcast to shy away from novel innovations that raise the eyebrows of government officials. High administrative costs could chew up valuable resources.And to what benefit? The Comcast/NBC consent decree seeks to regulate deals whose terms are always on the public record, not to operate some secret cartel. Any bad offer will be pounced on publicly by Comcast’s numerous video watchdogs. So the ultimate question is this: why impose these conditions now? The better strategy is to let Comcast go about its business as it pleases, subject in any future case to general antitrust sanctions. Let a bad pattern and practice emerge, and down the road this consent decree could allow for remedies tailored to those risks. Just having that possibility in the wings is a heavy sanction on any form of present misconduct. Like the European Union, the DoJ has become more proactive in attempted monopolization cases. Those priors matter in treating discrete cases. With Comcast/NBC, it led to a set of remedies best described as too much, too soon.Richard A. Epstein is the Laurence A.

532;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-02-09T02:18:03Z;Olbermann to host TV show for Gore network;;Keith Olbermann, the leftwing talk show host who abruptly left MSNBC last month, will host a new show on Current TV, the cable network co-founded by Al Gore, the former US vice-president.The deal will bring Current TV its first big anchor and the chance to increase its audience, while giving the volatile Mr Olbermann a new home after his hasty departure from NBC Universal.Both parties will have an incentive to make the arrangement work. Current TV is in 60m US homes, a small audience by that market’s standards. Mr Olbermann will become chief news officer for the San Francisco based network and take an equity position in the private company. His hour-long primetime show, to be broadcast each weeknight, will be taped in New York. Current TV does not attract 25,000 viewers in prime time, the cut-off point for a Nielsen rating. Mr Olbermann attracted up-wards of 1m viewers per night in his prime at MSNBC.Current Media, the parent company, was founded in 2005 by Mr Gore and Joel Hyatt, a businessman affiliated with the Democratic party. It has won critical acclaim for some programmes but has not had mass market success. The company does not disclose revenues.Mr Olbermann said Current TV would give him a degree of editorial independence. “Nothing is more vital to a free America than a free media,” he said. “And nothing is more vital to my concept of a free media than news . . . free from corporate interference.”Comcast, which won approval last month for its takeover of MSNBC parent company NBC Universal, owns 10 per cent of Current Media. Mr Olbermann did not address Comcast’s stake or discuss his views of MSNBC or the terms of his exit package.Mr Gore said Current TV was poised to gain market share with Mr Olbermann. “We have more subscribers today than MSNBC had at the time Keith began working for them [in 2003],” said Mr Gore. “We have remained profitable, quite profitable, through the great recession, and increasingly so through the last two years.”The new show has yet to be named and will debut in coming months. “It will be, for all intents and purposes, an improved and we hope amplified and stronger version of the show that I just did,” Mr Olbermann said.His move to Current TV comes the day after AOL bought the Huffington Post, the left-leaning blog network founded by Arianna Huffington, for $315m. “I’ve worked with Arianna many times,” said Mr Olbermann. “I find her an insightful and progressive voice. I hope we have the chance to have her on the show as a guest.”
533;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-02-06T21:02:11Z;Epic film battle on the home front;;A drive around the palm tree-lined streets of Los Angeles provides ample evidence that Hollywood’s traditional business model is in a state of flux.Blockbuster, the DVD rental store which used to pay movie studios hundreds of millions of dollars a year for their movies, once had outlets scattered across the film industry capital. But most have closed and are empty and boarded up since the chain sought bankruptcy protection last year.The company found itself struggling to adapt to technological change and the advent of DVD subscriptions, where consumers pay a flat monthly fee for as many DVDs as they can watch. Blockbuster is working on a restructuring that would see it close most of its 3,000 stores but as its fortunes have declined, other companies have taken its place, offering consumers different ways to rent or buy movies to watch in their homes.Two different models have emerged, each holding promise for anxious Hollywood executives concerned about where the film industry’s future revenues will come from. One is a new generation of subscription services such as Netflix, which has in 10 years signed up more than 20m subscribers to its DVD-by-mail service.Netflix has also invested heavily in a digital service and last year struck a five-year deal worth $900m for the right to stream movies from three studios – Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lions Gate Entertainment.The Netflix streaming service has grown quickly, fuelling a fourfold increase in its share price in 2010. It includes new movies such as Shutter Island alongside thousands of older titles and television programmes.A different model is being pursued by DVD kiosk operators such as Redbox, which offer DVDs of new releases for as little as $1 a day, and companies from the technology and retail sectors such as Apple and Walmart, which are offering digital copies of films to buy or rent, charging the consumer for each individual transaction.Apple is the biggest player in individual digital film transactions, with more than 60 per cent of total transactions, according to IHS Screen Digest, the media research firm. It now generates more money for Hollywood studios than many traditional cable television operators – including Time Warner Cable – and is on course to eclipse Comcast, the cable operator which recently acquired NBC Universal, as the largest provider of video-on-demand by 2014.Meanwhile, Walmart is trying to erode Apple’s lead in the digital delivery of films. The retailer also spends $3.5bn a year buying DVDs to sell in its stores, according to industry estimates. As demand for DVDs falls, it is unclear how much longer this will continue.“With consumer behaviour increasingly shifting from movie purchasing to rental, we wonder how long can DVDs continue to command such a visible presence at Walmart,” wrote Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, in a recent note.Yet despite the competition between Apple, Walmart and others, the size of the digital film rental and online sales business is still relatively small, says Arash Amel, research director, digital media, at IHS Screen Digest.“You’ve got the largest companies in the media business and the world’s biggest retailer competing for share of a business that generated less than $400m in 2010. We expect it will barely double by 2015.”This may explain why Amazon is building its own subscription service to compete with Netflix. Amazon continues to offer one-off digital movie rentals and purchases but inadvertently revealed its plans for a subscription service recently when it published a screen shot promoting it.The company is planning to bundle access to the digital film subscription service with Amazon Prime, which gives customers unlimited free shipping on items for an initial fee.But while Netflix, Apple, Amazon and the others jockey to control the future of home entertainment, Blockbuster can only watch from the sidelines.Summit Entertainment, the company behind the hit Twilight series, last week asked a federal judge to make Blockbuster pay $6.8m it owes for unpaid DVDs or force it into liquidation.Stephen Nickerson, Summit’s president, said the unpaid bills were a “significant hardship” for the studio, according to court filings. It is a far cry from Blockbuster’s heyday but technology and shifting consumer behaviour have changed the game in Hollywood.
534;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-02-03T08:10:40Z;Hulu chief attacks traditional TV businesses;;Jason Kilar, the chief executive of Hulu is heading for a showdown with News Corp, Walt Disney and NBC Universal, the media companies that own the online video site, after he criticised their traditional television business model.In a blog post on Wednesday, Mr Kilar said “traditional TV has too many ads” while Hulu’s advertising is “2-times as effective as traditional TV video advertising”.The comments will likely exacerbate tensions between Mr Kilar and the media companies. Relations between the two sides are already strained over his plans to redefine Hulu by adding more exclusive television programming, according to people familiar with the situation.The blog post came as a shock to the company’s owners, who are heavily invested in the US television business. News Corp owns the Fox network, while Walt Disney owns the ABC network, and NBC is now owned by Comcast, the cable group.Walt Disney said Mr Kilar’s views were “personal and clearly not shared by anyone at Walt Disney”. News Corp declined to comment, and NBC Universal could not be reached for comment.Hulu currently carries thousands of hours of programming much of which is provided by the three media companies. Programmes such as The Office, 30 Rock and Modern Family are all available on Hulu.Mr Kilar has been willing to risk future access to that content by angering Hulu’s owners with his expansion plans. Hulu was initially created as a response to YouTube by giving its owners a legitimate online outlet for their programming. Before Hulu was launched ABC, for example, was streaming its own programming.However, Hulu’s owners have become alarmed at Mr Kilar’s attempts to redefine the company as a premium online video destination with programming that is not available anywhere else. His comments have exacerbated those tensions. He concludes the blog post with: “We are crazy. All entrepreneurs need to be.”One person close to Hulu said the company’s owners were furious with Mr Kilar. “If I were given billions of dollars worth of programming, I too could probably build a business,” the person said. “But I know that in order to build a long-term, viable business I would have to do so in a way that works for everybody.”Another person close to the situation said Mr Kilar was out of touch with mainstream television viewing. “These are clearly the musings of an elitist who is obviously disconnected from how the majority of America watches television,” said the person.Relations between Mr Kilar and the three media companies have deteriorated in recent months. He pursued an initial public offering for Hulu with the aim of using funds to acquire more content. But the IPO plan was scrapped at an early stage because of muted investor interest and concerns about how long Hulu would control the rights to its programming, according to people familiar with the plans.Still, the company remains one of the dominant online video destinations. In his blog post, Mr Kilar said Hulu would generate $500m in revenues from advertising and from its subscription service in 2011. That would compare with $263m in 2010 and $108m the previous year.“In the near to mid term, we anticipate being able to generate higher advertising returns than any traditional channel can from their advertising service, for any type of content,” Mr Kilar wrote in his blog post.Hulu on Wednesday also announced that it had struck a new deal with Viacom, owner of the Comedy Central cable channel, and would begin showing The Daily Show and The Colbert Report on the site. The shows were removed from the site last year following a disagreement with Viacom.
535;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-01-26T20:23:15Z;TV economics rests on Super Bowl’s shoulders;Football drives ad revenues for networks, writes William Wallis;It is a truism about the Super Bowl that what happens on the field is not always the most memorable thing about the crowning game of the American football season. Many people watch instead to see what marketing’s wildest creative directors come up with in the ad breaks. When the Pittsburgh Steelers face the Green Bay Packers on Fox on February 6, however, the sporting action should be centre stage for anyone looking to understand US television’s remarkable comeback.In spite of high unemployment and the rise of Netflix, Hulu and other alternatives to cable and satellite, broadcast networks and top cable channels saw booming audiences and advertising revenues in 2010. Dig into the numbers, though, and you find two big drivers of this rebound: football (the American variety) and football (World Cup flavour). In spite of unprecedented US ratings for international soccer last summer, the National Football League should take most of the credit.Football games accounted for eight of last year’s top 10 US TV audiences, Nielsen reports. The New Orleans Saints’ Super Bowl victory drew 106.5m viewers to CBS, beating the record set at the 2009 Super Bowl to become the most watched broadcast in US history.The phenomenon is not constrained to professional football. College football and NBA basketball saw similar viewing surges. Nor is it confined to the US. But with two big teams on the field, the Super Bowl audience record could be beaten once more. Last Sunday’s NFL games attracted audiences not seen since 1982.It is little wonder then that President Barack Obama has agreed to a Super Bowl pre-game interview: the audience will dwarf that for his State of the Union address. The point is not lost on advertisers, either, but ads are sold in advance, so unexpected ratings have little impact on the network airing the game (rights rotate between CBS, Fox and NBC).A larger point matters a great deal, however: as audiences fragment and high definition screens proliferate, live sport has become broadcasters’ greatest weapon not just in the fight for the affluent male viewers that advertisers crave but in the battle to change their revenue model. US broadcast networks are pushing cable and satellite operators to pay hefty “affiliate fees” for programming, prompting clashes that have sometimes caused channels to go dark, as when Cablevision tussled with Fox during the baseball World Series.“Sports programming is the negotiation axe to wield when threatening to black out a signal,” Michael Nathanson, media analyst at Nomura, pointed out in a recent note. That makes it pivotal to securing higher affiliate fees, the biggest driver of broadcast revenues in the coming years.Cable and satellite operators face rising programming costs, but also know that live sport is the main thing stopping customers from “cutting the cord” for online alternatives. Just try watching your favourite team without cable or satellite.Pay-TV operators’ need for premium sporting content explains why ESPN, Disney’s sports franchise, commands a fifth of all affiliate fees with just 5 per cent of US cable viewers. SNL Kagan analysts estimate that ESPN charges cable and satellite operators $4.40 a month per subscriber, a multiple of what any rival earns, making it a huge contributor to Disney’s profits. Comcast and DirecTV may not end up paying ESPN-level sums to CBS or Fox, but something has to give. Smaller cable network owners without sports rights will probably feel the pain.As it takes control of NBC Universal, Comcast finds itself on both sides, and it is notable that one of its first moves has been to create an NBC sports group that analysts believe it wants to build into a challenger to ESPN. Time Warner has also been expanding in sports, with a 14-year, $10.8bn deal to share college basketball rights between Turner and CBS.More competition from more bidders with the business models to support higher fees can mean only one thing: steep inflation in the cost of rights. “The most important driver of the next two to 10 years is that leagues now have a multitude of options,” says Joel Hollander, a former CBS Network Radio head who led many negotiations with the NFL.Lots of league agreements are locked up for years, but already ESPN has agreed to a reported 40 per cent rise in fees to the NFL. The next big test will be this year’s bidding for US rights to the 2014 and 2016 Olympics. NBC lost money on the 2010 Winter Olympics and the risk of overpaying will be strong.Before then, the NFL has to negotiate a new labour contract and the real threat of a strike hangs over next year’s season. Player salaries are calculated on a share of league revenues so players will expect a big pay rise. Don’t be surprised if the spotlight of envy shifts from pinstriped bankers to the padded shoulders of the Super Bowl stars.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s Media Editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com
536;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Republican donor trail offers 2012 clues;;A long list of possible Republican presidential candidates have been busy raising millions of dollars over the past two years, although not a single one has officially thrown his – or her – hat in the ring.Campaign finance experts say it is unusual that, even at this early stage of the 2012 presidential contest, Republican candidates have not yet begun to organise campaign committees or raise funds formally at the level necessary to win the Republican nomination to take on Barack Obama.But a review of federal campaign data shows the potential candidates were able to raise a substantial amount of money to promote themselves and back other Republican candidates’ political campaigns.While these funds may not be used for a presidential campaign – a candidate must officially announce their intention to run and create a separate committee for that purpose – the contributions donated to the candidates from 2009 to 2010 offer a picture of the kinds of donors lining up for what is likely to be a tough Republican primary contest.The former Republican speaker of the House, who will announce whether he is running for president in April, has proved to be one of the most adept fundraisers so far. A tax-exempt issue advocacy group chaired by Mr Gingrich, called American Solutions for Winning the Future, raised – and spent – about $24.4m from 2009 to October 2010, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Leading contributors include big coal interests such as Peabody Energy and Arch Coal, a group that is at loggerheads with the Obama administration over a permit that was revoked by environmental regulators.Other big donors include Las Vegas Sands, which gave the group $500,000. It is unclear if the donation came from executives or the company, a resort and gaming group that generates most of its revenue from casinos in Macao and Singapore. Crow Holdings, a Texas-based real estate investment group, gave $350,000.American Solutions, which is advocating a campaign to end the Obama healthcare reforms, has spent $11.7m to create a direct mail fundraising network.According to tax records, American Solutions also paid out $235,000 in “small loans” to a holding company controlled by Mr Gingrich in 2009. A spokesman for the group said it was repaying a loan Gingrich Holdings had made to the political organisation a year earlier “as a precaution to make sure it had cash flow”.Mr Gingrich and his associates have also spent $2.2m in private chartered jet travel since 2009. The former speaker’s political action committee raised more than $700,000, and donated $125,700 to Republican candidates and other political action committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Ms Palin has proved to be a Republican kingmaker over the past two years, which could give her a boost among influential Tea Party lawmakers.SarahPac, her political action committee, raised $5.4m over the past two years, with about $500,000 going mostly to Tea Party candidates.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, most of the money flowing into SarahPac comes from individuals who work for single-cause organisations, people working in finance or retirees. SarahPac spent more than $1.4m on political and media consultants and fundraising over the past two years.The former Arkansas governor has raised more than $1.7m since 2009, mostly from retirees and healthcare professionals, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Donors who have given $10,000 include a theatre group called Celebrity Attractionsand a Memphis gastroenterology group.Ask any Republican on Wall Street and they will tell you that Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who lost the Republican primary against John McCain in 2008, is a natural fundraiser.The former Bain executive raised $8.8m through his political action committee over the last election cycle, with much of the funds coming from the financial industry.Individuals working for Goldman Sachs donated nearly $200,000 to Mr Romney in the 2010 election cycle, followed by $88,500 from those working for Bain, the private equity group, and $40,500 from people living in a huge Florida retirement community known as The Villages.About $1.1m has been directed to Republican candidates.The Pac has spent more than $2m on campaign and fundraising expenses.The former Minnesota governor emerged on the national scene as a potential running-mate for Republican nominee John McCain in 2008. Since then, he has raised $3.3m with the help of corporate donations from Comcast, Enterprise-Rent-A-Car, Target and AT&T and a handful of $10,000 donations from wealthy individuals and retirees.The Florida senator is not considered a presidential contender, but he is almost universally regarded as a likely candidate for vice-president. Mr Rubio would be an attractive choice because he could attract Hispanic voters and is popular in Florida, a battleground state.His campaign to be senator proved he is a formidable fundraiser, having raised and spent $21m on his election. Fundraisers included employees at Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group, and employees of Elliott Management, the New York hedge fund founded by Paul Singer.
537;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-01-25T10:23:14Z;Obama centre-stage as a jilted left looks on;A challenge from progressives would be quixotic in the extreme;"The angry thunder on the American right is still present, even if a little muted since the Tucson shootings. Some conservative Republicans, if not the firebrands, are even going to sit with Democrats at President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address on Tuesday night, rather than sitting on their hands on the other side of the aisle, shouting “liar” or conspicuously playing with their smartphones.But, for once, it is the noise on the left that commands more attention. Its most distinctive media voice, Keith Olbermann, is going silent, removed from his prime time show on MSNBC last Friday, apparently by mutual agreement with his employers. He leaves a big hole; a talented, literate, if combustible, broadcaster, he had been the first liberal successfully to take on rightwing dominance of talk radio and TV on its own polemical terms.Conspiracy theorists immediately attributed his demise to the imminent arrival of Comcast, the cable and internet giant, as the new parent of Universal-NBC. It certainly would have been an embarrassment to Comcast if he had left shortly after it assumed control, but the truth does appear to lie in the many and long-standing disputes between him and his existing bosses.Elsewhere on the left, there is unconcealed distaste for the president’s supposed move to the political centre. This, in their view, was manifested last week by the appointment of an industrialist, Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric, to head a new advisory panel on economic recovery; the arrival of two business-friendly operatives, Bill Daley and Gene Sperling, into the upper reaches of the White House staff; and the fact that Mr Obama even wrote a column promising less heavy-handed regulation in the Wall Street Journal no less, the house organ for his political opponents.To my mind, these liberals are acting like jilted lovers. Mr Obama has always been an intellectual pragmatist, never a reflexive progressive, no matter how the left vested so many hopes in him or the right portrayed him as a socialist, or worse. The big difference after the midterm elections is that he no longer needs Congressional Democrats as much as he did when his legislative plate was so full. I suspect he finds not having to defer to Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi quite liberating, even though he would never say so.Mr Olbermann was far from alone in voicing disappointment. Paul Krugman of Princeton and the New York Times, the intellectual giant of the left, even went so far in a New York Review of Books article to propose that progressives “de-link” themselves from Mr Obama in the 2012 election.Robert Reich, who served in the Clinton cabinet and commands a following as a policy commentator, attacked Mr Immelt’s elevation because GE had outsourced so many American jobs overseas, not exactly consistent, he said, with his mandate to create more jobs at home.Mr Krugman does have a Nobel Prize to his name, but in economics not politics, and he was vague on how de-linking might be accomplished. No Democratic challenger to Mr Obama’s re-nomination is in sight, in contrast to the proliferation of potential Republican candidates. Former Senator Russell Feingold, defeated in November, gets mentioned but more in fond hope than well-founded expectation. In any case, he has always been very much his own man, not the tool of others or the standard bearer for lost causes.If opinion polls mean anything beyond the moment, Mr Obama’s sharp rise in public approval, especially among independent voters and moderate Republicans, since the lame duck Congress actually got some things done suggests that any challenge from his left would be quixotic in the extreme. Wouldn’t it make more sense, if the centre rules again, to leave the extremes to the Palins, Bachmanns, Boltons etc on the dark side of the political moon?onohana@aol.com"
538;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-01-23T20:35:51Z;Host’s exit adds to Comcast challenges;;One of Comcast’s first challenges as it takes over NBC Universal will be managing the often volatile on-air personalities of its newly acquired broadcast and cable networks.This was brought into relief Friday with the resignation of Keith Olbermann, the outspoken left-leaning host of Countdown, the most popular show on MSNBC, the cable news network.Mr Olbermann’s departure comes amid calls for less inflamed media rhetoric after the Tucson shooting of a US congresswoman, and just days after Comcast, the largest US cable and internet provider, won regulatory approval to acquire NBCU.Critics of Comcast’s takeover of NBCU voiced concerns that the new owners might try to exert control over controversial content.Comcast denied that it was involved in Mr Olbermann’s departure. “Comcast pledged from [the] day [the] deal was announced that we would not interfere with NBCU’s news operations,” Comcast said on Friday. “We have not, and we will not.”Mr Olbermann was a fierce critic of Republican politicians and Fox News, which is aligned with the political right. He recently said Fox News “goes beyond having a point of view and actually starts to shill [advocate] for partisan causes”.Yet Mr Olbermann fell foul of his network last year, when it was revealed that he donated money to the campaigns of two Democratic politicians, including Gabrielle Giffords, the congresswoman who was shot in Arizona two weeks ago. Mr Olbermann was briefly suspended, an episode that soured relations between him and executives at MSNBC. In 2008 Mr Olbermann signed a four-year contract worth $30m. Details of his exit package were not made public.“MSNBC and Keith Olbermann have ended our contract,” Phil Griffin, MSNBC president, said on Friday. “The last broadcast of Countdown will be this evening. MSNBC thanks Keith for his integral role in MSNBC’s success, and we wish him well in his future endeavours.”Sources close to MSNBC said relations between Mr Olbermann and MSNBC executives had been souring in recent months and that the departure had been in the works for weeks. As part of his exit deal, Mr Olbermann reportedly will not be allowed to appear on television for some time but will be free to appear on the radio and internet.Mr Olbermann’s Countdown was the highest rated show on MSNBC. One of Comcast’s first tasks will be to demonstrate that it can make the channel’s primetime schedule work.
539;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-01-21T00:09:26Z;Verizon challenges broadband rules;;Verizon, the US telecommunications group, mounted a legal challenge against the Obama administration’s new regulations on broadband, saying it was “deeply concerned” that the Federal Communications Commission was asserting too much control of the internet.The company said on Thursday that the FCC’s so-called net neutrality rules exceeded the federal regulator’s authority and created “uncertainty” for the communications industry, innovators and consumers.The claim against the FCC was filed in a US appeals court in Washington, a venue known for its scepticism of regulators and has historically favoured telecoms companies.The net neutrality rules, which were passed in December by a 3-2 vote at the FCC, prohibit broadband providers from blocking any lawful content, applications and services, though it allowed “reasonable network management” and gave operators a green light to charge heavy internet users more.The new regulations also imposed new – but light – restrictions on wireless providers such as Verizon.The company’s legal challenge contrasts with the position other big communications companies adopted in the wake of the new rules, which analysts said were watered down to lessen corporate resistance.Comcast and AT&T did not express enthusiasm for the rules but appeared to accept them as the best they could hope for from an administration that had made the passage of strict net neutrality regulations a key campaign promise.“It’s sort of a good cop, bad cop routine and AT&T and cable companies got to play the good cop. And Verizon goes forward and does the legal challenge,” said Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.Ms Arbogast said Verizon had been “particularly uneasy” about the new rules on wireless services, which said companies could not block websites or applications that competed with their own voice or video services.The suit comes as the White House has promised to take a second look at its regulatory policies as part of a broader attempt to improve its relationship with business.Ivan Siedenberg, chairman and chief executive of Verizon, has been a tough critic of Barack Obama, US president, in the past. Last June he charged that the administration’s policies were harming efforts to increase jobs.The FCC declined to comment.
540;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-01-19T22:48:29Z;Comcast hedges against weakening in core business;;When Comcast’s takeover of NBC Universal was conceived at the 2009 Allen & Company media conference in Sun Valley, the television industry was undergoing a period of great uncertainty.General Electric, the industrial conglomerate that owned NBCU, had just watched the TV business endure a gruelling advertising recession. NBCU’s chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was struggling to reorder the broadcast arm’s primetime line-up – an effort that dragged over into last year’s scheduling feud between comedy hosts Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien.The problems at NBCU – the group behind NBC News, Bravo and Universal Studios – made the long-running question of why GE continued to own a media business more pressing, and provided perfect conditions for Comcast, the US cable company, to strike, five years after it had been frustrated in an unsolicited $54bn bid for Disney.The deal, announced in December 2009 and approved by the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday, has Comcast buying 51 per cent of NBCU for $6.4bn in cash, and injecting cable channels into the venture. GE will sell its remaining 49 per cent stake to Comcast over seven years, and Vivendi will reap $5.8bn for its 20 per cent. The new joint venture is valued at $30bn.Yet, from the outset, many analysts questioned the logic of combining NBCU’s content with the distribution might of Comcast, the largest US cable and internet service provider. Time Warner had just done the opposite, abandoning past efforts to add distribution properties to its core content business by spinning off AOL and Time Warner Cable.Critics also wondered if the businessmen from Philadelphia, where Comcast is based, were ready for the scrutiny that would come from owning a broadcast network and news outlets such as MSNBC.Comcast contends that the deal makes good business sense. For one, it can make more of its own cable networks, such as the Golf Channel and E!, when they are paired with bigger NBCU cable channels such as Bravo, USA and CNBC.Comcast’s bid also seems a hedge against the prospect of a slowdown in its core cable business. Cable companies around the country lost subscribers for two quarters of last year, raising concerns about “cord cutting”, where consumers drop cable for online alternatives.By acquiring NBCU, Comcast has diversified its risk in case cable weakens further. It has also instantly made itself a major player in the developments shaping the emerging market for online video.With the rights to NBC’s content, particularly the backlog of Universal Studios movies, Comcast will have significant weight in negotiations with online rivals. Films still help drive each new video distribution platform, as Netflix, the DVD and online video rental service, in particular has shown most recently.US regulators approved the deal with conditions designed to prevent Comcast from using its new might to harm competitors. But on Tuesday afternoon two very different accounts were on offer as to what the deal creates.Most analysts said the conditions were generally unobtrusive. “I think the FCC was quite lenient on them,” said Shahid Khan, chairman at MediaMorph, the software-as-a-service provider. “It looks like a joke. I was expecting them to be much stricter.”This view was echoed by FCC commissioner Michael Copps, the lone dissenter in a 4-1 vote in favour of the deal, who said the new entity would have too much power. “This Comcast-NBCU joint venture grievously fails the public interest,” he said.Comcast also seemed pleased with the outcome. “I don’t think any of the conditions are particularly restrictive,” said Comcast executive vice-president David Cohen. But some Republicans said the FCC over-reached, placing too many onerous terms on Comcast.Comcast shares were flat on Tuesday and rose early on Wednesday, suggesting investors were surprised neither by the approval, nor by regulators’ demands.Shares are up nearly 40 per cent in the past year, broadly in line with competitors, and this media rebound has silenced some of the strategic doubters.“It is now clear in retrospect that, in buying media assets at a price struck in late 2009, Comcast bought NBCU very well indeed,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “What the deal lacks strategically, it more than makes up for in sheer market timing.”Questions remain as to how Comcast will handle some of NBCU’s less compatible assets, such as its Universal Studios theme parks, and whether it will feel compelled to dispose of overlapping cable channels.Still, Comcast-NBCU will have unparalleled influence over the rapidly evolving media landscape. In the nascent online video market, the new venture will have particular leverage to shape deals and determine access rights, in spite of the government’s conditions.It will also retain substantial cash balances. Although analysts doubt that Comcast will pursue further substantial deals for now, these should allow it to step up its share buy-back programme, Mr Moffett said.On Tuesday, regulators signed off on the deal with a whiff of trepidation, setting in motion events that will invariably reshape the media industry.
541;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-01-18T21:18:02Z;US regulators approve Comcast-NBCU deal;;"US regulators have cleared Comcast’s bid to control NBC Universal, after a lengthy review that imposed several conditions on the largest US cable company’s combination with the group behind NBC News, Bravo and Universal Studios.A four-to-one vote from the Federal Communications Commission, echoed by clearance from the Department of Justice, deemed that Comcast’s acquisition of a 51 per cent stake from General Electric and Vivendi would be in the public interest, after extracting a series of concessions, many of which will tie Comcast’s hands for seven years. Comcast, which is the largest internet service provider in the US, will have to pledge not to harm rival cable operators by withholding NBCU content and encourage competition in the online video market.It will also have to expand NBC’s local news operation; offer more programming for children and Spanish speakers; provide free high-speed internet access to 600 schools and libraries in “underserved communities” and offer broadband access for $10 a month and computers for under $150 to 2.5m low-income consumers.The FCC also focused on Comcast’s possible power over online video, an emerging market that is gaining importance as consumers access more mainstream content over the internet. The lengthy review process and long list of conditions divided the FCC’s five-member board along political lines.Commissioners Robert McDowell and Meredith Attwell Baker said the organisation’s “approach to merger reviews had become excessively coercive and lengthy”, saying the FCC “exceeded its limited statutory bounds”.However, Michael Copps, the FCC commissioner who was the lone dissenting vote, said the decision would make the new Comcast-NBCU joint venture too powerful.“[This decision] reaches into virtually every corner of our media and digital landscapes and will affect every citizen in the land,” he said. “And it confers too much power in one company’s hands.”Mr Copps said that the venture would pose a threat to the open internet, adding: “The potential for walled gardens, toll booths, content prioritisation, access fees to reach end users and a stake in the heart of independent content production is now very real.”Comcast lent tacit support to the government’s net neutrality proposal last year.In the deal, Comcast will buy 51 per cent of NBCU– which owns television networks and a film studio – paying $5.8bn to Vivendi and $7.1bn to GE, and injecting its own cable channels into the new joint venture, which is valued at $30bn.GE will also receive $9.1bn from NBCU, which will take on debt to fund the payment. An adjustment based on NBCU’s recent performance during the past year is not expected to significantly affect the terms of the deal. GE can sell its remaining 49 per cent stake to Comcast over the next seven years."
542;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-01-18T00:20:20Z;Approval expected for NBCU Comcast;;US regulators will approve Comcast’s purchase of NBC Universal from General Electric and Vivendi as early as Tuesday, people close to the review process say.The Federal Communications Commission has been working over final conditions for the deal since December, when chairman Julius Genachowski circulated a draft order for the approval to the FCC’s other four commissioners.Since then the commissioners have been hearing last-minute appeals from lobbyists and public interest groups who have emphasised the need for strict conditions that will prevent Comcast from exploiting its control of both content and distribution to harm competitors.Last week Michael Copps, FCC commissioner, heard appeals from public interest groups who stressed that with approval, Comcast would be in a position to withhold popular NBCU programming from rival cable operators.Reports suggest Mr Copps may be the lone holdout among the commissioners, paving the way for a 4-1 approval vote.The Department of Justice, which has also been reviewing the proposed joint venture, is also expected to give the greenlight within days. Both government agencies are expected to approve the deal with conditions, including provisions that would ensure continued competition in the emerging online video market.But these terms are not expected to be onerous enough to kill the deal, putting completion of the merger on track for early February.In the deal, Comcast will buy 51 per cent of NBCU, which owns television networks and a film studio, paying $5.8bn to Vivendi and $7.1bn to GE, and injecting its own cable channels into the new joint venture.GE will also receive $9.1bn from NBCU, which will take on debt to fund the payment.An adjustment based on NBCU’s recent performance over the past year is not expected to significantly affect the terms of the deal. GE can sell its remaining 49 per cent stake to Comcast over the next seven years.The new joint venture is valued at $30bn and will give Comcast-NBCU a unique role as content creator and major distributor.Stephen Burke, Comcast’s chief operating officer, will lead the new joint venture.In December, Comcast lent tacit support to the government’s net neutrality proposal, a move that likely helped smooth the way for approval of the deal.While the media landscape has changed over the past year, and NBCU’s critical primetime television line-up has suffered, the deal is still expected to be profitable for Comcast.
543;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-01-07T23:13:55Z;Premium content to drive tablets’ popularity;;"“You shouldn’t have to have a PhD as a consumer to be able to figure out how to get this stuff,” Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner’s chairman and chief executive said at the Consumer Electronics Show.Anyone trying to navigate through the forest of new entertainment devices and services unveiled at CES would sympathise, but for the media companies present the event served up a particularly complex mix of promise and challenges.Media executives were out in force. Three Murdoch family members (Rupert, Elisabeth and Lachlan) took meetings on the fringes; Comcast’s Brian Roberts announced in-home streaming for his cable system’s channels on tablets; and Time Warner Cable’s Glenn Britt showed how it could deliver video-on-demand to subscribers’ Sony televisions without a set-top box.Many announcements felt like incremental advances on plans announced a year earlier, but one palpable change was media owners’ confidence that manufacturers need premium content to differentiate their gadgets, and that consumers will watch and read more on such devices. “I believe tablets create compelling opportunities for video consumption”, said Anthony DiClemente media analyst at Barclays Capital, noting that the scores of new tablets “expand the amount of time and places a person can consume” media content.News Corp’s impending tablet newspaper, The Daily, was one reason for Rupert Murdoch to attend. Tablets are also grabbing TV companies’ attention as they evolve into souped-up remote controls, with the ability to search for programming and take it from room to room.The rise of internet-connected televisions, often presented by companies such as Samsung alongside a string of deals with content companies, revived the debate about the danger “over the top” web video alternatives represent to television from cable, satellite or telecom companies.After two quarters of falling pay-TV subscriber numbers, analysts expect a stronger fourth quarter to cool talk of the “cord-cutting” threat for now. But Shahid Khan, a consultant with MediaMorph, cautioned: “They should be more concerned about an entire generation of consumers coming behind us who will perhaps never even connect the cord.”Mr Bewkes appeared with Ivan Seidenberg of Verizon, which touted faster download speeds for its FiOS video service, highlighting media owners continuing concern about the strength of the networks underlying internet-delivery.Media executives’ main message, however, was that the old model content owners thrived on is not going away as they reiterated the case for “TV Everywhere”, the concept that subscribers should be able to access their full array of channels on any device.Showing a slide of the 30-odd digital services it would take a consumer to replace everything a pay-TV subscription offers, Mr Bewkes argued: “You should use the system that you have and the consumer habits that you have.”"
544;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2011-01-07T17:39:14Z;TV makers seek to retune 3D revolution;;Advances in televisions on display at the Consumer Electronics Show helped make a spectacular Las Vegas event, with Sony and Samsung even bringing on dancing girls during their presentations.There have been bigger, flashier sets, with images leaping out from the screens, in some cases without the need for special 3D glasses. Content is richer and more colourful, with film studios and broadcasters keen to see wider distribution.There is also a new live element to internet content to supplement the many on-demand services that have dominated web-connected TVs so far.But a year on from big introductions of 3D and connected “smart TVs”, the show is still barely on the road, with 3D sales disappointing to date and the choice of content services and TV interfaces still confusing consumers.Only about 3m 3D TVs were sold worldwide in 2010, just over 1 per cent of total TV sales of 247m, according to estimates by the DisplaySearch research firm. Internet-connected TVs were far more successful, accounting for about 21 per cent of global shipments.Manufacturers appear divided in their response to consumer resistance to 3D. LG and Vizio are now promoting cheaper “passive” glasses, similar to those worn in the cinema, in response to complaints about the cost of the more sophisticated active-shutter glasses, which are also heavier and subject to flat batteries as consumers forget to recharge them.The TV makers are also working with standard eyewear designers, such as Oakley and Silhouette, to improve the look and feel of the glasses. Samsung showed off spectacles weighing less than an ounce that could be charged wirelessly by resting them on a special stand.Toshiba demonstrated a large-screen TV that displays 3D without the need for any eyewear but the technology still needs work and there are no plans to launch such a set yet.Sony is standing by its active-shutter glasses, which it says provide unmatched quality.In terms of internet connectivity, the Japanese consumer electronics company has chosen Google TV for its web-connected TV interface, while incorporating features of its own Qriocity content service, which will now include streaming of music as well as films.Vizio, which was the leading US LCD TV maker in the third quarter, said this week that it was switching from Yahoo internet widgets to its own interface based on Google’s Android operating system. Samsung, meanwhile, has announced a deal with Adobe to encourage its developer community to provide applications for its own smart TV platform.While alliances with technology companies are shifting, new ones with traditional cable providers are being established that cut out the need for TVs to be dependent on set-top boxes or aerials and coaxial cable, which carries regular and cable TV channels into the home.During CES, both Sony and Samsung have announced partnerships with Time Warner Cable that will allow delivery of the full line-up of its channels of live programming over their TVs’ internet connections. Samsung also announced a similar deal with Comcast cable, which will make programming available over internet protocol to Samsung’s Galaxy Tab tablet and its Android phones.This is part of a newer trend for 2011 – TV makers such as Vizio and Samsung are coming up with tablets and smartphones that can act as both relays and remotes for TVs. This involves using wireless connections to switch content – such as films being watched on a tablet – to the TV screen and using the mobile devices’ touch screens as remote controls.This growing interconnectivity of devices, from phones to TVs, appears to have been behind Qualcomm’s biggest acquisition this week. The leading phone chipmaker bought home network chipmaker Atheros for $3.1bn.“The industry is moving very rapidly and the phone is going to bleed into these adjacent areas [such as the digital home],” says Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm executive vice-president.Intel has also enabled similar capabilities for notebook PCs with the launch of its next-generation chips at the show – allowing high-definition films to be streamed securely over wireless to TVs.Intel’s technology won the confidence of the film studios, which are always worried about copyright piracy among PC owners.Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Fox, Universal and Warner Bros also announced at CES they would begin using UltraViolet this year – the brand for content that can be bought and stored in a digital locker to be used on any device owned by the consumer.With Hollywood now happy to offer content across devices and on TVs, this long-awaited move is promising for both TV makers and consumers, according to Dave Habiger, chief executive of Sonic Solutions, which securely encodes digital content for the studios. “This could be a transformational year – we’ve got an alignment of device manufacturers and storefronts and technology players . . . and consumers seem to like it,” he says.

The comment is accompanied with a link to a just-taken picture of the two items as they are displayed at Moxsie’s offices in Palo Alto, California.Twitter user @kojioka agrees, declaring that “the red reminds me of a picnic basket”, while it puts @kristin in mind of a tablecloth; @master_lallers thinks “the grey is a lot more subtle than the red, which gives off a bit of a Raggedy Ann doll vibe”.Moxsie’s Twitter-based “buyerchat” event is accompanied by a series of pictures of products on show at Moxsie’s offices.The event illustrates what Jon Fahrner, the chief executive, describes as a deliberately radical embrace of the concept of crowdsourcing via social media, by inviting the site’s customers to help influence the process of buying next season’s line-up. “The goal is not to sell stuff, but to get honest feedback on the merchandise,” says Mr Fahrner, formerly one of the first buyers at Zappos, the online shoe store that is now part of Amazon.Twitter has already inspired a number of creative marketing responses from retailers. Fresh & Easy, the California-based grocery chain owned by the UK’s Tesco, conducts regular evening wine-tasting events during which participants gather on Twitter at a fixed time equipped with a pre-announced selection of wines and then share their thoughts. Best Buy, the electronics retailer, Comcast, the cable company, and others have also used the social messaging service to improve customer service.Steve Rubel, director of insights at Edelman Digital, says Moxsie’s approach to what he calls “supreme transparency” puts it on the extreme edge of what companies are doing with social media.Mr Gray found the experience a “little weird” at first as Moxsie’s social media employee snapped photos with her iPhone and relayed Twitter comments. “I felt a little as if I were part of a performance at first, but then I got used to it,” he says. “They were really taking the input from the people on Twitter. One item went from something they weren’t going to buy to something they had to really think hard about because someone online said they liked it.”Mr Fahrner says the idea of consulting on Twitter came up when Moxsie was considering how to use crowdsourcing to create a closer relationship with customers, having collected 110,000 followers on Twitter and almost 35,000 Facebook fans.After deciding that true crowdsourcing should involve engagement in a task carried out by an employee, the company settled on opening up its buying meetings – where stores decide what and how much to buy for the next season. The company, which has fewer than 20 employees, is expanding the initiative by offering the most committed participants “junior buyer” and “buyer in training” online badges, and giving away $50 Moxsie gift vouchers to the best participant in a session.Participants might in future become interns or even buyers, says Mr Fahrner, noting that one active Twitter feed follower now heads its social media efforts.For Moxsie, the test of the initiative will come within months, when the inventory that was open to influence by buyerchat goes on sale. Mr Fahrner says the online retailer is already seeing a link between online comments on items that are made available for pre-order to registered customers.“It is getting to the point where were can almost match the dialogue with how something sells,” he adds."
546;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-12-23T23:39:41Z;Conditions set for Comcast’s NBCU bid;;"Comcast’s bid to buy control of NBC Universal from GE and Vivendi will be subject to tough but narrowly defined conditions, it emerged as the Federal Communications Commission chairman indicated that he would support the deal.Julius Genachowski circulated a draft order to the FCC’s four other commissioners, indicating that the transaction would meet public interest standards if Comcast, the largest US cable group, resolved concerns in several areas, senior FCC officials said.The biggest concerns involve the fast-evolving online video market, where the FCC is proposing a mechanism to ensure that online services such as Hulu, Netflix or video offerings from Apple and Google have fair access to NBCU programming.The FCC has stopped short of forcing Comcast to sell NBCU’s stake in Hulu, one person familiar with the transaction said, but it is unclear whether the Department of Justice may make tougher demands in its separate review.Comcast will also have to make guarantees about providing NBCU content to cable, satellite and telecom rivals, and issues around diversity, local programming and children’s programming.Some critics, such as Bloomberg, feared that competitors to NBCU’s cable channels could be pushed to the far reaches of the electronic programme guides on Comcast’s cable boxes.One person familiar with the FCC’s proposals said it had put some protections in place on how Comcast treats rival channels, but it would not have to change its channel line-up drastically.Comcast hinted that it would accept the conditions, saying it was “gratified” that the FCC chairman had circulated an order “that would lead to approval of our transaction”.Comcast and NBCU expect to complete the deal in January – later than the year-end closing date they had hoped for.It added: “We believe the draft FCC order as circulated ensures [that the promised public interest] benefits [of the deal] will be realised and will enable us to operate the NBC Universal and legacy Comcast businesses in an appropriate way.”Comcast’s position as the largest broadband provider and largest pay-television company in the US and raised worries from rivals and public interest groups. The FCC was flooded with more than 30,000 submissions on the deal.Comcast will buy 51 per cent of NBCU, and inject cable channels into the
venture. Vivendi will sell its 20 per cent stake for $5.8bn while Comcast will pay GE $7.1bn in cash, minus an adjustment tied to NBCU’s cash flow since the deal was announced.GE will also receive $9.1bn from NBCU, which will take on debt to fund the payment, and GE can sell its remaining 49 per cent stake to Comcast over seven years."
547;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-12-23T00:47:02Z;Delays push back Comcast’s NBCU takeover;;Regulatory delays will push back Comcast’s takeover of NBC Universal until early next year, both companies said on Wednesday.The postponement will keep what would have been the biggest completed media deal of the year off 2010’s balance sheets.In the deal, Comcast, the largest US cable company, will buy 51 per cent of NBC Universal from General Electric and Vivendi, valuing the new joint venture at $37.25bn.Vivendi, the French media telecommunications group, will sell its entire 20 per cent stake in NBCU, and GE will retain a 49 per cent stake for now.Several sources familiar with the deal said the delay was procedural as the US Federal Communications Commission works through its heavy end-of-the-year load, and is not expected to affect the closing of the deal, which is now being targeted for January.“We are not aware of any material adverse consequences of an early 2011 closing as compared to 2010,” said Rebecca Arbogast, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.While the transaction still looks set to close, the companies have been talking to the FCC in recent days about potential conditions that will be placed on the deal. The media watchdog is seeking to ensure that the new company will not withhold NBCU content from rival distributors in the fast-evolving online video market.Another looming issue was “net neutrality”, but the FCC earlier this week set the groundwork for its new rules for regulating internet traffic, a move that should remove one sticking point from the ongoing scrutiny of the Comcast/NBCU deal.The next step in the FCC’s process will involve circulating a draft order of the approval to the agency’s commissioners.Several sources said that was expected to happen as early as Thursday.“Because of the lead time required to prepare for a close, it now appears that we will not be able to close the transaction with GE relating to NBC Universal by year-end,” Comcast said.“We believe the regulatory review puts us on track for a closing in January 2011.”A framework for extending the deal’s closing without penalty was built into the original contract, noted one person familiar with the proceedings.On Wednesday Jeff Zucker, the NBCU chief executive who will step down after the deal is completed, addressed the delay in a memo to staff.“We have made substantial progress this month with both the FCC and the Department of Justice, and expect that we will get a ‘green light’ in January,” said Mr Zucker.“The official close of the transaction would happen shortly after government approval.”
548;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-12-21T22:51:49Z;US sets rules on web traffic management;;The US Federal Communications Commission has set down its first rules of the road for internet traffic, after a split vote that left critics at both ends of the political spectrum warning the decision could be challenged by Congress or the courts.The “net neutrality” ruling prohibits broadband providers from blocking any lawful content, applications and services, though it would allow “reasonable network management” and permit operators to manage congestion by charging heavy users more.In one of its most divisive provisions, the FCC agreed by a 3-2 vote that mobile broadband should be regulated differently from fixed-line internet access, imposing fewer restrictions on wireless companies such as AT&T and Verizon.These providers may not block voice or video applications competing with their own services, but will be able to limit access to other bandwidth-hungry services and applications on iPhones, Android handsets and similar mobile devices.Barack Obama, who had made net neutrality an election pledge while campaigning for president in 2008, hailed the decision as one that would advance innovation, economic growth and job creation.However, Republican lawmakers signalled they would fight the regulations, with Fred Upton, the incoming chairman of the House energy and commerce committee, saying he would look to use the 1996 Congressional Review Act to repeal the FCC’s ruling.“The internet is an invaluable resource. It should be left alone,” said Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate, promising that his party would push back against the new rules once it formally takes over the House in January. It was unclear how effective such attempts would be.Timothy Karr, campaign director of Free Press, a media lobby group, said the “toothless” FCC ruling had fallen short of early promises to protect internet users.The FCC voted along partisan lines, with Democratic commissioners Michael Copps and Mignon Clyburn supporting the ruling while expressing disappointment that it had not gone further.Republicans Robert McDowell and Meredith Attwell Baker criticised it as unnecessary state intervention that would stifle innovation.The vote would weaken America’s ability to argue against foreign states’ interference with internet freedoms, Mr McDowell argued.Julius Genachowski, the FCC’s Democratic chairman, hailed the order as “strong and balanced”, adding the FCC had to act as “a cop on the beat” to ensure the vitality of communications networks and to protect consumers.Industry members were relieved that the FCC’s compromise stopped short of classifying broadband provision as a “Title II” service, exposing them to price controls and other tougher rules, but voiced questions about its legal authority.Verizon said it was “deeply concerned” that the FCC’s “assertion of authority without solid statutory underpinnings [would] yield continued uncertainty for industry, innovators and investors.”However Comcast said the rules appeared to strike “a workable balance between the needs of the marketplace for certainty and everyone’s desire that internet openness be preserved.”Mr Genachowski is expected to be a target of Republican oversight hearings, which are expected to examine his management of the FCC, the implementation of the net neutrality rules and, lobbyists say, the frequency of his travels since taking office
549;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-12-21T01:04:49Z;MGM studio emerges from bankruptcy;;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the company behind Hollywood classics such as The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind, has emerged from bankruptcy, bringing to an end a turbulent period that saw the legendary studio come close to being broken up and sold.The company, which also owns the James Bond series, has left bankruptcy with $500m of new financing arranged by JPMorgan, and a new management team. Creditors, who were owed some $4bn by MGM, now own the studio.Emerging from bankruptcy increases the chances of a new James Bond film being made, although it is likely the company will need to raise more funds to finance the movie.Production of the latest Bond film to star Daniel Craig had been suspended indefinitely by the Broccoli family, which owns the rights to Bond with MGM, because of the uncertainty surrounding the studio.Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, two former executives with Spyglass Entertainment, the company behind recent films including Get Him to the Greek and Dinner for Schmucks, have been appointed co-chairmen and co-chief executives of MGM.“MGM is emerging from one of the most challenging periods of its storied history,” they said in a statement. “Beginning today, MGM is a stronger, more competitive company, with a solid financial foundation and a bright future.”MGM’s troubles began with the highly leveraged $5bn purchase of the studio in 2004 by a consortium made up of Sony, TPG, Providence Equity Partners and Comcast.The deal loaded the studio with debt just as the DVD market went into sharp decline. When the credit crunch took hold in 2007, the group found itself unable to raise money to finance new movies, which would have helped it sell its older library titles.The new management team faces an uphill battle to revive MGM post-bankruptcy. Its television and film sales operations have stagnated for the past 12 months when creditors tried – and failed – to sell the studio.Mr Birnbaum and Mr Barber are also likely to face pressure from Carl Icahn, the activist investor who holds as much as 20 per cent of MGM shares. He is keen to merge the company with Lions Gate Entertainment, the company behind the Mad Men television series.
550;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-12-16T00:16:44Z;Obama urges big business to start hiring;;"President Barack Obama was pressed by top executives to slash taxes on foreign earnings of US companies, prompting the White House to agree to “continue discussions” on the issue, according to a person familiar with the talks.Mr Obama met with 20 executives, including Brian Roberts of Comcast and James McNerney of Boeing, as the US Congress moved closer to passage of a $858bn package to extend Bush-era tax cuts and other measures to stimulate the economy that were strongly supported by business.The four-hour meeting between the executives and Mr Obama included an exchange about the tax treatment of income generated internationally by US firms, which is currently subject to levies when brought back to the US.The White House has resisted calls for a wholesale elimination of the tax, arguing that it would encourage companies to invest oversees rather than in the US.Robert Wolf, the chairman of UBS Americas and a member of the president’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, who attended the meeting said: “[Mr Obama] was clear that everyone would like to see money locked overseas come back and reinvested in America, but we have to do it in alignment with tax policy that doesn’t create more of a deficit for this country and disadvantages domestic companies.”A person familiar with the talks said there was agreement to continue discussions. Negotiations to change the tax could begin next year as part of a broader overhaul of the corporate tax code, which the White House has said it would consider to boost competitiveness, address inequities and reduce the deficit.Mr Obama also had a chance to vent his own grievances with the business community. A person who was in the meeting said the president expressed his frustration about the apparent disconnect between productive talks with the executives, and the harsh rhetoric directed at the administration by the business lobbyists they employ. Having delivered important business-friendly initiatives - like the tax deal and the finalisation of a trade agreement with South Korea, Mr Obama implored the executives to use their nearly $2,000bn cash pile to hire new workers and reduce the unemployment rate.Mr Wolf said the meeting was “one of the best meetings I’ve been at between the White house and the business community”. Speaking before the meeting on Wednesday, Jeff Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, also signalled that the sometimes frosty relationship between Mr Obama and the business community was improving.“I thought he did a great job in India, in South Korea, with the trade statements. I think everybody now has said: ‘look, let’s focus on growth; it doesn’t matter what happened before,’ and CEOs are going to be quite open to that,” said Mr Immelt. “I think this move on taxes …is going to help the economy.”While the White House often tempers its comments on the importance of business with rhetoric on the need to protect consumers and correct and prevent corporate abuses, Mr Obama took a different tone on Wednesday.“I believe the primary engine of America’s economic success is not government. It’s the ingenuity of America’s entrepreneurs. It’s the dynamism of our market,” Mr Obama said before the meeting at Blair House, across from the White House.“I hope to elicit ideas from these business leaders that will help us not only climb out of recession but seize the promise of this moment.”Before the meeting, Mr Obama listed the priorities that he said were necessary for the US to “outcompete” other nations: education, innovation in industries such as clean energy, and infrastructure, including roads, high-speed rail and internet.He also said the US had to “redouble our commitment to fiscal discipline and address our long-term deficit challenges”."
551;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-12-02T23:28:54Z;Internet rules stir Republicans;;The incoming Republican majority’s staunch opposition to a new industry-supported proposal by the Federal Communications Commission shows that even some of the most powerful companies in Washington may be losing sway over their traditional allies on Capitol Hill.Instead of a nod of support to watered down “net neutrality” regulations, including concessions to the cable and wireless industry and companies such as Comcast and AT&T, Republicans are instead engaged in a race to prove their conservative credentials to a base that abhors any kind of government regulation.A proposal unveiled by the FCC this week would protect internet sites, such as Google, from being blocked by internet service providers. It would also give telecommunications companies the freedom to charge content providers for usage.Fred Upton, a Republican from Michigan who is vying to become the next chairman of the House energy and commerce committee when his party takes control in January, said the FCC proposal was nothing less than an “assault” on the internet.“We have all grown sick and tired of the Chicago-style politics to ram through job-killing measures at any cost, regardless of the consequences or damage to our economy. Rather than put a gun to the head of our largest economic engines, now is the time for the FCC to cease and desist,” he said.His views were shared by his rival for the committee gavel, Joe Barton, whose office said he did not believe in regulating the internet. “An unregulated internet has been a springboard for economic growth and [he] sees no need to reverse course,” his office said.Neither Mr Upton nor Mr Barton are new to Congress. But both are competing for approval from the ultra-conservative wing of the Republican party, and incoming Tea Party Republicans, to win the chairmanship of the energy committee, which has oversight over the FCC.Tea Party activists have not been shy about expressing their disdain for net neutrality rules, claiming that any regulation of how companies manage their online networks represents an affront to free speech.“Irrespective of where industry is on this, House Republicans will want to use this issue as a club,” said one Republican industry lobbyist. “If and when industry says to Republicans, ‘hey, this is not such a bad thing,’ House Republicans might say back, ‘We have our own issues with this.’”It is so far unclear how far Republicans may go to try to block the proposal from moving forward. FCC chairman Julius Genachowski needs the support of two other commissioners on the five-member panel to pass the rules at a planned December 21 meeting.Republicans in the House would like to call hearings on the new rules and could even seek to defund the measure once they retain the majority in the new year.Big US communications companies have traditionally opposed any net neutrality rules. But industry analysts said some of the biggest players, including Comcast and AT&T, believed the proposal set out by Mr Genachowski was a welcome rollback from tougher rules the Obama administration had originally supported.Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, said the FCC proposal offered certainty and closed the door on the debate.It was also likely that many companies with influence on Capitol Hill would not be affected by the regulations.But it was too early to tell, she added, whether the companies would be willing to challenge their Republican allies to see the proposal carried out or whether they would sit back and watch Republicans pick apart the FCC.
552;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;US cable groups win ground on net neutrality rules;;"The US cable and mobile communications industries have won important concessions from regulators over proposed “net neutrality” rules, as part of a broader retreat by Barack Obama’s administration from the tougher rules it had argued were needed to protect the openness of the internet.The plan, endorsed by Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, would remove uncertainty about the ability of cable companies to charge internet users and content providers for the amount of network capacity they use, which some analysts call “broadband rationing”.It would also allow mobile operators more freedom than regulators had originally proposed to favour some types of traffic on their networks over others, although it would prevent them from blocking services outright.The relaxation of the FCC’s proposals follows political opposition to stricter regulation that some feared would result in price controls, as well as a protracted battle with network companies who claimed it would discourage investment.Mr Genachowski said a ­proposal he announced at midnight on Tuesday to institute new regulations that would ­protect internet companies such as Google from being blocked had already received support from leading technology and internet companies, as well as broadband and consumer groups.Although the exact details of the plan have yet to be unveiled, analysts said the FCC had made two big concessions to US cable companies; freeing them from the threat of being regulated more closely in the way that telecommunications concerns are, and approval for the tiering practices that are already in place.While the cable companies would not be able to discriminate against certain types of traffic on their networks, such as video, they might be able to charge companies like Walt Disney or ­Netflix extra in return for guaranteeing quality, said Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.“This was a key concern for the cable industry,” she said. “I think it is a good win for them.”The plans gained cautious backing from cable and communications companies. Verizon applauded Mr Genachowski’s change in direction, while warning that his plan might be subject to legal challenge.Mr Genachowski’s proposals will be put to the FCC’s board of commissioners at a meeting on December 21. He is expected to win the support of two other Democratic commissioners at the five-member FCC even though both supported the adoption of more onerous restrictions on cable companies and other high speed internet providers."

Some investors are locking in profits given the performance of the markets.”The S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent to 1,180.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to close at 11,006.10 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.1 per cent lower at 2,498.23.The indices finished November almost flat, with the S&P 500 down 0.2 per cent over the month, after a sharp rally in September and October.Energy and consumer discretionary stocks led the risers over the month while the utilities and healthcare sectors suffered the most.On Tuesday, stocks pared their losses after positive data on the US economy.“Today’s catalyst for now is the Chicago PMI and the better-than-expected consumer confidence figures,” said Nino Jimenez, senior vice president at Brinson Patrick. “They point to the more largely followed ISM manufacturing index due out tomorrow as well as Friday’s employment numbers.”The Chicago Purchasing Manager’s Index showed business activity in the region climbed faster than expected in November, partly on the back of stronger employment.Improving confidence in the labour market helped US consumer confidence rise to its highest level in five months.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index pared its losses after the report and was down just 0.3 per cent. Supervalu, the grocery store operator, added 2.7 per cent to $9.04, department store owner Macy’s gained 1 per cent to $25.68 and clothing retailer Gap advanced 3.1 per cent to $21.36.But the housing market remained grim. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of house prices in 20 cities showed US house prices fell for the third month running in September.Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said 19 of the 20 cities showed a decline in prices for the month and he expected further declines before the end of the year.However the S&P 500 homebuilders index was up 1.2 per cent with Lennar gaining 1.3 per cent to $15.19 and DR Horton jumping 1.7 per cent to $10.04.In financials, Bank of America fell 3.2 per cent to $10.95 just before the close as investors speculated the bank could be at the centre of a future Wikileaks document release.Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, said in an interview with Forbes that his group plans to release tens of thousands of documents from a major US bank but would not identify the bank. In an interview last year with Computerworld, Mr Assange said he had obtained data from Bank of America.Bank of America said it is aware of WikiLeak’s claims but has not been contacted by the group or seen proof that it possesses any of the bank’s information.Shares in Goldman Sachswere down 1.8 per cent to $156.14 and Morgan Stanleylost 1.9 per cent to $24.46.The technology sector fell the most in the wider indices, down 1.4 per cent.Google dropped 4.5 per cent to $555.71 as the European Union said it had opened a full investigation after allegations from smaller online search providers that the US company had abused its dominant market position. There was also continued speculation that Google would bid for the Groupon discount website and it was reported that a possible offer could be between $5bn and $6bn.Comcast lost 0.9 per cent to $20.04 after it found itself at the centre of a dispute about how it handles video traffic on the internet as US regulators work to prepare “net neutrality” rules.The cable company was accused late on Monday of asking for fees for the first time in return for carrying internet movies and other traffic for Level 3, which provides streaming services. Level 3 edged up 0.5 per cent to $1.01.Ebay fell 3.6 per cent to $29.14 after it was downgraded by analysts at Piper Jaffray who said the auction site will lose market share in the next two years.Research in Motion jumped 4.8 per cent to $61.83 after analysts at Jeffries Group upgraded the BlackBerry maker, citing the company’s new QNX operating system.In deal news, shares in Baldor Electric Company put on 40.4 per cent to $63.31 after the maker of industrial motors agreed to be bought by Swiss-Swedish group ABB. The bid, worth $4.2bn including debt, will pay investors $63.50 a share, a 41 per cent premium to Monday’s closing price.
554;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast at the centre of ‘net neutrality’ row;;Comcast has found itself at the centre of a fresh row over alleged discrimination in the way it handles video traffic on the internet, as US regulators prepare to issue “net neutrality” rules aimed at preventing internet service providers from favouring selective content online.The US cable giant was accused late on Monday of demanding fees for the first time in return for carrying internet movies and other traffic for Level 3, an internet backbone network operator.Level 3 accused Comcast of “effectively putting up a toll booth” on its broadband networks so that it could unilaterally set the price for online content that competes with its own services.The Colorado-based company recently won a contract to carry video on behalf of Netflix, whose inroads into streaming movies pose a long-term challenge to Comcast’s own cable television business.Network operators normally abide by the internet’s “peering” arrangements which were originally intended to allow competing networks to carry each other’s traffic without charge on the assumption that costs would roughly balance out.Comcast said that there had been a doubling in the amount of traffic it was being asked to handle on behalf of Level 3, with the Netflix deal believed to account for the jump. It added that it was being asked to carry five times as much traffic for Level 3 as it sent in the other direction, which it said justified the imposition of fees.Comcast claimed that Level 3 had “inaccurately portrayed” a normal commercial negotiation between the two companies. It also accused it of being “simply duplicitous” in trying to turn the dispute into a row about net neutrality.The disagreement has spilled over into a public row at a sensitive time for Comcast. It is still awaiting regulatory approval for its planned acquisition of NBC Universal, which has been held up over concerns about Comcast’s outsized role in shaping the future of the video business.Also, the US Federal Communications Commission is expected to issue net neutrality rules before Christmas that seek to prevent the sort of discrimination of which Level 3 has accused Comcast. The action has been prompted partly by a court ruling earlier this year that upheld Comcast’s right to restrict access to BitTorrent, a service often used to carry pirated movies.Comcast moved quickly to limit the potential damage from Level 3’s accusations late on Monday, contacting regulators and Congressional representatives involved in the NBC Universal review to put forward its side of the case.In a blog post, the cable company said that it already charged other internet backbone companies the same fees that it was seeking to apply to Level 3. It added that the fees were justified by an imbalance between the amount of internet traffic it delivered to its subscribers on behalf of Level 3, compared to the amount of traffic that passed in the other direction.
555;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-11-28T17:33:32Z;Cable groups suffer as viewers switch to video streaming;;"Netflix, the DVD subscription service that also offers movies to be streamed online, has a share performance chart most companies would kill for.A year ago the stock was trading at $58; last week, after 12 months in which the company began to attract attention for its willingness to buy digital rights to Hollywood movies, the shares were hovering around $187.The company launched a $7.99 streaming-only subscription service last week, which fuelled a further jump in the shares. Yet its expansion, and the growth of rival online video services, such as Hulu, has come at a cost.Debate is raging in the US media industry about television viewers “cutting the cord” – abandoning traditional cable TV in favour of new, cheaper online video services.Recent data appear to support the theory that consumers are shifting online. Although the number of people subscribing to TV services offered by satellite or telecoms groups is growing, cable TV subscriptions have suffered their biggest drop in 30 years, according to figures compiled by SNL Kagan, the research firm.It is unclear how much of this decline can be attributed to online alternatives, although the high cost of TV services is clearly an issue, according to Spencer Wang, a media analyst with Credit Suisse.“We think we are now at the point where the pay-TV bundle exceeds what the market needs,” he wrote in a recent research note. “In 2009, the average US home received 128 channels, but watches only 38 in a week.”The cost of bundled services has risen above the rate of inflation, he says. “There is an increasing gap between the average price per channel received [versus what is] actually viewed.”But while cable companies such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable may be concerned by the rise of so-called “over the top” online alternatives, such as Hulu and Netflix, the growth of these services has yet to hit them in the pocket.This is partly because the larger cable groups diversified their businesses several years ago and now offer high-speed data and telephony services alongside their traditional video businesses.The ability of Comcast and its peers to “bundle” telephony and data services with video has, to date, protected them from swings in the number of people subscribing to pay TV. In fact, telephony and data services are more profitable than video, with a new generation of higher-margin subscribers fuelling cable earnings.“The point that is being missed here is that cable companies don’t just offer video,” says Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. “Cable companies are very focused on driving revenues and profits – and if that means sacrificing some low-end video subscribers, that’s a price worth paying.”All of the big cable operators are taking steps to stem the exodus of subscribers: Time Warner Cable last week launched a cut-price service with fewer bundled channels aimed at cost-conscious customers. Meanwhile, Comcast is taking steps to ensure that its subscribers can go online and get access to the programming and channels that are usually only available through their television sets.The company is also close to completing its protracted takeover of NBC Universal, a $30bn deal that will allow it to exploit NBC’s TV and film content on a range of platforms and distribution systems – not just over Comcast’s traditional cable business.Yet despite these initiatives, the streaming video providers are continuing to grow and court new customers. Netflix recently agreed a deal worth as much as $900m with three Hollywood studios – Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lions Gate Entertainment – to add their films to its streaming service. Hulu, which is owned by a consortium of companies including three owners of broadcast networks – Walt Disney, News Corp and, NBC Universal – is preparing an initial public offering to fund further expansion.Netflix has “all the hallmarks of a disruptive technology”, says Mr Wang.The response of the cable companies – and whether they succeed in retaining subscribers – will ultimately determine how much more disruptive it becomes."
556;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-11-20T00:49:13Z;FCC moves to ensure ‘net neutrality’;;The Federal Communications Commission is expected to announce plans next week for regulations that would forbid internet service providers from blocking or favouring content online.The so-called “net neutrality” rules could be passed by the commission as early as December 15. The move would fulfil a campaign promise by President Barack Obama and infuriate the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill, which has said it would oppose the plan, but would have little power to stop it.The FCC called the talk “speculative”, but industry executives familiar with its plan said they expected regulations to be launched to ensure ISPs could not hinder content delivery.The rules are expected to be modelled after legislation hammered out earlier this year by Congressman Henry Waxman, the outgoing Democratic chairman of the House energy and commerce committee.That legislation, which had won support from most big telecom and cable companies but not from Republicans in Congress, would have prohibited wireless carriers from blocking websites and prevented phone and cable groups from “unjustly or unreasonably” discriminating against lawful internet traffic.Although most telecom and cable companies initially resisted the push by Mr Genachowski and some Democrats to set net neutrality standards, the move could be begrudgingly welcomed by some of them.If the FCC passes such regulations it would likely defer – at least temporarily – a separate plan endorsed by Mr Genachowski for broadband providers to be subjected to a tighter regulatory regime known as “Title II”, which would open the door to price controls and other tough new rules.The FCC’s expected move could also benefit Comcast, the largest US cable operator, as it had feared that it alone would be subject to net neutrality regulations as part of its proposed $30bn takeover of NBC Universal.Should the FCC instead design an industry-wide policy, that might also speed regulators’ review of the NBCU deal, which hinges on how to regulate the fast-growing online video market.Regulators have focused on whether Comcast could use its network to favour NBC Universal content, or protect cable revenues by hobbling emerging services such as Hulu, the online video site, or Netflix’s streamed films.Disputes between cable system operators and broadcasters over fees for the carriage of their channels have also sparked a debate about whether similar rules should apply to online video sites as to cable and satellite operators.Opponents argue that this would amount to the FCC regulating the rapidly-evolving online video industry.Republicans on Capitol Hill responded to Mr Genachowski’s expected move with anger. In a letter, 18 members from the House energy committee asked him not to move forward with the plan.“Reigniting the network neutrality debate will only distract us from [other] work [at the FCC] and further jeopardise investment, innovation, and jobs,” they wrote.
557;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-11-17T21:31:21Z;Viewers pull plug on US cable television;;The number of people subscribing to US cable television services has suffered its biggest decline in 30 years as younger, tech-savvy viewers lead an exodus to web-based operations, such as Hulu and Netflix.The total number of subscribers to TV services provided by cable, satellite and telco operators fell by 119,000 in the third quarter, compared with a gain of 346,000 in the third quarter of 2009, according to SNL Kagan, a research company.Although television services offered by telecoms and satellite providers added subscribers over the period, cable operators were hard hit, with subscriber numbers falling by 741,000 – the largest decline in 30 years.The figures suggest that “cord-cutting” – one of the pay-television industry’s biggest fears – is becoming a reality as viewers drift to web-based platforms.Online TV services are stepping up their efforts to reach new viewers and become profitable: Hulu, which is owned by News Corp, Walt Disney and NBC Universal, has slashed the cost of its online subscription service by 20 per cent to $7.99 per month and offers a vast array of film and TV programming.Jason Kilar, Hulu’s chief executive, has maintained that Hulu, which is exploring an initial public offering, complements pay-television services.Yet the data suggest that the growth of Hulu and Netflix, the DVD subscription company which began testing a $7.99 per month streaming-only service last month, has become problematic for cable operators.Ian Olgeirson, senior analyst at SNL Kagan, said it was becoming “increasingly difficult” to dismiss the impact of web-based services on the pay-TV industry, “particularly after seeing declines during the period of the year that tends to produce the largest subscriber gains due to seasonal shifts back to television viewing and subscription packages”.Hulu’s revenues are increasing sharply: the company is projected to generate more than $240m in 2010, up from $108m in 2009. It has extended the number of devices that can access its subscription service to include Sony’s PlayStation 3 console and will add internet-connected devices, including Vizio, LG Electronics and Panasonic Blu-ray players, in the next few months.Devices such as Apple’s iPad also appear to be accelerating the move away from traditional multichannel television.Research from The Diffusion Group, a technology research company, found that more than a third of iPad users were likely to cancel their pay-TV subscriptions in the next six months.The cable industry has launched a vigorous defence against cord-cutting: companies such as Comcast, which has agreed to buy NBC Universal, are backing “TV Everywhere”, which gives subscribers access to channels and programming online, and via their cable box.
558;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-10-31T23:19:44Z;Cablevision meets Fox’s fee rise;;The standoff between Cablevision and Fox, the television network, came to an end this weekend.It means programmes from Fox, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, were beamed back into the homes of the 3m Cablevision customers in the north-east of the US.Cablevision will pay an increased rate to carry Fox programming – though terms of the new deal were not disclosed.The spat emphasises the shifting economics of the television business – and its outcome could have consequences for similar deals in the future.Fox had withheld its three public stations and three cable stations from Cablevision since October 16, when the deadline for a renewed contract expired. Fox demanded an increase in the fees that Cablevision paid to carry its content. Cablevision said the fee hike was unreasonable.Details of the negotiations were not revealed, but Cablevision said Fox was asking for a more than doubling of their annual fees, from $70m to $150m. Fox said that figure was inaccurate.When it became clear no agreement was near, Cablevision called on the US Federal Communications Commission to intervene.The company asked for binding arbitration with Fox – but Fox refused.The FCC encouraged both sides to come to terms, but declined to intervene.In a statement announcing the end of the standoff, the cable company made it clear it was not happy with the terms of the deal.“In the absence of any meaningful action from the FCC, Cablevision has agreed to pay Fox an unfair price for multiple channels of its programming including many in which our customers have little or no interest,” the company said.“Cablevision conceded because it does not think its customers should any longer be denied the Fox programmes [that] they wish to see.”The two week standoff set off a war of words between the two companies, with Cablevision seeking to associate Fox with its parent company, News Corp, and Fox suggesting that Cablevision was seeking exceptional terms for itself.The rhetoric was intensified because in addition to the steep fees in play, the outcome of this standoff – which is the longest in recent memory – will serve to set the tone as, in future, deals come up to be renewed.With the FCC declining to intervene, cable companies may go on the defensive, while networks may feel sufficiently emboldened to increase their fees.The spat could also affect the regulatory approval process for Comcast’s takeover of NBC Universal. That deal would give control of an important network to the country’s largest cable company.During the two week blackout, Cablevision customers missed the first two games of the baseball World Series, as well as many other sporting events.Fox programming returned in time for the third game of the World Series.
559;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-10-27T20:28:54Z;Upbeat earnings fail to cheer US investors;;Better-than-expected earnings from consumer goods companies including Procter & Gamble and Whirlpool failed to cheer investors, who focused instead on their cautious outlooks.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent to 1,182.45 on Wednesday, after paring its losses in the late afternoon as the rise in the dollar began to falter.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to close at 11,126.36 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,503.26.P&G edged up 0.4 per cent to $63.08 but the consumer staples index still fell by 0.5 per cent after the world’s largest consumer products company reported its quarterly earnings.Profit in its first quarter fell 6.8 per cent after it sold a pharmaceuticals division and suffered from rising commodity costs.But earnings were still slightly better than expected and sales just missed analysts’ estimates.The company also forecast earnings for the second quarter within a range that was a little less than it previously predicted because of commodity costs and a rise in marketing spending as a percentage of sales.“I think relative to where [P&G rival] Kimberly-Clark came in [on Tuesday], this is a pretty positive earnings report,” said Hank Smith, chief equity investment officer at Haverford Investments. “There’s a little bit of similarity to way back in the early-1990s when there was a period of economic weakness and a lot of branded companies were impacted. Its not a secular phenomenon, it's a cyclical fact.”He added that cost-cutting and strength in emerging markets was softening the blow at P&G.Shares in Kimberly-Clark suffered on Tuesday, falling 5.8 per cent, after it posted a 19 per cent drop in profit and lowered its forecasts because of rising materials costs.They continued to slide on Wednesday, down 0.4 per cent to $62.35.The consumer discretionary sector lost 0.5 per cent after home appliance makers beat expectations but warned that the outlook was volatile.Whirlpool said sales remained flat and it beat profit expectations by tightly controlling costs.Sales fell in the US and Europe as consumers refrained from buying large ticket items, some of which are closely tied to buying a new house, but sales grew in emerging markets. Its shares sunk 4.1 per cent to $81.04.Whirlpool’s announcement mirrored that of its Swedish competitor Electrolux, which reported its results earlier in the European session.US-listed shares in Electrolux dropped 4.4 per cent to $48.10.Before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures extended losses after a durable goods report showed that orders rose more than expected in September. But when the volatile transportation sector was excluded, orders actually fell.The S&P 500 industrials index lost 0.7 per cent with Boeing declining by 0.6 per cent to $70.86 and Caterpillar down by 0.6 per cent to $78.22.Dan Greenhaus, chief economist at Miller-Tabak, said business spending had shown a noticeable slowing over the past few months and it was one of the reasons why third-quarter GDP, due to be released on Friday, will not show a meaningful surprise on the upside.Elsewhere in earnings news, Comcast climbed 3.2 per cent to $20.27 after the largest cable operator in the US beat expectations with its quarterly earnings, excluding the costs related to its deal to take control of NBC Universal.Revenue was also better than expected as it sold more packages offering cable, phone and internet service, pushing up revenue per video customer and helping to compensate for customers who cut services because of the economy.But Sprint Nextel dropped 9.9 per cent to $4.30 after the mobile phone carrier reported a larger loss than expected.The company subsidised customer upgrades to phones capable of working on its new networks.The number of contract customers, who pay their bills after making the calls, fell at a lower rate but the company was still losing these valuable subscribers.
560;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Comcast quarterly profits fall 8.2%;;Comcast, the biggest US cable provider, said on Wednesday that its third-quarter profits fell as customers pared back television services amid a weak economy and the growing capabilities of online video content.Net income at Comcast declined by 8.2 per cent to $867m, or 31 cents a share, down from $944m, or 33 cents in the same period a year ago. That beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts, boosting its shares by 0.05 per cent to $19.65 in pre-market trading on Wednesday.“We are increasing the pace of innovation and new product introductions to our customers,” Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We believe this focus on consistently improving the customer experience and on driving profitable growth will further strengthen our competitive position.”The Philadelphia-based company did increase revenues, which rose by 7.3 per cent to $9.5bn. In spite of a 3.5 per cent decline in video customers, Comcast succeeded at luring more people to its high-speed internet and voice services, and signed more subscribers to high-end packages that combine these services.Comcast said it saw strong advertising across its cable networks and that revenues at its programming division grew by 11.3 per cent to $1.3bn. It is continuing work towards integrating NBC Universal into its business and incurred $21m in transaction costs related to that deal during the quarter.Last month Comcast said that Steve Burke, its chief operating officer would become chief executive of NBC Universal, replacing Jeff Zucker, once the proposed acquisition of a majority stake in the company closed.,
561;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-10-26T21:12:40Z;Fox and Cablevision dispute set to hit World Series;Battle of two media companies goes into a second week;Millions of television viewers in the New York and Philadelphia regions look set to miss the Major League Baseball World Series as a dispute between Cablevision and Fox stretches into a second week.Cablevision, cable provider to about 3m people in the US north-east, and Fox, the network owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, are locked in bitter battle over the fees that cable companies pay to networks to carry their programming.When their existing deal expired on October 15, Fox pulled three cable and three local stations from Cablevision.The two companies have not met since last Thursday, and there are few signs that an agreement will be reached by the time the World Series gets under way.Cablevision accuses Fox of “bad faith” negotiations, and says the News Corp subsidiary is seeking to more than double the fees it collects, from $70m to $150m a year.“News Corp never engaged in real negotiations, they only made a ‘take it or leave it’ proposal,” Cablevision said. “They timed the Fox blackout to leverage major national sporting events to force Cablevision to accept unreasonable demands.”Cablevision is calling for arbitration and is encouraging the Federal Communications Commission to intercede. Fox denies it was asking for such a high sum and has rejected Cablevision’s calls for arbitration.On Friday, the FCC sent letters to both companies asking for updates on the negotiations, but has so far not signalled that it will get further involved.“Cablevision and Fox are spending more time attacking each other through ads and lobbyists than sitting down at the negotiating table,” said Julius Genachowski, chairman of the FCC.New York and Philadelphia baseball fans are already disappointed after both cities’ teams – the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies – were knocked out of contention for the sport’s biggest prize by the two finalists over the weekend. The World Series will instead see the Texas Rangers face the San Francisco Giants starting Wednesday evening.The spat could threaten to complicate Comcast’s takeover of NBC Universal, currently under review by regulators. The deal would give Comcast, the largest cable company in the US, control of the NBC network and several prominent cable channels.Some politicians and analysts suggest clearance of that deal could give Comcast too much leverage and allow it to charge other cable companies higher rates to carry NBC programming.Comcast called such claims “incoherent”.
562;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Facebook success spurs investment interest;;The explosive growth of Facebook has triggered a new boom in early-stage internet investment, with news on Thursday of a new, $250m fund aimed at start-ups looking to profit from the social networking phenomenon.Run by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, one of Silicon Valley’s best-known venture capital firms, the handful of investors in the fund includes a group of established internet companies, including Facebook, Amazon and Zynga, a fast-growing company that makes games for users of Facebook.The unusual decision to include as investors companies with a direct interest in different aspects of the internet will have an impact on how the fund is invested.Bing Gordon, the Kleiner partner who will oversee the fund, said the new investment vehicle will not invest in any new games companies to rival Zynga.The company, which dominates the rankings of leading games played on Facebook, has already been backed separately by Kleiner.The limitation could exclude the fund from one of the most active areas of social networking, given the soaring popularity of games that connect users with their friends. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, said games had become the first popular applications to be developed for social networks, as they were on earlier new computing platforms, like the PC.The new investment vehicle, called the sFund, echoes earlier Kleiner efforts to cash in on new computing platforms with the potential to attract millions of new users. These include its iFund, which has $200m to invest in applications that run on Apple’s touchscreen devices.While that fund was launched even before the iPhone was opened to outside applications, however, the social networking vehicle, called the sFund, comes three years after Facebook took a similar step, allowing outsiders to create applications for its users.John Doerr, a Kleiner partner, said that the firm had decided to create the fund only after witnessing the recent, explosive growth of Zynga.The backers of the sFund painted the rise of social networking as a phenomenon that would totally transform internet behaviour, creating big opportunities for a new wave of online companies.Mr Zuckerberg said “over the next five years or so” social networking would make it possible to “pick any industry and rethink it”, as internet experiences are redesigned to take into account social connections.The other investors in the sFund are media companies Comcast and Liberty Media, along with Allen & Co, a media investment bank, and Kleiner itself.
563;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Customer service via social networks;;"When Jimmie Sanchez had a late night problem recently with the website of Best Buy, the leading US electronics retailer, the California resident turned to Twitter, the online social messaging service. “Been trying to buy a laptop (and more) on bestbuy.com for 4 days. Keeps saying “online ordering unavailable.” Don’t u want my $?”, he wrote, in a frustated message to Best Buy’s “@twelpforce” Twitter account.A Best Buy employee soon responded, apologizing for the apparent problem, and asking Mr Sanchez to send the details to the company’s customer service team. The exchange was typical of the thousands of interactions now being handled by US consumer companies, as they seek to adapt their traditional customer service operations to the rise of social media.Best Buy launched its “Twelpforce” in 2009, alongside a range of commonly found customer service tools, including phone help lines, click to chat, and “frequently asked questions” section on its website, fed by an extensive range of open customer discussion forums.Best Buy was one of the first companies to take an active position on Twitter as the medium gained prominence rapidly last year. And just two years ago, according to Thor Muller, founder of Get Satisfaction, which helps companies set up and manage social forums, “companies were largely ignoring social media”. Since then, he says, “there has been something of an arms race to embrace social media as an opportunity.”“They now see it not just as low-cost marketing opportunity through word-of-mouth, but also as a way to demonstrate their customer centricity, putting customers first.”Companies are also responding to the fact that services such as YouTube, Yelp, and Facebook allow individuals to air their complaints with new power, as demonstrated by the musician who made a music video out of his unfortunate baggage experience with United Airlines.“Customers are empowered to put those complaints on a business’ front door,” says Steve Rubel, head of insight at Edelman Interactive.Best Buy’s Twelpforce represents an unusually open approach to social media; while the account is seen by the retailer’s traditional customer service department, it also extends to a network of registered Best Buy store employees, who can pitch in at any time to offer solutions or ideas in response to customer queries.But Fiona Dias, head of strategy at GSI Commerce, an e-commerce service provider, argues that Best Buy’s high profile effort, and its democratic approach are a reflection of its particular corporate culture, and is not something that can be easily emulated by other companies.“Best Buy had already embraced a more devolved approach to its business that was unusual in the industry, so it was easier for them to accept the more open approach,” says Ms Dias.Other brands have sought instead to use Twitter to actively engage disgruntled customers, using a model most famously pioneered at Comcast, the US cable company. Starting in early 2008, and led by Frank Eliason, a customer care executive, the company began searching Twitter to find and hopefully assuage troubled customers. Last year, Brian Roberts, CEO, said the effort had “changed the culture” at Comcast, and praised Mr Eliason when he moved on this summer to become head of social media at Citigroup.The approach, with Mr Eliason and a team hunting down disgruntled Tweeters, fits into what Mr Rubel describes as a “digital embassies” approach to emerging social networking channels.“You need a presence in each major hub where your consumers are hanging out. And you need to have a community ambassador, or manager, listening and responding.”Whirlpool, the kitchen and home appliances maker whose brands include Maytag and Kitchen Aid, this year also started to make public responses online an existing effort to engage with unhappy customers. According to Brian Snyder, a senior manager of interactive communication, the company had since early 2008 been using a small customer-care team, dubbed “digital detectives”, to identify and privately contact customers who had made public complaints on social media sites.But since the complaints were dealt with privately, “it looked to anyone else that we had a user with a problem, and we were not helping them,” says Mr Snyder.The dealing with problems more publicly, he says, met with “some pushback” internally at first. “People said we were creating a new customer service channel. Our answer was that we didn’t create it, the channel had already been created by our customers.”Companies also face tensions over the way that social networks break down the traditional divisions between their customer service and their marketing departments – since social media can be used both to deal with complaints and advice, and with word-of-mouth marketing.Mr Rubel at Edelman Interactive argues the companies now have to view consumers behaviour on Twitter, Facebook, and on review sites such as Yelp “holistically”, in a way that breaks down the traditional divisions between marketing and customer service, and which can also communicate to other parts of the company as well.“The systems have to get smarter …linking those channels together is really important, and that involves deep business integration.”Mr Muller, at Get Satisfaction, points out that engaging with social networks has a dramatic impact on the way customer service departments work, since handling customer complaints or queries becomes intricately connected to the more intangible business of marketing. “Customer service teams tend to be more conservative, with metrics tending to be focused around costs per call. Now there is a wider opportunity,” he says.Meanwhile, despite the changes underway, Mr Snyder at Whirlpool says that phones still account for the bulk of customer contacts, as they do across the customer service world.“It’s small but important, and it’s growing,” he says of the volume of social networking contacts. “And we are learning things that will help us in the future.”"
564;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-09-24T23:50:20Z;Zucker to leave NBC Universal early;;Jeff Zucker will make an earlier-than-expected exit from NBC Universal, stepping down after three turbulent years as chief executive once Comcast completes its takeover of the broadcaster, cable channel operator and film studio owner.“Two weeks ago I had a conversation with Steve Burke [Comcast’s chief operating officer] where he made it clear that was what they wanted to happen,” Mr Zucker told the Financial Times, adding that he had thought Comcast might choose other people for the leadership since before the deal was announced. “I’ve been at peace with this for some time.”The news comes just months after General Electric and Vivendi, NBCU’s current owners, extended his contract until 2013, allowing him to leave with a near three-year pay-off and GE options, which vest when the deal closes.People close to the situation said Mr Zucker had struggled to build a strong working relationship with Comcast, led by Brian Roberts, and that he was highly emotional as he broke the news to ­colleagues.“The company is going to change. It is going to be a different company, and I didn’t want to be a guest in my own house,” Mr Zucker said, although he added that he remained a believer in the deal, which values NBCU at $30bn, and hoped that his successor would “keep going with the strategy that’s playing out”.Mr Zucker said a political career was “of interest” but he had no imminent political plans and could look at opportunities in ­producing, sports and ­journalism.His exit is expected to see Mr Burke take control of the combined NBCU and Comcast entertainment properties, at least in the short term. Insiders said that Comcast had been cautious about sharing longer-term plans with NBCU.Most analysts had expected Mr Zucker to leave after the deal closed, but the news comes at a time when he is still presenting the two companies’ case to regulators in Washington.Comcast agreed in December to buy 51 per cent of NBCU from GE and Vivendi, with the French media group selling its entire 20 per cent holding. The deal is expected to close towards the end of this year, pending final regulatory approval.“Although regulatory processes can be unpredictable, we expect to close the Comcast deal in the fourth quarter,” said Jeff Immelt, chairman of GE.Mr Zucker began his career at NBC 25 years ago, quickly rising from researcher to produce the Today Show at the age of 26. As chief executive, however, he has faced criticism for his management of NBC’s entertainment properties, notably after a failed attempt to shake up its core broadcast network’s prime-time schedule.He was mocked, sometimes by comedians on his own payroll, for the reshuffling of Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien, and the jury is still out on the scripted programming that now fills the evening schedule.By contrast, cable properties such as USA Network and Bravo grew strongly and Mr Immelt sang Mr Zucker’s praises. “He has always stepped up when the company needed him. He never blinked when it came to tough decisions.”Mr Zucker said: “I think I was creative and innovative. I think I took a lot of risk, I put diversity on the agenda and I created a culture of co-operation and collaboration I’m incredibly proud of. I do wish this had been a simpler time.”He added: “I turned this into a hell of a cable network company and expanded internationally and digitally and dealt with a cost stucture in an economically challenging time.”
565;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Letter from Jeff Zucker;;"From: Zucker, Jeff (NBC Universal)Sent: Friday, September 24, 2010 10:58 AMTo: NBC Universal Employee Communications (NBC Universal)Subject: A Note from Jeff ZuckerSeptember 24, 2010Well, the time has come. This time, to tell you a little news about me.When Comcast assumes control of NBC Universal, I will leave the company.It has not been an easy or simple decision. I have spent my entire adult life here, more than 24 years. This is the only place I have ever worked. The only professional thing I have ever known. I met my wife here, enjoyed the birth of our four children in that time, worked in almost every division of the company. And forged relationships, both professional and personal, that will last a lifetime.I remember, vividly, the first day I came to work here in August, 1986. I walked to work at 30 Rockefeller Plaza that day; it was humid and my shirt was soaking by the time I got there. In the years since, I have enjoyed nothing but sheer pleasure in having the names NBC and Universal on my business cards. Sure, there have been ups and downs in the last quarter century. But when I step back, and think about what we’ve been through, I feel nothing but pride and joy. It has been a great run and I’ve been incredibly fortunate.Now, it is clear to me that this is the right decision for me and for the company. Comcast will be a great new steward, just as GE has been, and they deserve the chance to implement their own vision.I am proud that they will inherit a company in very good shape, with almost every one of our divisions enjoying their best year ever. The current strength of the company is a tribute to every one of you and the terrific leadership team that is in place.We’ll talk more about the shape of the company in the months ahead. For now, I just wanted you to know my plans. I won’t be going anywhere until the day the deal closes, and that day is still months away. There is plenty left to do, and we have an obligation to each other to maintain what we have already built. I will continue to approach everything we do with the long-term interest of the company in mind, just as I always have; I know no other way.I don’t yet know what my future will bring. I’ve spent the last 24 years thinking only about NBC Universal, and never contemplated anything else. I haven’t even begun to think about the next chapter. But I wanted to be honest with you about this news as soon as I could.I love NBC Universal. And always will. And I am grateful to each of you.My most heartfelt thanks."
566;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-09-22T09:19:10Z;Book review: ‘Empowered’;;"Customers have more power than ever thanks to ‘groundswell’ technologies including the YouTube Video. As some companies have found to their cost (remember the Comcast service engineer caught napping video) in this new world customers can easily make their complaints public and viral.In Empowered, Josh Bernoff and Ted Schaeder, top Forrester Research executives argue that in order to thrive in today’s connected world, companies must empower their employees to solve empowered customers’ problems using the same technological tools like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook that customers are using to sound their attack.The book, published last week by harvard Business Reeview Press, expands on the theme of ‘Groundswell,’ the 2008 business best seller co-authored by Bernoff, and addresses the new management challenges taht have arisen as companies engage with their customers.As Stephene Gillett, chief information officer of Starbuck Coffee Company, writes on the book jacket: “Our personal and business worlds have changed;Empowered is the blueprint for digital immigrants and natives to sucessfully participate.”Below is an excerpt of the book taken from Part 1.Why your business needs HEROesWhen Dooce rants, it’s sheer poetry. Breathtaking in honesty and scope, Dooce’s rants about motherhood have a quality that people appreciate, especially other mothers. You do not want to be the target of one of those rants.Dooce is a thirty-four-year-old woman named Heather Armstrong. In August of 2009 she reached the end of her tether. Marlo, Heather’s second child, had arrived two months earlier, in June. Heather knew what new babies mean: lots and lots of laundry. Her old Kenmore washer was failing. So she bought the big, heavy-duty clothes washer from Maytag, the company that for decades has advertised its dependability, and on top of that, she bought the ten-year warranty.Twelve weeks into the life of baby number two, the Maytag was not doing its dependability thing. Heather’s poetic rants appear on her blog, at dooce.com. Here’s an excerpt from her rant about the Maytag, titled “Containing a capital letter or two”:So, yeah. The damn thing broke a week after it was delivered. Started giving us this error reading and wouldn’t ﬁll up with water …So we called, complained, and they sent out a repairman. He shows up three days later and is all, yeah, gonna have to order parts. That’s going to take another seven to ten days.Ten days later the repairman shows up to ﬁx the machine because the part has been delivered, and oops! Guess he didn’t order all the parts he needed! Going to have to order more parts! Another seven to ten days!It takes a poet to tell compelling stories that include baby poop. Google “Maytag washer poor service” if you want to see the post; it’s in the top four results.As it turns out, Heather’s sort of popular. Her book about mothering and postpartum depression,2 It Sucked and Then I Cried: How I Had a Baby, a Breakdown, and a Much Needed Margarita, made the New York Times bestseller list in April of 2009. Her blog has a readership of about 350,000 unique visitors a month.Let’s skip to the end here. Maytag’s third visit to repair the machine failed. Heather called customer service. Back to the poetic rant:I call the service department, explain in great detail what has happened, and she says that Maytag has a policy that they will not replace a brand new machine unless it is documented that someone has tried to ﬁx it at least three times. WHA?? WHA-HAAA? And I tell her that someone has been out to my house three times, and she says, yeah, but he’s only tried to ﬁx it once …Okay then, I say, almost begging at this point, almost to the point of tears, is there anyone I can talk to who might see what I’ve been through and understand? And here’s where I say, do you know what Twitter is? Because I have over a million followers on Twitter. If I say something about my terrible experience on Twitter do you think someone will help me? And she says in the most condescending tone and hiss ever uttered, “Yes, I know what Twitter is. And no, that will not matter.”Bad move, Maytag. Because now Heather starts tweeting. Her million-plus devoted followers on Twitter see this:So that you may not have to suffer like we have: DO NOT EVER BUY A MAYTAG. I repeat: OUR MAYTAG EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE.Have I mentioned what a nightmare our experience was with Maytag? No? A TOTAL NIGHTMARE.Now Whirlpool (Maytag’s parent company) will tell you this story has a happy ending. Whirlpool monitors social media; they see the tweets.3 Unable to contact her by phone, they tweet back from their (admittedly seldom used) @WhirlpoolCorp account. Heather sends her phone number, and Whirlpool calls her the next morning. A more competent repair person comes and fixes the machine.But the damage has been done. A million people have seen the tweets; how many have written off Maytag forever? Heather will not retract her rant; it’s true, after all, and as she told us, “No one should have to go through this.”Her original blog post attracts 2,906 comments. Forbes writes a story about it.4Whirlpool says it learned from what happened. Now it responds to tweets like this in public, on Twitter. That may make a difference in the future. But for now, it’s clear that in a contest between a poetic blogger with a twelve-week-old and a 67,000-employee, $17-billion multinational company, there’s no contest. The blogger won.unleash your employeesIndividuals like Heather now have incredible amounts of power over companies. And not only through social technologies like blogs. With their smartphones they can connect from anywhere, anytime. They’ve got video. They’ve got Google, Facebook, and a thousand Internet startups empowering them.Your company is not and cannot be nimble enough to serve them. With your established processes and departmental boundaries, you move too slowly.Only your employees can help. And only if you unleash them.The same technologies that empower your customers are available to your employees. Right now, they’re using Facebook, YouTube, and Wikipedia and getting ideas about how to help your business. Technology is cheap and easy now. In marketing, in sales, and yes, in customer support, your staff are not just interested in reaching out to customers. In fact, they’re ready to build solutions, applications, and systems that will transform your business. The question is: will you let them? You must, and here’s why:To succeed with empowered customers, you must empower your employees to solve customer problems.This is much harder than it sounds. It means your staff are going to be coming up with solutions on their own. The ideas don’t come from management; management’s new job is to support and empower employees. The technology doesn’t come from the information technology department; IT’s new job is to support and encourage employees. It’s a complete inversion of the top-down way companies run. And it’s the only way to thrive in the age of the empowered customer.Before you decide this is impossible, we’d like to show you a real, large, successful company where it’s working: the electronics retailer Best Buy.Best Buy empowers its workforceJosh Korin is a recruiter—his job is to help companies hire people. Like thousands of other people, he bought an Apple iPhone at Best Buy in February 2009. Because Josh doesn’t like downtime, he also bought Best Buy’s $14.99-a-month Geek Squad Black Tie product protection plan.When the iPhone conked out six months after he bought it, he was annoyed of course, but he also felt pretty smart for buying that protection offered him a BlackBerry as a loaner until the iPhone was ﬁxed. Josh reread the protection plan agreement and decided what he was owed was another iPhone, not a substitute. The manager at the Best Buy wouldn’t budge, though. So Josh began to exercise his voice as an empowered individual.As soon as he got home on August 29, Josh Korin’s 596 Twitter followers saw dozens of messages from a very angry man. Here are a few. (The “@username” messages here are directed at a particular Twitter member, while the # indicates a “hashtag” included to make tweets show up in searches on that term.)Worst #customerservice ever? @bestbuy!! What’s the point of Geek Squad phone insurance, if you replace an iPhone with a blackberry?#geeksquad whats the deal with your iPhone protection plan? replace an iPhone with a BlackBerry, WTF?! @bestbuy honor your insurance plan!Even though Josh was tweeting his complaints on a Saturday, two things happened right away. One was that Best Buy’s CMO, Barry Judge—one of the main supporters of Best Buy’s Twitter response force—responded from his own Twitter account at @bestbuycmo. He saw Josh’s tweet since it mentioned his Twitter user name.And second, Coral Biegler stepped in. Coral is a “community connector”—her job is to monitor Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and other forms of social communication for problems just like this. And she (@coral_bestbuy) immediately responded with this message:@joshkorin I understand this is frustrating, thanks for patience …I will be in ofﬁce tomorrow to research & respond #twelpforceThis message is directed to Josh, but the tag “#twelpforce” indicates that it comes from Best Buy’s Twitter Help Force. The Twelpforce includes both dedicated employees like Coral and members of Best Buy’s blue-shirted floor sales team and Geek Squad service representatives. If you include “#twelpforce” in your tweets, any one of twentyfive hundred Best Buy employees who have signed up with Twelpforce could respond and try to help you out. They do it over a hundred times every day. (Check it out: go to http://twitter.com/twelpforce and you’ll see all the responses.)Coral called Josh Korin at home the next day, a Sunday. She arranged for him to go down to the store and get a loaner until his phone was ﬁxed. “Coral was unbelievable,” Josh told us. “She consistently said, ‘I will ﬁnd you a resolution, since you walked out of the store not satisﬁed, and that’s not OK.’”But what Coral didn’t know at the time is that Josh’s wife is @interactiveAmy, a Twitter member with over three thousand followers who gives presentations at places like the Social Media Breakfast group of Chicago (#smbchicago). Here’s what interactiveAmy’s Twitter followers were hearing:@coral_bestbuy just told the story of how u & @twelpforce helped @joshkorin to #smbchicago, they were so impressed!! Great job #bestbuy!Josh Korin and his well-connected wife never got to create an avalanche of negative word of mouth for Best Buy, because Best Buy, with some timely, well-placed intervention, turned these detractors into promoters.the HERO-powered businessWe’ve got a word for people like Coral Biegler, John Bernier, and the rest of the people at Best Buy—and in companies all over the world—who are taking technology into their own hands and creating solutions for customer problems. They are highly empowered and resourceful operatives: HEROes for short.Coral Biegler is a HERO in customer service. Twelpforce is a HERO brigade. None of these people is an IT professional, but all of them are comfortable using technology to solve customer problems. They’re empowered and resourceful because Best Buy is run in such a way that they can be. It’s a HERO-powered business.When we published Groundswell in 2008, the challenge was creating strategies for connecting with customers in social environments like Facebook or blogs. As more and more companies do this, the challenge has shifted. The problem is not just connecting with empowered customers, it’s what this engagement does to corporations. It’s a management challenge. Because these technology projects are grassroots solutions conceived by HEROes, not top-down management initiatives, they require a transformation in the way companies operate.Adapted from Empowered: Unleash Your Employees, Energise Your Customers, and Transform Your Business by Josh Bernoff and Ted Schadler (Harvard Business Review Press).

567;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-09-20T16:37:41Z;India’s Sahara in talks to rescue MGM;;Sahara India Pariwar, an Indian media-to-sports conglomerate, is in talks to rescue Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the debt-ridden Hollywood studio, in a move that would deepen ties between Bollywood and Hollywood.The Indian group, controlled by billionaire industrialist Subrata Roy, is prepared to pay up to half of the $3.7bn debt accumulated by the famed US film studio, which owns ‘Gone with the Wind’ and the James Bond series, according to a person familiar with the matter, Sahara would receive an equity stake in the company in return.Sahara had no official comment on Monday except to confirm that the two companies were in talks. “On mutual interest, discussions are on, but it is too early to comment on the issue,” it said, stressing that the talks were at an early stage.Shares in Sahara One Media and Entertainment, a listed subsidiary of Sahara India Pariwar, rose as much as 5.49 per cent in early trading on Monday in Mumbai, while the Bombay Stock Exchange’s benchmark Sensex traded up 1.27 per cent.MGM has been in the hands of its lenders for almost a year after it became unable to service its huge debt, amassed when it was taken over in 2005 by a consortium comprising private equity firms, Sony and Comcast.Several potential buyers have had their eye on MGM in the past year, including Anil Ambani, the Indian billionaire who controls Reliance Big Entertainment, Lions Gate Entertainment, Time Warner and Spyglass Entertainment.However, no one has yet come forward with a credible offer and creditors are preparing to take over the studio next month in a streamlined bankruptcy.Mr Roy – one of India’s most flamboyant businessmen with strong political contacts and many friends in Mumbai’s glamorous film circle – has been looking for ways to bring Bollywood closer to Hollywood, according to people close to him.Sahara, which sponsors the national cricket and hockey teams, recently spent a record $370m to buy a cricket team in the Indian Premier League, and was in talks to acquire Liverpool Football Club before it abandoned discussions in August.
568;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-09-15T21:21:51Z;Sprint rules out Clearwire purchase for now;;Sprint Nextel, the third largest US mobile network operator, is not interested in buying out its partners in Clearwire, the US WiMax network operator, at this stage, but may consider such a transaction later.Robert Brust, Sprint Nextel’s chief financial officer, told investors that a Clearwire buyout would be too expensive at present. He was responding to analysts’ speculation that Sprint Nextel might seek full ownership of Clearwire in order to increase its control of operational issues such as plans to expand into new markets and adopt other 4G technologies.Sprint Nextel currently owns about 55 per cent of Clearwire with the rest of Clearwire’s equity spread between a group of cable companies including Comcast and Time Warner, and technology partners including Intel and Google.Clearwire is building a nationwide network based on a next generation technology called WiMax which supports much faster mobile data connections than the 3G mobile networks which are currently used.However Sprint Nextel and Clearwire have indicated that they may embrace a rival 4G technology called LTE which has been widely adopted by mobile network operators in the US and overseas. This, coupled with speculation that Sprint Nextel might want to reposition Wimax as a wireless alternative to fixed line broadband, has fuelled speculation that Sprint Nextel might seek to buy out its Clearwire partners.But in response to questions during a webcast of an investor conference, Mr Brust rejected the idea of an acquisition, at least in the near term, while acknowledging that it would help Sprint to have full control.“The path that’s probably likely is that we’ll continue to infuse some equity (investments) over the coming years and maybe some way down the road to take control of it.” he said. “An imminent move on that would just be very expensive.”
569;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Wealthy Americans shift from paper to screen;;The readership of print media among the wealthiest US consumers dropped 16 per cent in 2010 from the year before, while their internet usage rose 12 per cent, according to a new survey.The shift from paper to screen was particularly marked among younger consumers, who spent more time online and read fewer magazines and newspapers than the average.In a further bad sign for the media industry, consumption of business and financial news dropped across print, television and the web, according to the Mendelsohn Affluent Survey of heads of households making more than $100,000 a year. “There’s one category that went down in all three [platforms],” Bob Shullman, Ipsos Mendelson president, told the Financial Times. “We’re living in turbulent times.”The industry has made significant investments in business news programming on television and online.There are an estimated 44m affluent consumers in the US, representing 21 per cent of American households but holding 60 per cent of total income and 70 per cent of consumer wealth, according to Ipsos Mendelsohn, the media research group that conducts the annual survey. The survey of 13,804 individuals asked about interests and spending habits, including media consumption, travel and leisure activities.“These people drive the US economy”, Mr Shullman said.The number of affluent consumers who watched business, financial and economic news on television and online video dropped 28 per cent from 2009, while personal finance and investing programs fell 23 per cent. Business and financial news in print declined 20 per cent, and business and investing websites drew 10 per cent fewer viewers.In addition, the survey recorded a 7 per cent drop in the number of consumers who plan to invest in stocks, mutual funds or other assets in the next year.The apparent drop-off in interest may be a troubling sign for the media industry, which has made significant investments in business news programming on television and online. That includes Thomson’s acquisition of Reuters in 2007 and News Corp’s launch of Fox Business the same year, in addition to the growth of CNBC, which was seen as key attraction in Comcast’s purchase of NBC Universal. Thomson Reuters recently launched a new video platform to connect financial services professionals with clients, and Bloomberg has made heavy investments in video content for its terminals and for Bloomberg Television.Mr Shullman said that the decline in print readership did not represent a decline in overall content consumption, but rather a shift to new platforms.“This was the inflection point”, he said. “It’s part and parcel of the way [the younger] generational group grew up. Kids live on the internet.”That claim is supported by the number of affluent consumers who use smartphones, e-readers and tablet computers such as Apple’s iPad. Of the 44m affluent heads of household, 14.5m own smartphones, 2m own e-readers and nearly 1m own tablets. In addition, more than a third have downloaded apps to their devices.The growing popularity of the iPad is expected to boost those numbers, Mr Shullman said, with another 1.4m affluent consumers saying they plan to buy a tablet, 1.7m planning to buy an e-reader and 4.5m planning to buy a smartphone.Affluent consumers tend to be early adopters of technology, Mr Shullman said, noting that 98 per cent of the group has access to the internet.

571;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-09-01T17:13:52Z;Buoyant Vivendi raises full-year targets;;Vivendi, Europe’s largest entertainment group, raised its annual profit targets after revealing better-than-expected earnings that were lifted by its recently acquired Brazilian and French broadband operations and its fast-growing video games business.The French company posted sales of €13.98bn ($17.91bn), up 6.1 per cent on the same period in 2009, and earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of €3.24bn, up 11.9 per cent on a like-for-like basis.Vivendi raised its full-year objectives, predicting higher net profit than the €2.59bn achieved in 2009.Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive, argued that the company’s “return to growth” was a vindication of his acquisitions strategy. He singled out last year’s purchase of GVT, the Brazilian broadband provider, for $4.2bn, a price at the upper end of analysts’ valuations.GVT reported a 39 per cent increase in first-half sales and a 49 per cent increase in adjusted ebitda as it accelerated its roll-out of high-speed internet services across Brazil.Vivendi said that it planned to step up its investments in extending GVT’s network to Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. GVT also intends to launch a pay-TV product, making use of Vivendi’s expertise with Canal Plus, its French broadcaster.Some analysts raised concerns at the purchase of GVT last year, pointing to its small scale alongside powerful competitors in the Brazilian market, including Spain’s Telefónica. But Mr Lévy described the acquisition as “the most important strategic decision we have taken in the last few years”.The group’s performance was also boosted by strong broadband sales at SFR following the 2008 purchase of fixed-line operator Neuf Cegetel. The French telecoms business, in which it has a 56 per cent stake, posted a 6.6 per cent rise in operating profit.Vivendi was also buoyed by its video games business, a world-leader by sales following the purchase of Activision in 2007, which saw first-half revenues of €1.7bn.Vivendi’s more recently acquired businesses helped offset declining or slowing sales growth at its more traditional operations, including Universal Music Group and SFR’s mobile operations.Investor concerns about Vivendi’s acquisitions strategy and potential damages stemming from a class-action lawsuit in the US have weighed on its share price this year.Vivendi is set to receive a downpayment of $2bn from the proposed sale of its 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal before the US broadcaster’s merger with rival Comcast. Mr Lévy said that he thought the NBC deal could be completed by the end of the year, which would bring Vivendi a further $3.8bn.As for potential acquisitions, Mr Lévy said that Vivendi’s priorities were to buy the 44 per cent stake in SFR owned by Vodafone and the 20 per cent stake in Canal Plus France owned by Lagardère.Lagardère said that it would float its Canal Plus stake after failing to agree a price with Vivendi.Vivendi’s adjusted net profit rose 4 per cent to €1.53bn. Its shares closed nearly 5 per cent up at €19.26.
572;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-08-24T18:58:37Z;Entertainment: A pointer to profits;Legal ‘streaming’ services offer studios fresh ways to use the web;Maddy Cross likes to watch television but like many American teenagers she does not bother to use a television set. The 18-year-old drama student will shortly leave her home in Santa Monica, California, to study at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. There was a time when a TV was an essential fixture in any student’s room but Maddy has no plans to take one with her.“I’m moving into a dorm and we decided there wasn’t any point in getting one,” she explains. “We can watch everything we want on our laptops using Netflix and Hulu, which means we don’t have to buy a TV or pay for cable.”With digital piracy costing millions of dollars in lost revenue every year, Hollywood used to be frightened of the internet. While those fears still exist, the growth and expansion of legal online subscription services such as Netflix and Hulu, which deliver or “stream” TV programmes and films on demand over the web, is upending business models that have survived intact for decades, and causing both excitement and anxiety in the entertainment industry.For the first time large sums are being spent on streaming rights, creating new profits for an industry beset by soaring talent and marketing costs and slumping DVD sales.“We’re here to show Hollywood that it can make money online,” says Ted Sarandos, Netflix chief content officer.The stakes are about to rise further in the sector. Apple, according to people familiar with the situation, is considering a significant price cut and reconfiguration of its much-maligned Apple TV device, launched amid great fanfare three years ago promising to connect the living room set with the internet. Google also wants to move into TV, and is working on software that will be integrated into new TV sets, allowing viewers to search for programmes much as they search the web.Meanwhile, Hulu, an online video site owned by the TV networks NBC Universal, News Corporation’s Fox, Walt Disney’s ABC and Providence Equity Partners, has recently launched a subscription service. It is also exploring an initial public offering that could value it at $2bn. Any proceeds will be spent on content deals – buying the rights to show films and programmes, bolstering a line-up that includes hit shows such as Modern Family, 30 Rock and The Office.The fact that Ms Cross and her generation consume media differently from their predecessors – they have grown up streaming video and will pay for the convenience of watching an unlimited amount of what they want when they want – is good news for the likes of Netflix and Hulu. But it is a challenge for the cable and satellite TV operators that deliver programming into the home, such as US-based Comcast and DirecTV, which have for years relied on customers’ willingness to pay for large bundles of channels.The cash-strapped young are leading those shunning cable subscription. The sector lost more than 700,000 subscribers in the US in the second quarter of the year – its worst loss ever, according to SNL Kagan, a research company. This was partly because of competition from satellite operators and telecommunications groups such as Verizon. But new streaming or “over the top” services such as Hulu were also a factor, says Mariam Rondeli of SNL Kagan. “There’s definitely some substitution taking place.”For Netflix, the pay-TV industry is as ripe for revolution as the DVD rental market was a decade ago. “DVD rental used to require the customer to drive to the store,” says Mr Sarandos, adding that this was inefficient. So Netflix launched a by-mail service – Lovefilm provides a similar service in the UK – and in the process brought Blockbuster, the former market leader in rentals, to its knees.Netflix’s DVD service has amassed 15m subscribers in the past 10 years, who have access to both the by-mail and streaming services. It spends $600m a year posting DVDs to US customers but wants to shift them to online streaming. It says 60 per cent have already tried the service, using internet-connected Blu-ray disc players, or web-enabled TV sets and games consoles, such as Microsoft’s Xbox. Netflix is available only in the US but the company hopes to launch a streaming-only service in Canada in the next few months and, next year, in the UK, according to a person familiar with the situation.The internet “thrives on inefficiency”, says Mr Sarandos, adding that with cable TV, “the inefficiency is in the cost – you may have to pay $100-$150 a month for your cable subscription and there may only be a few channels that you want to watch”.…Netflix, by contrast, costs $9 a month and subscribers have access to thousands of hours of on-demand film and TV programmes. Mr Sarandos says he is prepared to “write big cheques” to strike fresh content deals with studios, producers and pay-TV companies, using the money saved on postage as customers shift from its DVD subscription service to streaming.This is music to the ears of Hollywood studio executives worried about the decline of DVD sales, once the most profitable revenue stream but now in steep decline, falling from $14bn at its peak in the US in 2004 to $10.87bn in 2009, according to Screen Digest, a research company.For Netflix, the aim is to amass as much content as possible. It recently struck a five-year deal worth an estimated $900m with Epix, a new cable TV channel owned by Paramount Pictures, Lionsgate Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.This deal will give it the right to show movies ranging from the blockbuster 2009 remake of Star Trek to Oscar-nominated critical hits such as last year’s Precious. “Phones have been ringing around town with studio chairmen demanding to know why they aren’t getting that kind of money for their streaming rights,” says one studio executive.Starz, the pay-TV channel owned by John Malone’s Liberty Media – which licenses films from Walt Disney and Sony Pictures – also has a streaming deal with Netflix. But pay-TV channel HBO, the market leader that makes its own premium programmes such as The Sopranos, The Wire and True Blood as well as showing the latest Hollywood films, is unwilling to share content with a potential competitor. “We believe the bedrock of the pay-TV business is exclusivity,” says Eric Kessler, HBO co-president.HBO has close to 30m US subscribers and a similar number again worldwide paying to watch its content. It has vowed to keep its films and TV shows off the Netflix streaming service. “Every year we spend $1.5bn on content, whether it’s content we acquire from Hollywood or content we make ourselves,” says Mr Kessler. “We believe it makes no sense to take that investment and allow someone else to build their own business by giving it to their customers.” It is a business model that has served HBO well so far: the company generated operating profits of $1.2bn from revenues of $3.9bn in its last fiscal year.HBO is about to launch HBO Go, a streaming service, which will allow its subscribers to watch its films and TV shows on web-connected devices, such as iPads or smartphones. “If you want to watch Avatar, then the only place you’ll be able to stream it will be on HBO Go,” says Mr Kessler.In a bid to retain subscribers, cable operators that distribute HBO, such as Comcast, have also created streaming services that allow their viewers to watch programming for which they have already paid on mobile devices.Mr Sarandos says he would rather work with HBO and its rivals than compete against them directly with the studios and producers that make films for streaming rights. “But if we don’t work together then we have no other choice than to be a head-to-head competitor …and will have to buy product out from underneath them.” It has already struck a deal with US-based production company Relativity Media, which has financed or produced more than 200 films and which will shortly release The Fighter, starring Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. The deal gives Netflix the right to stream Relativity films before they are aired on pay-TV channels. Netflix also recently streamed the adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo when it was released on DVD and before it was broadcast on pay-TV.The rivalry between Netflix and HBO has not affected the pay-TV channel’s subscriber base – at least, not yet. If anything, the two services seem to be complementary. In San Francisco, Netflix’s strongest market, HBO subscriptions have risen in the past four years.But that could change if Netflix and HBO find themselves bidding for the same film deals – or if Netflix decides to start making its own programming. The jury is also out on what effect Netflix, Hulu and new TV services from Apple and Google will have on cable and satellite operators that carry channels such as HBO. “Cable will go the way of the landline phone industry,” predicts Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “It is nothing more than an empty pipe which the internet will replace.”…Others disagree. “People like watching cable TV – they like choice,” says Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. Big live events that draw millions of views, including news as well as entertainment, are not suited to streaming. “If you want to watch live sport or American Idol then you have to have pay-TV.”The bigger question, he says, is what the new streaming services mean for the future of DVDs, the great Hollywood cash cow. “It’s a big question for the studios – they [should] spend less on making movies because the DVD is beginning to die.”Still, since Netflix set a high bar with the Epix deal, studios can expect to receive more for streaming rights to their content. And if Hulu completes an IPO and expands, as anticipated, into the UK and Japan, among other countries, there will be more money in the marketplace to buy digital rights for TV programming.This is good news for makers of films and TV shows because, after years of failing to live up to expectations, digital delivery is at last yielding decent returns. This will not have gone unnoticed at Comcast, the biggest US cable group: it has agreed to buy NBC Universal, one of Hulu’s founding shareholders, in a deal that values the network at $30bn. The acquisition is awaiting regulatory approval but, assuming it is passed, will leave the cable operator with a vast array of film and TV programming to exploit online.“Netflix has the most expansive strategy that we’ve seen and is leading the pack,” says Arash Amel, an analyst with Screen Digest. “But anybody who can assemble enough content can now become a distributor of content over the web into the home. The rules of the game have changed.”
573;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-08-05T21:02:57Z;Net neutrality;Google and Verizon are working on a bilateral agreement;The telecoms industry is developing a habit of shooting itself in the foot. Cable operator Comcast blasted away by challenging the Federal Communications Commission’s right to regulate broadband – its court victory in April threw the structure of regulation into doubt. Now, amid delicate negotiations between the FCC and interested industries to establish rules for how internet services are carried over communications networks, it emerges that Google and Verizon are working on a bilateral agreement. Given what is at stake, the smell of singed boot leather is unmistakable.The headline issue is net neutrality – the principle that there should be no discrimination between different types of internet traffic. Advocates, which until now included Google, want to prevent broadband providers favouring one site over another: for instance allowing faster access to Hulu than YouTube. As four-fifths of US households have only two choices of broadband supplier, there is insufficient competition to ensure this principle is observed.Wireless is perhaps more competitive (although the FCC no longer regards it as effectively so). And capacity limits suggest a case for not applying net neutrality here. But the underlying nature and aims of telecoms regulation itself are at stake. Should the priority be to extend broadband coverage and speed (the US ranks 23rd internationally for access, notes Bernstein Research), or to bring down prices? The FCC is already taking steps to reclassify broadband as a Title II industry, which would give it sweeping powers including the right to regulate prices.It may be that Google and Verizon hope to lead the FCC’s negotiations out of a dead end by example. But the future profitability of the whole telecom industry is uncertain. Trigger-happy actions around an already intensely polarised net neutrality debate are likely to lessen the chance of a favourable outcome.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
574;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Floating asset values might sink market;;The fight against moving to a floating net asset value for US money market funds is gathering strength. Four large business groups last month sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, urging them to reject the idea of a floating NAV.The US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Corporate Treasurers, the Association for Financial Professionals, and Financial Executives International said in their July 21 letter that, if regulators were to do away with money funds’ stable $1 NAV, the expected flight of investors from such funds would “severely impair the ability of companies to raise capital in the US and undermine efforts to strengthen the American economy”.The groups were joined in the letter by more than half a dozen large companies, including Comcast, CVS Caremark and Safeway.Paul Schott Stevens, president and chief executive of the Investment Company Institute, the fund industry trade body, referred to the letter last week in his opening address to Crane’s Money Fund Symposium in Boston. “At ICI, we have been making this case [against a floating NAV] to anyone who will listen and urging users of money market funds and issuers in the money markets to speak out,” he said. “And I’m pleased to report that they are responding.”Mr Stevens said that more than 40 companies either signed the recent letter or others that ask the president’s working group to drop the idea. Issuance of the president’s working group report has been delayed, and Mr Stevens said it was unclear when it would be released.The SEC, which is also waiting to see the working group’s views on this issue, has said that mandating a floating NAV is a possibility within its second round of rule making to reform the regulatory structure for money funds. (Its first round was finalised earlier this year.) The agency views the floating NAV as a way for money funds to reduce systemic risk.The ICI has repeatedly voiced its opposition, and Mr Stevens sought to make the case in his speech, in front of more than 300 conference delegates, that both retail and institutional investors have voted with their feet for a stable NAV.“For almost a year, taxable money market funds have paid their investors an average yield of less than one tenth of 1 per cent. Yet at the end of May, investors still had $2,500bn [£1,603bn, €1,923bn] invested in taxable money market funds. That compares with just $200bn in higher-yielding short-term bond funds, whose share prices vary day to day,” he said.Mr Stevens also noted that the American Bankers Association supports the ICI’s position with respect to the stable NAV.“Banks don’t want large institutional deposits,” he said. “In fact, banks now ‘sweep’ institutional deposits off their books and into money market funds and other short-term instruments so that the banks can avoid carrying large demand balances.“Wiping out stable value money market funds won’t make banks any more eager to assume those liabilities.”Indeed, the four groups that sent the letter to the SEC and Mr Geithner say there are “no immediate substitutes” for money market funds. They note that unregulated private pools of assets might be a possibility but that encouraging investors to move money into these vehicles does not seem consistent with efforts to reduce risk.Mr Stevens said private investment vehicles are already drawing institutional dollars out of money market funds.He also called attention to the positive impact the SEC’s new rules for money funds are already having. As an example, he said that last December, 15 per cent of taxable money market funds had a weighted average maturity longer than 60 days. By May, he said, that was down to 2 per cent of these funds. He noted that this was before the rule amendments requiring shorter maturities had entirely kicked in.During his speech, Mr Stevens also briefly described the ICI’s work with the industry to create a liquidity backstop for prime money market funds – another means, it says, of reducing risk within the money fund industry – but he did not provide any new details on the facility and whether it will actually be created.He said as well that the ICI will work with the SEC to create an appropriate standard of creditworthiness for money market fund instruments that complies with the new Dodd-Frank legislation.Beagan Wilcox Volz is associate editor at Ignites.com, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared
575;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-07-28T21:00:03Z;Wall St falls on durable goods data and poor forecasts;;US equities fell on Wednesday after lower-than-expected orders for durable goods, a mixed picture from the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book and cautious outlooks from Boeing and ArcelorMittal weighed on market sentiment.The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent at 1,106.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to close at 10,497.88 and the Nasdaq was 1 per cent lower to close at 2,264.56.Before the opening bell, data showing unexpectedly low orders for durable goods added to concerns that economic growth may have slowed in the second quarter. New orders for long-lasting US manufactured goods dropped 1 per cent in June after a revised 0.8 per cent fall in May, making the decline the largest since last August. Analysts had expected orders to rise 1 per cent.But the markets did not fall any further when the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book was released later in the day. The Book, which is a wider survey of business, said that the US economy was growing but that there were signs of a slowdown in some regions over the past two months.The S&P has hovered around its 200-day moving average for a third session in a row. Ray Velazquez, managing director of Mizuho Securities, said that in spite of a better than expected earnings season stocks would trade in a tight range for the next quarter or two. He said concerns about the economy meant investors would pay little attention to a stock’s fundamentals until unemployment came down.Both Boeing and ArcelorMittal beat expectations in the second quarter but were cautious about the rest of the year.Boeing reported a second-quarter net profit of $1.06 per share, beating the forecast of $1.01 per share. But the aircraft manufacturer said its profit outlook was lower than analysts’ consensus. The shares dropped 1.9 per cent to $67.32.US-listed shares in ArcelorMittal fell 2.8 per cent to $31.11 after it was also cautious about its outlook, warning that the combination of slowing growth in China, a seasonal drop in activity and higher raw material costs would push down third-quarter earnings by up to 30 per cent.The world’s biggest steelmaker beat expectations in its second quarter, with net income at $1.7bn, after a loss of $792m for the same quarter of last year.Century Aluminum plummeted 9.3 per cent to $9.57 after it reported lower-than-expected net earnings of $5.1m for the second quarter, which were helped by a gain on forward contracts.Some companies did rise after reporting earnings, with Sprint Nextel nudging up 0.2 per cent to $4.84. The US mobile phone carrier said its net loss had widened to $760m, or 25 cents a share, from $384m, or 13 cents, a year earlier. But fewer monthly bill-paying customers left than analysts had expected.The world’s largest commercial real estate broker, CB Richard Ellis Group, jumped 7.6 per cent to $16.58 after it moved into the black and reported its strongest revenue growth since 2007. It announced earnings of 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of 2 cents per share a year ago.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group , was flat at $54.44. It reported better than expected profit for the quarter and said it would sell its stake in Lukoil, Russia’s largest independent oil company.Shares in CVS Caremark, the largest US provider of prescription drugs, rose 3.1 per cent to $31.54 after the company signed a 12-year contract with Aetna, the health insurer, and in spite of it lowering its forecasts. For the full year, earnings excluding some items will be at least $2.68 a share, compared with an earlier minimum of $2.77.Comcast shares rose 1.2 per cent to $19.56 after it reported a better than expected 6 per cent rise in quarterly revenue. But the cable company’s profit was cut by fees paid as part of its acquisition of NBC Universal, falling to $884m compared with $967m for the same period a year before.In deal news, American Oil & Gas gained 6.3 per cent to $7.11. Hess Corporation will acquire the oil and gas exploration and development company.
576;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Hulu eyes launching global pay platform;;Hulu, the online video service owned by News Corp, Walt Disney and NBC Universal, plans to launch a subscription service internationally following the US release of the service last week.Hulu Plus, which allows viewers to watch full series of shows such as The Office, Glee and Family Guy on a range of devices for $9.99 per month, has already attracted thousands of subscribers.The Hulu application, which is required to run the paid service on Apple’s iPhone or iPad, was the most downloaded application from Apple’s Apps store in its first six days of release.But while the service has the potential to upset traditional pay-TV companies such as Comcast, which are struggling with the migration of audiences to other online platforms and devices, Jason Kilar, Hulu’s chief executive, said the two could co-exist.“It’s inaccurate to consider Hulu as a substitute for cable or pay TV services,” he told the Financial Times.Hulu would never compete with pay-TV operators for live sports rights or for premium content only available on paid-for cable channels, such as Time Warner’s HBO, he added.“You have to think of Hulu to a smartphone as cable TV is to a laptop …this is about a need that’s going unmet.”Its plans may yet be affected by the imminent $30bn takeover of NBC Universal, one of Hulu’s founding shareholders, by Comcast, the US cable group. Mr Kilar declined to comment on Comcast but other shareholders in Hulu have privately expressed concern that Comcast may see Hulu as competition and want to curb the site’s growth.Hulu has been working on an international launch for several months and has identified the UK and Japan as two markets where its free site and subscription model could feasibly work. It has been in lengthy discussions with ITV about starting a Hulu service in the UK although no date has been set for launch.The tangled international rights to each programme on the site has held up the international plans, although Mr Kilar expressed confidence that the US model could be replicated elsewhere. “We won’t be satisfied until this is a global service,” he said.The company has struck deals with a range of consumer electronics groups to ensure that Hulu Plus can be found on multiple devices. Hulu Plus will be available on Sony games devices such as the PlayStation 3 as well as via Samsung TVs. Discussions are ongoing with Microsoft about putting Hulu Plus on the XBox console. “We want to work with any screen connected with the internet,” said Mr Kilar.The media companies that started Hulu wanted to tap into a generation of viewers comfortable with watching TV and movies on devices other than TV sets.“We want to make sure that our focus is on serving an unmet need with broadcast content,” said Mr Kilar.
577;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-07-05T22:24:38Z;Apple likely to spoil Sun Valley’s summer;;Deal talk used to dominate the unofficial agenda of Sun Valley, the annual summer gathering of media, tech and finance moguls.Capital Cities/ABC’s merger with Disney in 1996 and the imminent takeover of NBC Universal by Comcast were both ideas seeded at the exclusive conference sponsored by Allen & Co, the boutique media investment bank.But this week, the chatter will centre on the one invited guest not yet expected to attend – Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple.As late as last week, Mr Jobs had told some associates he planned to skip the event, while relaying to others that he was “leaning against” attending, but was undecided.He has only attended twice in the last 27 years.Ketchum, Idaho, is once a year transformed from being a sleepy ski resort town into a billionaires’ summer camp.But the mood this year will also be decidedly less relaxed than at some previous gatherings. The meeting is sure to witness skirmishes in a crucial battle to shape the media world for the next decade.Mr Jobs is in an arms race with Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, for the future of mobile media and television.Apple’s iPhones and iPad digital tablet devices compete for market share with dozens of devices that run Google’s Android software platform.The fate of a constellation of media executives, whose companies have recovered somewhat from a severe advertising drought last year, rests on the outcome of the war.“The Apple versus Google fight is now a media fight,” said one senior media executive expected to attend the conference. “It’s a big deal and it’s on everybody’s mind.”Chief executives attending the meeting include Rupert Murdoch of News Corp, Barry Diller of IAC, Robert Iger of Disney, and Brian Roberts of Comcast.The pivotal role content plays in the success of both Apple and Google has given the media industry leverage in the platform war. But the economics of digital media in an Apple or Google-dominated future remain under pressure.“The Apple store has been about 99 cents music and they’re trying to drive the price [of films and TV programmes] down,” the senior executive said. “Google starts at zero.”Media companies have favoured Apple’s closed system, which recalls the “walled garden” business model of AOL, when access to entertainment and news required signing up for the service – and revenues to content companies were guaranteed.The lustre of the iPad has also captured the attention of media executives, who have tended to have held off adopting new technology in their personal lives.“A lot of media guys who never got it are using the iPad,” one media executive said.“It’s a different kind of interest than I have ever seen before.”Google, whose mission is to organise the world’s information and to generate income from advertising against content, prefers an open system.Although Mr Murdoch spent last year waging a public relations offensive against Google for acting like a “content kleptomaniac,” his attitude against the group has softened, said one executive close to the company.News Corp has been in talks with Mr Schmidt about forming pay models for news, he added.Google has also stepped up its war with Apple with the debut of Google TV, software which connects television to the vast libraries of the internet.Google TV – which has attracted the backing of Sony, Adobe, Intel and Dish Network – has pushed Apple to rethink its lacklustre television technology, according to executives in contact with Apple.Both companies have failed to rally any substantial support for TV initiatives from content companies.But Sun Valley would not maintain its mystique without at least one tidbit of deal speculation.Disney denied in late May that it was actively seeking a buyer for its ABC television network and stations – but the talk has not died down, said one media executive.Additional reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco
578;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Apple targets on-demand film market;;Apple is on course to become the second-largest provider of paid on-demand movies in the US by the end of 2010, leapfrogging Time Warner Cable and setting itself up as viable competitor to the cable TV industry.The group’s iTunes store, which sells movies to buy or rent electronically, has grown faster than video-on-demand services operated by Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest cable providers, according to Screen Digest, the media research firm.Screen Digest is projecting that more people will be buying or renting movies via iTunes than on Time Warner Cable’s video-on-demand service by the end of the year.The firm estimates that movie spending on iTunes will have overtaken the video-on-demand service operated by Comcast, the largest provider, by 2014. “This year we expect Apple will generate $280m in movie spending from 35m transactions, compared with Time Warner Cable, which will generate $160m from 31m transactions,” said Arash Amel, research director for digital media at Screen Digest.Comcast would generate $385m from 90m transactions in 2010, he added. But its share of consumer spending is expected to decline in line with Apple’s growth. “By 2014, we predict Apple will be $470m from 56m transactions while Comcast will be $400m from 108m.”Apple’s growth is worrying for the cable industry, which has traditionally used video-on-demand to drive subscriptions.Cable operators are offering free on-demand movies and TV shows bundled with subscriptions to prevent customer churn. “Cable operators have ceded ground in paid video-on-demand to Apple,” said Mr Amel. “Apple’s growth shows consumers don’t just want to watch movies on their TVs.”Hollywood is increasingly interested in video-on-demand as digital piracy spirals and sales of DVDs decline. Nine movie websites offering illegal copies of films were shut down in the US this week as part of a government crackdown.“Apple’s paid-on-demand services provide a legal alternative to illegal movies,” said Mr Amel. But he added that Hollywood could not afford to be complacent about the biggest threat to its future. “Piracy for the movie business in the next decade is already threatening to be what it was for the music industry in the last decade.”
579;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-06-28T23:29:04Z;Obama pledges to increase internet capacity;;Barack Obama on Monday pledged to speed up the availability of high-speed internet across the US by nearly doubling the availability of airwaves during the next 10 years.A memorandum signed by the US president would free up 500 megahertz of spectrum held by both the US government and US corporations to fulfil an ever-growing demand for broadband services.But the pronouncement comes as relations between the White House and the communications industry are increasingly fraught. Mr Obama’s move represents his first high-stakes pledge after months of wrangling between the Federal Communications Commission and the leading communications providers in the US – including Comcast, Verizon and AT&T – over planned tougher regulations.The proposal outlined by Mr Obama would force US government agencies that are sitting on under-utilised spectrum to give up the airwave space. The White House is also looking to television companies to give up spectrum voluntarily.The spectrum would then be auctioned, which could raise tens of billions of dollars in proceeds that would compensate the companies and help pay for a new $12bn to $16bn network for public safety.But companies have been sceptical about the plan. The National Association of Broadcasters, a lobby group, on Monday said Congress’s “first priority” should be to investigate “fallow” or unused spectrum. One broadcast executive told the Financial Times that it appeared that the White House was moving away from talks of mandatory or involuntary recovery of spectrum.“Nobody opposes a voluntary plan,” the person said.Wireless internet companies like AT&T and Verizon, which have seen a steady increase in demand for their services given the explosion in consumers’ use of smartphones and other devices, are eager to increase their spectrum supply.Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said: “It is going to help all the wireless broadband providers be able to keep pace with demand and it feeds into the goal of the National Broadband Plan introduced by the FCC.”But she added that, at the moment, AT&T and Verizon had enough spectrum to increase their networks and could be alarmed at being shut out of a future auction for more spectrum. Such a move, which analysts say appears increasingly likely, would strongly benefit those companies’ rivals.The White House on Monday focused on the economic impact of its broadband plan. In a speech at the New America Foundation, economic adviser Lawrence Summers said the policy was a “win” three times over.“It creates prosperity and jobs while at the same time raising revenue for public purposes like public safety and increasing our ability to compete internationally,” Mr Summers said.“At their root these initiatives involve the government acting as a catalyst for private sector investments and growth.”But the communications industry has said the Obama administration’s overall policy on broadband, and a move to seek greater regulatory oversight of companies were doing the opposite.The spectrum policy outlined by the White House is technically separate from the regulatory proposal, but the politics are nevertheless becoming difficult for the administration.
580;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-06-18T00:35:10Z;FCC in move to regulate internet;;The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday took its first formal step towards the adoption of new regulations for the broadband industry, setting the stage for what could become one of the most expensive lobbying campaigns to hit Capitol Hill by major telecommunications and cable providers.In a 3-2 vote along party lines, Democrats at the FCC on Thursday agreed to begin formal consideration to adopt new rules for high- speed internet companies such as AT&T and Comcast, which have until now operated virtually free of the FCC’s oversight. Technically, the FCC’s majority passed a motion to “open for comment” new broadband rules, the first step to passing the rules.The move represents a difficult political situation for the White House, which appears to be on a collision course with Democrats in Congress, many of whom support AT&T, Verizon and others and have voiced opposition to the FCC’s plan. It will also test the lobbying prowess of Google and other technology groups that strongly favour greater regulation of broadband companies but have less experience in Washington than the communications industry.Julius Genachowski, FCC chairman, has said the media regulator would seek only limited enhancement to its regulatory powers. But the legal change Mr Genachowski is pursuing, which would change the classification of broadband providers from Title I information services to Title II telecommunications services, would legally give the FCC far greater authority to enforce rate changes and unbundling.The FCC and, by extension, the Obama administration, faces a tough adversary which has many friends on Capitol Hill.AT&T on Thursday slammed the FCC proposal, which it said created “investment uncertainty at a time when certainty is most needed” and could cost jobs. The company said it supported handing the issue to Congress, a prospect “far less risky to jobs and investment than the FCC’s current path”.Senator Jay Rockefeller, the Democratic chairman of the Senate commerce committee, which oversees the FCC, said he supported the FCC, but added: “In the short term, this is the right course and the right thing to do. In the long term, I believe we need to develop consensus to update the law, further safeguard consumers, and spur universal broadband deployment.”
581;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-06-13T22:42:07Z;Cablevision near to $1.3bn deal for Bresnan;;Cablevision, the US cable company controlled by the Dolan family, was on Sunday poised to announce the purchase of Bresnan Communications for $1.3bn.The deal, which could be announced as soon as Monday, according to people familiar with the matter, will extend Cablevision’s reach beyond its core market in the New York tri-state area.Bresnan, which is majority owned by Providence Equity Partners, operates in the Rocky Mountain states, areas where it faces little direct competition.Providence bought Bres­nan for $525m in 2003. Comcast, a rival cable company, and private equity groups Quadrangle and TD Capital also have stakes in the company.Providence Equity Partners declined to comment while Cablevision could not immediately be reached for comment.Cablevision’s return to dealmaking could leave its investors uneasy.In spite of operating one of the country’s most profitable and efficiently run cable systems, the Dolan family have alarmed investors over the years with erratic decisions, including the founders’ decision to create a rival satellite pay television service a few years ago, before abandoning the venture.The company also paid about $650m in 2008 to buy Newsday, the Long Island tabloid newspaper, after a bidding war with Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corp. It was later forced to write down much of that investment.More recently, Cablevision has been in the good graces of shareholders. It last year decided to spin-off its Madison Square Garden live entertainment and sports franchise division, appeasing shareholders who pushed the operator to break up the company to unlock value.But word of the company’s interest in Bresnan sent its stock price tumbling by more than 5 per cent last week, before recovering by the end of the week.Bresnan operates cable systems in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming and Utah, serving about 320,000 subscribers.Although it is not close to any large cable systems, the auction, which began in March, also attracted the attention of John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media, who once controlled the largest US cable company before selling it to AT&T.Cable companies often look to buy rivals that are close to their existing networks, in order to save on costs.Bresnan was founded in 1984 by William Bresnan, who died last year.Credit Suisse and UBS are believed to be advising Providence on the sale of Bresnan.

This is not a happy time for companies with the nation in their name or origins. As BP struggles with a catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, angry locals have lashed out at what they see as haughty demeanour by the company and its “toffee-nosed” boss, Tony Hayward. British Airways, meanwhile, is in a stand-off with striking cabin crew who call it “Brutish Airways”.Faith placed in national corporate flagships can lead to disillusion, as Scots discovered when Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland, part of HBOS, had to be rescued by the taxpayer. Changing a company’s name, though, does not necessarily resolve the problem.BP has not been British Petroleum since 1998, one of several that slimmed down to initials in the age of globalisation – including BAE (formerly British Aerospace), BG (British Gas), BT (British Telecom) and BTG (British Technology Group). It also signalled the end of the era of state-owned dinosaurs such as British Leyland, British Steel and British Shipbuilders.British Airways is one of only six FTSE 350 companies that still have “British” in their title, along with British American Tobacco, British Assets Trust, British Empire Securities and General Trust, British Land and British Sky Broadcasting.This has not protected BP from being derided as “Bayou Polluter”. Just as British actors always play the villain in US movies, scorn has been directed at Mr Hayward. A Florida professor asked on the BBC: “This Tiny Hayward person, this head of BP, is he a lord or a duke or a knight? My knowledge of aristocracy is pretty vague.”Mr Hayward is no aristocrat: he went to a state grammar school outside Reading and read geology at Birmingham University. Of course BP must be held to account for any failings leading to the explosion and for its handling of the disaster. One understands the pain Louisiana feels.But BP’s nationality is beside the point. Past disasters have involved US companies, such as Occidental Oil’s Piper Alpha explosion in the North Sea in 1988 and the gas leak at Union Carbide’s plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984. Blaming the mother country helps no one.Setting the PaceDavid Cameron made a smart choice of location for his first speech as prime minister on Friday – the offices of digital TV company Pace in Shipley, Yorkshire. Pace has just become the world’s largest supplier of set-top boxes, leapfrogging Motorola of the US and France’s Technicolor, formerly Thomson.With the north of England fearing it will bear the brunt of public spending cuts, it will need companies like Pace if the private sector is to rise to the challenge. When Neil Gaydon became chief executive four years ago, Pace – formerly a darling of the dotcom boom – was close to bankruptcy and seemed likely to be taken over.He turned it round by curbing costs, improving reliability, doing a deal with pay-TV giant Comcast in the US and mounting a bold reverse takeover of Philips’s set-top box division. “For Yorkshire to have the world’s leader in a market that is changing the way we watch TV is a real achievement,” Mr Gaydon says.Mr Cameron was at pains to say he wanted to transform the UK’s economy so that it is no longer so heavily dependent on the City or the south east at the expense of manufacturing and the northern regions. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat business secretary, said northern regional development agencies would get “preferential treatment” when £293m ($426m) of cuts are shared out among RDAs.But the north, with long memories of the deindustrialisation it suffered in Margaret Thatcher’s time, will remain wary of the much bigger cuts to come. Parts of it are heavily dependent on public spending, so it is hard to see how it can avoid a bigger share of the pain.Trouble in TivoliHow did Jamaica’s Tivoli Gardens, scene of a drugs war, get its evocative name? Apparently it was named after a local theatre when the slum district was rebuilt in 1963. There are Tivoli theatres all round the world, presumably taking their cue from Copenhagen’s Tivoli Gardens amusement park and Paris’s Jardin de Tivoli, both of which derived from the gardens of the Villa d’Este in Tivoli, Italy.

583;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-05-25T00:14:18Z;US legislators seek changes to telecoms rules;;Top lawmakers in Congress on Monday announced they want to rewrite the law that regulates the communications industry, a move that could complicate efforts by the Obama administration to issue its own rules on broadband providers such as AT&T and Comcast.Senator John Rockefeller and Congressman Henry Waxman, the two Democratic lawmakers with chief oversight over the Federal Communications Commission, said in a joint statement that they would hold meetings with stakeholders beginning in June to discuss proposals to update the Communications Act.The lawmakers made the announcement as 74 Democratic members of Congress expressed “serious concerns” about a proposal to grant the FCC greater authority over US broadband companies.“The significant regulatory impact of reclassifying broadband service is not something that should be taken lightly and should not be done without additional direction from Congress,” the Democrats wrote in a letter to FCC chairman Julius Genachowski. The lawmakers who signed the letter are widely seen as sympathetic to US telecoms companies.The FCC declined to comment on the letter or the lawmakers’ announcement, which was made while Mr Genachowski was on a trip to India.Any attempt to rewrite the Communications Act, which could touch on issues ranging from how cable companies manage their networks, also known as net neutrality, to privacy rules, would take years to complete.Efforts to rewrite the Act would also create a big political fight between incumbent telecoms carriers and their rivals in Silicon Valley. The communications industry has already stepped up television advertising attacking the FCC’s plans. The ads charge the administration with wanting to take over the internet, just as it took control of US banks and carmakers.Google and other content providers have, on the other hand, appeared largely silent in their support of the FCC, according to FreePress, a non-profit organisation that staunchly supported Mr Genachowski’s plan to take a tougher stance against broadband companies.FreePress on Monday urged the FCC to quickly proceed with its plan.“We cannot wait for Congress to act to protect consumers,” it said.However, AT&T said it welcomed the lawmakers’ announcement.“Questions about the FCC’s legal authority should be decided by the Congress itself, and not by applying to the internet a set of onerous rules designed for a different technology, a different situation, and a different era.”
584;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-05-24T18:42:34Z;Pace takes top spot in set-top box market;;Pace has provided the UK technology sector with a fillip after becoming the world’s largest maker of TV set-top boxes, overtaking US rival Motorola and Technicolor of France.The group, based in Saltaire, Yorkshire, leapt from third place to first, according to industry analysts IMS Research, after it increased shipments of its set-top boxes by 31 per cent to 17m in 2009, to customers such as Comcast, DirecTV and Canal+.Pace’s success contrasts with the early part of the decade, when it was largely dependent on one contract from BSkyB and repeated profit warnings put it close to bankruptcy.IMS said Pace had taken market share from rivals, as the number of set-top boxes sold around the world rose 15.2 per cent year on year.In the past year, the company has been rushing to meet increased demand for high- definition TV services. It also benefited from ongoing problems at Motorola and Technicolor (formerly known as Thomson), which saw first-quarter sales declines of 18 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively.But Pace shares have fallen more than 15 per cent in the past four weeks on concern that its position could be short-lived.In particular, investors are worried that internet-based TV, such as the newly launched Google TV, could encourage households to by-pass the set-top box in favour of online video services such as Hulu and Netflix.However, Arun George, an analyst at Noble Securities, said Pace was forecast to ship more than 21m boxes this year, and IMS expects the increase will be enough to hold the top-ranking position in 2010 for the group.New business this year included contracts from a Malaysian pay-TV operator and BT Vision. Mr Gaydon said recent shipments had also been driven by the forthcoming football World Cup.Three years ago, Pace sat in eighth place globally in terms of shipments, but sprang into the top three with its £68m acquisition of Philips’ set-top box division . Within a year the lossmaking division made a profit. Pace shares rose 0.8p to close at 161.9p.

They aim to slide in unnoticed through vents and ducts or wirelessly. They might rearrange the furniture a little and the point of entry will be varied. Your best chance of a glimpse of them will be on a TV monitor or an iPad-like tablet device.A first encounter with the culprits may be at a Best Buy store. The world’s largest consumer electronics retailer said in March it was
re-engineering its stores to sell what it described as higher-value “invisible” digital products.The thinking is that TVs and computers are becoming commoditised items, while services can command a premium. Selling a portable media player with a music subscription service installed or a DVD player with movies can add value to the purchase.Sonic Solutions, which digitises content for Hollywood studios and other media companies, is working with Best Buy and other retailers and content owners to digitise media in every conceivable format so it can be streamed from the cloud to any device. Its CinemaNow movie service is also offered on network-enabled digital video recorders (DVRs) and Blu-ray players.Walmart bought the Vudu digital media service in February to create a digital storefront for content.As well as Blu-ray players, there are set-top boxes, storage devices and games consoles delivering content over the internet to the TV, from Flickr photos and Pandora radio to Netflix movie streaming.These are known as “over the top” (OTT) services, ones that leap over the established cable and satellite players with their content.All the big TV makers are also integrating such services directly into their sets to differentiate their products and adding features such as Skype videoconferencing. Sony is expected to announce an Android-based internet TV next week with Intel chips inside.The established market participants are fighting back with their own added-value services to retain customers. Comcast, a cable provider, launched TV Everywhere last year, allowing access to programming online through a PC, in addition to its set-top box.Dish Network, the satellite service, bought Sling Media and integrated its technology into digital video recorders to allow content to be viewed remotely on mobile devices and PCs anywhere.Last month, Broadcom gave me a demonstration of some tablet devices based on its chips. They can act as an enlarged touch-screen remote control, showing a TV guide grid and allowing programmes to be previewed and then selected for the main screen.The idea is that service providers could give them away to subscribers and later add services, such as home automation controls, which can earn extra revenues and increase their hold on their customers.Motorola and NDS, which make set-top boxes and provide services for cable and satellite, have shown me user interfaces that contain the best of OTT internet services, including social features, such as Facebook and Twitter. They can also offer greater personalisation because of the knowledge that service providers have of their customers’ behaviour.All this is part of a battle over the control centre for the digital home. Scott McGregor, Broadcom chief executive, told me he could make a case for every market participant – from makers of standard cable set-top boxes, TVs, and games consoles, to network storage suppliers, remote control makers and even cellphone vendors – to make theirs the main device in the home.A Silicon Valley company, 2Wire, showed me in a demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show in January how their modems for telecoms carriers had developed into home gateways offering a variety of bolt-on services.Modules can now be added to extend cellphone coverage in the home, add home automation and security systems or provide a server that aggregates all digital media content and also draws from the cloud. 2Wire sees its home gateways as obviating the need for set-top boxes in future.Finally, wireless and wired solutions are fighting it out for the best way to route all of this wonderful broadband content around the home. The idea is to establish carrier-grade service throughout the house, where consumers now rely on flaky Wi-Fi and limited cabling.The International Telecommunication Union ratified a new “G.hn standard” for wired home networking last October. Backed by the non-profit trade group, HomeGrid Forum, the technology can run seamlessly over phone lines, powerlines and co-axial cable. However, backers of HomePlug AV and MoCa (multimedia over cable) technologies have criticised the standard.In wireless, the Wi-Fi and WiGig Alliances announced a co-operation agreement this week to develop multi-gigabit technology for wireless high-definition video in the home, competing with existing WirelessHD and WHDI technologies.As new network technologies and wireless video remove the need for tangles of cables behind the TV, these invisible forces at work could gather and explode our existing concepts of how homes are designed and function for our entertainment.While the TV may hang on a wall in the future, the Blu-ray player could be wedged under the coffee table, the DVR could be in the closet and the tablet remote-control would at last be too big to lose down the back of the sofa."

They are also the printing presses, the telephone lines and the broadcast networks. So it’s no surprise that the mother of all fights has just broken out in Washington over who should control them.This is an issue that has already tied the US broadband industry in regulatory and legal knots for the past decade and a half. Based on last week’s attempt by the Obama Federal Communications Commission to shift the ground once again, one of the most important industries of the information age is set for at least a half-decade more in the netherworld of arcane legal wrangling.The cries that have gone up from broadband companies – that the new uncertainty will kill investment in the very networks that the White House is seeking to foster – sound overdone. But it’s hard not to sympathise with the companies as they start to feel the political whiplash.It took mistakes and ideological posturing by administrations of both political persuasions to reach this point.The regulators of the Clinton years hoped that the last sweeping legislative overhaul of the country’s communications industry, in 1996, would hand them a crowbar strong enough to prise open the existing communications networks to competition. They were wrong. When they pressed on regardless, they walked straight into a legal buzz saw.That was a natural prelude to the deregulatory tendencies of the Bush years. The Republican-leaning FCC conjured up a regime for broadband that essentially left the operators with considerable freedom, for instance to treat some of the data bits that flowed over their networks more favourably than others, or even to block some types of traffic altogether.That was all well and good as long as no one had the temerity to avail themselves of these powers.But profit-seeking entities have a tendency to test the limits of their legal environments.Cable company Comcast took to restricting video traffic on the BitTorrent peer-to-peer network that had been clogging its digital arteries. The FCC ordered it to stop. Comcast sued.Until that point, the regulators had managed to keep a rough consensus by hinting at a tougher stance if the industry didn’t practise self-restraint. No one really believed them, but it paid to pretend. After a court sided with Comcast, though, there was no longer any denying the obvious: the FCC had no clothes.Cue the Obama White House, which had arrived with grand campaign promises to foster the open, high-speed networks it claimed the US would need to retain both its open society and its global competitiveness.Last week new FCC chairman, Julius Genachowski, responded by tearing up the rulebook of the past eight years. Instead, he proposed using a stricter regime originally designed for the world of monopoly telephone networks – though he promised not to apply some of its more stringent rules.It was like picking up a heavy cudgel but wrapping it in velvet. The US broadband companies, not surprisingly, are now transfixed by the outline of the weapon beneath.No matter that Mr Genachowski says he wants to cherry-pick the parts of the old system that will keep networks open: legally, it’s far from clear that he can separate these pieces from the price controls and other rules that were also part and parcel of the old regime.Both sides appear to have miscalculated. Comcast overplayed its hand and provoked a regulatory backlash. The FCC, meanwhile, has invited a court wrangle as long and as bitter as the one that followed the 1996 Telecom Act.Having earlier proposed a set of rules to keep broadband networks open – an approach known as “network neutrality” – Mr Genachowski has sown plenty of distrust among network companies. No wonder they suspect his intentions. And if the real endgame all along has been to angle for legislation, the current political realities in Washington make success unlikely.The result is likely to be a continuation of the muddle-through that has got the industry this far. Dark warnings that legal uncertainty would cause broadband investment to dry up have proved overly alarmist in the past, and are likely to do so now as well.It is not a disaster, perhaps – but hardly the solid foundation for the modern networked economy that was one of the big promises of the Obama campaign.
587;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast shrugs off tougher regulation;;Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, on Tuesday said he was not concerned about increased regulation from the US Federal Communications Commission, which is seeking new authority to regulate cable and telecoms groups.The FCC is seeking to impose tougher regulations on high-speed internet providers such as Comcast, AT&T and Verizon to guarantee that all content creators would be treated equally over the services.But Mr Roberts said on Tuesday that increased regulation was not yet a “big worry”.“We don’t believe the government is trying to turn back the clock,” he said.The FCC is seeking broad new legal authority over broadband, but it has pledged to interpret its power in a limited way – although this argument has been greeted with scepticism by the industry and some US lawmakers.Mr Roberts, speaking at a conference of television industry executives in Los Angeles, is also seeking regulatory approval to take control of NBC Universal. He expressed confidence of gaining approval within the next six to 12 months.He said making NBC News the top US news source would be one of his top goals once his company took control of NBC Universal.Mr Roberts, whose company is set to take control of the GE-owned portfolio of film studios, cable networks, the NBC broadcast network and vast array of internet properties, called NBC News the “single most awesome asset” of the media group.NBC News, like rival broadcast news organisations, has struggled to hold on to audiences as internet and other sources have sapped viewers.To reduce the financial burden of operating news gathering divisions, ABC News, owned by Disney, recently eliminated a quarter of its staff.But NBC’s news operations have fared better than rivals in recent years. The news operations, which include broadcast and cable properties, share news gathering resources.A reformating of MSNBC to a more left-leaning partisan tone has helped boost ratings ahead of CNN, the cable news network that invented the category, but has lagged in ratings since 2000, when Fox News, owned by News Corp, overtook it.NBC’s ability to defray the cost of news across three channels has inspired a rekindling of a more than decade-old discussion between CNN, owned by Time Warner, whose prime-time ratings weakness has become a serious distraction if not yet a financial problem, and CBS News.CBS News lags behind the big three networks in prime-time ratings and hopes that CNN’s global resources can defray the high cost of news gathering.CNN hopes the star quality of highly paid anchors such as Katie Couric can help it bring back evening audiences from Fox News.
588;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Harmonic in deal to acquire Omneon;;Harmonic is set to acquire fellow Californian company Omneon to create an end-to-end video content storage, processing and delivery group serving some of world’s biggest media companies. The transaction is valued at about $274m in cash and stock.Privately owned Omneon specialises in the storage and processing of video content and counts while Harmonic is a provider of live and on-demand video delivery to personal computers, televisions and mobile devices. Both companies are based in Sunnyvale.Omneon’s customers include the BBC, BSkyB, CBS, Comcast, News Corp and Viacom. The combined company will have annual revenues of more than $500m.The combination “will position Harmonic to become a global leader in video infrastructure for the digital media industry,” said Patrick Harshman, Harmonic’s chief executive.Mr Harshman said the acquisition would address the continuing convergence of content creators and media delivery service providers. “Media companies are being driven by ever-increasing demand for video content coupled with consumers’ desire to consume video anytime and anywhere,” he said.“At the same time, the dramatic growth of video delivery over broadband and wireless networks is blurring traditional boundaries between content producers and service providers.”Under the terms of the agreement, Harmonic will pay $190m in cash and issue approximately 17.1m shares of its common stock. This represents an enterprise value of approximately $274m, based on the closing price of Harmonic’s stock on Wednesday and is net of Omneon’s cash balances, which are expected to be approximately $32m at closing, which is expected to be in the next quarter.The deal is expected to be neutral to Harmonic’s net income in 2010 and accretive to net income in 2011.It was announced as Harmonic reported net income for the first quarter of $5.3m, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2009 of $18.8m, or $0.20 per share, on net sales of $84.8m, up 25 per cent from $67.8m in the first quarter of 2009.
589;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-05-06T23:44:56Z;Internet groups eye fight on tighter rules;;High-speed internet providers such as Comcast, AT&T and Verizon were on Thursday gearing up for battle with the Obama administration after the US media regulator unveiled plans to impose tougher rules on the companies.Verizon and AT&T signalled they would mount a legal challenge against the move by the Federal Communications Commission, despite assurance by Julius Genachowski, FCC chairman, that the commission would show restraint with its proposed new authority.Republican lawmakers attacked the prospect of tighter rules for cable and telecommunications companies, saying the move represented nothing less than a “government takeover of the internet”.“Under this job-killing big government scheme, the Obama administration is seeking to expand the power of the federal government,” said John Boehner, the House minority leader.The immediate corporate and political backlash underscored how brutal the debate in Washington is likely to become in coming months as Mr Genachowski moves forward with plans to classify broadband companies as “telecommunications services”.The classification, also known as a “ Title I I”, would technically give the FCC the right to enforce rate changes and unbundling on broadband companies, but the FCC said it would only seek limited enhancement to its regulatory authority to address key issues.The FCC made the decision in the wake of an appeals court ruling in April that stripped it of its authority to regulate broadband companies.The change will open the door for the Obama administration to pass so-called net neutrality regulations that would prohibit internet providers from blocking or discriminating against certain content.A top FCC official, Bruce Gottlieb, on Thursday said that the move would have no impact on tens of billions of dollars in potential investment in communications networks by the private sector.However, even before an afternoon of wild trading on US markets, investors expressed alarm at the prospect of tougher regulations, prompting heavy falls in cable and telecoms stocks. Time Warner Cable closed down 8 per cent, Cablevision down 7 per cent and Comcast down 6 per cent, while AT&T and Verizon both lost more than 2 per cent.Tom Tauke, Verizon’s executive vice-president of public affairs, on Thursday said the FCC’s approach was “legally unsupported”, a statement that foreshadowed a likely legal challenge against the decision.“The regulatory and judicial proceedings that will ensue can only bring confusion and delay to the important work of continuing to build the nation’s broadband future,” he said.Mr Genachowski vowed that the policy would reflect his understanding that government had a “vital but limited role” to protect consumers and promote competition but otherwise needed to “get out of the way of the entrepreneurial genius and free market that is America’s greatest competitive advantage”.Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said the FCC’s decision represented a “loss” for broadband companies but was not as “apocalyptic” as some industry players portrayed it to be because the FCC was only seeking to make limited changes to their business practices.
590;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-05-06T20:46:30Z;Wall St records biggest ever intraday drop;;"US stock markets fell sharply on Thursday with the Dow recording its biggest ever intraday drop in point terms before recovering most of its losses by the closing bell.Exchanges were investigating whether trading errors played a role. Analysts said programme trades may have exacerbated the fall.At mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 was down about 4 per cent to 1,120, and then plunged to its intraday low of 8.6 per cent.Tom Schrader, managing director at Stifel Nicolaus, says that once stocks reached 1,200, it triggered computer programmes that were set up to sell off at that level.“There is the possibility of some programme trades going wrong, and trades being executed in error.”“Liquidity at that point was thin, exacerbating the drop,” he added.Rich Adamonis, spokesman at NYSE Euronext, said: “There were a number of erroneous trades…Nasdaq is investigating.”At the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 3.2 per cent to 1,128.14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.2 per cent to 10,520.32 and the Nasdaq Composite was 3.4 per cent lower at 2,319.64.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility rocketed up 39.1 per cent to $34.65, its biggest one-day change since February 2007.An unusual move in the Procter & Gamble share price, with the stock dropping to $39.37 from about $62 in a matter of minutes was being investigated by Nasdaq as trading error. The stock was down 2.3 per cent on the day.Financials stocks were some of the day’s worst performers, with Bank of America leading the pack lower by falling 7.1 per cent to $16.28. Citigroup lost 3.4 per cent to $4.04 and JPMorgan was down 4.3 per cent to $40.81.Teen retailers Abercrombie & Fitch and Aeropostale reported significantly weaker April sales, ending a run of three months of gains. Abercrombie’s sales slipped 7 per cent, more than the 1.8 per cent decline projected by analysts, and its shares were 8.6 per cent lower to $40.45. Aeropostale sales fell 5 per cent and its shares lost 6.7 per cent to $27.66.Gap fell 7.2 per cent to $22.91 after its sales fell 3 per cent; analysts were looking for a 1.3 per cent rise on average.Shares in Nordstrom, the high-end department store chain, pulled back 2.3 per cent to $42.49 even as its sales beat expectations to rise 7.5 per cent in the quarter. Rival Macy’s edged 3.5 per cent lower to $22.42 even after it reported a 1.1 per cent increase in same-store sales last month, exceeding its own and analyst forecasts.The company also raised its first-quarter profit forecast to 4 cents per share, excluding some items, compared with the average analyst estimate of 2 cents per share.Warehouse club operator Costco tumbled 3.9 per cent to $58.03 after its April sales data came in slightly lower than expected, rising 11 per cent versus average analyst estimates of a gain of 11.2 per cent.Americold Realty Trust, a warehouse operator owned by billionaire Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa Cos, postponed its $660m initial public offering after slashing the mid-point price by 33 per cent.The offering, which was expected to be the year’s largest US listing, was originally priced at about double the average valuation of property firms worldwide.Internet stocks were in focus as the Federal Communications Commission said it would seek stronger authority to regulate companies that provide internet access after a recent court ruling reduced its powers.Cable operator Comcast and phone company AT&T have both warned that more regulation could damp investment. Their shares were down 6.2 per cent to $18.51 and 2.4 per cent to $25.14, respectively.The FCC proposal is a “nuclear option” with “profoundly negative impact on capital investment”, said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, in a client note.He called the development “an unequivocal negative” for cable operators as well as for telecoms company Verizon, which could be forced to share its $23bn high-speed network with competitors.Verizon was down 2.3 per cent to $28.01. Cable operators and Time Warner Cable fell 7.1 per cent to $24.91 and 8 per cent to $50.60, respectively.Pacer International surged 10.2 per cent to $6.94 on the release of better-than-expected first-quarter results.The provider of trucking, freight and transportation logistics earned
1 cent per share in the quarter compared with average analyst estimates of a loss of 16 cents per share."
591;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T19:53:04+0000;White House unveils push on broadband rules;;The Obama administration on Wednesday handed Google and other web content providers a significant victory as it announced that cable and telecommunications companies would face tough new regulations on how they manage their high-speed internet networks.An official at the Federal Communications Commission, the US media regulator, said that chairman Julius Genachowski would on Thursday announce that the FCC will seek to regulate broadband service providers such as Comcast and AT&T under a more rigorous legal framework.The move would open the door for the FCC to implement so-called net neutrality regulations that would bar the companies from favouring some content and discriminating against other traffic over their networks. Google, Amazon and other content groups strongly support net neutrality rules.The FCC decision comes in the wake of an appeals court ruling last month that, in effect, stripped it of its authority to regulate broadband companies.With the announcement, the FCC begins a process to assume greater powers by classifying broadband providers as a “Title II” or “telecommunications service”. It can do this by a vote of the five-member commission.An FCC official said that the commission would also set “meaningful boundaries to guard against regulatory overreach”.The FCC is expected to emphasise that while it will seek new net neutrality regulations, it is not expected to enforce rules on rates, unbundling and other regulations it could have under Title II.But telecommunications and cable groups affected by the ruling are not expected to see any silver lining in the FCC’s allegedly “light touch” approach.“You can call it an ice cream sundae, it is still Title II,” said one industry insider in Washington. Representatives of the cable and telecommunications industries declined to comment.Markham Erickson, executive director of the Open Internet Coalition, a group that represents Google and others, said that the move ensured “consumer choice and innovation on the broadband internet will receive the protections this essential communications infrastructure for the 21st century requires”.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Paul Taylor in New York
592;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-05-05T21:46:48Z;Real’s GameHouse launches social gaming fusion;;Real Network’s GameHouse online gaming division is playing its social cards en route to being spun off by its parent by the end of this year.GameHouse has announced a Facebook-based social gaming service at this week’s Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco and plans to release other social gaming applications in the coming months.GameHouse, formerly known as RealArcade, has been more associated with casual PC gaming, but it needs to get into the biggest growth area of social gaming if it is to increase its appeal or make an impression as a stand-alone company.It is adopting a platform strategy called GameHouse Fusion to spread its influence, aimed at giving game developers access to the 50m players a month it attracts to its own site, mobile phones and services it provides to customers such as Comcast.Using its software developer kit, game designers can publish their game once and have it distributed to PC gaming portals and the major social-networking sites. Social gaming features such as leaderboards and the ability to play with friends across networks and devices will be built in.Further SDKs coming later this year will provide access to the iPhone, Android devices, phones running Qualcomm’s Brew software and internet-connected televisions.While Facebook is by far the biggest social gaming platfrom, with more than 400m members, GameHouse is aiming to cover more web territory with its strategy and range of partners. Fusion will also provide partners with ways of generating revenues including sponsored trophies, virtual goods and other micro-transactions.GameHouse on Facebook starts with around 1,000 existing games, such as Uno, with games built specifically for the platform being rolled out in the coming months.
593;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-05-03T22:00:27Z;Next mobile bandwidth wave gains momentum;;Bandwidth-hungry smartphones led by Apple’s iPhone are unleashing a data tsunami on mobile networks that could nurture new business models in the telecoms industry.In the US, two companies – Clearwire and Harbinger Capital – hope the data explosion will give them the chance to make profits through deals with established mobile operators and new entrants to the industry. Clearwire, the telecoms company whose strategic investors include Sprint, Comcast and Google, is building a high-speed mobile data network that will cover 120m people by the end of 2010.While Clearwire is selling services to consumers that give them wireless internet access on their laptops, the company is heavily focused on reaching wholesale deals with its strategic partners and other companies.The wholesale customers – which could include mobile operators that cannot afford to build their own infrastructure – rent capacity on Clearwire’s network. “We do see wholesale as a very big part of our future,” said Bill Morrow, Clearwire’s chief executive, in March.Harbinger Capital, the New York-based hedge fund that is planning a fast mobile data network, is pursuing a similar wholesale business model to Clearwire, although there are big differences in the two companies’ technology choices.Deutsche Telekom’s troubled T-Mobile USA subsidiary is one company that may be attracted to the wholesale solutions offered by Clearwire and Harbinger. Rene Obermann, Deutsche Telekom’s chief executive, has to decide whether T-Mobile USA should make a large investment in infrastructure based on fourth generation wireless technology, plus the radio spectrum to support it.One way of avoiding the investment would be to strike a wholesale deal with Clearwire or Harbinger.Robert Dotson, head of T-Mobile USA, said in March that T-Mobile USA had held talks with Clearwire, which already has several wholesale customers on its network, including Sprint. T-Mobile USA has also held talks with Harbinger, and the hedge fund’s planned network may be more attractive to Deutsche Telekom’s US subsidiary than Clearwire’s infrastructure.This is because Harbinger’s network will be based on LTE, a 4G wireless technology. LTE is a successor technology to HSPA, which T-Mobile USA has used for its 3G network. Clearwire’s network is focused on a different 4G technology called WiMAX.Harbinger’s decision to build a high-speed mobile data network should not surprise those familiar with its extensive interests in the telecoms industry, which include a 28 per cent stake in Inmarsat, the UK company that provides satellite phone services.In March, regulators approved Harbinger’s takeover of SkyTerra, a US company that supplies satellite radio and data services to public sector agencies including the police.Harbinger outlined in a letter to the regulators how, by using SkyTerra’s assets, it was planning a hybrid 4G network that involves satellite and mobile infrastructure. Mobile phones using Harbinger’s network would likely connect to terrestrial base stations in towns and cities, but in rural areas the devices would rely on satellite links.The big advantage of the hybrid network is that, by involving satellite connections, it could surpass existing mobile operators’ infrastructure and cover all of the US population.The US Federal Communications Commission said: “Harbinger’s broadband network will provide voice and data mobile wireless services nationwide, including to rural areas that lack services from existing terrestrial wireless providers.”Tim Farrar, a technology consultant, estimated Harbinger’s network could cost more than $4bn, and some analysts have expressed doubts about whether the plans are realistic.But in a further signal that it is serious about the initiative, Harbinger last month hired Sanjiv Ahuja, former chief executive of France Telecom’s Orange mobile phone unit, to lead the network roll-out.
594;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T19:36:57+0000;US broadband;Regulatory uncertainty needs to be addressed with new rules;Be careful what you wish for. Two weeks ago a court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission lacked the legal authority it had asserted to regulate the behaviour of Comcast – a US cable company and broadband supplier. Shares in Comcast and its peers have since been largely unmoved, and regulatory bombshells in financial services have attracted rather more attention. Investors, though, should consider the effects of not knowing the rules of the game.The legal battle began in 2008 when Comcast began selectively to restrict high bandwidth filesharing as part of its network management, and the FCC issued a formal objection. Comcast’s victory now leaves the FCC’s position as a regulator of broadband uncertain. Both its ability to enforce net neutrality (a presidential campaign promise), and to implement the national broadband plan are also called into question.Remedies exist. Congress could write a new law, or give the FCC the authorisation it needs. Alternatively, the FCC might simply make an executive decision to change broadband’s designation from its current Title I to Title II, or Common Carrier status. While this sounds nondescript, it would be akin to giving itself the powers of martial law, without risk of judicial review.Title II was originally designed to deal with the railways, and would mean treating broadband as a regulated monopoly. The FCC could set consumer prices, or force broadband suppliers to offer wholesale access to competitors as in other countries, such as the UK. It would no doubt promise to forego from using these powers, but there would be nothing to stop a future administration pulling them off the shelf.Regulatory uncertainty has always existed at the margins, but such significant risks would make assessing the value of broadband networks difficult in the extreme. Picking a fight with government is a dangerous game indeed.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyThe Federal Communications Commission, the US media regulator, has been stopped in its tracks before it could begin implementing an ambitious plan to overhaul the US communications industry.A US appeals court ruling that largely invalidated any attempts by the FCC to regulate broadband services has dramatically upped the ante for the regulator, which is now controlled by Democrats.Julius Genachowski, the FCC’s chairman, wants to expand broadband services across the US. But to achieve that he will have to wrestle back the legal and political authority to regulate the very companies he is also asking to invest billions of dollars in new and faster internet networks.After the court ruling, Mr Genachowski hinted that the FCC was willing to give itself greater authority over broadband companies as a means to regulate them.
595;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-04-20T21:06:48Z;A mogul on the air everywhere;;It is a rare moment when Ryan Seacrest is not in front of a television camera or radio microphone. One of the busiest presenters in broadcasting, the 35-year-old with the blinding white teeth has become an indelible presence on America’s airwaves. His jobs include hosting a daily radio show that attracts more than 20m listeners, presenting the American Top 40 chart countdown, hosting a daily entertainment news show for the E! cable channel and presenting American Idol, the biggest ratings winner of the past decade.Yet today there are no cameras or microphones to be seen. The patio doors in his office are flung open to the afternoon sun and an impressive view of the Los Angeles skyline. He jumps up to shake hands, his BlackBerry is placed out of reach on a coffee table and he begins outlining his grand plan for media moguldom. “You have to master compartmentalisation,” he says.Mr Seacrest’s relentless presenting activities mean he is already a household name in the US. But it is his work as a producer and the commercial deals he has negotiated for his company, Ryan Seacrest Productions, which suggest his talents extend beyond being good on TV. His latest series, Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution, is the English chef’s first programme in the US and comes to an end this Friday. Loosely based on Mr Oliver’s UK programmes which took aim, among other things, at school dinners, the US show aims to shake up American attitudes to food and health: one recent scene showed a classroom of young children failing to identify common vegetables, like tomatoes. “It was just staggering,” says Mr Seacrest.The programme scored the best Friday night ratings in three years for Walt Disney’s ABC network when it launched last month.The Jamie Oliver show has little in common with other programmes RSP has produced, such as the reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which turned three sisters from the Los Angeles suburbs into pin-up stars. But Mr Seacrest says the idea is to tackle a range of genres. “I want to produce content that’s socially conscious as well as pop candy entertainment,” he explains. “We don’t target one type of show . . . we try to come up with things that are popular.”He is not alone in making the move from in front to behind the camera. Other stars, from model and chatshow host Tyra Banks to his American Idol colleague Simon Cowell, have produced shows in which they do not appear. But Mr Seacrest has carved a lucrative niche thanks to a willingness to embed marketing campaigns with his programming and presenting.“I try to forge more creative relationships with advertisers,” he says, reeling off a list of partners that includes Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, which struck a deal with Mr Seacrest through its Crest toothpaste brand – fitting, given his shiny white gnashers. He says advertisers need ways to cut through “all the noise” in the overcrowded media marketplace. “Big companies and advertisers are looking for ways to get their messages through to their audiences and to make those messages stick,” he adds.His relationship with Microsoft’s Bing search engine is one example. When Bing launched last year, he featured it heavily on his radio show and regularly points out new features to his listeners, such as the Bing BlackBerry application. He also promotes the search engine on his Twitter feed, where he has more than 3m followers.Eric Hadley, who runs marketing for the search engine in the US, says Microsoft was looking for new ways to connect with consumers. “We wanted to make Bing culturally relevant and part of the dialogue …Ryan has broad appeal. He has social currency and social influence,” he says.One reason is that he is on air so much. The presenter cites Merv Griffin and Dick Clark as his inspirations: both men presented numerous programmes but also owned intellectual property – Griffin created the Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune game shows, for example. “I don’t get up every morning and say, ‘How can I get on TV today?’ ” says Mr Seacrest. “I’m building something here that runs without me having to stand in front of or beside a camera.”And yet he says his role as a presenter means he can strike commercial deals that are more effective – mainly because he takes on so many roles on and off camera. “If I’m producing a series with an integrated [marketing] message in it I’m the one meeting advertisers,” he says. “I talk to the big guys [at these companies] on a regular basis about what’s working. And I’m on the front lines hosting the show or producing the show.”Mr Seacrest started RSP in 2006 with help from Comcast, which rents him space for his offices and has a “first look” production deal for his shows, meaning the right to broadcast them before anyone else. He owns the company, which employs 30 people, outright.He generated headlines two years ago when he struck a three-year deal worth an estimated $35m with Clear Channel for his radio shows. The agreement broke new ground because it gave Mr Seacrest control of some of the airtime on the shows, allowing him to sell his own advertising and embed his marketing partners into the programming.They certainly help drive his earnings: in addition to the Clear Channel deal, his three-year contract for American Idol is worth $45m and he has a $35m agreement with Comcast, owner of the E! channel. He declines to give earnings figures for RSP, but given the value of his personal deals are his employers concerned that he has too much on his mind? “I’d be lying if I said it made me happy,” says Ted Harbert, chief executive of Comcast’s entertainment group. “But I feel fortunate that we got him …I know how hard he works for us. I never feel that when he’s in our building that he’s thinking about American Idol. He can get a lot done – more than just about anyone I’ve ever seen.”Mr Oliver, who has become a friend since the two started working together, adds Mr Seacrest has “laser focus …he loves what he does, whether it’s presenting his radio show, hosting Idol or having a production meeting at RSP”.Mr Seacrest admits he would like to own his own distribution platform and says he has considered potential purchases. “I would be interested at some point in owning a cable channel or a similar kind of pipe [for our content],” he says. But until then he is content to work multiple jobs, knowing that the more ubiquitous he becomes the more opportunities he can offer advertisers. “The mission is to create pop culture content,” he says. “Where it’s distributed I will leave to someone else to figure out.”
596;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
597;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-04-16T23:45:15Z;Net Neutrality: Time for Evidence-Based Policy;;"A federal appeals court has bopped the Federal Communications Commission yet again. In Comcast v. FCC – the “network neutrality” case – the agency was found to be making up the law as it went. In sanctioning the cable operator for broadband network management it found dubious, the Bush-era FCC exceeded its charter. Cable modem services and digital subscriber line (DSL) connections provided by phone carriers compete – officially – as unregulated “information services.”Congress could now mandate broadband regulation. This could have happened four years ago, when the Democrats took majority control and announced that they would impose network sharing mandates. That has not happened, and – with unemployment running at above 9 per cent – is not likely now. Net neutrality is seen, bluntly, as a jobs killer. That’s one take Congress has actually gotten right.Alternatively, the FCC could flip its own rules, going back to a DSL regime discarded in 2005. But it would have to go further, extending “open access” to cable broadband, something is has always rejected. In 1999, when AOL and phone carrier GTE lobbied hard for cable regulation, Clinton-appointed regulators stood firm. “We don’t have a monopoly, we don’t have a duopoly,” stated FCC Chair Bill Kennard, “we have a no-opoly.” Forget regulation, encourage investment, get amazing new stuff.But “open access” rules for DSL remained. These permitted phone company rivals to lease capacity at rates determined by regulators. It was not until February 2003 that the major requirements were ended. In August 2005, remaining rules were scrapped. A test was created. Deregulation would further investment and deployment, or quash competition and slow broadband growth. FCC member Michael Copps predicted the latter. He challenged the Commission to see if the policy would “yield the results” anticipated. “I’ll be keeping tabs,” he warned.Yet, the market’s verdict is in – and the proponents of regulation have ignored them. Obama economic adviser Susan Crawford, arguing in the New York Times for broadband re-regulation, said that ending government DSL mandates was “a radical move… [that] produced a wave of mergers,” raising prices and lowering quality.It is simply untrue. Mergers, governed by the FCC and antitrust agencies, have had no material impact on broadband rivalry. And the rate of broadband adoption significantly increased following deregulation. This pattern continued a trend.Cable, unregulated, led DSL in subscribers by nearly two-to-one through 2002. Then, with DSL deregulated, phone carriers narrowed the gap, adding more customers, quarter-to-quarter, than cable operators by 2006. The spurt in DSL growth relative to cable modem usage takes place at precisely the time the former was shedding “open access” mandates, and cannot be explained by overall changes in technology. In short, DSL subscribership was up 65 per cent by year-end 2006 compared to the predicated (pre-2003) trend under regulation.The story in ultra-high-speed fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) services is similar. There was virtually no deployment until the Commission, in late 2004, declared that fiber networks would not be subject to access regulation. That move, according to industry analysts, unleashed investment. FTTH is now offered to over 15m homes, and networks are capable of supplying 100 MBPS downloads, on a par with services delivered anywhere.Not only has access regulation been shown to retard advanced networks, the Internet is loaded with “non-neutral” business deals where Internet Service Providers (ISPs) give preference to favored firms or applications. These negotiated contracts rationalize resource use, and drive incentives for innovation.Data flows, unregulated, across large backbone networks that pay no fees to exchange their traffic, but collect billions from smaller networks that must fork out to inter-connect. This pay-to-play structure pushes networks to invest, grow, and cooperate.Cable TV systems reserve broadband capacity for their own branded “digital phone” services. This special “fast lane” provides a premium service not available to independent VoIP applications. It has also transformed the competitive landscape, helping to forge fixed line competition for over 100m US households – what the 1996 Telecommunications Act tried failed to do via network sharing mandates (tossed out by a federal court in 2004).And the corporate history of Google offers a landmark date: on Feb. 1, 2002, the company’s search engine popped up as the default choice on 33m AOL subscribers’ home page. The coveted spot was purchased; the young firm mortgage its future to outbid search engine rivals. An application provider paying the country’s largest ISP for preferred access to its customers. That may not be a violation of net neutrality. But if not, many lawyers will be very busy explaining why.Today’s FCC Chair, Julius Genachowski, has made a pledge: the Commission’s “processes should be open, participatory, fact-based, and analytically rigorous.” That would be a refreshing approach. In addressing new regulations for broadband, let’s first see how these markets actually work, and how well the last batch of network sharing mandates performed.Let’s all keep tabs."
598;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Rockefeller backs FCC broadband regulation;;A senior Democratic lawmaker on Wednesday urged the Federal Communications Commission to use “all of its existing authority” to regulate broadband internet providers and said he was prepared to rewrite legislation to accomplish that goal.The statement by Jay Rockefeller, the Democratic chairman of the Senate commerce committee, signalled for the first time that Congress could pursue a sweeping overhaul of the regulations that govern the communications industry, including telecommunications companies, cable operators and internet groups.A US appeals court ruling last week found that the FCC did not have the authority to enforce rules on how broadband providers, such as Comcast, managed their networks. The decision has prompted speculation that the US media regulator would vote to reclassify broadband providers to give itself greater jurisdiction over the companies.Mr Rockefeller on Wednesday did not state explicitly if he endorsed such a move. But he expressed support for a robust regulatory agenda for the FCC and said he would consider other steps to revamp the commission, including new legislation. The last time Congress amended the rules governing communications was in 1996, when it created separate regulatory schemes for telecommunications and cable providers.“In the long-term, if there is a need to rewrite the law to provide consumers, the FCC, and industry with a new framework, I will take that task on. That’s the option where I think we are probably going to end,” Mr Rockefeller said.He added that the recent US appeals court ruling, which was prompted by a challenge by Comcast, the US cable operator, had put a recently unveiled plan by the FCC to expand broadband coverage across the US “at risk”.“The chairman of the FCC ought to be pretty upset about this. I know I am,” Mr Rockefeller said.But he also took a rare swipe at the FCC, which is controlled by Democratic chairman Julius Genachowski.He complained about the recently announced National Broadband Plan: “The report has over 200 recommendations. But it takes no action. It is long on vision but short on tactics …Just seeking a slew of issues is not enough.”Mr Genachowski, who has the ultimate authority to decide on how the FCC moves forward, said on Wednesday he had not yet decided whether he would simply seek to move forward under the limited jurisdiction outlined by the court, or whether he would pursue a bolder and more aggressive path and reclassify the broadband companies.Reclassification would create an outcry from US cable and telecommunications companies.
599;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-04-08T22:53:49Z;Comcast faces tough regulation from FCC;;Comcast’s bid to take over NBC Universal could face more stringent conditions from the Federal Communications Commission after the company’s victory in the US appeals court, according to people close to the deal.Though a court ruling this week represented a nominal victory for Comcast over the regulator, it has made the leading US cable provider more vulnerable to having rules imposed upon it over how to manage its broadband network, these people say.The US appeals court ruling found that the FCC did not have the authority to dictate how broadband providers manage their networks.The regulator is exploring how to respond to the ruling but the decision has quashed its attempt to implement industry-wide net neutrality regulations that would bar broadband carriers from restricting or blocking certain content providers.But the court ruling did not prevent the FCC from imposing such rules on Comcast as a temporary merger condition.Indeed, the FCC under the administration of George W. Bush imposed such conditions on a temporary basis on AT&T in its takeover of BellSouth.One person close to the Comcast-NBC Universal deal said that the transaction “clearly exposes” Comcast to tougher treatment. However, two other people close to the deal said that the ruling did not heighten existing risks around the NBC regulatory review.With its hands tied given the court ruling, people who are closely following the deal say that the FCC will be looking at the Comcast deal as an opportunity to impose conditions on the largest industry presence.They say that the biggest question now is whether the FCC would impose general net neutrality principles that Comcast could easily agree, or whether it would impose more onerous network management conditions that it would be likely to resist.“My sense is it would not be the FCC’s preferred approach but after this week they will be looking more widely for the tools they have to push their policies forward,” said Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research said that he thought it unlikely that the appeals court ruling would directly affect the ultimate outcome of the NBC bid.One industry lobbyist in Washington said that the only decision that might stop the FCC from imposing such conditions was if it appealed against the court ruling at the Supreme Court. “But as long as the issue is in the FCC’s hands, the pressure intensifies for them to do something on the merger,” the lobbyist said.
600;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T19:53:04+0000;Comcast victory thwarts FCC plans;;It is as if the shadow of former US president George W. Bush had emerged over the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday, stopping the US media regulator in its tracks even before it could begin implementing an ambitious plan to overhaul the US communications industry.A US appeals court ruling that largely invalidated any attempts by the FCC to regulate broadband internet services has dramatically upped the ante for the regulator, which is now controlled by Democrats.Julius Genachowski, the FCC’s chairman, wants to expand broadband services across the US. But to achieve that he will have to wrestle back the legal and political authority to regulate the very companies he is also asking to invest billions of dollars in new and faster internet networks.After the court ruling, Mr Genachowski hinted that the FCC was willing to give itself greater authority over broadband companies as a means to regulate them.For years, the Bush administration whittled away the rules regulating the broadband industry in the belief that booming demand for fast internet service would create a flurry of competition among wireless and cable companies to provide broadband services.Under the arcane policies ruling how certain companies could be regulated, the Bush-era FCC classified broadband as an “information service”, also known as “Title 1 service”, which freed broadband companies from the stricter regulatory regime saved for telecommunications providers – “Title 2” services.The competition the Bush administration believed would flourish under deregulation failed to materialise. In 2008, the FCC censured Comcast for blocking customers from using a video-sharing service.But Comcast challenged the FCC in court, saying it had no authority to dictate how the company managed its network. On Tuesday the court agreed, handing Comcast a victory.Analysts said the FCC had several options. It could move to challenge the appeals court ruling at the Supreme Court. More immediately, it could press ahead with attempts to regulate broadband providers under the strict confines laid out by the lower court.But, in what is seen as its most likely option, it could reverse Bush-era policies and redesignate broadband as a “Title 2” service, opening the door to a new era of regulation, including controls on pricing.But the strategy is rife with legal and political risk. Consumer advocates say Comcast, AT&T and other politically powerful companies would fight “tooth and nail” against heavier regulation.“The trump card that the cable companies and the telecommunications companies have is that they will argue [re-regulation] will just create so much uncertainty that it will just chill investment. And right now policymakers are trying to encourage investment,” said Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus in Washington.Wall Street analysts at Bernstein Research said a “Title 2” designation would “broadly throw into question” capital investment plans for all broadband service providers.“Telecom and cable operators have privately indicated that a “Title 2” designation would result in a radical downsizing of their broadband investment plans to account for the enormous regulatory uncertainty it would introduce,” they said.Cable and other groups would almost definitely challenge such a designation in court. But attorneys who have studied the issue say the FCC has the right to change course on such designations and it was unclear whether the ruling would ultimately be judged as a “win” for Comcast.The company said: “Comcast remains committed to the FCC’s existing open internet principles and we will continue to work constructively with this FCC as it determines how best to increase broadband adoption and preserve an open and vibrant Internet.”
601;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-04-06T23:52:12Z;US internet reform plan hit by court ruling;;The Obama administration’s ambitious plans to expand broadband services and open networks were dealt a blow on Tuesday when a US appeals court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission did not have the authority to regulate the high-speed internet systems.The ruling raised the possibility that the FCC would seek jurisdiction to regulate companies such as Comcast, AT&T and other broadband providers.It could get those new powers by a simple vote in which it would reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service, which is heavily regulated under the law. Such a move would prompt strong opposition from the industry and its backers in Congress.The FCC indicated on Tuesday that it would follow that path, saying it was “committed to promoting an open internet”. It said: “The court in no way disagreed with the importance of preserving a free and open internet, nor did it close the door to other methods for achieving this important end.”An attempt to reverse the Bush administration’s deregulation of broadband companies has been dubbed the “nuclear option” by some Wall Street analysts. Doing so would give the FCC the authority to pass so-called “net neutrality” standards, a key goal of the Obama White House.The FCC has already begun imposing net neutrality rules that would bar broadband carriers from restricting or blocking certain content providers. But the appeals court ruling in effect quashed those efforts, along with other initiatives that were included in a national broadband plan unveiled weeks ago.“The court has destroyed the FCC’s justification for broadband policy in one stroke today,” said Ben Scott, policy director of Free Press, which supports net neutrality reform.Consumer advocates and lobbyists for internet providers such as Google are also prodding the FCC to act assertively.“We would hope that they take this decision and move forward with the broadband plan. The alternative is that they can’t move forward and consumers are left without any protection,” said Markham Erickson, a partner at Holch & Erickson, which represents a number of internet companies including Google.The case stemmed from a 2008 decision by the FCC to censure Comcast, the largest US cable group, after it found that the company had blocked customers from using a video sharing service. In a 3-0 decision, the appeals court on Tuesday found that Congress had not given the FCC the authority to regulate Comcast’s network management practices.The ruling represented a major victory for Comcast, which issued a statement after the ruling saying it “remains committed to the FCC’s existing open internet principles”.But it is far from clear whether Comcast will emerge as the ultimate winner.Any move by the FCC to reregulate Comcast and other broadband providers will have sweeping implications for its business, including on price regulation.
602;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Who’s buying whom?;;Technology, media and telecomsMedia moguls like few things better than dealmaking, but in 2009 they made fewer deals than since the dotcom doldrums of 2003-04. They had reason to suppress their usual instincts: some of the deals they did just before the credit crisis are among the highest-profile failures seared into investors’ memories, writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson.PwC found that $77bn (£51bn, €56bn) of media deals were completed last year – down by half on 2008 as an advertising slump forced a focus on cost cutting. This year, however, the need for elusive top-line growth is driving a revival in mergers and acquisitions, concentrated in a few sub-sectors.Cable networks have been rare bright spots in many conglomerates’ results, making channels such as USA Network and Bravo a drawcard for Comcast in NBC Universal.Advertising agencies are once more the focus of deal speculation, and Hollywood’s need to bulk up to face a declining DVD market and a complex digital transition has set off a studio consolidation. After Disney’s takeover of Marvel, the auctions of MGM and Miramax have attracted interest from groups such as Time Warner and News Corp.Activity has also been strong in business media. The 2007 bids for Reuters and Dow Jones, by Thomson Corporation and News Corp, respectively, raised expectations of further consolidation among information providers, but finance for such deals dried up since soon after those deals were struck.That process has now begun, with CME’s bid for Dow Jones Indexes, MSCI ’s offer for RiskMetrics and several private equity firms examining Interactive Data Corp, which is controlled by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Follow-on deals look plausible. With several media buyouts from the 2006 and 2007 vintages underwater, private equity owners may turn to consolidating mergers as a way to recoup their investments.Media groups are still looking for faster-growing international markets, as symbolised by News Corp’s investment in Rotana, a Saudi broadcaster. Their efforts so far have been dwarfed, though, by emerging market moves in the telecommunications sector. After Vivendi’s €2.8bn (£2.5bn) bid for GVT, a Brazilian broadband operator, Bharti Airtel, the Indian telecoms group, struck a $10.7bn deal for the African assets of Kuwait’s Zain.Deals such as T-Mobile’s UK merger with Orange have been a response to slowing growth in developed telecoms markets. The true test of the health of technology, media and telecoms M&A markets, however, will be whether such a deal happens in the US this year.………………………………….Pharmaceuticals and healthcareAfter the feast, the digestif. Though 2009 marked an unprecedented period for large-scale takeovers in the healthcare sector, the months ahead are likely to see more modest transactions. Last year brought an extraordinary range of mega-mergers, with Pfizer paying $68bn (£45bn, €50bn) for Wyeth, Merck $41bn for Schering-Plough, and Roche spending $47bn to buy out the minority shareholders in Genentech. Those deals overshadowed others that, in a more typical year, would have garnered greater attention, writes Andrew Jack.“I would be surprised if there is substantially more large-scale M&A this year,” says Alexis de Rosnay, vice-chairman of Lazard International. “The natural predators have made their moves, although we will continue to see a good flow of mid-size transactions.”Among the larger firms still tipped to launch ambitious takeovers is Sanofi-Aventis, though Chris Viehbacher, chief executive, has said he is more likely to focus on smaller purchases. The French group’s $2bn takeover of US-based Chattem and its purchase of Czech group Zentiva and Kendrick in Latin America were typical of an industry trend for niche deals aimed at diversifying geographical reach and product range at a time of pressure on core patented medicines.GlaxoSmithKline has focused on periodic “bolt-on” acquisitions, whether paying $4bn to buy Stiefel Laboratories, the US dermatology company, or purchasing the rights to rivals’ product portfolios in specific markets, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb in Pakistan and Egypt. It has sealed licensing deals with generic companies and biotech groups by taking equity positions, such as in Aspen of South Africa.There has also been a new trend for risk-sharing deals. GSK created ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture with Pfizer, for its HIV products. AstraZeneca and Merck have combined forces around cancer drugs, and Eli Lilly brought in Quintiles, the world’s largest clinical research organisation, as an investor in drug development.A few large deals remain outstanding. Novartis is to complete its $50bn purchase of Alcon, the US eyecare company, this year. Sanofi-Aventis hopes to renew its animal health joint venture with Merck in an enlarged joint venture.Emboldened by Daiichi Sankyo’s purchase of the Indian generic company Ranbaxy, more international deals by Japanese companies are possible. There is some scope for fresh generic purchases – including Ratiopharm of Germany and possibly Iceland-based Actavis – while European mid-size companies such as Lundbeck and Nycomed could be bought.One wildcard is Bayer, which could be broken up under its new chief executive. But, like Eli Lilly and others with protective shareholder structures, such deals will not be easily imposed by outsiders.………………………………….Financial servicesExcluding government-led deals, financial services deals hit a six-year low in 2009, according to PwC. But, says the consulting firm, that is about to change. The deal by Prudential, the UK-based insurance group, to buy AIA, the Asian arm of AIG , the stricken US insurer bailed out by the US authorities in 2008, for $35.5bn (£23.6bn, €25.9bn) is just the start, writes Kate Burgess.Just €80bn-worth (£73bn-worth) of mergers and acquisitions was announced last year, compared with €178bn in 2008 and €208bn in 2007. Of that, government-led bank rescues accounted for €41bn in 2009 and €70bn the year before. However, PwC says “a restructuring-led wave of deal activity has started to gather momentum across the financial services industry”, which will be led by the private sector. It reckons British banks may become the targets of overseas buyers. It also believes impending changes to EU regulations on the solvency of insurers will lead to insurance groups rethinking strategies to improve capital efficiency models.Nevertheless, one UK banker warns: “There is a danger in being simplistic. There are a lot of regulatory, economic and political forces pulling in different directions and a lot of moving parts.”For example, he says, current rules allow banks effectively to double-count insurance assets on balance sheets, a practice that minimises the capital they have to hold. Business chiefs may question the benefits of the bancassurance model, but only once the rules change in a couple of years.European M&A advisers agree on four general trends. The first is that banks that have taken state aid will be forced to sell assets. Second, most big financial groups in Europe are retreating to their heartlands – the Pru’s bid for AIA aside.Third, the asset management industry is consolidating. One UK lawyer says banks are looking at selling low-margin, high-volume “plumbing and infrastructure businesses” that provide custody and settlement services while absorbing capital. A few big businesses are watching out for such deals. State Street, the custody bank, last year underlined its ambitions to become the market leader in Europe by buying Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo’s securities servicing business for €1.75bn in cash.Meanwhile, financial conglomerates are examining whether to shake loose their asset management arms amid toughening regulatory and capital requirements. Industry-changing deals, such as BlackRock’s acquisition last year of Barclays Global Investors, will be hard to replicate. But some independent managers, such as the UK’s Aberdeen Asset Management, will look to pick up assets on the cheap. The chief executive of a European asset management group says he has been approached by several US asset managers looking to expand in Europe.A fourth trend, say advisers, is the paucity of buyers prepared to pay the prices that sellers want. According to one lawyer: “Businesses that require balance-sheet support and absorb high levels of capital will struggle to find buyers.”Without more certainty about markets and regulation, “there will be a lot of hesitancy”, says a US banker. “There may be bursts of activity in 2010, but there won’t be a return to the boom times.”
603;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-03-16T00:42:45Z;US broadcasters set for fight over FCC plan;;The broadcast industry marked a line in the sand on Monday in anticipation of a looming battle with the Federal Communications Commission over a plan by the US media regulator that calls for broadcasters to give up some of their airwaves voluntarily.The FCC’s national broadband plan, which was officially released on Monday and will be presented to Congress on Tuesday, would allow broadcasters “voluntarily” to give up the airwaves in exchange for compensation. The airwaves could then be bought by wireless companies, who need the additional spectrum.The FCC sees their broadband plan as a blueprint for spurring greater private investment in broadband networks and making fast internet service more affordable and more accessible across the country. Some aspects of the plan, including elements dealing with potential future spectrum auctions, require congressional approval.Some analysts said the FCC’s insistence that broadcasters could voluntarily give up some airwaves for a portion of future auction proceeds were dubious.“So a question here is how voluntary some of these spectrum measures are. Will it be an offer so good they can’t refuse?” said Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.The National Association of Broadcasters said it was “unclear” whether the FCC had the authority to call for “involuntary action”.“We had gotten wind earlier that what they said was not what was being presented,” an NAB spokesperson said, referring to industry talks on the prospect of voluntary surrender of some broadcast spectrum.The issue raises difficult questions for Comcast, the US cable group seeking to take control of NBC Universal, a significant holder of spectrum rights, in a deal valuing the media property at $30bn. The deal, which is under review by the FCC and the Department of Justice, would create one of largest media conglomerates in the US.Industry observers on Monday said it was unlikely that Comcast would face pressure to give up spectrum in exchange for deal approval, but said the issue could play into the FCC’s review of the deal.It is unclear whether the lower-tier broadcasters seeking exits from markets through the FCC plan could fulfil the commission’s goals to recover 120Mhz of the 300Mhz currently allotted to broadcasters.Some broadcasters fearful of the plan believe that the views of Julius Genachowski, FCC chairman, were shaped during his time as general counsel under Reed Hundt, FCC commissioner during the Clinton administration. Executives had widely disseminated links to a recent speech by Mr Hundt to a Columbia Business School audience, in which he said “broadcast had become a threat to democracy”.
604;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-03-14T21:20:54Z;US watchdog prepares for broadband shake-up;;US regulators are due to unveil plans on Tuesday aimed at improving the country’s mediocre performance in the global broadband race. But they are already learning the hard way that change will not be easy.The Obama administration came to power with ambitious plans to boost the nation’s flagging communications infrastructure. Having been at the forefront of broadband deployment a decade ago, the US has slipped back to a middling position among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, according to a Harvard University study commissioned by the Federal Communications Commission last year.One idea has already been floated by the FCC to help remedy this: enticing TV broadcasters to give up part of their spectrum in return for some of the estimated $50bn (€36bn, £33bn) in proceeds from re-auctioning it for use in wireless broadband networks.But that has gone down badly with many broadcasters, who claim they are being railroaded into giving up airwaves they could still use.One broadcast television chief executive says: “If I want to try to go into a large collective bargain situation, I wouldn’t hire extremists, who have been completely inappropriate and obnoxious.”Colin Crowell, senior counsellor to Julius Genachowski, FCC chairman, shrugs off this broadcaster’s accusation of “political inexperience”. He calls the debate “the most open and participatory in the agency’s history”. Yet even allowing for the heat generated when vested interests are threatened, such strong reactions show how hard a job Mr Obama’s ambitious new FCC chairman faces.On Tuesday the agency is to unveil its national broadband plan – ambitious proposals to increase the reach and capacity of the nation’s networks.The shortage of available spectrum is widely seen as the single biggest obstacle to progress. While many countries forced their local telecoms companies to give preferential access on their networks to rival internet service providers, ensuring a competitive broadband market, the US abandoned a similar attempt early last decade. That has made the wireless networks the best hope for fostering new broadband competition.Blair Levin, who heads the FCC’s broadband initiative, quotes an estimate that the US will need 500 megahertz of extra spectrum over the next decade, but currently only has 50MHz earmarked for release. The FCC’s plan is expected to kick off a series of so-called rulemaking procedures that, after consultation and revision, are likely to take years to complete.In some cases this will mean fighting old battles. An earlier rule to force cable TV companies to open set-top boxes to rivals, making it easier for alternative internet services to reach TV sets, has proved ineffectual, and the FCC seems bent on trying again.Adding to the agency’s headaches, meanwhile, is a looming court ruling that is widely expected to constrain further its powers, making it difficult to implement some of the key broadband proposals.Comcast, the US cable company, has challenged the legality of actions the FCC took against it in 2008, after the regulator censured it for illegally blocking traffic on a file-sharing network. A loss in this case is likely to have an impact well beyond the narrow issue of the agency’s ability to regulate how companies manage network traffic.Some industry observers believe the FCC could seek to pre-empt the court and recommend it be granted more authority to regulate cable and other internet service providers, subjecting them to the same, more restrictive rules, as telecoms providers.For now, the agency denies it will use the broadband plan to push for an extension of its regulatory authority.Yet the FCC has not ruled out looking to Congress for help, should it lose the Comcast case.

Station owners such as Disney have historically given away channels in exchange for launching cable networks such as ESPN.But TV station owners, eyeing the dual revenue streams of fees and advertising of pay-TV networks, have begun demanding fees for carriage of its free-to-air TV stations to offset declines in advertising revenue and viewership as consumers migrate to pay-TV channels and online video services such as Google’s YouTube.
606;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Industries fight plans for beefed-up watchdog;;A broad range of industry groups, from advertising to food companies, are lobbying against a proposal that would give the US Federal Trade Commission new powers to issue regulations.If the measure becomes law it would eliminate restrictions in place at the consumer watchdog since the 1970s that have made it difficult for the FTC to clamp down quickly on companies that it believes participate in unfair or deceptive marketing practices.It would also give the FTC the flexibility to make mandatory rules for companies that, under the current system, are simply recommended as voluntary guidelines.The lobbying effort to block the measure to give the FTC more power is being led by trade and lobby groups that represent Comcast, Nestlé, Coca-Cola, Kraft and dozens of other food, advertising and broadcasting companies.Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the FTC, has said in congressional testimony that giving the commission more authority to set regulations would “significantly enhance the agency’s ability to stop financial fraud”.Instead of it taking years for the FTC to pass regulations, as it currently does, the measure, which quietly passed in the House of Representatives last year and is being considered in the Senate, would allow the agency to pass new regulations in just months.For food and advertising companies, this potential change in authority represents a nightmare scenario.The FTC is this week poised to release guidelines which recommend that media and food companies restrict the kinds of foods they market to children.The companies said making those guidelines mandatory would, in effect, bar them from marketing soups, some snacks and nearly all kinds of sugary cereals on television.When the House passed the FTC provision last year as part of a broad Wall Street reform bill, it received scant attention.Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, who is spearheading efforts in the Senate to pass similar financial reform legislation, is not expected to include the FTC provision in his proposal, which is due to be released shortly. But some corporate lobbyists fear that the Dodd legislation could be amended to include the provision, or that it could be added to the legislation as part of a compromise between the House and Senate.In a letter to Senator John Rockefeller, the chairman of the commerce committee, sent last month, industry groups said they were concerned that eliminating current restrictions at the FTC would give it an “unprecedented range of powers to create significant new legal liabilities and large financial penalties for the media and for a multitude of businesses based on their advertising”.The FTC declined to comment on the proposal.
607;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-02-28T22:12:41Z;Pace now world’s number 2 in set-top boxes;;Pace will this week announce that it has overtaken Technicolor to become the world’s second-largest maker of pay TV set-top boxes, behind Motorola of the US.It marks an astonishing turnround for the Yorkshire-based company that, three years ago, was close to bankruptcy and languishing in eighth place globally.Pace is expected to have sold more than 17m set-top boxes last year to TV companies including Comcast, DirecTV and Canal+. The company is expected to announce £1.1bn in sales for 2009, passing the £1bn milestone for the first time.Neil Gaydon, chief executive, told the Financial Times he had looked at buying Motorola’s set-top box business before the US rival decided against selling the unit. Mr Gaydon said the company was still on the lookout for alternative acquisitions.Jonathan Imlah, analyst at Altium, said he had been impressed by the company’s willingness to buy a business several times its size. “It shows the scale of their ambitions,” he said.Less than two years ago, Pace surprised the market with the £68m acquisition of Philips’ set-top box division, and within a year had turned the lossmaking division round to make a profit.In the past year, Pace has benefited from disarray at Motorola and Technicolor (formerly known as Thomson), which saw fourth-quarter shipments fall 28 and 36 per cent year on year respectively.However, it has also been boosted by an increasing interest in high-definition television, especially ahead of the football World Cup this summer. Demand for pay-TV has remained robust throughout the downturn, as people swap nights out for staying in.Pace has seen a comprehensive structural overhaul over the past three years, overseen by Mr Gaydon. He has created small teams focused on key customers, which has enabled the company to better meet delivery deadlines and keep down costs.The company’s shares have been one of the strongest performers among UK technology stocks, more than tripling in the past year. However, the shares have slid over the past few months on fears that the company’s turnround had run its course.Mr Gaydon insisted that this was only the beginning. “People keep asking me what is next after high-definition television. But HD is only at 6 per cent penetration,” he said.
608;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Clearwire reports strong Wimax growth;;Clearwire reported a $98.7m fourth quarter loss on Wednesday, reflecting the costs of expanding its 4G wireless broadband network in the US, but revenues grew more than expected, boosted by strong subscriber gains.Clearwire, majority owned by Sprint Nextel, the third largest US mobile network operator, is racing to build the first 4G wireless network in the US based on Wimax technology ahead of the launch later this year and next of rival 4G networks using different technology, called LTE.While the latest quarterly loss, equivalent to 55 cents a share, had been expected, fourth quarter revenues grew by more than expected to $79.9m from $59.7m, as Clearwire added 87,000 net new retail customers, more than the first three quarters combined.The company, whose other strategic investors include Comcast and Time Warner Cable, two of the largest US cable operators, ended the year with 688,000 subscribers, up from 475,000 on a pro forma basis a year earlier. The latest figure includes 392,000 retail subscribers in the 27 markets where Clearwire has already rolled out its 4G service.“Over the past year, Clearwire established its leadership in 4G mobile broadband services by building the largest 4G network in North America, raising additional financing to fuel our growth, supporting the 4G wholesale service launches for three of the most prominent communications companies in the US, and delivering solid financial results in a challenging economic environment,” said Bill Morrow, Clearwire’s chief executive.Clearwire, which raised $4.3bn during the quarter, including $1.6bn of additional funding from its strategic investors, plans to roll out its 4G network to cover 120m people this year, including those living in New York, Boston, the District of Columbia, Houston, the San Francisco Bay area, Denver, Minneapolis and Kansas City.It also expects its 4G subscriber levels to triple and forecasts net cash spending of between $2.8bn and $3.2bn this year. “We are confident that we remain on a strong growth trajectory for 2010,” said Mr Morrow.
609;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-02-23T23:00:09Z;Cisco joins Google in ultra-fast broadband race;;Cisco Systems is developing an ultra-high-speed system for internet access in partnership with a number of US service providers, according to people close to the company.The move by the US telecommunications equipment maker comes just weeks after Google promised it would build an ultra-high-speed fibre-optic system. The Federal Communications Commission, the US media regulator, is preparing to unveil its national broadband strategy next month. Unlike Google, Cisco’s move does not appear to conflict with existing broadband network operators.Some of Cisco’s biggest customers, including AT&T and Comcast, the leading telecoms and cable companies, are expected to come under pressure to invest more in high-speed networks once the FCC unveils its plan.Google’s announcement that it would build an ultra-high-speed 1Gbps ’trial’ network was widely viewed as a threat by US telecommunications operators, despite chief executive Eric Schmidt’s insistence last week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that Google has “no interest” in become a broadband network operator.The FCC plan will include recommendations on the private sector’s role in achieving the regulator’s goal of building networks with speeds of 100 megabits per second for 100m households by 2020.The FCC in September projected that upgrading networks and building new ones could cost anything from $20bn to $350bn, depending on the speed of the networks.Cisco declined to comment on its plans. But it said the US “needs high-speed, future-proof broadband networks that are accessible and affordable to all” and that it “looks forward to being part of this exciting transformation”.David Kaut, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus in Washington, said Cisco’s move, like Google’s, would help the private sector determine whether there was real consumer demand for huge amounts of bandwidth, or whether current levels of 5 or 10 megabits were sufficient.“One of the questions is, if you build it, will they come?” Mr Kaut said.Blair Levin, executive director of the FCC’s broadband plan, told the Financial Times that he expected demand to be high in the case of Google’s so-called testbed, which aims to connect up to 500,000 Americans in select communities, and that costs will not be as prohibitive as some have predicted in the past.“I believe that a lot of communities will apply, showing there is a lot of interest in super connectivity. When they roll it out, my guess is that costs will be less than expected,” said Mr Levin. He added: “The network should always be ahead of applications, but applications should be driving the network.”By explicitly allying with the telecom giants, Cisco is hoping to benefit from those companies’ unease with Google. Google’s foray into high-speed access could cut into a core business for AT&T and other communications groups.In a statement, Cisco said future networks ”will be predominantly built by the private sector, including new and existing operations using fixed and wireless technologies, various business models and partnerships”, with the government providing leadership and in some cases facilitating investment.
610;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-02-17T23:25:02Z;HBO Go launches on Verizon;;This is a guest post from FT media correspondent Kenneth LiIt has taken no less than two years of testing, but HBO Go, the subscription TV channel’s broadband portal, has finally launched in the US.Initially available to Verizon’s estimated 3m television and high speed internet customers, the Time Warner-owned HBO plans to offer this to all 30m of its subscribers at no extra charge in a staggered rollout. HBO said it was in talks with European pay TV operators on similar versions outside the US.Only subscribers to pay TV packages will be able to peruse the 600 hours of programming that includes the entire season of The Wire and movies currently scheduled for the service such as Watchmen. (Nearly the entire softcore porn lineup is also available including Super Ninja Bikini Babes, Voodoo Dollz, Real Sex and the popular Alien Sex Files series.) The exact same catalog of shows is available to Comcast customers, but repackaged under the cable operator’s own video portal Fancast Xfinity.HBO Go’s launch is the strongest demonstration of Time Warner’s “TV Everywhere” initiative that aims to vastly improve the volume of videos offered online – in this case, four times as many hours of programming than cable video on demand services – but only to paying subscribers.In keeping with TV Everywhere’s core principle to safeguard the economic cycle-resistant business model forged over three decades, Eric Kessler, HBO co-president, says the “name of the game here is customer retention”.Big content producers like Time Warner have much to protect. HBO, which does not separately report financials, generates about $4 billion in revenues and a cash flow of $1.3 billion annually, according to Edward Jay Epstein, a media industry author writing for Gawker, and confirmed independently by a source familiar with the network.Perhaps the bigger industry ripple won’t come until HBO and Verizon begin offering a similar service for smartphones, which Kessler said was in development. It will unlikely to play on the iPhone since the site’s videos are offered within an Adobe Flash player. A version that would let subscribers download shows and movies from HBO Go is also in the offing. Whether those downloads will make their way onto Apple’s upcoming iPad tablet computer is an open question that HBO executives dodged for now.A flood of similar sites from other big pay TV channels are expected to make their debuts this year and if all of them followed HBO Go’s gameplan – web and smartphone access – consumers may face a difficult decision on their next smartphone purchase. The iPhone, for all its elegance and utility, may be locked out of a burgeoning source of online video entertainment, at least for pay TV subscribers.Apple has also had little success so far in convincing television networks to license their programmes to create a low cost TV subscription plan for the iPad.But at least one senior television executive recently told the FT that this could be the year media companies pursue subscription deals outside of traditional confines. A transaction for Comcast, the top US cable operator, to take control of NBC Universal, owner of America’s oldest television network and cable channels, faces intense regulatory review, creating an opportunity for networks to extract concessions. “The government is on our side,” the media executive said.It is hard to shake the feeling that HBO Go is an expression of a giant’s bet on the day when web video watching makes a serious dent in TV viewing and preparation for a day when it can start charging separately for subscriptions unbundled from distribution contracts.For now, there is no price consumers can pay (we asked) to separate cable networks like HBO from pay TV providers like Verizon or Comcast. There is simply no economic reason for HBO to do so, they say.
611;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Google prepares for a high-speed battle;;"Google is gearing up for a bloody fight in Washington.For its rivals, AT&T, Comcast and other internet service providers, the battle is being fought over nothing less than who will control the internet and the cables that deliver it into millions of homes across America.The opening salvo in that fight was heard loud and clear last week when Google announced it was prepared to build its own ultra-high-speed internet network. It was, in the words of one person close to the Google camp, “a hot poker in the eye” of the
telecoms and cable companies: a way of pointing out to regulators that Google was prepared to build the networks, even if the old guard was not.If it was a ploy, it worked. The move was praised by Julius Genachowski, Federal Communications Commission chairman, even as the US cable industry poured cold water over what they called Google’s “experiment”.Next month the FCC will unveil a national broadband strategy that analysts say comes at a useful time for Google, putting telecommunications and cable companies on the defensive about their own slow progress.For Google, the move was yet another public relations win in a town where it already enjoys a close relationship with the Obama administration and where it has won accolades from Nancy Pelosi, House speaker, and others for its stand against internet censorship in China.Indeed, there is a pervading sense that the Mountain View company has become a darling of the Washington elite. But the question facing Google is whether its popularity among decision-makers will give it an edge over its political enemies, many of whom have been engaged in trench warfare over regulatory issues for decades and nearly always win.The answer from many Washington veterans who have witnessed big corporate clashes in the past is: No. Google has beefed up its profile in Washington in recent years, increasing the amount it spends on lobbying from $1.52m in 2007 to $4m (€2.93m, £2.55m) last year. But these veterans say that the company remains on the backfoot on Capitol Hill.One voice in the Google camp said the company was better off now than it was a few years ago, but “that doesn’t . . . negate the influence of the telcos and the cable companies. They are dropping gold into the pockets of congressmen.”A senior staffer on Capitol Hill put it this way: “Washington likes having favourites and right now the company is the flavour of the month. That said, they definitely don’t have the sophistication in their lobbying shop [of others]”.The company seems to be winning the policy debate over net neutrality. The FCC voted in October to support a proposal that would regulate network operators such as AT&T and Comcast and forbid them from blocking content. But most analysts agree that members of Congress, which have direct oversight of the FCC, will still weigh in on the matter, and will put pressure on the commission to dilute the rules in favour of the telecommunications and cable groups. Alternatively, they may pass their own net neutrality legislation.Google is attempting to curry favour on Capitol Hill through the usual tactics, such as hiring former Capitol Hill staffers, as well as unconventional methods, such as trying to educate politicians about how to use the internet in campaigns. People who are watching the company try to gain influence say it is using an intellectual approach in a town where “the best idea” does not always win.Google lacks deep relationships on the Hill that companies such as AT&T and Comcast, which spend tens of millions of dollars on lobbying and charitable and campaign donations, have developed over many years.“Those companies have employees in every congressional district and relationships that an upstart company like Google cannot begin to match,” says Andrew Schwartzman, president of Media Access Project, an advocacy group that is supportive of Google.Soon after the FCC announced its net neutrality plans in October, members from two usually opposing Democratic caucuses on Capitol Hill – conservative Blue Dogs and the liberal Congressional Black Caucus – wrote a letter to the regulator saying they opposed the proposed regulations. Both groups are long-time beneficiaries of AT&T and others.Advocates of Google do not, at least, seem disillusioned about the fight they are facing. “A lot of blood may be spilled on this one. The telcos in particular see this as the biggest challenge to their dominance,” said one."
612;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Comcast chief gently queried on merger plans;;"Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts was given a mostly warm reception on Capitol Hill on Thursday as Democratic lawmakers gently questioned the impact of the US cable company’s proposed merger with NBC Universal. They stopped short of demanding that regulators block or impose onerous conditions on the transaction.It is unclear if the US Justice Department will take a similarly benign view in its antitrust review of the deal. But the sometimes chummy atmosphere in the House energy and commerce committee underlined that, on this side of Pennsylvania Avenue, the US cable company’s ties to lawmakers are deep.According to an analysis by The Hill, a Washington newspaper, Comcast and General Electric, from which the cable company is seeking to buy a controlling stake in NBC, have spent $474,000 on contributions to members of both the House and Senate panels reviewing the deal, about 70 per cent of what the companies spent in the 2008 election cycle.In his opening statement defending the deal, Mr Roberts promised lawmakers that Comcast would be a reliable steward of NBC. The reasons for which Wall Street was not initially enamoured with the deal, he said – namely, that there would be no major layoffs or “big synergies” – were the same reasons why Washington should be.The strongest statements of the day came from lawmakers who signalled that the deal gave the Federal Communications Commission an opportunity to impose so-called “net-
neutrality” conditions on the transaction which would ensure non-discriminatory access to the internet. Democrats also raised questions about issues ranging from Comcast’s commitment to NBC News to its support for free over-the-air broadcasting.Anna Eshoo, a Democrat from California, said the merger threatened open access of information for consumers.“It has the potential to place a chokehold on the transfer of information to consumers today and well into the future. This demonstrates why we need net-neutrality across the board,” she said.Edward Markey, a senior Democrat from Massachusetts, said he wanted to ensure that the combination “does not enable the creation of discriminatory fast lanes and slow lanes on the internet to the detriment of users”.Republican legislators were unified in their call for the deal to be reviewed quickly and ultimately approved without conditions.They also said they would oppose any effort by the FCC to impose net-neutrality regulations, saying that doing so would be “highly inappropriate”.Mr Roberts was due to meet lawmakers in the Senate in the afternoon for a second hearing on the deal.In one of a handful of examples of House members explicitly praising the company in their opening statements, veteran Democratic lawmaker John Dingell thanked Comcast for its work in his district in Dearborn, Michigan."
613;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-02-04T01:18:32Z;Time Warner joins rebound from crisis;;Some of the biggest US media companies are rebounding from a crisis that many expected to finish them off with a spate of dividend increases, forecast upgrades and promises to boost shareholder returns.Having whispered of “cautious optimism” since September, executives at News Corp, Time Warner and Comcast supplied evidence this week of confidence that a recovery from the worst economic period since the Great Depression would last.In a surprise to investors who have grown weary amid years of moguls ploughing profits into risky mergers and acquisitions, media chiefs vowed to increase returns to shareholders in the form of larger stock repurchases and dividends.Time Warner, unshackled from the loss-making AOL, which analysts had called the “long national nightmare”, reported a return to profits from a period a year ago when it was saddled with writedowns on its publishing, internet and cable divisions. It also expected 2010 profit per share to rise in the mid-teens range.To celebrate its new optimism, Time Warner raised its quarterly dividend 13 per cent to 21.25 cents per share – one of the industry’s largest dividend yields. “These steps reflect our confidence … that we can deliver steady superior returns to stock holders year-by-year and over the long term,” said Jeffrey Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner.Time Warner’s cheery outlook came on the heels of Rupert Murdoch’s aggressive predictions on Tuesday for News Corp’s current fiscal year. He said he expected the group to raise operating profits in the low-20 per cent range, after twice upgrading the forecast over the past six months.For the first time in two years News Corp raised its dividend 25 per cent.Despite trends to the contrary, DVD sales underpinned both companies’ recovery. News Corp also saw TV advertising sales improving, which helped send rival CBS shares up nearly 5 per cent on Wednesday.Comcast had already raised its dividend 40 per cent when it announced its bid for NBC Universal in December, and said it had paid out more than half of last year’s free cash flow, or $1.5bn, in dividends and share buy-backs, with plans to spend another $3.3bn on repurchases through 2010.Comcast’s ad revenue fell 7 per cent year-on-year, but it said this was up 10 per cent after stripping out political advertising around last year’s election.The “real drag” of ad declines at the beginning of 2009 “could turn into a real lift” for operating cash flow if current trends continue in 2010, Stephen Burke, chief operating officer, said.As for the newly emancipated AOL, which on Wednesday reported a small quarterly profit, it also had cause for hope: US internet display ad revenue had risen 1 per cent. “AOL is a turnaround story,” Tim Armstrong, chairman and chief executive, said.
614;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;US media;Why mix programming in with the pipes?;Comcast will be in Washington on Thursday pitching its plans to buy NBC Universal. While politicians will be more interested in making noises about consumer protection, they might also do a service to Comcast investors by asking the company to explain why it makes sense to mix programming in with the pipes.Wednesday’s fourth-quarter results from Comcast certainly gave a foretaste of what may lie ahead if it is allowed to take control of General Electric’s media division. Content is the smallest part of Comcast (just 4 per cent of revenues), but higher programming costs caused profits from the unit to plunge, even while sales expanded. More experienced management from NBC may help – although its own prime time line-up has recently been the subject of some very high profile troubles – but the move is a reversal of the split undertaken by Time Warner last year.The bisection allowed both to stand on their own merits. Time Warner returned to profit in the fourth quarter thanks largely to its film division and the surprise contribution from The Hangover. Such volatility is a fact of life for content companies – News Corp raised earnings guidance on Tuesday to reflect the success of smash hit Avatar. Along with less need to invest in physical infrastructure, it is the reason they typically command higher valuations than the pipers.Yet Time Warner Cable is reassuringly predictable, a fact it underlined with last week’s dividend increase. And compared to the two big telecoms companies that it and Comcast are outmanoeuvring – taking two-thirds of net new broadband customers last year, according to Bernstein – they are cheap on five times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, to AT&T and Verizon’s six. Better to stick with reliability than an ego-driven rush into content.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
615;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-02-03T13:33:01Z;Time Warner swings to quarterly profit;;Time Warner swung back to a quarterly net profit thanks to its cable networks and film studios, leaving behind a year weighed down by a string of big writedowns in its AOL and publishing divisions.The company also raised its dividend, the second media company this week to do so, and increased its stock repurchase programme, underscoring a plan to boost shareholder returns after the December spin-off of the troubled AOL internet division.The company will raise its quarterly dividend by 13 per cent to 21.25 cents per share. Time Warner’s board of directors also approved a plan to commit an additional $2bn to a stock repurchase programme. Since 2007, it has repurchased approximately $4bn and has $1bn left over from the earlier programme.The shareholder returns strategy will help assuage some fears among investors that the company would embark on a spending spree in spite of statements to the contrary. Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner chief executive, has said he planned to continue reviewing potential acquisitions cautiously. It has bid less than $2bn for MGM.The dividend rise would give Time Warner one of the largest dividend yields among major media conglomerates and will be ahead of Comcast, the top US cable services company that agreed to buy control of NBC Universal from General Electric.The owner of the Warner Bros movies studio and Time magazine reported a quarterly net profit of $627m, or 53 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $16bn, or $13.41 loss per share from a year ago. Revenue rose 2 per cent to $7.3bn.Excluding one-offs including discontinued operations, the company’s profit of 55 cents surpassed Wall Street estimates of 52 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters.Time Warner expects full year 2010 diluted income per share from continuing operations to rise in the mid-teens from a base of $1.83 in 2009.`Filmed entertainment drove profits with operating income rising 61 per cent from sales of DVDs of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Hangover and box office sales of Sherlock Holmes.But results at its magazine publishing division continued to slide. Revenue fell 13 per cent from a 12 per cent drop in advertising revenue and a 6 per cent fall in subscription revenue.
616;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Studio auctions steal limelight in Hollywood;;"With Oscar season in full swing Hollywood is on tenterhooks to see which films will triumph on the industry’s glitziest night of the year.But away from the “gifting suites” and parties ahead of next month’s main event, Hollywood studio executives, financiers and producers are closely following two auction processes that could be better barometers of the industry’s financial health.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio behind Gone With The Wind and The Wizard Of Oz is on the auction block, as is Miramax, the company behind Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare In Love, which is now part of Walt Disney.MGM owns the biggest film library in Hollywood with 4,000 titles but is up for sale after a failed attempt to relaunch the studio as a production force. Disney, meanwhile, is selling its 700-title Miramax library after deciding to focus on family fare and its branded divisions, such as Pixar and Marvel.Both sales will test the value of film content at a time when the film and television industries are in severe flux. Pay-TV operators such as Showtime, which is part of CBS, are spending less on buying films and investing more in original programming, while revenues from DVD sales, once Hollywood’s biggest revenue stream, are in decline.“Library valuations went through the roof with the rise of the DVD [in the 1990s],” says Robb Klein, a lawyer in the entertainment, media and technology group at Sheppard Mullin. “But with DVD revenues now falling it’s unclear whether those valuations will be achievable again – unless video on demand or other forms of digital distribution really take off.”When DVDs represented a fast-growing business and pay-TV operators were still hungry for film content, Hollywood rushed to cash in. Paramount sold the 59-
title DreamWorks library, including Gladiator and Saving Private Ryan, to George Soros for $900m as recently as 2006.MGM fetched $4.8bn when it was bought in 2005 by its current owners Sony, Comcast, Texas Pacific Group and Providence Equity Partners.There has been plenty of interest in MGM this time with Time Warner, flush with cash from the recent sale of its cable business, among the companies monitoring the auction. News Corporation’s Fox unit, which is riding high on the recent success of Avatar, was also eyeing the sale, although Rupert Murdoch, the company’s chairman, said on Tuesday that “it appears other people are more interested than us, so I think you can count us out”.Initial bids for MGM have been in the $1.5bn-$2bn range – short of what had been hoped for by its investors. The level of interest might also be affected by the Miramax auction: with 700 titles, it is a smaller and cheaper library which may be better suited to some potential MGM buyers.Disney has been contacted by several companies interested in Miramax, including Summit Entertainment, the studio behind the Twilight franchise and the Oscar contender The Hurt Locker. Disney declined to comment. But while there is healthy interest in both auctions the pressures on DVD sales may be the biggest factor in determining price.Walmart is cutting the shelf space it allocates DVDs while the emergence of low-margin DVD rental kiosk operators, such as Redbox, has further eaten into Hollywood profits from DVD sales.This makes for a tricky environment to sell, made worse by the difficulties facing potential financial buyers, says Clark Hallren, managing director of Clear Scope Partners, an entertainment advisory group.“Strategic buyers are in the best position to execute transactions,” he says.For those companies that continue to have faith in entertainment content, digital delivery represents the brightest hope for the future and for the exploitation of older titles. “There will be a pick up in value whenever there is a clear revenue model for broad-based digital delivery [of content] to the home,” says Mr Hallren. “But candidly, no one knows how quickly that will happen.”"
617;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-01-27T22:31:05Z;CNBC profits from a crisis;;After weeks of watching his programming strategy for NBC pilloried by comedians on his payroll, Jeff Zucker, chief executive of NBC Universal, is eager to change the subject. The public bust-up involving late-night talk show hosts Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien, two of the company’s highest profile figures, ended when Mr O’Brien and the network reached an exit agreement which netted him $32.5m (€23m, £20m).The saga raised uncomfortable questions about the business model – and Mr Zucker’s leadership of the company. So, it is little surprise that he is eager to talk about CNBC, the business news channel that has just delivered its fourth year of double-digit growth in operating profits.“CNBC is such an important part of our cable portfolio, in large part because it’s such a public symbol of the company,” he says. “CNBC’s public prestige in many ways outweighs its total viewership.”NBC used to lead the pack of free-to-air networks with programmes such as Seinfeld, Friends and ER, but it now languishes in last place. By contrast, its cable properties are profitable, growing and now contribute 80 per cent of the group’s cash flow.This helps explain the decision of Comcast, the US’s top cable operator, to purchase a controlling stake in NBC Universal from General Electric and Vivendi for $30bn. On the day it announced the deal in December, Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chairman and chief executive, went on CNBC to explain that the lure of NBC Universal lay more in its cable channels than in the broadcast network. “Cable programming channels are really the best part, I think, of the media business,” he said. With two revenue sources – advertising revenues and a share of consumers’ pay-TV bills – five NBC Universal cable channels now make more than $200m a year in operating profit, he added.NBC Universal does not disclose such numbers, but CNBC is reputed to have become its second-most lucrative channel after USA Networks, with an operating profit of between $300m and $400m. As such, it serves as a microcosm of what Comcast sees in NBC Universal.Sitting in an office in NBC’s headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York, a short drive from his New Jersey studios, Mark Hoffman, the channel’s president, admits that he is not sure what Comcast control might mean for CNBC, “but by all indications they are fans”, he says.Mr Hoffman is reflecting on a complex fifth year in the job. A little over 12 months ago, he was basking in a surge in ratings, brought on by a financial crisis that left a mass audience craving information on market gyrations that affected investment portfolios large and small. Business news became gripping television for non-experts after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. “We retained most but not all of the audience we gained,” Mr Zucker says.Don Seaman, director of communications analysis at MPG, the media agency, says CNBC “still provides the same high-value resource” to advertisers in a struggling economy, but the recession has cannibalised the audience it enjoyed at the peak of the crisis. “The story that is in their wheelhouse is ubiquitous across all the other higher-rated [general news] networks, so they’re still only delivering their core viewer,” he says.The network will also have to cope with increased competition. Bloomberg, for example, has set out to become “the world’s most influential news organisation”, using profits from its financial data terminals to put a vast network of reporters on screen at relatively little cost, notably in markets outside the US. It has also recruited seasoned news executives to give its financially focused television efforts more mainstream appeal.The Fox Business Network, launched by News Corporation in 2007, has yet to fulfil early predictions that it could join forces with News Corp’s Wall Street Journal, which is locked in a contract with CNBC until the end of 2012. It has instead pursued main street US investors with a focus on personal finance and the recruitment last year of Don Imus, a provocative talk radio star now mixing business news into his political show in the hours before the US market opens.Mr Hoffman claims to be unconcerned. “I’ve made a point of not talking specifically about any of our competitors, but I can tell you we’ve seen growth in every category,” he said. “My sense is we’re more significant …than we’ve ever been before.”Mr Hoffman’s strategic reshaping of CNBC started with buying out Dow Jones and Microsoft, partners in its international and online operations. The next stage, he says, is to identify local language launches and build a mobile strategy so “every affluent person in the world [can] view or use CNBC when they want it, where they want it, in real time”.The strategy of using local partners for non-English language versions of CNBC is a stark contrast with that of Bloomberg, which has cut local-language programming, but it has boosted CNBC’s distribution by 80 per cent in Asia and by 23 per cent in Europe over five years.CNBC’s fortunes will continue to be driven by the broader advertising market, but Mr Hoffman says that it can command “substantially higher” advertising rates than more general news channels. “It is no small thing to have the best educated and most affluent audience on TV,” he says. CNBC claimed the wealthiest viewers of any cable network in US trading hours in the fourth quarter, citing Nielsen figures saying that its $93,000 median income in adults between 25 and 54 was $20,000 higher than Fox News or CNN.Rivals challenge CNBC’s audience data and its claim that it is increasing its market share, saying that when compared with more general news channels, including Fox News and CNN, its share of the 9am to 5pm audience has slipped.CNBC counters that it sees Nielsen’s ratings, which exclude offices, trading floors and hotels, as an imperfect measure of its true US television audience and also fails to reflect its international viewers or online users.But like NBC, CNBC has had its share of negative coverage this year with critics suggesting that some of its high-profile anchors were not critical enough during the boom years. Jon Stewart of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show notably accused Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s Mad Money, of being a “snake-oil salesman” for his bullish approach.The criticism clearly still annoys Mr Hoffman, who says that CNBC was among the first media outlets to raise concerns about subprime mortgages and gave airtime to the few economists voicing doubts about the sustainability of the boom.Moreover, Mr Cramer is “an incredible asset”, he adds – not least because the controversy boosted his ratings. Getting the facts right and first is CNBC’s priority, but Mr Hoffman says, “We do have to make a show. We need to be content, but we need to be compelling”.
618;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;NBC host close to comedian pay-off deal;;NBC Universal is closing in on a severance deal with Conan O’Brien, the comedian losing out in the network’s reshuffle of its poorly performing evening schedule, which will give the host of the Tonight Show the kind of pay-off more common on Wall Street.Mr O’Brien stands to collect about $32m under his contract, people familiar with the negotiations said, putting him in the same league as some of the fallen stars of the banking industry’s bubble era.Martin Sullivan stood to collect $35m when he left AIG in 2008, while Michael Klein left Citigroup with a cash-and-shares severance agreement then worth $42m, although half of this was frozen last year amid growing political anger about Wall Street compensation.Both men’s “golden parachutes” were dwarfed by the $160m retirement package in 2007 for Stan O’Neal, the former Merrill Lynch chief executive, but such rewards have been depleted by the steep decline in financial stocks since then.NBC is understood to have set aside a further $12m to cover pay-outs to almost 200 staff set to lose their jobs when Mr O’Brien is replaced by Jay Leno, whose failed move from the Tonight Show to a primetime slot precipitated the latest tearing-up of NBC’s schedule.Mr O’Brien is said to be pushing for about another $600,000 for his staff, but negotiations over the payout dragged the drama out on Tuesday, with NBC dismissing reports that Mr O’Brien was trying to look after his staff.“It was Conan’s decision to leave NBC that resulted in nearly 200 of his staffers being out of work. We have already agreed to pay millions of dollars to compensate every one of them. This latest posturing is nothing more than a PR ploy,” NBC said.The crisis played out on television screens for another night on Monday, with Mr O’Brien calling NBC “incompetent morons” on his show and Mr Leno telling his audience: “This is all business. If you don’t get the ratings, they take you off the air.”Jeff Zucker, NBCU’s chief executive, told the Charlie Rose show that he had received death threats but: “Leadership is about taking chances and taking risks. And also, leadership is about acknowledging when they don’t work.”The upheaval, triggered by local stations’ ratings concerns, comes as GE and Vivendi are seeking regulatory approval for the sale of a majority stake in NBCU to Comcast.

News Corp’s Fox studio was close to signing a non-disclosure agreement on Friday night and was expected to consider bid plans over the weekend.Lionsgate, the maker of Mad Men and the Saw horror films, was also ex­pected to bid. Peter Cher­nin, the former News Corp chief operating officer ru­moured to have shown interest, had no plans to bid, people familiar with him said.MGM aims to avert a painful restructuring of the $3.7bn debt legacy of its 2005 takeover by private equity firms TPG, Providence Equity Partners, DLJ Merchant Banking Partners and Quadrangle Group, and media companies Sony and Comcast.People familiar with the auction said the studio was asking for about $2bn, well below the sum it owed creditors, but predicted opening bids of $1.5bn-$2bn. Barclays Capital said: “We find it unlikely that MGM’s creditors would cleanly agree to a sale price materially below $2bn.”The studio missed an interest payment last year when it failed to raise the capital required for an ambitious production schedule. It must make a $250m payment by April on a revolving credit facility and pay off its $3.7bn term loan by 2012. Lenders have granted it forbearance from interest payments until the end of this month.MGM’s main value lies in its 4,000-title film library and its rights to franchises such as James Bond and the Pink Panther. Cash flow from the library was about $300m a year, a person familiar with the deal said.A takeover would give Reliance a position at the heart of Hollywood. It last year provided $325m of equity to fund recreating Steven Spielberg’s DreamWorks studio as an independent entity.
620;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2010-01-13T01:11:49Z;NBC’s O’Brien in open revolt;;NBC looked increasingly likely to lose the host of its most venerable franchise on Tuesday as Conan O’Brien said he would not risk the “destruction” of the Tonight Show by moving it to resolve the network’s scheduling crisis.The NBC Universal-owned broadcaster has proposed moving the 56-year-old comedy chat show back 30 minutes to after midnight eastern time, in order to allow Jay Leno to reverse a failed move to prime time and return to a shortened 11.35pm slot after local news bulletins.Mr O’Brien’s bitterly worded statement, however, effectively challenged the network to choose between him and Mr Leno, his Tonight Show predecessor, raising expectations the fourth-placed network could lose Mr O’Brien to a rival such as News Corp’s Fox.Fox, which has not hidden its interest in Mr O’Brien, said it was “digesting the information”.Mr O’Brien said he had received no offers.One Fox affiliate said there was no consensus among local Fox stations, each of which would have to assess whether it was worth replacing their current late-night programming to take Mr O’Brien.The fallout is a damaging blow to Jeff Zucker, chief executive of NBC Universal, who presented last year’s scheduling shake-up as “the most important thing we’re doing” and defended it last month as General Electric and Vivendi announced plans to sell control of NBCU to Comcast.Mr Zucker’s move, designed to save money on costly dramas at 10pm, has resulted in poor ratings, provoking uproar among affiliates, who rely on strong audiences for the local news bulletins that provide much of their revenues.“Delaying the Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy programme will seriously damage …the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting,” Mr O’Brien said, adding that he could not participate in the programme’s “destruction”.Mr O’Brien, who has attracted a smaller but younger audience, said he had hoped to be given time and higher audience numbers leading into his show, “but sadly, we were never given that chance”.Harris Diamond, chief executive of Interpublic’s constituency management group, said the upheaval could damage NBC’s brand “on a business level”, but from viewers’ perspective it remained “a destination brand”.Comcast, which may have to wait a year for regulatory clearance of its NBCU deal, has had to take a back seat in the discussions.“From Comcast’s point of view, it’s better for the affiliates’ issues to be resolved now,” Mr Diamond said.Mr O’Brien and Mr Leno devoted their opening monologues on Monday to the debacle.
621;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-30T20:55:46Z;Father and son keep the show on the road;;On a crowded stage at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York this month, NBC Universal employees sampled a taste of Comcast family tradition just hours after the top US cable operator disclosed it would take control of one of America’s oldest media companies.Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, introduced his father Ralph Roberts, the 89-year-old founder of the company, to the audience as “the love of my life”.The introduction capped an hour-long presentation to NBC Universal staff nervous about the future.It sparked a standing ovation and reduced a few to tears as Mr Roberts senior pointed out that the takeover of NBC Universal was not just a change of control from one corporate overlord to another, but an embrace of new members into the Comcast fold.“Our family has gotten a little larger here,” Ralph Roberts told the crowd.The rhetoric is signature Roberts and one that has been consistent since Comcast’s founding in 1963.Succession issues have afflicted US media empires, from once-great newspaper dynasties such as Dow Jones and Tribune, to big entertainment groups such as News Corp and Viacom.But Comcast, run by Brian Roberts since 1990 as its president and 2002 as its chief, has distinguished itself as one of the few that have bridged the generation gap seamlessly. When he was 15, Brian Roberts began to work during the summer at the company, holding jobs ranging from an installer of cable lines to assistant management positions at local operations. He formally joined the company in 1981 after graduating from business school.“There hasn’t been a single mis-step or single question raised” as to whether Brian Roberts was supposed to fill his father’s shoes, or if he has filled them well, says Leo Hindery, former president of TeleCommunications Inc, the one-time biggest US cable operator.“He looks at his dad with just unbelievable affection and respect,” Mr Hindery says. “That’s why it works.”Although the Roberts family has not held a controlling stake in the company since 2002 – when it reduced its 88 per cent controlling stake to one third as a condition of a deal to purchase cable systems from AT&T – the family’s careful stewardship of Comcast has afforded its management the luxury of taking the long view even when their decisions have been unpopular.The family’s conservative exterior – Ralph Roberts, who still comes to work every day, is known for his trademark bow ties and Brian Roberts for his plain grey suits – belies an aggressive strategy that flouts conventional wisdom.Comcast’s 2002 purchase of AT&T Broadband, which valued the cable systems group at $50bn, vaulted the number three cable operator into first place, but came as investors cooled on the deal-making fervour of the dotcom bubble era.That year, cable stocks fell close to 60 per cent. Comcast shed a third of its stock value in 2002.At the time, the deal was the biggest since AOL’s $164bn takeover of Time Warner, now considered the worst in corporate history.Integrating AT&T’s systems required another $2bn in upgrades. The bet was that improved systems would allow Comcast to sell additional products such as high-speed internet services and digital phone subscriptions, as well as advanced video products. The concept now underpins the modern media distribution economy, but was considered risky at the time.“My father’s view has always been that in bad times there are great opportunities,” Brian Roberts told the Financial Times.Preparing for a rainy day, as Brian Roberts puts it, has also drawn fire from investors at boom times.A refusal to give in to one large shareholder’s bullying in 2008 proved prescient just months later when the credit markets collapsed.Chieftain Capital Management, which owned 2 per cent of Comcast shares at the time, demanded that Brian Roberts be ousted as CEO after the company refused to borrow heavily to buy back stock.The recession that gripped the global markets by late 2008 presented its next big opportunity. At the time, Ralph Roberts said: “We’re going to come out of the recession even stronger than we were going into it”.The recession gave Comcast the opportunity to seek out content acquisitions at discounted prices even as rivals abandoned the concept of marrying content and distribution. By March of 2009, the Roberts duo had made their first overtures to take over NBC Universal.
622;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-28T22:45:58Z;The $164bn question that stumped AOL;;The millennium hangovers had just eased when AOL, the dial-up provider that introduced America to the world wide web, announced its takeover of Time Warner, home to the media empires of Henry Luce and Ted Turner, on January 10, 2000.Just a month shy of the deal’s 10th anniversary, the conglomerate that had long since dropped AOL from its name ended the decade by spinning off the unit altogether.In 2000, the $164bn all-stock takeover was unveiled in a blizzard of superlatives. The marriage of the world’s largest online service with the old media giant behind Time magazine and CNN was “the deal of the millennium”, breathless analysts said, heralding a new era of synergies between prime content and the internet’s world-changing distribution network.On the contrary, AOL Time Warner became a byword for top-of-the-market hubris. When Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS, told a conference this month that Comcast’s bid for NBC Universal was the biggest media deal since AOL Time Warner, his audience sniggered.The dreams of Steve Case and Jerry Levin, AOL and Time Warner’s chief executives at the time, fell apart not just with the bursting of the dotcom bubble in internet valuations.The list of reasons is long, ranging from petty culture clashes, which saw Time Warner employees resist adopting AOL e-mail addresses, to the fact that Time Warner had simply overvalued the AOL stock it sold out for.The deal was ultimately undone by flaws in its premise and holes in AOL’s business model. AOL’s lock on providing internet services in the dial-up world disappeared in the new world of broadband connections.Buying Time Warner, whose cable company controlled only a sliver of the US broadband market, did nothing to solve AOL’s migration challenge.The deal took a year to complete and the merged company was soon bogged down in an accounting scandal. By 2002, the management team was unravelling, too.Repeated attempts to sell or merge parts of AOL with partners such as Microsoft and Yahoo came to nothing in the intervening years, as Google became the world’s dominant internet company and splashy content acquisitions such as Bebo turned out to be expensive mistakes.A year after the deal closed, AOL writedowns forced the group into a $100bn loss, then the largest in US history.At its peak, AOL was valued at $240bn. As it started its newly independent existence and run by a former Google executive, its market value stood below $3bn.

But a recession at least ups the ante in turning research and development into commercial reality. Next year is looking to be a bumper one for new products.Apple’s tablet is one of the most keenly awaited devices. Having transformed the experience of browsing the internet through a mobile phone, hopes are that the hardware will bridge the gap between a full laptop and a small handheld. At best, this could solidify Apple’s position as the software maker of choice for mobile operating systems, providing more customers for its online applications store. At worst it will be a flop, shattering the air of invulnerability on which Apple’s lofty valuation – almost five times sales – rests.Bringing the internet more easily into the living room via a tablet will have other effects though, possibly forcing television and film companies to address the problem of competition from free online content. A recovery in advertising markets will help, but ZenithOptimedia forecasts global ad spending to rise by only 1 per cent in 2010 (after falling by a tenth in 2009). And the economics of online viewing, where users tolerate a minute of adverts per half hour, compared with nine on TV, do not stack up.However, Comcast at least should be motivated to try and change those dynamics. The cable company’s takeover of content business NBC Universal will bring with it a 30 per cent stake in an industry experiment, free video website Hulu. The deal may not even close in 2010 as regulators consider approval, but the company will be searching for ways to swiftly justify merging content with distribution.

624;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-22T21:01:21Z;Apple looks at internet TV foray;Hopes to launch service in 2010;Apple is courting owners of US television networks, including CBS and Walt Disney, in the hope of launching a subscription television service over the internet next year, people familiar with the discussions said.The service is expected to be offered over Apple’s iTunes digital entertainment store, which sells movies and TV shows, but does not offer them for a recurring monthly fee.The debut of the service is among other entertainment and news services that the maker of the iPod and iPhone could offer on the “tablet” computer it is widely expected to launch imminently.Magazine publishers Time Inc and Condé Nast have created prototype digital editions of their magazines for a new generation of handheld tablet devices from companies including Hewlett-Packard, Samsung and potentially Apple.Apple has contacted other broadcast and cable networks, including Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting System and Viacom, which have so far been unconvinced by Apple’s proposal. The computer maker has also courted the book publishing industry, sector executives say.“The driver behind it [the tablet] will be content,” said Kathryn Huberty, a Morgan Stanley analyst.Apple is preparing an announcement next month that many anticipate will be the official unveiling of its tablet, but the company has so far declined to confirm the existence of the device. Wall Street analysts expect mass production of an Apple tablet to begin as early as February.Executives close to the discussions fear Apple’s possible TV service could undermine the lucrative economics of the pay television industry, where basic networks such as MTV collect a fee per subscriber from distributors such as cable operators as well as selling advertising.The business model, honed over three decades, has made cable networks one of the most resilient sectors of the media industry during the recession and was the chief reason why Comcast sought to take control of NBC Universal from General Electric this year.Creating a new subscription service with Apple could upset distributors, these people said.Apple was said to be offering broadcast networks $2 to $4 per subscriber and basic cable networks $1 to $2 a month, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
625;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-21T16:17:11Z;Spanish media M&A;;Take a stiff recession, add breakneck technological change, and the result – for nearly all western media companies – has been a pounding. In the US, the likes of cable company Comcast has responded with consolidation, buying control of TV station NBC Universal. Now Europe is following suit, with Spain merging of two of its four free-to-air TV channels. It is a welcome and overdue move.Free-to-air station T5, controlled by Italy’s Mediaset, is the main protagonist. For a total consideration of €1bn, half equity and half cash, it is buying loss-making TV station Cuatro, owned by Grupo Prisa, the struggling publisher of newspaper El País. T5 will also take a 22 per cent stake in Prisa’s subsidiary Digital+, Spain’s biggest pay-TV company.The overall idea is simple. The number of Spanish free-to-air channels will fall. That should boost advertising revenues, especially as Spain’s state broadcaster is now banned from taking ads. Meanwhile Digital+, the centrepiece of the deal, will be strengthened. T5 will feed it traffic from its free-TV channels – much as Mediaset does in Italy. But Digital+ will also offer customers broadband via its minority partner Telefónica, which owns 21 per cent. The result will be a “triple-play” company similar to what cable operator Virgin Media had in mind when it tried to buy British free-to-air broadcaster ITV three years ago, but was thwarted by Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB.Mediaset comes out the winner from all this. It solidifies its Spanish position for a cash cost of €500m – and half of that will be paid for by T5’s minorities. For Prisa, a distressed seller, the result is more equivocal. Its strategic position is enhanced, but the company still needs to refinance €5bn of debt. Prisa believes this is achievable. But further asset sales or a rights issue may be necessary first.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyGestevision Telecinco, Spain’s biggest private TV company, known as T5, is to buy rival Cuatro and a 22 per cent stake in pay-TV business Digital+ for €1.05bn.T5, which is 50.1 per cent owned by Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Mediaset, will pay Spain’s largest media group Grupo Prisa, owner of Cuatro and Digital+, €550m of new shares for Cuatro and €500m in cash for the Digital+ stake.Spain passed legislation this year to allow mergers in the television industry as the recession and increased competition from digital channels eroded broadcasters’ profits.

626;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-17T02:56:15Z;Time Warner buys Indian entertainment network;;Time Warner will take control of NDTV Imagine, a top five Indian general entertainment broadcast network, for $126.5m in the second deal of the year to expand the US media company’s international portfolio.The company that owns CNN, People magazine and the Warner Bros film studio media company, spun-off its troubled AOL internet division this month, and has said it aimed to increase its exposure in the Indian market, where it currently distributes television networks including the Cartoon Network, CNN and Pogo.NDTV Imagine is a subsidiary of NDTV Networks.“Our accelerated pace of investment here underscores both our commitment to this dynamic market and our view of India’s compelling long-term potential,” said Steve Marcopoto, the president of Turner Broadcasting System Asia Pacific.The NDTV Imagine deal, which includes a $50m cash infusion for the business, follows its transaction in May to invest $241.5m for a third stake in Central European Media and is part of a broad strategy to invest more deeply in programming companies globally.US media companies have invested aggressively in India, attracted to the favourable regulatory environment and rapid growth in media consumption.As late as this year, NBC Universal, which owned a 26 per cent stake in NDTV Imagine’s holding company NDTV Networks, had been in negotiations for a majority stake, according to Indian media. But talks fell apart partially over the lack of further investment into the network.NBCU sold the stake back to NDTV Networks this year.General Electric, which owns an 80 per cent stake in NBCU, in December agreed to sell control of its media assets comprised of America’s oldest television network and a thriving collection of cable TV networks to Comcast, the top US cable operator.For months NDTV Networks sought other strategic partners to fill NBCU’s vacated role, according to the paidContent blog.Scripps Network in November said it purchased a 69 per cent stake in another subsidiary of NDTV Networks, NDTV Lifestyle Ltd, for $55m.The deal is the “final stage” of the restructuring of NDTV Networks, the company said.Sameer Nair, chief executive of NDTV Imagine, will continue to run the company.
627;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-16T00:35:34Z;Tough year leaves GE more focused;;General Electric’s earnings in 2010 are likely to be flat, but Jeffrey Immelt, its chief executive, expects a simpler, more focused company to post healthy returns in 2011 and 2012.Mr Immelt, discussing the challenges and opportunities facing GE at a summit for investors and analysts, said the company had come through a difficult year, but had outperformed all other industrials in the S&P 500 over the past three years. He said it would return to its strengths in infrastructure, technology, energy and finance.“We were playing defence a year ago,” Mr Immelt said, “but in 2010 you can think of the company being back on offence. We have a much easier hand to play than we had five years ago, or 10 years ago.”GE is coming off one of the most challenging years in its history, having had to cut its dividend in 2009 and endure a decline in its share price to $6.66 in March, down from the $38 it had reached a year earlier.The company’s finance arm, GE Capital, will no longer be the engine of the conglomerate’s profits, as it had been in the years prior to the credit crunch, but Mr Immelt said GE remained committed to the business. “The worst days are behind us,” he said.Mr Immelt said that healthcare reform in the US would be a big opportunity for the company, as would government stimulus spending in the US and abroad. “Our focus on government intervention is not going to change”, he said.In terms of energy, Mr Immelt said GE was well positioned to take advantage of trends towards gas and wind technologies. “This is going to be the gas and wind world,” he said. “This is just a great GE business.”GE would also perform well in developing economies such as India, China and south-east Asia, he said. Referring to a series of contracts and joint ventures that the company has struck recently, Mr Immelt said: “I don’t think anybody has played China better than GE has.”GE recently sold a majority stake in its NBC Universal unit to Comcast, generating much-needed cash for the parent company.Up until two years ago, GE had enjoyed a decades-long streak of meeting earnings targets every quarter. In early 2008, Mr Immelt assured investors that GE would once again meet expectations, but the collapse of Bear Stearns hurt the company’s ability to sell assets and resulted in a negative surprise for investors. GE has not provided earnings forecasts since then.Analysts expect GE to earn 99 cents per share for 2009. Mr Immelt said on Tuesday that 2010 was likely to be flat.Based on the amount of cash that GE’s far-flung operations generate, Mr Immelt said he would consider a share buyback once GE’s earnings are on the rise again. He also said his goal was to restore the company’s dividend within several years.

Diddy, rapper and entrepreneur, joined him on the floor of the exchange to fête the hoped-for rebirth of one of the internet’s first franchises.Eight years after AOL completed its takeover of Time Warner, which destroyed more than $100bn in shareholder value, the once largest dial-up internet service provider will cut its ties to one of the world’s largest producers of entertainment and news.It will debut as a smaller company as it goes head-to-head with Yahoo, Microsoft and Google for online advertising revenue.AOL, valued at more than $150bn when the merger was announced, is estimated to be worth $2.5bn today. Its shares, which have been trading on a “when issued” basis, rose 17 cents to $23.67 on Wednesday.Until Comcast agreed to take control of NBC Universal from General Electric last week, the unravelling of the AOL Time Warner deal had dissuaded a generation of media executives from so-called “transformative” mergers.Ironically, the new AOL will focus on becoming the web’s largest content producer.Mr Armstrong’s team has devised a content technology system where algorithms will help predict the popularity of stories and videos with users and advertisers, similar to companies such as Demand Media and Associated Content, in which Mr Armstrong is also an investor.Three thousand freelance writers will tap into a new website, Seed.com, to find article assignments based on the algorithms’ results.To assuage critics who claim the new system blurs the line between editorial and advertising, while commoditising content creation, executives stress that AOL employs nine Pulitzer prize winners among its 500 editorial employees.It this week hired Saul Hansell, a veteran New York Times technology journalist, to oversee Seed.com.Mr Armstrong, who left a lucrative career running North American advertising at Google last April, said the company would also focus on improving its unwieldy advertising technology, and streamline popular communications technologies such as AOL Instant Messenger.He said investors should no longer worry about “hail Marys” or the sudden expensive purchases of the previous regime, such as the $850m purchase of Bebo, a social network that trails Facebook and MySpace.“What happens over the next day or weeks doesn’t matter as much as the value that we create over time,” he said.
629;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Discovery taps Liguori for Oprah channel launch;;Discovery Communications, the cable channel operator behind non-fiction hits such as Man vs Wild and Mythbusters, has turned to a Hollywood marketing executive with a strong record in scripted entertainment to lead its joint ventures with Oprah Winfrey and Hasbro.Peter Liguori, the former Fox Broadcasting chairman who lost out in a reshuffle of the News Corp division in March, will take over as Discovery’s chief operating officer on January 19, replacing Mark Hollinger, who took over the group’s international networks last week.Mr Liguori, who oversaw shows such as The Shield and Nip/Tuck at Fox told the FT he hoped to bring his west coast connections and “marketing purview” to bear on programming which shared the high production values, “great storytelling” and strong characters of scripted drama.The former HBO and FX Networks executive confirmed he had spent part of the intervening months advising Comcast on its bid for NBC Universal, which was driven by the cable group’s interest in NBCU cable channels such as USA Networks.“Cable’s kind of where it’s at right now,” Mr Liguori said, highlighting last month’s Scripps Networks bid for control of the Travel Channel and Oprah Winfrey’s decision to move her talk show off broadcast television to the Oprah Winfrey Network, a cable joint venture with Discovery.Mr Liguori said he would act as Discovery’s “key liaison” with Ms Winfrey’s team, and with Hasbro, with which Discovery plans to launch a children’s television venture in the second half of 2010.Discovery, which has seen ratings and advertising revenue rise this year in contrast to most rivals, was “red hot”, he said.“The opportunity is to really accelerate and deepen the relationship viewers have with Discovery brands,” Mr Liguori said. “It’s not just good marketing campaigns and logos. It’s staying focused and staying on-brand with all the programming while finding the next big hit.”He would work closely with Mr Hollinger, he said, to integrate domestic and international programming more closely and efficiently.

Analysts had predicted it to hold steady at 10.2 per cent.“Because the payroll data is out of step with most other employment indicators, this suggests a strong seasonal factor influence in the report,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “As such, this report does little to change our double-dip risk assessment.”Big Lots added to the early optimism on Friday after the clearance retailer raised its outlook for the holiday season.The group, which sells manufacturers’ excess inventory at discounted prices, also posted quarterly results above estimates.Demand had remained strong during the recession and lower freight costs also boosted gross margins, the company said. Its shares jumped 19.3 per cent to $28.08.Retailers in general disappointed Wall Street this week as the results of the Thanksgiving shopping period emerged. More than 80 per cent of retailers missed their November sales estimates.

631;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-04T01:19:00Z;Services sector dip drags on Wall St;;An unexpected contraction in the services industry last month and sharp sales declines among retailers pushed US stocks lower on Thursday.The services index from the Institute for Supply Management, which tracks businesses such as banks and restaurants, had shown the industry was expanding in October.After struggling to hold on to its early gains, the S&P 500 gave up in the last 30 minutes of trading and fell sharply, ending 0.8 per cent lower at 1,099.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 10,366.15 and the Nasdaq was down 0.5 per cent to 2,173.14.The market had initially been buoyed by data showing that fewer Americans had filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week.The figures came ahead of Friday’s closely-watched government report on payrolls, which analysts believe will show the unemployment rate has held steady at 10.2 per cent. But Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com, said investors had been nervous the rate could be higher. “Given that there was a surprise last time, people are concerned that we are going to get another surprise this time and no one wants to be out in front of that,” he said.Positive corporate news had also fuelled Wall Street’s early optimism. Comcast finally sealed an agreement to take control of NBC Universal from General Electric. The deal, which values the unit at $30bn, will create one of America’s largest media companies.Comcast also said it would increase its dividend by 40 per cent and would complete a $3.6bn stock buyback in the next three years, helping boost its shares 6.5 per cent to $15.91. General Electric lost 0.4 per cent to $16.Shares in Bank of America advanced 0.7 per cent to $15.76 despite heavy declines among financials after the country’s biggest lender agreed to repay $45bn of federal bail-out funds. The bank plans to sell up to $18.8bn in securities that will convert into common stock once shareholders approve an increase in the bank’s shares.Retailers weighed on the market throughout the day after more than 80 per cent missed their November sales estimates.Like-for-like sales at Saks, the upmarket department store chain, plunged 26.1 per cent during the period, sending its shares down 5 per cent to $5.90.Shoppers also spent less at Macy’s over the Thanksgiving holiday, resulting in a 6.1 per cent sales decline last month.Its shares dropped 3 per cent to $15.81. All sectors of retail performed worse than forecast but the biggest disappointments came among the clothing chains catering to teenagers.But shares in Collective Brands, which owns the Payless Shoesource chain, jumped 7.6 per cent to $21.71 after the group reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter.Collective said it had benefited from a successful back-to-school season and stronger sales of boots.Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle manufacturer, said it would cut almost half of its workforce at its central Pennsylvania plant. But after a long-running dispute with its union, it agreed to keep the site open rather than moveto Kentucky. The shares dropped 3.2 per cent to $28.63.Toll Brothers, the largest luxury homebuilder in the US, posted a bigger than expected loss in the fourth quarter.However, the group also reported a strong rise in new contracts, indicating that conditions in the industry were improving. The shares still fell 7.5 per cent to $18.02. An unexpected jump in pending home sales had buoyed the sector this week.UTI Worldwide climbed 12.1 per cent to $14.85 after the shipping company reported third-quarter sales above estimates.The group said the number of goods sent by air had increased in October, marking the first rise since early last year.
632;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-04T00:19:13Z;Lawmakers warn on Comcast bid;;US officials warned they would closely scrutinise Comcast’s bid for control of NBC Universal, as the cable company sought to ease regulatory and shareholder concerns.The combination of the General Electric-run NBCU, valued at $30bn, with $7.25bn worth of Comcast’s cable channels, will create one of the US’s largest content and distribution companies, with a strong say in the development of new digital business models for the industry.A review of the deal by the Federal Communications Commission, and either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, is expected to take 12 months.“My longstanding scepticism about the harms imposed by few controlling so much persists,” said Michael Copps, a Democratic FCC commissioner. “They face a very steep climb with me.”Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said: “This proposal raises questions regarding diversity, competition, and the future of the production and distribution of video content across broadcasting, cable, online and mobile platforms.”Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, told the Financial Times: “We believe this is an approvable transaction.”He would not say whether any regulatory demands might be deal-breakers. He added that the deal would be “immediately accretive” to Comcast shareholders. Comcast said it would increase its dividend by 40 per cent and complete a $3.6bn stock buyback in the next three years.Comcast shares rose 6.5 per cent to $15.91, recovering some recent losses.Steve Burke, chief operating officer, said the goal was for the cable channels that would account for 80 per cent of the venture’s cash flow to expand faster than the industry average. SNL Kagan, a research group, estimates that the average will be 10.5 per cent in 2010 and 12.1 per cent in 2011 – below NBCU’s recent cable growth rate.The combination of Comcast properties, including E! and regional sports channels, with NBC cable assets, including USA Network and CNBC, runs against recent media trends.Comcast will pay about $6.5bn in cash, subject to adjustments, and own 51 per cent of the venture, which will take on $9.1bn in debt. GE plans to sell its 49 per cent in two steps over seven years.Vivendi has agreed to sell its 20 per cent stake in NBCU to GE for $5.8bn and will receive $2bn for 7.66 per cent up front if the Comcast-GE deal has not completed by September.
633;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-03T19:09:50Z;GE to gain $8bn from NBCU spin-off;;General Electric will eventually reap more than $8bn from the spin-off of NBC Universal, giving Jeff Immelt, the conglomerate’s chief executive, his first opportunity in several years to rev up what was once one of corporate America’s most prolific deal-making machines.Mr Immelt is unlikely to run short of ideas on how to spend the proceeds, created by on Thursday’s agreement to form an NBC Universal venture with Comcast and gradually wind down its remaining stake in the media business.The credit crisis that enveloped the financial-services industry last year took its toll on GE and its own finance arm, GE Capital, denting the conglomerate’s financial strength and sapping its flexibility to pursue sizeable acquisitions. Mr Immelt has pledged to emerge from the economic downturn with a sharper focus on industrial businesses.“We see so much great growth and global infrastructure businesses,” Mr Immelt said during an appearance on NBC Universal’s business-news cable network, CNBC.“We just think it’s great to have capital to invest in those, in those assets, where we really have a great footprint and immense strength.”When the NBC Universal deal with Comcast closes GE will have about $25bn in cash to invest, he said on Thursday.In a process Mr Immelt initiated in 2001, each of GE’s division heads must submit at least five ideas for acquisitions and partnerships every month to Pam Daley, the conglomerate’s senior vice president of corporate business development.For GE, the Comcast transaction will contribute about $8bn at closing and include a small tax gain, the company said.Other disposals may follow.GE had weighed shedding its consumer and industrial division, which includes long-time product lines such as light bulbs and appliances, and its private-label credit card arm last year, before deciding to keep the slow-growth businesses until conditions had improved.The stock-market rally has helped drive many companies to issue stock and fuelled executives’ confidence to make acquisitions. In the meantime, the debt markets have reopened to multibillion-dollar leveraged buy-outs.Steven Winoker, an analyst with Sanford C Bernstein, predicted last month that GE would sell or spin-off businesses with annual revenues totalling as much as $30bn in the next two to three years.“Acquisitions will be key. We think staying closer to what they do best – scale, technology, service – will have a higher chance of success than some prior efforts,” Mr Winoker wrote in a note to clients.Some of the NBC Universal proceeds had been earmarked for the electric transmission and distribution business of Areva, the French energy group. GE had bid about €4bn ($6bn) for the division only to learn this week it had lost the auction to a combined French bid from Alstom and Schneider Electric.GE had coveted the Areva unit for its strong European presence and for the opportunities the acquisition would have created selling the division’s transmission gear to customers in the US and China.Despite the setback, GE’s energy-infrastructure arm is likely to benefit from the NBC Universal divestiture.The division is not only a centrepiece of Mr Immelt’s growth strategy but also a source of consistent earnings that has helped cushion the conglomerate’s results from the impact of the troubles at GE Capital.The sprawling business is engaged in everything from renewable markets, to next-generation electric grid equipment, while remaining a leader in more mature markets, including gas turbines.
634;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;NBCU deal tests Obama’s merger policies;;The creation of a company that could control about one-fifth of all advertising on US televisions poses the first significant test of the Obama administration’s merger policies.Congressman Henry Waxman said it was “imperative” that the Federal Communications Commission, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission “rigorously” assess the transaction. Brian Roberts and Steve Burke, Comcast’s chief executive and chief operating officer, told the FT the DoJ and FTC had yet to inform them which agency would join the FCC in reviewing the deal.Comcast sought to head off criticism with a series of “affirmative voluntary commitments” to local affiliates and to audiences including children and Hispanic viewers.One media industry executive said regulators’ demands were likely to go far beyond these points, reducing synergy benefits in the deal and potentially reducing Comcast’s negotiating power over programme suppliers. One potential deal-breaker could be if regulators required Comcast to sell its services in unbundled “a la carte” packages.
635;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-03T12:55:35Z;Comcast to take control of NBC Universal;;Comcast has sealed an agreement to take control of NBC Universal from General Electric in a deal valuing the media property at $30bn that will create one of America’s largest media companies.The top US cable operator will contribute its collection of cable properties including E!, Versus and a portfolio of regional sports television networks worth $7.25bn to a joint venture that features America’s oldest television network and a roster of the most popular cable channels including USA Network, CNBC and Bravo.The deal runs against recent media industry trends in splitting apart content creation and distribution that has inspired decades of deal-making, but failed to generate more value combined than apart.Comcast will pay about $6.5bn in cash, subject to adjustments and will own 51 per cent of the combined venture and GE will own 49 per cent. Vivendi has agreed to sell its 20 per cent stake in NBCU back to GE for $5.8bn. The new venture will take on $9.1bn in debt to third party lenders.The deal “will allow us to become a leader in the development and distribution of multiplatform ‘any time, anywhere’ media that American consumers are demanding,” said Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast.Mr Roberts said the deal will be “immediately accretive” while allowing the company to continue returning capital to shareholders. To reinforce the point, Comcast said it would increase its dividend by 40 per cent and said it was committed to completing a $3.6bn stock buyback in the next three years.“Today, we are strategically complete,” Mr Roberts said on CNBC.After months of haggling over Vivendi’s sale of its 20 per cent stake in NBCU, the French company accepted an interim payment of $2bn for 7.66 per cent of NBCU shares if the deal between GE and Comcast was not completed by September 2010.How much Vivendi would be paid if the deal was blocked by US antitrust authorities had been a sticking point in negotiations with GE.Vivendi said it would sell its remaining 12.34 per cent stake in NBCU for $3.8bn upon the completion of the GE-Comcast transaction. If that transaction was never completed, Vivendi intends to sell its remaining stake through an initial public offering.The NBCU stake was Vivendi’s last minority asset and its sale gives the French group cash to complete its takeover of GVT, a Brazilian broadband operator, and to pursue further acquisitions in emerging markets.Jean-Bernard Lévy, Vivendi chief executive, said the disposal left the French group “more coherent, and more focused on rapidly growing countries, with a stronger presence in communications and entertainment businesses that it has managed for many years”.Vivendi’s sale of the NBCU stake draws a line under the era of Jean-Marie Messier, the former chief executive, who took Vivendi to the brink of bankruptcy with a series of audacious but reckless deals. These included the takeover of Seagram and its Universal unit.Speaking before the agreed sale, analysts regarded the price tag of $5.8bn as a good deal for Vivendi even it came in below the $6.1bn value the company had placed on its stake.For GE, the transaction will contribute about $8bn at closing and include a small tax gain, the company said, allowing the conglomerate to invest further in the global infrastructure business. “NBCU has been a great business for GE over the past two decades,” Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and CEO of GE, said. “We have generated an average annual return of 11 per cent, while expanding into cable, movies, parks and international media.”GE can sell back half its remaining interest after three-and-a-half years and the remaining stake after seven. Cash flow from the joint venture is expected to pay for the remaining stake so long as its leverage ratio does not exceed 2.75-times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, retaining its investment grade rating.Comcast has agreed to “backstop” the redemption commitment – paying up to $5.75bn over seven years if the joint venture’s cash flow is unable to pay GE for its remaining stake.The transaction has elicited spirited protest from organisations opposing further media consolidation and a government regulatory review is expected to last 12 months. There is no break-up fee if Comcast and GE’s deal fails to pass regulatory review.“This merger’s potential to foreclose competition and stifle innovation is significant and real,” said Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation of America.To address opponents fearful the company would over time transform the free-to-air NBC TV network into a pay cable channel, Comcast said it was committed to maintaining the free business model. “We will continue our co-operative dialogue with our affiliates toward a business model to sustain free over-the-air service that can be workable in the evolving economic and technological environment,” said David Cohen, executive vice president of Comcast.Morgan Stanley was lead financial adviser to Comcast with UBS and Bank of America as co-advisers. JPMorgan was lead financial adviser to GE, and Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were co-advisers.
636;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Comcast venture values NBC Universal at $37bn;;Comcast’s long-awaited bid for control of NBC Universal will value the new joint venture with General Electric at an unexpectedly larger $37.25bn before debt, boosted by a higher valuation on the US cable group’s pay-television stations, and also the potential for a larger cash outlay than analysts had foreseen.The top US cable service company’s bid for a 51 per cent stake values the existing NBCU assets – which include the NBC television network, Universal Studios and cable channels include CNBC and Bravo – at $30bn including $9bn of debt.On Thursday Vivendi, the French media and telecoms group, confirmed that it had agreed to sell its 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal to GE for $5.8bn.Analysts had estimated that Comcast would pay GE about $6bn cash as well as injecting its own cable channels, the value of which they had also estimated at about $6bn.However, people briefed on the terms of the complex transaction as they stood on the eve of the announcement said these included a larger cash component.This is valued at $6.5bn but could be lower or could rise to about $7bn based on financial variables.They added that the agreement would also include a higher valuation than expected of about $7.25bn for the networks Comcast would contribute to the joint venture, such as E! and the Golf Channel.The higher valuation for Comcast’s assets boosts the joint venture’s value to $37.25bn from an earlier expected $36bn.GE has agreed to buy out Vivendi’s stake for $5.8bn, but has made this conditional on the progress of the Comcast deal, which is expected to be subject to a regulatory review that could last 12 months.If GE and Comcast have not finalised their deal by the end of 2010, or if it is blocked in Washington, Vivendi has the right to sell GE part of its stake for $2bn. It would then retain an option governing how it could dispose of its remaining holding over time.GE intends to sell the remaining 49 per cent in two stages, starting three and a half years after the initial transaction closes and ending three and a half years after that.The agreement includes no ‘break fee’ that would be paid should the deal fall apart for regulatory or other reasons, according to two people familiar with its terms. This suggests that GE is committed to securing a deal with Comcast come what may.
637;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-02T22:42:43Z;Comcast’s NBCU move is no joke;;"Tina Fey quipped last month about whether NBC Universal would change the name of hit show 30 Rock to Industrial Park on the Schuylkill River.The show, which stars the popular comedian, is named after 30 Rockefeller, where NBCU is located in New York, and is probably in no danger of being renamed after the location of cable group Comcast’s headquarters.However, media executives wondered whether the underpinnings of Ms Fey’s comedic turn – the proposed deal by Comcast to take control of NBCU from General Electric – were all that they seemed.Analysts had proclaimed the move as a bold bid to unite content and distribution by fusing the US’s largest cable services company with the country’s oldest broadcast network.However, those familiar with Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, say the deal, expected to be announced on Thursday and which values NBCU at $30bn, was driven largely by financial considerations.The proposed deal will see Comcast buy a 51 per cent stake in a joint venture that combines NBCU with its own roster of smaller cable networks such as E! and the Golf Channel for only about $6.5bn up front. It will create the country’s largest entertainment company; rivalling Disney, which Comcast failed to buy in 2004 for $60bn.Supporters of the deal say it is a hedge against the declining growth of Mr Roberts’ cable television, broadband and phone company empire, where it competes heavily with rival phone and satellite rivals.“It’s an opportune and important transaction for both companies,” says Leo Hindery, the managing partner of InterMedia Partners and former chief executive of TCI, once the largest US cable operator. “NBC and Comcast will be stronger if it gets done.”The NBC television network, once anchored by the superstar line-up of Seinfeld and Friends, is now ranked last among the free-to-air US TV networks.In more explicit terms, “Comcast can buy it at an attractive price and can generate value through market timing”, one executive who has had business dealings with Mr Roberts said. “It’s clear the way he thinks about media deals simply through the lens of a portfolio manager.”Indeed, Comcast would benefit from NBC’s Olympic ties and would give the cable operator leverage to transform its Versus sports network into a credible rival to ESPN, Disney’s lucrative cable sports television network.Analysts have also speculated that Comcast would probably explore offering more films from Universal Studio’s vast library – including The Fast and the Furious and Flash Gordon – over cable video-on-demand quicker than current release periods.“There is more evidence now than in 2004 that the consumer is moving to more non-linear viewing and that marketers are shifting their dollars towards both cable and digital,” says Christopher Vollmer, a partner at Booz Allen, explaining why Comcast’s NBCU deal differs from its Disney approach.But beyond that, the so-called synergies appear specious, media executives and analysts say.“If all of these initiatives, like addressable advertising and better windows on video-on-demand, [are] in the interest of content owners. It should happen anyway [without an acquisition],” says Craig Moffett, an analyst at Bernstein Research and a critic of Comcast’s NBCU and Disney moves.Other potential benefits from owning NBCU would probably be diluted after US regulators tack on “consent decree” conditions, such as the inability to withhold broadcast signals as part of a business disagreement, says Mr Moffett.“This deal is going to be met by a sceptical US Federal Communications Commission that will view it through the lens of unwanted media consolidation,” he says.Perhaps the more pressing matter is how a cable company can resuscitate NBCU’s suffering TV network, one former television network chief wondered.Owning a network “sucks the oxygen out of the room and puts a lot of pressure on the rest of your company”, the executive says."
638;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-02T21:47:33Z;Cable guys gain little from merging;;"This is how media synergy ends, not with a bang but a whimper.Comcast, the biggest US cable television operator, is expected on Thursday to unveil a $30bn (£18bn, €20bn) deal to buy 51 per cent of NBC Universal, the television and film company, from General Electric. It is the culmination of a complex piece of asset shuffling involving Comcast, GE and Vivendi, the French media and communications group.In the old days, companies that snapped up media groups would lay out dazzling visions of hoped-for synergies from combining different assets. The merger of AOL and Time Warner in 2000 was the culmination of such bravado but ended, like others, in disillusion.This time, Comcast’s ambition to buy a media company, which it revealed in 2004 when it tried to acquire Walt Disney, has settled on a more manageable target. As well as a troubled broadcast network and an underperforming studio, NBC owns profitable and growing cable networks including CNBC, Bravo and The Weather Channel.Its rationale for combining media assets with cable distribution is as convoluted as the structure of the deal. NBC’s cable networks may offset a decline in basic cable subscriptions; or Comcast’s control of a studio will let it bring films faster to cable; or it will retrieve the cash it pays to cable networks. Pick one, or all, of the above.The odds on small bets can be just as bad as those on a big one, however. Synergy, in any sense other than a company buying a similar one and cutting out costly duplication, has never fulfilled its promise in media. The fact that Comcast has the money to try again does not justify the gamble.Leo Hindery, a financier who used to run AT&T’s cable system, argues that Comcast has more or less reached the limits of growth in its core business (it reaches 24m US homes) and either has to branch out or return cash to shareholders in dividends or buybacks.“Brian [Roberts, chief executive of Comcast] is confronting a typical growth challenge. What do you do next?” says Mr Hindery.The fact that the Roberts family controls Comcast with a dual-class share structure makes it easy for them to keep expanding. The better bet, although less fun, would be to return the money to shareholders and accept that their growth business is becoming a cash cow.For every buyer there is a seller, and in this case two sellers are fleeing film and television. Vivendi wants to focus on telecoms and emerging markets, while GE wants to end the long distraction of attaching a volatile and needy media group to its industrial businesses.Meanwhile, others have been retreating from the idea that combining media assets can make the whole greater than the sum of the parts. Time Warner has spun off its cable arm – Comcast’s biggest competitor – and is about to do the same with AOL, while Viacom and CBS have undone their merger.There are some clear ways in which combining ownership of television networks and film with cable distribution would add value for shareholders. Unfortunately, as Bernstein Research says, they are “so obvious that they’re illegal”.Cable companies are barred by the 1992 Cable Act from keeping their own cable networks off their competitors’ systems. Meanwhile, the regulators that will pore intensively over the deal will make it hard for Comcast-NBC to throw its weight around in negotiations on how much rivals pay to carry its cable networks (or whether they pay for NBC).So what does this leave for Comcast to exploit? By buying NBC, it gains a 30 per cent stake in Hulu, a venture that, like the BBC iPlayer, offers internet replays of television shows. Hulu is a hedge against cable distribution being displaced by the internet, but that is a long-term bet with no guarantee of success.Meanwhile, Comcast could use Universal to push other studios into letting films be shown on demand on cable at the same time as they are sold on DVD. At the moment, however, Universal is not doing well and Comcast must invest capital to give it bargaining power.These synergies look either modest or long-dated, which raises the question of why Comcast wants NBC at all. The least charitable explanation is that Mr Roberts is attracted, like oil companies, hedge funds and others before him, by the glamour of Hollywood and would rather be there than in Philadelphia, where Comcast is based.There is a more charitable explanation, although it does not justify the deal for shareholders. Cable networks are a good business by the standards of broadcast, music and print, while cable operators face sharper competition from satellite and telecoms rivals.Cable networks with niche audiences, from Nickelodeon to Fox News and ESPN, are still pulling advertising from broadcast and have cash-flow margins of 40 to 60 per cent, according to SNL Kagan. That makes NBC’s cable assets a nice addition to Comcast’s cables.The problem is that the whole is no greater than the sum of the parts – there is no synergy. Comcast’s shareholders could as easily make an investment in cable networks themselves without it being mediated by the Roberts family.Big media companies have tried to gain synergies from divergent assets before and have failed miserably. By acquiring control of NBC, Comcast is attempting something that is more modest, hedged and defensible than these earlier, grander visions. It is no more likely to work.john.gapper@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/johngapperRead and post comments at John Gapper’s business blog"

Shares in Pulte Homes, the country’s largest homebuilder, climbed 1.9 per cent to $9.31 and KB Home, which targets first-time buyers, was up 1 per cent at $13.69.The release overshadowed disappointing manufacturing data. Fears over the Dubai debt crisis also receded, prompting investors to return to riskier assets.“As the shroud of the Dubai saga is lifted from investors’ mindsets, equity markets continue to rally as trading for the final month of the year gets under way,” said Andrew Wilkinson at Interactive Brokers.The S&P 500 closed up 1.2 per cent at 1,108.86 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit fresh highs for the year, gaining 1.2 per cent to 10,471.58. The Nasdaq climbed 1.5 per cent to 2,175.81.Renewed dollar weakness and better-than-expected manufacturing data from China lifted commodities, pushing materials and energy stocks higher.Helix Energy Solutions jumped 6.4 per cent to $12.51 after the oil and gas services company announced a discovery in the Gulf of Mexico.Interoil also surprised the market pleasantly by announcing that production at its well in Papua New Guinea had hit a record rate. Shares in the Texan group rose 8.1 per cent to $60.43.However, SandRidge Energy shares fell 4.2 per cent to $8.99 after the group agreed to buy Permian Basin properties from Forest Oil for $800m.Deal news helped lift investors’ confidence in the health of corporate America. After months of speculation, there were widespread reports on Tuesday that General Electrichad agreed to pay Vivendi $5.8bn for the French group’s 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal. The deal would pave the way for GE to sell 51 per cent of the media group to Comcast, giving it unrivalled control over the creation and distribution of news and entertainment in the US. While GE shares gained 0.9 per cent to $16.17, Comcast added 2.1 per cent to $14.96.Retailers added to the optimism.Shares in Staples, the office products retailer, rose 4.8 per cent to $24.44 after the chain’s third-quarter results topped estimates. While sales were flat over the period, the group said it expected to see its core North American business continue to improve. The acquisition last year of its Dutch rival, Corporate Express, would also boost sales, the retailer said.Guess, the clothing chain, surprised analysts with an optimistic forecast for the holiday season, helping its shares jump 12.9 per cent to $41.82. Revenues from its North American stores edged higher over the third quarter, helped by strong sales of boots and denim.American International Group recovered some of Monday’s losses after the insurer announced it had reduced its debt with the Federal Reserve by $25bn through two debt-for-equity swaps. Shares rose 8.6 per cent to $30.84. On Monday, the stock lost almost 15 per cent in value after Sanford C. Bernstein, the investment research group, forecast a large shortfall in the group’s insurance reserves.Consolidated Edison, the utility company that provides electricity to New York, announced plans to sell 5m shares to raise funds for construction projects. The shares edged 0.9 per cent higher to $43.31.In the semiconductor industry, OmniVision Technologies, which makes image sensors used in digital cameras and mobile phones, forecast third-quarter revenue below estimates. Even though second-quarter results exceeded expectations, the shares fell 11.2 per cent to $12.44.Altera gained 4.6 per cent to $22 after raising its growth forecast. The Californian chipmaker has benefited from rising demand from telecoms equipment makers, especially for shipments to China and India.Mentor Graphics, which makes the software for designing and testing semiconductors, was raised to “overweight” from “underweight” by JPMorgan Chase, boosting its shares 11.1 per cent to $8.11.
640;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-01T23:29:09Z;No cash for Vivendi in deal for NBC stake;;Vivendi will not receive any cash upfront from General Electric for its stake in NBC Universal under a $5.8bn proposed deal agreed this week – a move that will boost GE’s cash flow at a crucial time in the economic cycle.People close to the situation said GE would pay more than its original offer of about $5bn for the French media group’s 20 per cent stake in NBCU but delay payments until late next year at the earliest.The deal came despite an earlier contract that each year gives Vivendi the right to cash out immediately by forcing an initial public offering of its stake unless GE buys it at a mutually agreed price. The window for Vivendi to exercise this option opened on November 15 and is due to close on December 10.The agreement on Vivendi’s stake, which was revealed late on Monday, paves the way for GE to sell 51 per cent of NBCU to Comcast, the US cable company, for about $30bn. Both deals could be announced this week.Under the terms agreed with GE, Vivendi will receive $5.8bn in cash once the Comcast transaction closes – a process that could take more than a year due to regulatory reviews. However, if the deal has not closed by the latter part of 2010, Vivendi would be entitled to a payment of up to $2bn from GE, according to people familiar with the situation.Delaying most of the payment until the Comcast deal closes will help GE conserve cash at a time when it wants to invest in its core industrial and financial businesses to take advantage of the global economic recovery.Vivendi shares rose 4 per cent, or 76 cents, to €19.95 on Tuesday, partly because the sale price was higher than expected.“The headline number sounds very good and indicates the management team has worked hard to extract as much value as it can for what is, after all, a minority asset,” said Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Bernstein Research.He added, however: “The question is whether the value seems as high when we know all the terms and conditions. First, what are the risks if the GE-Comcast deal doesn’t come through?”“Second, how will the cash be paid and over what period of time? Vivendi might want to use the money for further deals so the availability of the cash matters.”Vivendi has insisted that, even after spending more than €3bn on two recent deals, it has sufficient capacity in its balance sheet and is in no hurry to sell the NBCU stake.GE, Vivendi and Comcast declined to comment.Additional reporting by Justin Baer in New York and Ben Hall in Paris
641;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-12-01T20:15:18Z;Comcast / NBCU;By buying Vivendi’s stake, GE has set the stage for a unwise deal;Be careful what you wish for. General Electric and Vivendi have agreed a $5.8bn price for the latter’s 20 per cent of NBC Universal. So cable company Comcast should now be able to buy a majority stake in the media group, fulfilling its ambition of combining media content production with the physical pipes of distribution. But the benefits of merging are so obvious that politicians and regulators will strive to stop them being realised.Shareholders have frowned. Since attempting to buy Walt Disney in 2004, Comcast has underperformed the broader market, and 15 per cent has been knocked off its share price after its intentions towards NBCU emerged. Meanwhile, the implicit lack of confidence in Comcast’s core cable business depresses valuations for the entire sector.However, regulatory approval would take at least a year. Conditions attached could also go beyond preventing Comcast from abusing ownership of content – for instance by withholding attractive channels from competitors. A merged Comcast/NBCU might be hamstrung in commercial negotiations over content fees. And in a mid-term election year, such a tie-up would attract scrutiny for cable fees, media ownership and net neutrality. Consent decrees can also apply arbitrary conditions to a deal. Bernstein notes that when AT&T merged with BellSouth in 2006, the Federal Communications Commission specified price and service requirements for some customers.Less contentious benefits could come from pushing for more timely video on demand to offset declining DVD revenues, or by charging for online content such as Hulu (of which NBCU owns 30 per cent). But others in the industry could do this too. Only in a few local fee negotiations, and through a stronger sports brand, would Comcast alone gain. The desire to merge represents much wishful thinking.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially

All of a sudden the money would not seem that much. Second, how will the cash be paid and over what period of time? Vivendi might want to use the money for further deals so the availability of the cash matters.”The $5.8bn valuation is at the high end of analysts’ expectations but slightly below the stake’s current valuation in Vivendi’s books.The stake sale will ease pressure on Vivendi’s balance sheet after its $4.2bn takeover of 54 per cent of GVT, a Brazilian broadband operator.GE and Vivendi had been haggling over the valuation since the French group’s annual window for exercising a put option on the stake opened on November 15.One person familiar with the negotiations intimated that GE may not pay Vivendi the full $5.8bn upfront, but would stagger the payment over a period, reflecting the expectation that the Comcast deal may take a year to clear regulatory hurdles.Comcast’s offer to buy a 51 per cent stake in NBCU for about $30bn was expected to be announced last week, but was delayed as GE and Vivendi sought to bridge a gap of close to $1bn over the valuation of the French group’s stake, people familiar with the matter said.Vivendi declined to comment.Comcast’s bid for control of one of Hollywood’s biggest film studio and television networks would give it unrivalled power over the creation and distribution of news and entertainment in the US.Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, the largest US cable operator, has long coveted content following a failed hostile bid for Disney in 2004.
643;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;GE and Vivendi agree NBC Universal deal;;General Electric has agreed to pay Vivendi $5.8bn for the French group’s 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal, according to a person familiar with the negotiations, paving the way for the conglomerate’s planned sale of 51 per cent of the US media group to Comcast.The valuation is at the high end of expectations and essentially equates to one fifth of the valuation the Comcast deal puts on NBCU, once debt is stripped out. However, it is slightly below the stake’s current valuation in Vivendi’s books.GE and Vivendi had been haggling over the valuation since the French group’s annual window for exercising a put option on the stake opened on November 15. It was not immediately clear, however, whether GE would pay Vivendi the full $5.8bn upfront, or seek to stagger the payment over a period, given that the Comcast deal is expected to take as long as a year to clear regulatory hurdles.Comcast’s deal to buy a 51 per cent stake in NBCU for $30bn was expected to be announced last week, but was delayed by GE’s negotiations with Vivendi over the value of the stake. The two sides sought to bridge a gap of close to $1bn, people familiar with the matter said.Vivendi declined to comment.Comcast’s deal to take control of one of Hollywood’s biggest movie studio and television networks will give Comcast unrivaled control over the creation and distribution of news and entertainment in the US.Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, the largest US cable operator, has long coveted content following a failed hostile bid for Disney in 2004.Mr Roberts’ run for NBC Universal runs against current media industry conventional wisdom as rivals have failed to generate value out of owning the production and distribution of content. Time Warner this year spun off its cable division and will complete a spin off of AOL in December.Under the terms of an agreement dating back to Vivendi’s sale of its interest in Universal Studios to GE, the French group behind properties such as Universal Music and Activision Blizzard could have pursued the alternative option of pushing for an initial public offering of NBC Universal. However, such a move could have yielded a smaller sum for its stake and complicated GE’s plan to cut its exposure to its only media asset.The $5.8bn settlement with GE, first reported by WSJ.com, will ease pressure on Vivendi’s balance sheet after its $4.2bn takeover of 54 per cent of GVT, a Brazilian broadband operator.The deals with Vivendi and Comcast will begin GE’s gradual withdrawal from a business that brought glitz – and, in its heyday, big profits – to a conglomerate once known to many solely for its light bulbs and toasters. But with NBC Universal’s struggles now a drag on GE’s growth prospects, and given the media industry’s uncertain future, company executives had grown concerned the business might sap resources best placed with their industrial divisions.While the eventual disposal of NBC will sever another link to the Jack Welch era at GE, Mr Welch himself had by the early 1990s tired of the media business’s volatile results. He sought a buyer for the division before ultimately deciding to hold onto it, leaving the call to his successor, Jeff Immelt.The spinoff, along with Mr Immelt’s decision to shrink the conglomerate’s financial services arm, will also mark a return to GE roots as an industrial powerhouse. The group will focus on engineering know-how, government infrastructure work and a massive installed base of customers whose service contracts provide the company with reliable revenue stream years after they buy their first GE gas turbine or aircraft engine.
644;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-11-25T00:13:50Z;Facebook paves way for IPO;;Facebook has followed Google’s lead and introduced a dual-class stock structure, the clearest sign yet that the world’s most popular social networking site is preparing for an eventual public offering.In doing so, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s 25-year-old chief executive, looks to be solidifying his long-term grip on the site he founded five years ago that has become the fourth most popular destination on the web.Dual-class stock structures are controversial because they give certain shareholders much stronger voting rights than others.“Dual-class stock is an anathema to institutional investors,” said Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. “Ultimately, shareholders lose. If something were to go wrong, there’s absolutely nothing they can do about it.”The use of separate classes of shares to protect the voting control of a narrow group of investors has traditionally been used in the US only in the media business. Public investors in companies such as the New York Times, Comcast and Hollinger have not been able to exert the control they would normally have, Mr Elson said.Google adopted the practice when it went public in 2004, granting class-B shares to co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and chief executive Eric Schmidt.Google’s class-B shares held 10 times the voting rights as its class-A shares, an arrangement mimicked by Facebook.At the time, Mr Page warned that share structure would leave control of the company substantially with him and Mr Brin, though he added that that was necessary to fulfil the company’s long-term vision.With Tuesday’s move, Mr Zuckerberg appears to be emulating this strategy.Facebook confirmed the plan in a statement, saying that “existing shareholders wanted to maintain control over voting on certain issues to help ensure the company can continue to focus on the long term to build a great business”.Mr Zuckerberg has said that he plans to take the company public eventually. But on Tuesday Facebook said an IPO was not imminent.Facebook will convert all current shareholders to class-B stock, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the plan.Shares that carry higher voting rights usually lose that privilege when they change hands, leaving control with an even more concentrated group of investors over the long term.
645;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-11-20T00:53:23Z;Stake valuations hit Comcast deal for NBC;;General Electric and Vivendi are at least $1bn apart in their valuation of the French group’s stake in NBC Universal, damping hopes of a quick resolution to a stand-off that is holding up Comcast’s planned bid for a majority stake in the US broadcast, cable and film group.GE and Comcast, the cable operator that wants to take a 51 per cent stake in NBC Universal, have been eager to unveil an agreement before Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday in the US, people familiar with the negotiations said. Although GE and Comcast have been working towards an announcement on Monday, GE and Vivendi remain $1bn-$2bn apart on the valuation of the French group’s 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal, said these people.Comcast’s offer values NBC Universal at about $30bn, implying a $6bn valuation for Vivendi’s stake. Vivendi in June estimated the value of the stake at $6.3bn, so would have to take a further writedown should it receive less.However, a 2004 agreement between the companies stipulates that any sale must be conducted at “public market values”. This would treat Comcast’s offer as a private deal that would not influence the valuation.GE’s negotiating position is understood to be that current media sector multiples would imply a price of $4bn-$5bn. Independent analysts’ estimates vary, but Bernstein Research has valued NBC Universal at $27bn, suggesting Vivendi could expect $5.4bn for its holding.Under an agreement struck when Vivendi sold Universal Studios to the GE-controlled NBC in 2004, Vivendi can force an initial public offering of its stake unless GE offers a more attractive price.The annual window for exercising that option opened on Sunday and will close on December 10. No media IPO of such size has been attempted since the credit crunch began, leading analysts to forecast that a sale looks more likely, but Vivendi has not taken the IPO option off the table.Should the two sides remain deadlocked, the 2004 agreement dictates that they must each appoint an investment bank to provide a “fairness opinion”. Should their advisers return with valuations less than 20 per cent apart, Vivendi and GE must settle in the middle of the range. No banks have been chosen for the task, said people familiar with the negotiations.GE and Vivendi declined to comment.
646;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-11-19T20:20:20Z;AOL to slash workforce by a third;;AOL on Thursday said it would cut a third of its global workforce, or about 2,500 jobs, in an effort to save $300m annually.The move comes ahead of its planned spin-off from Time Warner next month.The one-time world’s largest internet service provider will ask for volunteers to leave the company before moving to compulsory lay-offs.AOL will take a $200m charge in the first half of 2010, the company disclosed in a regulatory filing.The restructuring comes on the heels of job cuts of about 100 employees this month, which included significant cuts of workers from the London office of Bebo, the social networking site. Bebo’s advertising sales force in London will combine with AOL’s UK operations.AOL said it would buy Time Warner in 2000 in a $164bn all-stock deal that began falling apart even before the deal closed a year later. AOL’s value, pegged at about $200bn before the merger, is now estimated to be about $3bn.The deal, which capped the end of the dotcom boom, has come to symbolise the strategic pitfalls in combining content with distribution.Despite few examples of success, the idea of putting together both business areas continues to inspire investment bankers and their media mogul clients.Media watchers have drawn comparisons between AOL and Time Warner’s merger with Comcast’s impending deal to buy a controlling stake in NBC Universal, which is controlled by General Electric.“Just because something is not right in one place doesn’t mean it’s not right in [another],” Jeff Zucker, chief executive of NBC Universal, said at a New York media conference in response to questions comparing the two deals.The Comcast deal, worth about $30bn, could be consummated by next week, people familiar with the matter said this week.Vivendi, which owns 20 per cent of NBC Universal, is in negotiations to sell the stake back to General Electric. Vivendi will not be a part of the Comcast, NBC Universal joint venture, Philippe Capron, chief financial officer of Vivendi, told attendees of a Morgan Stanley investors conference in Barcelona on Thursday.AOL will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on December 10 under its original symbol “AOL”.Tim Armstrong, chief executive of AOL and a former head of US advertising at Google, has said AOL will focus on developing content as it separates from one of the world’s largest producers of entertainment and news. Mr Armstrong will give up his 2009 bonus as part of the cost cuts.AOL has become an aggressive recruiter of journalists as newspapers and magazines suffer cost-cuts from a decline in advertising revenue.
647;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-11-16T21:04:54Z;Vivendi / GVT;;Vivendi is no longer guilty of vaulting ambition. Were Jean-Marie Messier still heading the French media conglomerate, a bid for the 80 per cent of NBC Universal it does not own would still be a possibility. Instead, a sale of Vivendi’s stake is likely as General Electric mulls some form of deal with cable network Comcast.But paying up for growth is a hard habit to lose. This weekend Vivendi announced a knock-out bid for Brazilian telecom operator GVT.The move is necessary to win a bidding war with Spanish competitor Telefónica, but the R$56 per share Vivendi will now pay is a third higher than the R$42 first mooted back in September. And Telefónica factored into its R$50.5 offer the prospect of cost savings from merging GVT with existing Brazilian operations – worth R$8 per share, according to the company. By contrast, Vivendi will have to run GVT as a standalone entity.Indeed, the R$7.4bn (€2.9bn) enterprise value for GVT equates to nine times expectations for 2010 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That is just about in line with recent emerging market telecoms transactions in Asia and Africa, but is twice the multiples carried by Brazilian peers.GVT is expected to grow revenues by a quarter in each of the next two years. Only about a 10th of the Brazilian population have internet access. But two factors would suggest caution.First, the telecoms industry is notorious for requiring capital investment to deliver growth – GVT has produced little actual cash in recent years. Second, increasing competition is likely, with GVT about to become the third operator in São Paulo, which may erode margins. If Vivendi is going to spend money so freely, it really must extract a decent price for NBCU.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyThe Lex column is on Twitter
648;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;UTC buys GE’s fire division;;United Technologies reached an agreement to acquire the fire and security division of General Electric for $1.82bn on Thursday, boosting the smaller conglomerate’s position in the niche market and allowing GE to extricate itself from a business in which it was not a dominant player.The deal is part of a drive by Jeffrey Immelt, GE chief executive, to raise capital and streamline the company’s sprawling global operations.The financial crisis of 2008 hit GE particularly hard because of a global downturn in business investment and the exposure of GE Capital, its financial services arm, to an overall decline in asset prices.“We see the business as a good strategic fit for UTC Fire and Security,” said Nigel Coe, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a note to investors. UTC “had very little exposure to the North American fire and security market and this transaction expands this footprint in security equipment, fire installation and service.”The deal still requires regulatory approval as well as the approval of both boards.Mr Coe said that because of the limited overlap between the products offered by UTC and the units it is buying from GE – the Interlogix and Edwards businesses – antitrust regulators were unlikely to have a problem with the deal.In a presentation to analysts, Ari Bousbib, president of UTC’s commercial companies unit, described the strategic rationale behind the deal, saying that the transaction would yield significant cost synergies, improve after-market revenue potential and fill an important gap in UTC’s product offerings.UTC’s goal, according to Mr Bousbib’s presentation, is to increase the fire and security division’s rate of return to 15 per cent, up from its current rate of 10 per cent. Mr Bousbib noted that in 2004, the unit’s operating margin was below 5 per cent.UTC already generates more than $6bn in revenue in the fire and security segment. The global market was worth an estimated $100bn last year.The deal comes at a time when GE is in the process of spinning off its NBC Universal television and movie unit into a joint venture controlled by the cable operator Comcast.The past year has been a trying one for Mr Immelt at GE. The company’s share price has slumped by almost 50 per cent and in August the company reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, without admitting liability, over charges that it had not used accepted accounting methods in its public filings.
649;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-11-11T00:31:36Z;GE targets security systems for sale to UTC;;General Electric is in talks to sell its security systems unit to United Technologies Corp for more than $1.5bn in yet another effort to reshuffle its sprawling portfolio and raise capital for acquisitions.People close to the situation said the discussions between GE and UTC, which owns Kidde fire systems and Chubb locks, were advanced but the deal could still collapse.UTC, a GE-like conglomerate with operations spanning Sikorsky helicopters, Otis lifts and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, has been looking to expand in the security business.GE and UTC declined to comment.GE’s move to sell its fire alarms and security division comes as the US conglomerate is finalising a bigger deal to spin off its NBC Universal television and movie unit into a joint venture controlled by the cable operator Comcast.Jeffrey Immelt, GE’s chief executive, is under pressure to revive the company’s share price and reduce its reliance on GE Capital, the financial services arm that was hit by the crisis. Bankers say GE wants to raise funds to expand its core businesses – which include infrastructure, oil and gas equipment, and energy – partly by selling peripheral divisions.GE has been looking to divest non-core businesses such as its consumer appliances unit and its US credit card portfolio for months, but its efforts have been thwarted by the global slowdown and tough financing markets.The recent rebound in capital markets and a stabilising economy could provide Mr Immelt with the chance to kickstart deal-making activity.GE does not release financial data for its security services unit, which operates in more than 26 countries around the world and caters to individuals, companies, governments and the military. The Florida-based division was founded in the early 2000s and received a huge boost when GE bought Edwards Systems Technology, a maker of fire detection equipment, from the US group SPX in 2004 for $1.4bn in cash.The addition of GE’s security division would add to UTC’s $6bn-plus in annual sales in the area and fulfil the company’s ambition to expand in a sector that it estimates to be worth about $100bn.Louis Chevenert, UTC’s chief executive, told a recent investor conference the company was a “willing buyer” in fire and security systems. Acquiring a rival in the security sector would fit Mr Chevenert’s strategy of increasing revenues from businesses that offer customers long service contracts in an effort to cushion UTC’s profits from the vagaries of the economic cycle.News of the talks between GE and UTC was first reported by Bloomberg.GE shares closed slightly lower at $15.78 on Tuesday. They have lost more than half their value in the past five years. UTC’s shares were flat at $66.73. The stock is up more than a third in the past five years.

This week alone, Axa announced it was raising €2bn ($3bn) for fresh acquisitions. Kraft formally launched a hostile bid for Cadbury. Areva received three competing bids for its power transmission and distribution business. Comcast is proposing to acquire NBC Universal.France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are in exclusive talks to merge their respective Orange and T-Mobile businesses in the UK. Vivendi and Telefónica are battling for control of Brazil’s GVT. ING and Royal Bank of Scotland are looking for buyers for assets they are being forced to dispose of.Indeed, there seems to be a renewed appetite for mergers and acquisitions across the entire range of industrial and service sectors. At a time of ongoing doubts over the strength and timing of the recovery, signs that unemployment in many developed countries risks getting worse before improving again, and governments struggling under record debt burdens, this M&A revival could be considered a little paradoxical.After all, the last hectic period for M&A activity occurred three years ago, before the subprime crisis brought the world to its knees. At that time, the strong performance of the equity markets combined with low interest rates encouraged companies to take on large amounts of debt to mount and finance takeovers. Companies engaged in bold transformational deals that reshaped the European corporate landscapeThis time round, the reasons behind the latest M&A wave are radically different, argues Patrice Lambert de Diesbach, research head at CM-CIC Securities. In a detailed study of current M&A trends, he notes that the big difference this time is that the corporate logic behind most deals is either opportunistic or purely defensive.Instead, those companies that have weathered the crisis better than their competitors and are sitting on strong balance sheets are now taking advantage of acquisition opportunities to reinforce their core businesses ahead of the eventual recovery in economic activity.They are all deeply aware that they have little, or indeed no, scope for increasing revenues unless they expand their businesses through acquisitions in an economic environment paralysed by the general lack of consumer confidence.The decision to launch takeover bids – hostile or otherwise – is motivated by a number of factors, argues Mr de Diesbach. They include the cost of debt returning to a reasonable level, with CDS levels just about getting back to where they were before the crisis; the general improvement in the earnings outlook; and price-to-book-value ratios showing that we are still a long way behind the long-term average.What he does not say, but is abundantly evident in all the latest hostile or friendly bids, is that while companies have rediscovered an appetite for deals, it is not at any price. Kraft’s offer for Cadbury, dismissed by the UK chocolate maker as “derisory”, is an obvious example.No Airbus armisticeNicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel will on Wednesday celebrate together for the first time the 91st anniversary of the first world war armistice. No doubt they will use the occasion to give fresh impetus to the special yet often difficult relationship between France and Germany. There is no better reminder of the difficulties of reconciling the two countries’ different cultures than their relationship in Airbus and its parent company EADS.The respective government and industrial shareholders of the aircraft maker have been constantly at loggerheads. Franco-German infighting has been a characteristic of Airbus and EADS management. Now it seems the disease is spreading inside the Airbus European Works Council.FO, the French union, has decided to boycott the works council after its representative was not re-elected co-president along with his German colleague, who was re-elected. Instead, quite surprisingly, a British representative was chosen to replace the Frenchman.The French are furious and are accusing the Germans of attempting to increase German influence at Airbus. Already, a German heads Airbus while Germans also run two other key EADS subsidiaries – the defence unit and the helicopter division. The French also claim that the Germans have been the big winners in the recent restructuring of Airbus production lines.The Germans may have gone one step too far this time.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2 per cent at 10,226.94, its highest level since October last year.The S&P 500 gained 2.2 per cent to 1,093.08 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2 per cent at 2,154.06.In spite of volatile trading, Wall Street closed higher every day last week, shrugging off Friday’s data that showed a spike in unemployment.A rally in the technology sector after Cisco’s results gave the Nasdaq its biggest daily gain since July.“The market was probably too short going into those payroll numbers and the fact that there wasn’t a downside on Friday has injected some confidence,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.After an indicative offer two months ago, Kraft launched a formal hostile bid for Cadbury on Monday, valuing the UK company at £9.8bn ($16.4bn).The terms were the same as the original offer but, due to the fall in Kraft’s share price, the implied value of the latest bid was slightly lower. Cadbury rejected the offer as “derisory”.While the deal activity boosted market sentiment, Kraft was the only Dow company to end the day in negative territory, losing 0.9 per cent to $26.53. Cadbury shares edged up in London.In other deals, Northrop Grumman, one of the largest US defence contractors, agreed to sell TASC, its advisory services unit, for $1.65bn to private equity groups General Atlantic and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.The sale is the latest sign of a revival in leveraged buy-outs. Northrop rose 3 per cent to $53.93.Reports also revealed that Comcast was planning to finalise a deal to buy a controlling stake in NBC Universal from General Electric by next Monday. The acquisition would create one of the US’s largest media companies and values NBC Universal at about $30bn.Comcast rose 3.8 per cent to $15.15 and General Electricgained 3.4 per cent to $15.85.A pledge by the G20 over the weekend to keep stimulus programmes in place until the recovery was more certain added to the market’s optimism and boosted financial stocks. Bank of Americawas up 4.8 per cent to $15.77 and Citigroup gained 3.2 per cent to $4.19.Elsewhere in the banking sector, East West Bancorpsurged 55 per cent to $13.41 after the California-based bank purchased its main rival United Commercial Bank (UCB), which was seized by regulators last week.UCB, based in San Francisco, was the 120th bank to fail this year and was estimated to have assets worth $11.2bn. Morgan Stanley analysts welcomed the deal, upgrading East West from “equal-weight” to “overweight”.The G20 assurances pushed gold to fresh highs and boosted other metal prices. ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, was raised from “neutral” to “buy” by MF Global, pushing the shares 4.9 per cent higher to $36.82.United States Steel gained 3.6 per cent to $38.11 and the S&P Materials sector was up 3.2 per cent.Global sales figures from McDonald’s sent shares in the fast food chain up 1.5 per cent to $62.64.Total like-for-like sales rose 3.3 per cent in October, helped by strong demand from Europe. The gains help to offset a 0.1 per cent decline in US sales – the first monthly decline in the fast food retailer’s home market since March 2008.Shares in RadioShack, the electronics retailer, were set to hit their highest level for two years after jumping 14.3 per cent to $20.27. The chain announced plans to sell versions of Apple’s iPhone later this month.Dish Network rose 5.2 per cent to $20.14 after the company, America’s second-largest satellite TV provider, beat Wall Street forecasts.Trex, the deckings and railings maker, was one of the market’s few casualties.Its shares fell 2.5 per cent to $16.86 after the group posted a quarterly loss due to an impairment charge and continued weakness
in the home construction sector."
652;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-11-05T15:59:51Z;Net neutrality required to spur innovation;;"For the first time in history, the majority of the Earth’s population is connected by a global communications network.Unlike traditional information networks, such as newspapers, radio and TV, however, the internet is based on interactive communication. It has allowed for a revolutionary real-time participation of users.With almost a billion connected computers and now so deeply embedded in our lives, the most surprising aspect of the internet may be that it is so new – a commercial life of just 15 years.Its amazing success has been based on its openness, ubiquity, and non-discrimination. Its non-discrimination – dubbed ”net neutrality” – means that content from anyone and of any type is treated equally on the internet.Its open and public standards and the fact that no one ever had to ask permission from the network to innovate have led to one of the greatest periods of economic growth in history.Companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Amazon would not otherwise exist. Centrally controlled electronic networks of the past, such as Compuserve, Prodigy and AOL, which did not allow innovation at the edge of the network, have either collapsed or radically changed and been absorbed in the internet.So, when the global communications network grows by leaps and bounds and spurs tremendous innovation, why change its traditional rules?One factor that is forcing a reconsideration of the rules is that telecom and cable companies aim to become the gatekeepers of the internet.The blocking of Bittorrent by Comcast was the first salvo in their plans to start discriminating based on content, application, and identity of the sender.These companies want to do this for two reasons: first, they want to promote their own traditional telecom and video services that compete with the new ones provided over the internet; second, they hope they will make more money through discrimination.In a truly competitive market, such discrimination would lead to loss of market share and profits to rival providers who did not discriminate.But this is an imperfect market: telecom and cable companies are to profit from discrimination because of limited competition in local internet provision. It is important to note the vast majority of US residential users have only two providers of internet service: a telecom and a cable TV company.Repeated acquisitions and mergers among telecom companies have brought us to a tight duopoly of AT&T and Verizon who have also extended their control in cellular telecommunications.On the internet, the US has fallen to fifteenth in broadband internet penetration behind many European countries, Canada, and Korea, largely because of the high prices that US companies are able to charge for internet connectivity.Without protection of net neutrality, consumers will have fewer choices in content, video, and telephone services.While Google can afford the tax charged by telecom and cable companies for preferential treatment, the ”next Google” won’t be able to afford the payments that will be demanded by the telecom and cable giants.Small and new companies, as well as individuals and non-profit organisations who create their own content will be put in the ”slow lane” that the telecom and cable businesses will create for all those who cannot afford to travel the toll road on the information highway.One can understand the frustration of telecom and cable TV companies. Tremendous wealth is generated by information packets going back and forth through their lines, but most of that ”internet gold” flows right past them to the content providers and consumers.Even worse, traditional phone services are now provided through the internet by voice-over-the-internet services and Skype, and bandwidth-heavy TV shows can now be downloaded over the internet.Abolition of net neutrality will allow telecom and cable TV companies to defend their old products and profits better.But the discrimination these companies propose will be devastating for innovation and choice. And, if internet innovation is hampered in the US, the rest of the world will not stay still.Viviane Reding, the European Commissioner in charge of media oversight, recently made it clear that the EU will protect the neutral internet: failing to protect non-discrimination on the internet in the US will leave us way behind Europe in the technology innovation race.Fortunately, the Federal Communications Commission recently proposed to formalise the non-discrimination tradition on the internet and preserve net neutrality and its tremendously positive effects on innovation.It is good public policy: it will protect consumers and the public interest and it will preserve and enhance the competitive position of the US in innovation.The proof of its wisdom is the tremendous success and innovation of the internet so far.The FCC also proposed that network management by the telecom and cable operators be transparent so that consumers and companies know what to expect. These two rules (non-discrimination and transparency) conform to the golden rule of regulation – they protect the public interest and enhance innovation while they do not impose strict and difficult to follow rules.Nicholas Economides is Professor of Economics, Stern School of Business, NYU; and Executive Director, NET Institute"
653;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-11-04T21:37:16Z;US stocks give up gains after late sell-off;;"Wall Street gave up early gains on Wednesday in a late sell-off after the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its intention to keep rates low for an extended period.Freddie Mac dropped 1.6 per cent to $1.22 and Fannie Mae lost 5.2 per cent to $1.09 after the Fed said it would buy less debt issued by government-backed mortgage finance agencies than it had originally planned.Financial stocks led the sharp pull-back in the final 30 minutes of trading, which left indices to close nears the lows of the day.Wall Street had initially risen on rising commodity prices, strength in the healthcare sector and a series of positive corporate results.While stocks fluctuated throughout the day, the healthcare sector remained strong after Republicans captured two state governorships on Tuesday.Investors bet that the opposition victories would bolster opposition to President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform package, lifting shares of UnitedHealth, the largest US health insurer, 3.6 per cent to $27.87.After gaining up to 1.5 per cent during the day, the S&P 500 finally closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,046.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 9,802.14 and the Nasdaq lost 0.1 per cent to 2,055.52.Investor confidence had initially remained high in spite of disappointing economic data earlier in the session. The ADP employment report, released during pre-market trading, showed that 203,000 private sector jobs were lost in October.Although this was just above the 198,000 consensus estimate, investors welcomed the fact that it represented the smallest number of job losses for the survey since July 2008.The Institute for Supply Management’s October reading of the services sector was also worse than expected. Economists had been expecting a reading of 51.5 but the ISM recorded a level of 50.6. However, a reading above 50 still indicates growth. “The basic flow of the statistics suggests that, in fact, the economic recovery is continuing to roll along,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“The other dynamic that is still important is that, because of the scepticism about the recovery and about the rally, a lot of people would like to be more heavily invested in equities. And some just give in and plough their money into the market.”Corporate news had also helped to lift the mood throughout the day on Wall Street. Walt Disney gained 1.5 per cent to $28.03 after announcing late on Tuesday its breakthrough deal to build a theme park in Shanghai.Time Warner raised its profit outlook for 2009 due to better results than expected at its cable and films division. But after sharp gains in early trading, the shares closed 0.2 per cent lower at $30.10.Comcast also made strong gains in early trading after the cable operator reported quarterly profit that beat analyst estimates. It said profit had risen 22 per cent, mainly due to subscriber gains and lower capital expenditure. But, by the closing bell, the shares had slid 3.1 per cent to $14.06.Radian, the mortgage insurer, was another to surprise analysts by reporting a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss. The group said fewer homeowners had claimed mortgage insurance and it also lowered its estimate of the value of claims to be paid out in 2009 by 15 per cent. Its shares rose 2.9 per cent to $6.09.Ambac Financial Group, the world’s second-largest bond insurer, surged by
35.2 per cent to $1.50. The group posted net income of $2.2bn, reversing last year’s loss, mainly due to accounting gains.Devon Energy, the third-largest US independent oil and gas company by market value, released quarterly results above expectations, sending its shares up 0.9 per cent to $67.07.Higher oil output and cost-cutting helped the company cushion the impact of falling prices.Elsewhere in the sector, Baker Hughes, the oilfield-services provider, fell 5.9 per cent to $40.89. The group reported a sharp drop in third-quarter profit due to plunging energy prices and reduced customer spending."
654;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-11-04T19:14:20Z;US media companies raise outlook;;Americans are still willing to pay for cable TV, broadband and cinema tickets in spite of weak consumer spending, according to the first crop of third-quarter results from US media companies.Among the media companies that have raised expectations for the second half of the year, Time Warner lifted its profit outlook for 2009 on the back of better-than-expected results at its cable and films division. Viacom on Tuesday reported a similar lift in earnings of 15 per cent in the third quarter from ticket sales of the GI Joe and Transformers films and its MTV Networks cable channels.Cable networks, which derive two sources of revenue – from fees paid to programmers by cable operators and from advertising, have underpinned the third-quarter improvements.The resilience of cable TV in the recession is a key reason why Comcast is seeking to purchase a controlling stake in NBC Universal from General Electric. Meanwhile, News Corporation and Scripps Network have been competing to buy the Travel Channel, valued at more than $1bn.Sharp declines in advertising revenue also appeared to moderate in the quarter as carmakers, retailers and consumer packaged goods companies have begun to spend on marketing again.The explosion in the use of online video sites such as Google’s YouTube and the broadcaster-backed Hulu, has not come at the expense of overall TV viewing, says Nielsen, the market research company, and has been accompanied by a surge in broadband subscriptions, as shown by results from Comcast and Cablevision.Comcast, the top US cable company, reported a surprising 22 per cent rise in quarterly profit, and added 361,000 net new broadband customers.Cablevision’s profit also rose past expectations, helped in part by more phone and high-speed internet customers.To court new viewers seeking out favourite shows online while protecting the lucrative TV business model, cable networks and pay-TV providers have moved quickly to deploy TV Everywhere services that offer more shows but only to subscribers.Time Warner has sought support for the plan across the media industry and is developing something similar for electronic readers for its struggling magazines business.Time Warner said net profit fell to $661m, or 55 cents per share, from $1.1bn, or 89 cents per share from the year ago period when it owned a cable services division. It raised its full year 2009 profit per share to be at least $2.05.Comcast reported a third quarter profit of $944m, or 33 cents per share, from $771m, or 26 cents per share a year earlier.
655;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;US regulators close to agreeing net neutrality rules;;"US regulators have taken a significant step towards implementing so-called net neutrality rules, with a majority vote by the Federal Communications Commission in favour of six “open internet” principles.Technology companies such as Google hope the rules will preserve the free flow of information online by preventing internet service providers from favouring or blocking
traffic over their landlines and wireless connections.The FCC’s decision is expected to set a model for regulators worldwide.However, the proposals set the stage for a battle with the likes of AT&T, Comcast and Verizon Communications, which fear further regulation will hinder their incentive to invest as surging data consumption stretches the capacity of their networks.Julius Genachowski, the FCC chairman, said that the starting point for new rules would be the broad promotion of investment and innovation.The government’s role, he said, “should be no greater than necessary to achieve the core goal of preserving a free and open internet”.Michael Copps, another of the three Democratic commissioners on the five-
member FCC, described the principles as “the clearest statement yet that we will ensure the genius of the internet is not subverted”.However, the two Republican commissioners, Robert McDowell and Mary Baker, argued that internet providers had already adequately addressed past “hiccups” and expressed concern about additional rules.The six principles included two that go beyond proposals set out in 2005: that internet providers may not discriminate between legal content, applications and services; and that they must be transparent about network management practices.Details of the regulations, including the FCC’s definition of “reasonable network management”, are expected to be hammered next March.The FCC acknowledged that the debate would include “a large question” over applying the new principles to mobile devices. Wireless companies are particularly concerned about tighter regulation, given the currently limited bandwidth available for mobile internet services.Analysts at Stifel Nicolaus noted that the FCC had signalled some flexibility in asking whether the rules should apply to parties beyond internet access
providers, which could include application and content providers such as Google, Amazon and Skype.The National Cable and Telecommunications Association reacted cautiously, saying: “We hope the commission will approach these issues with a healthy scepticism [regarding] hypothetical harms.”"
656;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-10-18T15:21:56Z;Pace breaking out of the box;;"Consumer demand for high-definition television has been one of the few constants in the recession. But in the opinion of the head of Pace, the set-top box maker, a “supercycle” that will change the way we watch our main source of entertainment is beginning.For Neil Gaydon, chief executive of the Yorkshire-based group, the recession is proving one overriding point: that people still see TV as offering unrivalled value for money when it comes to entertainment.“When questioning discretionary spend, there are three things people give up last: their mobile phone, broadband and digital TV,” he says.While retailers and restaurateurs struggle to attract customers, and the music industry battles with piracy, many pay-TV operators, such as BSkyB and Comcast, have gained subscribers.Pace occupies an increasingly large share of that third entertainment leg. Transformed by the acquisition of Philips’ set-top box business for £68m last year, it became the world’s third-largest personal video recorder (PVR) maker and surprised analysts and investors by upgrading its earnings forecasts twice in April.Benefiting from problems at rivals Motorola and Thomson of France, it now expects to ship more than 16m bespoke boxes around the world this year to the major pay-TV companies such as News Corp, Canal Plus and DirecTV.It underlines a break from the early part of the decade, when Pace was largely dependent on one contract from Sky, and profit warnings were commonplace.To underline this, Pace has restarted dividend payments after a six-year hiatus, while its shares have risen from 43p in January to 226½p on Friday, giving it a market capitalisation of £694m.But Mr Gaydon says future products – and Pace’s plans – are built around expectations that the way we consume TV will be different.“The supercycle is that people aren’t just buying one of these flat panels in their home; they’re buying multiple,” he says. “For example, DirecTV average 2.8 per house per subscriber and that’s a phenomenon we’re starting to see increase as well.“New products that allow people to pause, stop, rewind any TV, watch any content recorded in one room in another room will come in. Further down the line it will probably be streamed to a smartphone.”Pace will need to develop new products. Arun George, an analyst at Noble Securities, points out that rivals will not always be so hampered. “Next year looks comfortable, but as we go into 2011, their ability to drive top-line growth from market share will moderate,” he says.Buoyed by its £48m cash pile, Pace is looking to expand its bespoke PVRs. A MultiDweller service, aimed at apartment blocks and hotels where old wiring prevents the installation of new services, has signed up Canal Digital Plus. It is also targeting rural areas that have poor digital reception.Underpinning it all is the fact that only 2 per cent of the world has taken up HDTV. As analogue signals around the world are switched off in coming years, that number will grow.Jonathan Imlah, an analyst at Altium Securities, thinks the rapid take-up and Pace’s focus is still being underestimated by the market: “At 10 times full-year 2010 earnings, it trades at a substantial discount to the wider technology sector in spite of significantly higher forecast earnings growth.”One source of disquiet about Pace’s performance in the past year was its decision to move a key performance indicator from gross margins to return on sales. Some have suggested it indicates the company is losing margin.Mr Gaydon defends the move. “Investors need to look at the deals we go after,” he says.“What we’re showing is that we know how to make money in this space where others have shown they can’t or find it more difficult.”He points out that return on sales has risen from 3.5 per cent to 6 per cent, and it is moving towards analysts’ expectations of 8 per cent.“On a selective [contract] basis it makes sense, but I wouldn’t like to see them do it across the board,” says Mr Imlah.Mr Gaydon sees little competition so far from internet TV as no market can yet deliver standard definition TV to the mass market over broadband, let alone content for high-definition TV.Mr Imlah admits it may come in the future, but not the present: “So you go and buy a Samsung internet TV. What are you going to watch – YouTube?”"
657;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;GE figures fail to reassure Wall St;;"General Electric disappointed investors seeking proof of a recovery in the global economy on Friday when the bellwether conglomerate reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales.A fall in earnings at finance arm GE Capital and muted demand for industrial gear hit third-quarter results for the group, whose products range from gas turbines to
medical-imaging equipment.Shares in GE declined 4.23 per cent in New York, helping to trigger a correction on US and European stock markets after a strong week that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average cross the 10,000 mark.Along with Bank of America’s results showing a $1bn loss in the third quarter as weakened consumers continued to translate into credit losses, analysts said GE had damped investor optimism about the current US earnings season.The S&P 500 index was down 0.81 per cent at 1,087.68 points while the Dow was 0.67 per cent lower at 9,995.91.GE’s efforts to slash costs and reduce its dependence on GE Capital have helped cushion the group from mounting credit losses and reposition the company for an economic upswing. But investors are still waiting for signs that GE will convert its record backlog into higher revenue.“We’re executing well against our framework and we want to keep improving our position in 2010 and beyond,” said Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive. “The global environment has definitely improved. We’re seeing more interest in long-
cycle orders today and things like that.”Earnings from continuing operations dropped 47 per cent to $2.5bn, or 22 cents a share, from $4.6bn, or 45 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had predicted a profit of 20 cents per share.Total revenues fell 20 per cent to $37.8bn, missing Wall Street’s average estimate, with all five of the Connecticut-based conglomerate’s operating units posting declines.Energy Infrastructure, the power-generation equipment division, earned $1.6bn, an 11 per cent increase. Revenue slipped 9 per cent.Technology infrastructure, which includes GE’s healthcare and aviation businesses, reported an operating profit of $1.7bn, down 8 per cent. Sales fell 11 per cent.GE’s total industrial backlog, which includes both equipment orders and service contracts, climbed to a record $174bn during the period.Keith Sherin, GE’s chief financial officer, predicted orders would continue to show sequential improvement this period.GE Capital’s earnings tumbled 87 per cent to $263m, as the unit’s pared loan portfolio generated less revenue and its real-estate division posted a loss.The finance arm, which remains on track to reach its goal for a profitable year, continued to benefit from tax credits.NBC Universal, the media company GE is considering spinning off, reported a 13 per cent increase in profit. Revenue fell 20 per cent.John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media, has said he would be interested in looking at NBC Universal, but would not pay as much as Comcast is willing to offer for the group. Mr Malone said he had been approached by Goldman Sachs, which is advising GE on the possible sale of the entertainment company.Additional reporting by Kenneth Li in New York"
658;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-10-16T18:48:39Z;Liberty Media ‘might look at’ NBC Universal;;John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media, has said he would be interested in looking at NBC Universal, but would not pay as much as Comcast is willing to offer for the group , damping expectations of any immediate bidding war.Mr Malone said he had been approached by Goldman Sachs, which is advising General Electric on the possible sale of the entertainment company.But he valued NBC Universal at seven times its “real” cash flow, rather than the 11 times implied in the deal GE is discussing with Comcast, the US cable operator.The potential Comcast deal emerged this month as one of several options, including an initial public offering, that GE is pursuing as it waits for Vivendi, the French media group that owns 20 per cent of NBC Universal, to exercise its right to sell the stake back to GE, or force a stock sale.Mr Malone described valuation expectations on that potential deal as “phoney”, because they would include Comcast’s estimate of the value of its existing content assets, such as the Golf Channel.Independent estimates value NBC Universal at between $20bn and $30bn, compared with its $43bn valuation in 2004 when GE bought its 80 per cent stake.Comcast is talking to GE about taking an initial 51 per cent stake in a joint venture, with a path to full control over seven years. The two sides are working towards agreeing a deal in principle within a month.GE’s advisers had not opened the process to other bidders, Mr Malone told reporters on the sidelines of an investor meeting, adding that his talks with Goldman had been “one way”.The comments by Mr Malone came as Rupert Murdoch, who had also been seen by some analysts as a possible counter-bidder, told the News Corp annual meeting on Friday that he would “have a look at that deal and see what opportunities are there,” but was not in any negotiations over NBC Universal. A Comcast deal would not affect News Corp “in any detrimental way”, he added.Instead, Mr Murdoch highlighted India and Turkey as priorities for investing the $7bn of cash on the media group’s balance sheet, praising India in particular for opening up its media markets to foreign companies.He reiterated plans to introduce charges on the group’s news websites and to “exclude” web aggregators from profiting from its content, and to “take a leadership position” in extracting more money from cable and satellite networks that carry its broadcast channels.Three weeks before News Corp is due to release first quarter figures, Mr Murdoch also said he had “even more confidence” than at its last earnings in its guidance for the year, and predicted the group would be less dependent on advertising revenue in the coming year.
659;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-10-13T23:52:01Z;GE sets out exit path in Comcast talks;;General Electric’s ongoing negotiations to form a joint venture with Comcast combining NBC Universal with the cable operator’s networks now includes an option to redeem for cash half of its stake in the new company within three-and-a-half years providing a path for a complete exit, according to people familiar with the matter.Discussions to form a new venture take place as Vivendi, which owns a 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal, nears an annual deadline giving it the right to register the stake in an initial public offering or force GE to buy back its stake.In the venture, Comcast would pay $6bn in cash and contribute its networks to own 51 per cent of the cable, broadcast, film and theme parks business, and a deal is expected to be reached in about a month, people familiar with the matter said.GE, would retain a 49 per cent stake in the venture, and has negotiated rights to redeem up to half of that stake for cash at fair market value after three-and-a-half years and the remainder after seven years.A potential deal would create the biggest collection of cable networks, considered the most resilient part of traditional media.But media executives, burnt by decades of empire building, no longer believe in the value of owning content and distribution within one company. Once considered a strong cash flow generator, NBC is now viewed within GE as a drag on results and a drain on resources that might be put to better use elsewhere.The new company is expected to service an estimated $9bn of debt as well as pay for the redemption with its free cash flow, or by raising more debt, before breaching its investment grade threshold. The remaining balance would be backstopped by Comcast.Under the terms, Comcast has agreed to potentially pay up to $5bn to $6bn over the seven-year course if required, establishing a ceiling on the cash outlay the cable operator might be required to commit. The deal is viewed by media executives as a wager that content assets such as cable networks would grow faster than distribution properties such as cable operations.News Corp, which already owns the Fox TV network, is seen as a potential suitor, but it has not contacted GE and is unlikely to bid, one person familiar with the company said.Liberty Media’s John Malone, a one-time controller of the biggest cable company in the US, may also be interested, according to a CNBC report.The French telecoms and media conglomerate owns a 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal and is free to exercise its option during a mid-November to December window annually through to 2016. It is expected to discuss the fate of its minority stake at a board meeting this week.
660;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-10-05T23:02:00Z;GE ties with NBC come under pressure;;"General Electric’s potential NBC Universal spin-off, in which the cable television group Comcast would end up with a majority of the media division, seems to break many of the rules that have guided the conglomerate’s dealmaking strategy for decades.GE would cede control of NBC while still reporting a meaningful share of the division’s results. The proposed structure will not result in a windfall of cash and comes as media groups and their investors feel their way through one the most tumultuous periods for the industry since the dawn of the television age.Yet if such an uncharacteristic agreement is reached, it would be a fitting epilogue to a corporate relationship some GE executives concede never made that much sense in the first place.“It’s been the ‘right time’ for GE to exit for years,” a former NBC executive said. “GE has done nothing for NBC and NBC has done nothing for GE for quite a long time now.”Of course GE has its reasons for considering such a move this year. It expects Vivendi to exercise its option to put a 20 per cent stake in NBC back to GE or force an initial stock sale. But weighing heavily on the minds of GE executives is what to do to fix NBC, a proud franchise that is going through a protracted slump at a time when the media industry’s future is far from clear.Owning NBC had offered glitz, access and a reliable source of earnings growth in the years that followed GE’s 1986 purchase of the media arm’s former parent, RCA – even if executives long ago conceded that it offered the rest of GE little more than cash.While often called “waterfront property”, NBC is now viewed within GE as a drag on results and a drain on resources that might be put to better use elsewhere.“It now looks like one of those piers on (New York’s) Hudson River,” one former executive said. “It doesn’t have any huge ocean liners in front of it anymore.”Excluding its strong performing cable networks portfolio, which contributes 60 per cent of its earnings, the rest of Universal’s media portfolio is in tatters.Once the top-rated broadcast network with a golden line-up of shows such as Seinfeld and Friends, NBC now trails CBS and ABC in an industry roiled by viewer defections to the internet and cable television. A gutsy move to replace scripted drama with a primetime show by comedian Jay Leno to shave programming costs has yet to pan out.Its film division has fared no better, as it has been battered by a weak slate of movies this year and an industry-wide decline in DVD sales that contributes the biggest chunk of studio profits.A partial sale, company insiders say, would free up capital for GE’s industrial businesses. Reducing its stake in NBC from the current 80 per cent to the
49 per cent mooted in the Comcast talks would also provide it with some extra cash, increasing the chances it might splash out on a large acquisition in one of its core businesses.It is not the first time NBC has given GE executives heartburn. In the early 1990s, even Jack Welch – the former chairman and the architect of the RCA deal – had lost faith in the division. GE came close to unloading NBC to rivals such as Disney and Paramount before a new wave of hit shows restored its value.The focus of Jeffrey Immelt, Mr Welch’s successor, is on businesses expected to benefit from long-term trends in the economy. Energy, transportation, aviation and healthcare are expanding; financial services, appliances and industrial divisions such as lighting are shrinking or may soon be sold.Mr Immelt has viewed the financial crisis and the economic recession as more than a cyclical downturn; it is a “reset”, he has said, that has left GE – and the rest of corporate America – at a critical crossroads.Pulling NBC out of its slump may divert too much capital and attention away from the assets GE expects will drive future growth and revive its share price.Shedding the media division now may be a departure from a playbook that has secured GE’s place among the world’s respected companies. Given the events of the past year, it may be wise to chart a new path."
661;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-10-05T22:02:57Z;Universal co-chairmen axed over box office flops;;Universal Pictures, the Hollywood studio arm of NBC Universal, has fired two of its most senior executives after a string of flops made 2009 an abysmal year at the box office.Marc Shmuger and David Linde, co-chairmen of the studio, were responsible for a slate of films that included Funny People and Land of the Lost. But the releases failed to set the box office alight, leaving the studio trailing its rivals. The management shake-up comes as NBC Universal exerts greater pressure on its studio arm. Earlier this year Jeff Zucker, chief executive of NBC, dispatched Lynn Calpeter, the group’s chief financial officer, to Hollywood from New York to examine the poor performance of the studio.Until then, Universal had largely been left alone by its parent company to run as an autonomous unit. In 2007 and 2008 its films had performed strongly, with the studio recording its most profitable two years.However, past peformance counts for little in the film business. Universal’s flops this year included Bruno, the Sacha Baron Cohen comedy which earned only $60m. Its biggest failure was Land of the Lost, an expensive comedy that cost more than $100m but earned just $64m.After a dismal summer, Ron Meyer, chairman of Universal Studios, moved to act, dismissing Mr Shmuger and Mr Linde, his two most senior lieutenants.He has promoted two studio insiders, Adam Fogelson and Donna Langley, to replace Mr Shmuger and Mr Linde. Mr Fogelson has been appointed chairman and Ms Langley has been named co-chairman. Rick Finkelstein, chief operating officer, has been appointed a “strategic adviser” to the pair. “The depth of experience of these three executives gives me tremendous confidence,” said Mr Meyer. “I trust them to lead this organisation in today’s ever-changing media environment.”The shake-up comes amid a period of uncertainty about the future of NBC Universal. The group, which includes the Universal movie studio, the NBC network, a thriving cluster of cable channels and a theme parks business, is being eyed by Comcast, the US cable group.NBC Universal is owned by General Electric, which has held talks with Comcast to create a new venture that would combine the media company with assets held by the cable operator.One option would see GE buy back a 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal held by Vivendi, the French conglomerate. GE would then spin off NBC Universal and its debts into a new venture with Comcast.
662;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Swings and roundabouts of Messier legacy;;The legacy of the Messier era could bring Vivendi a pile of cash as well as the possibility of an unpleasant bill.For those who may have forgotten, Jean-Marie Messier was the flamboyant former chairman of Vivendi. And his heady acquisition spree to transform the French group into a giant communications and entertainment conglomerate virtually bankrupted the company seven years ago.Once described as France’s “master of the universe”, the former Lazard banker was dismissed by his board and replaced by Jean-René Fourtou, the businessman behind the pharmaceutical merger that ultimately created the French Sanofi-Aventis drug champion.First under Mr Fourtou and subsequently Jean-Bernard Levy, Vivendi’s current chief executive, the French communications company has been heavily restructured and returned on a profitable footing.It remains a conglomerate but has been refocused on four legs: telecoms, electronic games, pay television, and music. As part of the old Messier legacy it has also kept a stake in the Universal film studios after selling control of its Hollywood business to General Electric’s NBC television network. Under an agreement with GE, it negotiated an exit option for its remaining 20 per cent stake in what has since become NBC-Universal that it can exercise for a three-week period from November 15 to the first week of December every year until 2016.So far, Vivendi has not exercised this option but there are now strong signals that it may finally decide to do so this year.GE seems keen on either selling NBC-Universal or floating it and Comcast, the leading US cable operator, appears interested in taking control after failing five years ago to take over Disney. Mr Levy has never considered the NBC-Universal stake “strategic” so he may well be tempted to sell if the opportunity arose.Analysts suggest that Vivendi could pocket between $4m and $5m for this stake – perhaps more if it helped secure the eventual buyer control.The market and Vivendi investors are expected to welcome such a move because it would reduce the French group’s holding company discount.It would clean up the conglomerate’s overall structure and further streamline Vivendi around the core businesses it controls giving it additional resources to bolster one or more of these assets.The irony is that these manoeuvres also coincide with the start this week of what promises to be a high-profile class action case in a New York court against Vivendi, Mr Messier and Guillaume Hannezo, the company’s former chief financial officer.Launched seven years ago, the case could ultimately have significant implications on the potential liabilities and exposures of European – and especially French – publicly-held companies doing business in the US.The plaintiffs – not only investors who bought Vivendi shares in the US between October 2000 and July 2002 but also French, British and Dutch shareholders – are seeking compensation alleging the company had misinformed them of its financial plight at the time.A French lawyer representing small French shareholders claimed at the weekend that Vivendi and its two former managers could ultimately face a $50bn bill.Yet the fact that Vivendi has so far not entertained the idea of entering into any out-of-court settlement to avoid the court case going ahead suggests that the French group also believes it has a strong case.It has again appealed in another US court the decision to allow investors who bought their shares in France to take part in the class action.Its argument is that US-style class actions are contrary to French constitutional principles. And although Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, promised he would introduce such a mechanism during his presidential election campaign, the French business lobby has so far done a good job of blocking the introduction of such legislation.French investors – that is investors who bought their Vivendi shares in France – account for more than 60 per cent of the plaintiffs in the US class action. Should they be excluded, this could substantially lower any future pay-out given that the ultimate size of any award – if granted by the court – is based on the number of plaintiffs.Even in the event of the class action court ruling ultimately going against Vivendi, the French group claims it would take at least 18 months before the total amount of compensation it would be liable could be calculated.After this 18-month period, the company can also appeal the judgment. In other words, just as on Broadway, the legal show will run and run.european.view@ft.com
663;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-10-02T21:11:13Z;US stocks fall on jobs and factory orders;;US stocks ended lower on Friday after a surprise drop in factory orders and disappointing jobs data raised doubts about the strength of economic recovery.September’s non-farm payrolls report showed the loss of 263,000 jobs, taking the unemployment rate up to 9.8 per cent from 9.7 per cent in August, when a revised 201,000 jobs were lost. Economists polled by Bloomberg had been expecting the unemployment rate to rise to 9.8 per cent but had forecast a loss of only 175,000 jobs.The S&P 500 finished 0.5 per cent lower at 1,025.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.2 per cent at 9,487.67 and the Nasdaq fell 0.5 per cent to 2,048.11.Over the week, the S&P has lost 1.4 per cent, following a 2.2 per cent decline the previous week. The Dow is down 1.6 per cent – its biggest weekly drop since July. The Nasdaq is also 1.6 per cent lower.Wall Street started the week in a positive mood after a rush of merger deals lifted investor confidence. However, a series of economic indicators later in the week forced stocks to relinquish most of last month’s gains.Industrial stocks fell sharply on Friday. After growing speculation throughout the week, Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric’s chief executive said the company was holding discussions on partnerships or an initial public offering for its NBC Universal unit. Further reports on Thursday suggested a deal would be struck with cable operator Comcast. General Electric shares were down 3.8 per cent to $15.36, while Comcast lost 2.7 per cent to $15.24.Materials stocks also suffered. US Steel was down 3.6 per cent to $40.75, while Steel Dynamics fell 2.4 per cent to $14.34. Falling oil prices hit energy stocks. Edge Petroleum added to the gloom after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Its shares plunged 85.9 per cent to 8 cents.After the market’s close on Thursday, CIT, the lender to small and mid-sized companies, launched a debt exchange as part of a restructuring plan to avoid bankruptcy.CIT shares rose 10.4 per cent to $1.17. The stock had fallen 45 per cent on Wednesday after rumours of the plan first emerged.Technology stocks helped to mitigate some of the market’s losses.UBS upgraded Apple to “buy” from “neutral”, citing higher expectations for iPhone sales. Shares in Apple rose 2.2 per cent to $184.90.Intel, the world’s largest maker of semiconductors, also benefited from an upgrade. Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to “outperform” due to expected growth in personal computer sales. The shares were up 0.4 per cent at $18.97.Walmart said its operations in Asia had shown slight improvement. The world’s biggest retailer also said it saw a slow recovery from challenging US business conditions. Walmart closed 0.2 per cent higher at $49.08.
664;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast in talks to buy NBC Universal stake;;Comcast is in talks with General Electric to create a new venture that would combine NBC Universal and the content assets of the top US cable operator, people familiar with the negotiations said.The potential Comcast deal emerged this week as one of several options, including an initial public offering, GE is pursuing as it waits for Vivendi, which owns 20 per cent of NBC Universal, to exercise its right to sell the stake back to GE or force a stock sale.One scenario under consideration would involve GE buying back the stake from Vivendi and then spinning off NBC Universal and its debts to a new venture with Comcast, said a person familiar with the matter.Comcast would contribute about $4bn-$5bn cash to the new venture and its cable channels, including the Golf Channel and E! Networks, which it values at about $6bn, for a 51 per cent stake. The two companies are also discussing ways for GE to sell additional stakes in NBC to Comcast over time, the people said.For Comcast, the opportunity to create a large US cable company with a relatively meagre cash outlay is enticing in spite of the unpopularity among investors over combinations of content and distribution assets.GE would in turn shed a division that has looked increasingly out of place with the rest of its portfolio. While GE remains a massive conglomerate, the company has in recent years narrowed its focus onto faster-growing industrial businesses.The discussions are far from complete and the likelihood of the transaction was slim, people familiar with the talks said. An eventual initial public offering of the stake also remains an option for GE.Comcast’s shares fell 6 per cent on Thursday after reports that it may bid for all or part of NBC. The reaction mirrored the investor backlash Comcast faced after unveiling a surprise $54bn bid to buy Walt Disney in 2004.Comcast recently reassured investors it was unwilling to issue more debt or stock to complete a big transaction. The current scenario would satisfy both these objectives.Nevertheless, bankers noted that the deal conjured up memories of a bygone era in the media industry, when empire-building trumped financial or strategic rationale.Comcast has said owning both operators would offer cross-platform promotion opportunities as well as provide influence over future content distribution.
665;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-10-01T20:37:05Z;Wall Street suffers worst day since July;;Wall Street on Thursday suffered its biggest daily loss since early July after disappointing data on jobs and a surprise slowdown in manufacturing left investors concerned about economic recovery.The US government’s weekly jobless claims report showed that 551,000 Americans filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week. The figure was up from a revised 534,000 in the previous week and worse than economists’ forecasts of 535,000.The Institute for Supply Management’s index dropped to 52.6 last month from 52.9 in August. Analysts had been expecting a rise to 54.However, personal spending and personal income figures were slightly better than expected.The S&P 500 closed down 2.6 per cent at 1,029.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 per cent to 9,509.28. The Nasdaq lost 3.1 per cent to 2,057.48.“Usually you get to about this stage in an overall recovery and you are subject to a correction and so, from a psychological standpoint, it’s not surprising to see the market trying to reassess what’s really going on and how strong the recovery will be,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“We were primed for that anyway and some of the news more recently has been a little bit disappointing.”Materials and financial stocks dragged the market lower. United States Steel lost 4.8 per cent to $42.26. After falling 1.4 per cent on Wednesday on fears about economic recovery, Alcoa was down 1.5 per cent at $12.92 even after Deutsche Bank advised buying the shares.Ken Lewis, Bank of America’s chief executive, announced that he was retiring, leaving the country’s biggest lender without a successor. The shares were down 4.2 per cent at $16.21.Mr Lewis’ surprise departure, announced on Wednesday night, draws to an end his turbulent eight-year tenure at the bank and comes days after Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo made sweeping changes to their top ranks.JP Morgan lost 5.6 per cent to $41.37.The technology sector also suffered, with the Nasdaq reporting its biggest daily loss June.Cisco Systems agreed to buy Tandberg, the Norwegian video conferencing company, for $3bn in cash, presenting a further challenge to Microsoft as it pushes deeper into the online collaboration business. Cisco’s shares fell 1.9 per cent to $23.09.Goldman Sachs removed Microsoft from its “conviction buy” list, citing some degree of risk to first-quarter earnings, but retained a “buy” rating on the company. Microsoft shares fell 3.3 per cent to $24.88.Elsewhere in the sector, Comcast denied a report that it had struck a deal to buy General Electric’s stake in NBC Universal but reports suggested talks were ongoing about a joint venture. France’s Vivendi holds the remaining stake in the media conglomerate. Comcast’s shares fell 7.2 per cent to $15.67.Teradyne, which supplies automatic test equipment, lost 4.9 per cent to $8.80 following initial gains sparked by a raising of its third-quarter outlook.Late on Wednesday, Ascent Solar Technologies said it would offer 4m common shares in a public offering in order to raise cash for expansion. The shares dropped 23.8 per cent to $2.15.Penske announced, also late on Wednesday, it had broken off talks with General Motors to buy the Saturn brand. Its shares fell 16 per cent to $16.12.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Vical lost 5.9 per cent to $4.01. The shares had initially risen after the company said it had signed a $1.3m contract with the US Navy’s medical research centre to work on the development of its vaccine for H1N1 flu.Consumer groups, however, offered some relief. Diamond Foods, which sells nuts and snacks, posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings late on Wednesday. Higher snack sales offset lower demand for walnuts. The shares rose 4 per cent to $33.00.Constellation Brands, which owns wine brands such as Banrock Station and Clos du Bois, swung to a quarterly profit after restructuring efforts paid off. The shares gained 5.4 per cent to $15.97.
666;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-08-31T16:31:08Z;Television executives reach for reset button;;Broadcasters have marked 2009, their worst year in recent memory, by seeking a term other than “television” to describe the business of captivating couch potatoes.An existential crisis is gripping TV executives, who now prefer to call their output “video”. They face what newspaper executives witnessed a decade ago – big cash cow businesses in inexorable decline.The consumption of broadcast media has fragmented across hundreds of cable channels, countless mobile phones, the YouTube broadcasting website, as well as TV’s own digital ventures, such as Hulu and the BBC iPlayer. This all leaves the broadcast business at a critical moment.As advertising – the industry’s lifeblood – congeals, the threatened incumbents at the top of broadcast TV must redefine their businesses if they are to find growth once more.In broadcasting, “we have an ad-supported business model that does not work,” Chase Carey, chief operating officer of News Corp, said last month. “In the future, advertising will not pay all the bills,” Gerhard Zeiler, RTL’s chief executive, added last week.Globally, broadcast TV advertising will drop 13 per cent this year, and decline 1.5 per cent through 2013 to $116.2bn, according to PwC.In the US, spending is forecast to fall 9 per cent this year to $44.7bn as marketers move money into the areas of internet search and sponsorship. TV subscriptions, meanwhile, will rise 6.4 per cent through 2013 to reach $199bn, reported Veronis Suhler Stevenson, the private equity group.“The business is in decline,” said Jim Rutherfurd, managing partner of Veronis Suhler, the private equity firm. But “we’re not forecasting it will go away entirely”.Still, recent events in broadcasting are disturbing, with expectations of a 15 per cent decline in annual “upfront” ad sales for the coming US programming season, and networks withholding more inventory than usual in the hope of commanding higher prices when the economy improves.In this environment, it is understandable that NBC Universal, whose network lags rivals in primetime TV, now identifies itself as a cable-centric company.Mr Carey has similarly hinted that News Corp’s Fox TV stations could act more like cable networks and demand fees from distributors to retransmit local TV signals and for prime sports programming.“Every free-to-air group will have to think about, for example, pay-TV, about online services, about video-on-demand,” said Mr Zeiler, head of Europe’s largest broadcaster. In Britain, some analysts hope that a new chief at ITV, where ad revenue fell by 15 per cent in the first half of 2009, might pursue a pay-TV model.As traditional revenues decline, the search for digital growth has so far generated revenues far smaller than newspapers’ online divisions or the digital music business.Online video only accounts for two per cent of total TV viewing, notes Brian Wieser, global director of forecasting at Magna, a division of Interpublic. He calls it the “Web 2.0 per cent” phenomenon.Broadcasters may want to become more like their cable cousins, but most are also pursuing different strategies online. CBS, the free-to-air network, is joining Time Warner’s TV Everywhere trials – an initiative on which cable operators are pinning their digital hopes, which would offer hundreds of channels online for paying subscribers.The other US networks have placed bets on Hulu, an ad-supported video joint venture that attracted 40m visitors in April, comScore reported, but so far only churns out digital dimes, well short of the analogue dollars disappearing from its backers’ networks.Although an individual ad on Hulu costs two to three times as much as the same ad on a TV station, it has only managed to sell about a quarter of the number of ad spots, generating significantly less revenue per viewer.Comcast’s TV Everywhere trial is running the same ads online as on TV, to convince advertisers that online video adds to the audience rather than cannibalising it. For such experiments to succeed, a viewer measurement system spanning all platforms is required. Yet this will not be fully ready until 2011, said Nielsen, the audience measurement group.The danger is that TV Everywhere discounts the internet’s unique targeting abilities. Its ad model is seen even by backers as a two-year interim fix until they find a better solution.The good news is that professional content, rather than the YouTube-style videos of skateboarding dogs, will drive viewing online. By next year, half of the US population will watch online videos, according to eMarketer, a tipping point in the media industry.That single development – the ultimate mass medium reaching critical mass online – is perhaps television’s most promising growth opportunity.
667;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-08-31T16:31:08Z;Targeted advertising holds promise;;Targeted television advertising is touted as a winning innovation for everyone involved.For broadcasters, it could boost revenues at a time when TV advertising pricing is falling from historic highs, by bringing new niche or local advertisers to the medium.Advertisers would be able to tailor their messages by location, demographics or even viewing and web-browsing habits, thus making their marketing more appealing. Cat owners, for instance, would see fewer ads for dog food, a relevance surveys suggest viewers prefer. Media buying agencies would have an expanded role in administering the process, with opportunities for arbitrage.In spite of much promise, targeted or “addressable” TV has fallen short of its goals during implementation.Most distributors and software vendors have avoided noting viewership habit data for fear of drawing the ire of privacy advocates. “We’ve taken a really hard stance on privacy,” says Robert Ivins, vice-president of data development at US cable operator Comcast’s advertising division.The complexities of delivering fine-tuned TV ads on a national basis has also eluded technology companies and TV distributors, due to the different technologies used by thousands of cable operators, particularly in the US.“[The infrastructure] just wasn’t flexible enough,” says David Verklin, chief executive of Canoe, the advertising joint venture between Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cox, Charter and Cablevision, which had to postpone its trials of addressable advertising.But the opportunity remains alluring for broadcasters in the $170bn TV advertising market.“TV needs to fight back to maintain and improve its position in the marketplace,” says Stephen Nuttall, commercial director at BSkyB, the UK satellite broadcaster.Sky, and its UK pay-TV rival Virgin Media, will be investing millions of pounds in targeting strategies in the coming years.By 2011, Sky hopes to offer advertisers the ability to use the same ad slot to show different advertisements to different demographics. Ambitions to sell the same slot to different advertisers will come later.Hard disc-based digital video recorders are “the only realistic way of doing this at the moment”, says Adrian Stroud, director at Decipher, a media consultancy.Ads can be downloaded to set-top boxes in advance, and shown alongside chosen “on-demand” programmes or inserted dynamically into “linear” broadcast viewing. “Because millions of [DVRs] are already out there, you have a ready-made business case,” says Mr Stroud. “I don’t think it needs to get intrusive to be successful.”Media agencies and big advertisers such as P&G are pushing for the technology’s deployment. GroupM, WPP’s media agency, plans to offer addressable TV services to clients by the end of 2009. It believes the technology could be in 50 per cent of television households within five to seven years.
668;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-08-27T23:55:30Z;Cable groups in network tie-up;;NBC Universal, Walt Disney and Hearst are pooling two networks of cable channels in a complex consolidation that demonstrates the fragmented industry’s search for cost savings to offset falling advertising revenues.A&E Television Networks, currently controlled by all three companies, will buy Lifetime Entertainment Services, a 50:50 joint venture between Disney and Hearst, for an undisclosed sum.The agreement also illustrates the changed deal landscape for media companies, where boards, wary of the pricey takeovers that characterised the industry before credit markets gave way, are looking to asset swaps, which are more complicated but entail less financial risk.It may also herald further consolidation. An agreement whereby NBCU may sell its stake to its partners in the next 15 years could allow the GE-controlled group to cash in should a cable asset come on the market that offers it a path to full control.NBCU, which last year bought the Weather Channel with private equity partners, would not comment on whether it might bid for the Travel Channel, which Cox Communications is selling. The auction is expected to fetch offers of about $700m from Scripps Networks, Discovery Communications, News Corp and Time Warner.The expansion of A&E unites the History Channel’s male-oriented programmes such as IceRoad Truckers with Lifetime’s female-focused shows including Project Runway, which it picked up this season from NBCU’s Bravo cable channel.“The board felt the three major networks made for a stronger portfolio together,” Jeff Gaspin, chairman of NBCU’s television entertainment division, told the Financial Times.“It allows us continued diversification of our portfolio in cable and allows us to take advantage of the success Lifetime might have now it has Project Runway,” he added.The combined company’s 10 channels will reach 250m homes in 140 countries. It plans to cut duplicated costs and cross-promote shows more aggressively.The announcement came as the US pay-television industry’s TV Everywhere initiative, designed to preserve its subscription business model online, gained momentum.Time Warner Cable and Fios, Verizon’s fibre optic-based TV service, announced plans to conduct trials of TV Everywhere, following a similar statement from Comcast in June.The trials offer programming online for no additional cost to existing subscribers. Fios is initially offering programming from TBS and TNT, two channels owned by Time Warner, which spun off its cable operator this year.Time Warner Cable’s partners in the trial include its sister company’s channels, and others including CBS, BBC America and Discovery.“[TV Everywhere] will give our customers more control over content and allow them greater access to programmes they are already paying for, while enhancing the distributors’ and networks’ robust business model,” said Glenn Britt, chairman of Time Warner Cable.
669;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-08-19T00:11:24Z;MGM replaces its chief executive;;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios replaced its chief executive with a three-person team that includes a turnround expert, to devise a restructuring plan for its $3.7bn debt pile.Harry Sloan, MGM chief executive and media entrepreneur, who took over the CEO job in 2005 shortly after the company was taken private by a consortium of investors including Sony and Comcast, will remain as non-executive chairman of MGM.Three executives will replace Mr Sloan as part of the “Office of the CEO”. MGM hired Stephen Cooper, a highly regarded corporate turnround expert who oversaw Enron’s bankruptcy as interim CEO and the restructuring of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts in the same capacity. The co-founder of Zolfo Cooper, a restructuring group, was also appointed MGM vice-chairman.The studio that relaunched the United Artists division with Tom Cruise and owns the James Bond film library was taken private for $5bn in 2005 by a group of investors including Providence Equity Partners, TPG, DLJ Merchant Banking Partners and the Quadrangle Group.When Mr Cooper arrives at the studio’s California offices later this week, he will restart a complete review of the capital structure.The shuffling was not triggered by a specific event, people familiar with the company’s plan said. In July, MGM told investors it was in full compliance with its debt covenants. It faces a $250m payment by April 2010 on revolving credit and a $3.7bn term loan expiring in 2012.The other two members of the CEO group are Bedi Singh, chief financial officer, and Mary Parent, chairperson of MGM’s worldwide motion pictures group who was hired by Mr Sloan to restart the company’s film development and production.“The board looks at this as the best way to position us for the long term,” Ms Parent told the Financial Times. The move “gets us one of the best in the world to help address the capital structure”.Ms Parent, one of Hollywood’s most well known production chiefs, said the studio’s slate of six films, beginning with a remake of Fame, about a high school for gifted performance artists that makes its debut in September, remains on schedule.MGM has become a poster child for media sector leveraged buy-outs gone awry. Hollywood suffers from a sharp drop in DVD sales, long the profit-driver for studios, and now faces stiff competition from low-cost rental vendors such as Redbox.Investors such as Providence Equity, which holds the largest stake in the studio at 29 per cent, now values its stake at about 15 cents to the dollar, according to one person close to the investors.The weak credit environment has also made third party film financing difficult. In one failed attempt, MGM tapped Goldman Sachs last year to seek financing for a slate of films.By May 2009, the studio hired Moelis, a boutique investment bank, to “ explore options” for restructuring its capital structure and had considered debt-for-equity swaps with a committee of some 140 lenders.
670;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-08-06T21:33:40Z;Wall Street falls on economic jitters;;For the first time this week the S&P 500 closed below the 1,000-point threshold on Thursday, as healthcare, retail, energy and telecoms stocks weighed on sentiment ahead of today’s US monthly jobs report.The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 997.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 9,256.26. The Nasdaq Composite closed 1 per cent lower at 1,973.16.Shares in Cisco recovered from early losses and rose 0.6 per cent to $22.31. John Chambers, chief executive of the IT networking company, forecast another drop in quarterly revenue, even though it announced better results than expected.Early trading was choppy as investors reacted to news on unemployment and retail sales.Figures showed that fewer people than expected claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, but the effect on stocks was hampered by a rise in the number of people continuing to claim benefits.“The jobs data show we are going in the right direction, and that we have hit the bottom, but we think earnings are going to be the driver of the next bull market as things return to normal,” said Frank Ingarra, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.Poor same store sales in July among 30 major retailers and mixed earnings, along with a JPMorgan downgrade of healthcare stocks, were factors in pulling the major benchmarks lower. Thomson Reuters reported a drop of 5.1 per cent in same store sales last month.However, amid the gloom, several retailers raised their full-year profit guidance.Gap, the clothing retailer, jumped after beating its forecasts for July sales and increased its outlook on quarterly profits. The shares rose 8.2 per cent to $18.14.Macy’s was also able to increase its outlook for second-quarter earnings, bringing them far above analysts’ expectations in spite of seeing weaker sales than had been predicted. Its shares climbed 5.6 per cent to $15.01.Target slipped 0.2 per cent to $41.71 after reporting lower sales than analyst estimates. The company said the dip in comparable sales from last year was in line with its own forecasts.BJs Wholesale Club, which has shown strength during the recession as customers snap up goods at wholesale prices, saw sales drop more than expected, hurt in part by lower petrol prices. The shares gave up 3.2 per cent to $31.24.Within the healthcare sector, which was lowered to underweight by JP Morgan, shares in Gilead Sciences fell 3 per cent to $45.45, while Amgen lost 2.6 per cent to $60.69.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.4 per cent to $69.73 while Chevron lost 0.8 per cent to $69.25.Telecoms were hurt as shares in MetroPCS, the low-cost mobile telephone operator, slumped 29.2 per cent to $8.99. The company revealed a steep drop in new customers and a rise in the number of subscribers leaving its service and its earnings fell well short of Wall Street’s estimates.Financial shares were generally lower, although Citigroup continued its recent run and closed up 6.2 per cent at $3.80.In the insurance sector, Prudential and Allstate both fell after reporting quarterly results.Prudential easily beat analysts’ profit forecasts but failed to raise the upper end of its full-year outlook and the shares slipped 2.7 per cent to $45.63.Allstate’s shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $27.27 after it missed Wall Street’s expectations, suffering from unexpectedly high pay-outs following recent storms in the southern states.Elsewhere Comcast, the cable company, was able to cut costs sufficiently to bring quarterly profits above analyst estimates. After a warning that the company was seeing a continuing slowdown in the growth in new customers this quarter, the shares slipped 0.1 per cent to close at $15.05.Rival satellite television provider DirecTV’s stronger-than-expected revenues failed to translate into a rise in profits after one-off charges. The shares fell 3.6 per cent to $24.84.The first day of trading for CDC Software saw its shares close at $9.99, after being offered at a price of $12.
671;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-08-06T14:55:42Z;Comcast profit rises 53%;;Comcast, the top US cable operator, said second-quarter net profit surged 53 per cent from an income tax gain and lower capital spending, but the prolonged economic recession took its toll on the company.Shares rose more than 3 per cent on improved cash flow margins and profit that beat analyst expectations in a difficult environment.The prolonged recession and tough competition from rival telephone and satellite television services hurt Comcast’s ability to retain basic video customers and attract more subscribers to its other services. The company lost 214,000 basic video customers despite a benefit from the national digital television transition Comcast added 65,000 broadband customers, which executives acknowledged was “unusually low.” It added 171,000 net new digital video customers.Growth of revenue-generating units – a key metric of the number of customers taking at least one product – slowed by 65 per cent year on year.“We’re optimistic second-quarter high-speed internet growth is not a new trend,” said Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast. The company plans to improve its marketing of the product.Second-quarter net profit was $967m, or 33 cents per share, from $632m, or 21 cents per share a year earlier. Revenue rose 4.5 per cent to $8.9bn.Wall Street expected the company to post a profit per share of 26 cents and revenue of $8.8bn.Despite the economic pressures, operating cash flow rose 4.1 per cent to $3.5bn, and operating cash flow margins expanded to 39.6 per cent from 39.2 per cent in the same period a year earlier.Local cable advertising revenue fell 20 per cent. “We see no signs of recovery,” said Michael Angelakis, chief financial officer of Comcast, of the advertising environment.The company restarted its stock buyback program.
672;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-07-27T12:18:22Z;Pace triples set-top box sales to 8.5m;;"Interim pre-tax profits at Pace tripled as demand for high definition television bucked the global recession.The world’s third-largest set-top box maker shipped more than 8.5m personal video recorders in the six months to June 30, up from 2.8m units a year ago, to pay-TV operators around the world such as Comcast, Canal Plus and British Sky Broadcasting. About 57 per cent of those boxes were high definition, up from 55 per cent a year ago. Pace has upgraded full-year forecasts twice this year, but the shares fell 3¼p to 197p as the company only reiterated previous guidance.Arun George, an analyst at Noble Securities, said: “The City’s a bit disappointed there wasn’t an upgrade to earnings but
it’s still on the cards
later this year, especially on margins.”Revenue rose from £231.1m to £526.5m, while pre-tax profit jumped from £10.5m to £31m. Earnings per share were 7.3p (3.1p) and the interim dividend was 0.5p. Net cash rose from £37.7m to £48.9m.Gross margins, a key performance indicator, fell from 21 to 17.2 per cent.What recession? As Apple demonstrated last month, consumers are buying desirable high-tech gadgets. But Pace’s figures are not simply down to a buoyant market. Making the technology acceptable and reliable enough for pay-TV providers while making it profitable is tough. But Pace is pulling it off. Questions for the second half will revolve around margins and on early take-up for its Multi-dweller product, which can service multiple homes. Analysts are forecasting profits of about £75m from revenue of £1.1bn. Using an enterprise value-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio, Pace trades on a prospective value of 7 times compared with a hardware sector average of 16 times. The figure is too low."
673;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Cox to sell majority stake in Travel Channel;;Cox Communications has decided to sell a majority stake in the Travel Channel in an auction expected to value the cable network at $600m or more and break the drought in media industry deal-making.People briefed on the US group’s plans said it would issue documentation within days, but had already told potential bidders for the Travel Channel it planned to retain a stake of 33-35 per cent for tax reasons.Scripps Networks Interactive, owner of the Food Network, is widely seen as the front-runner in an auction likely to test large media groups’ continued appetite for cable programming.Cable networks have proven to be one of the few resilient sectors of a media business battered that has been ravaged by declining advertising and shifting consumer behavious. Networks such as Walt Disney’s ESPN and News Corp’s Fox News generate revenue from both advertising and affiliate fees paid by cable operators.The auction is also expected to attract interest from Time Warner, which remains flush with the proceeds of splitting off its cable business. Time Warner examined the Weather Channel last year, before its eventual sale to a group led by NBC Universal.Others ranging from News Corp to Comcast could also be drawn in to the process, people familiar with the situation said, but they expressed doubts about some analysts’ predictions that NBCU or Viacom might bid.Cox announced in June that it had appointed Goldman Sachs to advise it on strategic options for the Travel Channel, which it acquired from Discovery Communications two years ago when it sold a 25 per cent stake in Discovery. To avoid tax penalties on that deal, it must retain a minority stake in any sale, people briefed on its plans said.Travel Channel’s value was estimated at $1.25bn at the time of the Discovery transaction, but Barclays Capital estimated last month it may fetch closer to $600m-$700m in today’s more troubled credit markets, which have seen media companies’ trading multiples contract.Scripps and Time Warner declined to comment while Cox, News Corp and Comcast could not immediately be reached for comment.Launched in 1987, the Travel Channel is now available in 90m US cable homes, and has branched into online forums as well as video on demand and mobile services.
674;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;CBS joins online video-on-demand online trial;;CBS has become the first broadcast network to sign up to trials of an online video-on-demand service which has become the focus of the US cable industry’s efforts to preserve its business model in the digital era.The broadcaster’s alliance with Comcast, the cable group which unveiled plans for its On Demand Online service last month, could help CBS build up an alternative to Hulu, the fast-growing online video site backed by three rival US networks – NBC, News Corp’s Fox and Walt Disney’s ABC.To date, CBS has declined to offer its content through Hulu, preferring instead to build up its own online video site, TV.com, which has not matched Hulu’s traffic.Comcast said the technical trial would start “in the coming weeks” with 5,000 customers across the country, in the industry’s first big test of the “TV Everywhere” idea that consumers should have access to full length video online if that have already paid for it through a pay-television subscription.Following an agreement with Time Warner last month, On Demand Online has already secured content from TBS, TNT, HBO, Cinemax and Starz. More content deals are expected shortly.”CBS is very supportive of initiatives that help extend our content to new platforms in such a way that we gain new audiences and additional value for our advertisers,” said Quincy Smith, chief executive of CBS Interactive.CBS said it would offer “various types of current and library content” for the trial.
675;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-07-08T08:36:31Z;Chicago Cubs;It is hard to strike out by owning an icon;"Newspaper publisher Tribune may have been forced into bankruptcy through dud media investments but at least it hit a home run with its purchase of the Chicago Cubs nearly three decades ago. Based on price talk for a proposed sale to the Ricketts family of $900m, the compound annual return for owning the popular but hapless team was 14.5 per cent. This makes the Cubs, who have not won a World Series for over a century, one of the most valuable sports franchises on the planet.The valuation seems somewhat high on a multiple of estimated operating income and compared with recent sales. Three teams sold four years ago went for between $180m and $270m. The premium can be explained by its large local market and the Cubs’ mystique. Baseball team valuations also reflect the fun factor and exclusivity of team ownership. Even now, the deal must be approved by 75 per cent of other teams’ owners and the amount of debt financing is limited. With $239m in revenue, Forbes Magazine ranked the Cubs as the fifth most valuable out of 30 American baseball teams at $700m, about two and a half times as much as the lowly Florida Marlins. The New York Yankees are the most valuable at an estimated $1.5bn.The sale also includes a 25 per cent stake in the Chicago Comcast Sportsnet. Captive cable television franchises can be highly profitable – most notably the Yankees’ partial-ownership in the Yes Network, which was valued at $3.5bn two years ago. In addition to the Cubs, Comcast Sportsnet broadcasts games of crosstown rival White Sox and the Chicago Bulls, Blackhawks and Bears, the city’s basketball, hockey and football teams. Even so, the network’s value is said to be less than that of the team and the stadium.Wrigley Field, the Cubs’ home for the past 95 years, is one of the most old-fashioned yet iconic properties in baseball. Its famous ivy-covered walls, intimate seating and relative dearth of advertising all add to the fan appeal of a stadium that, in spite of being one of the smallest baseball stadiums, ranked 7th out of 30 in fan attendance last year. Physical attendance for the 81 home games is key as gate receipts provided more than half the Cubs’ total revenue last year versus just 16 per cent for the Marlins. The rest comes from sources such as broadcast revenue and merchandising.Tribune might have fetched a bit more for the Cubs had it sold before the recession, but the still-healthy price speaks to the enduring value of a storied sports franchise. Even in a prolonged recession, it is hard to strike out by owning an icon.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

676;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-06-24T22:26:39Z;Media industry plots pay plans;;"Two of the most ambitious media industry efforts to retrain consumers to pay for online content set out their plans on Wednesday amid a surge in accessing free content via the internet.Time Warner said it planned to begin a test in July to offer some of its top cable network shows online to about 5,000 subscribers of Comcast, the top US cable operator. A broader roll-out will begin in the fourth quarter.The test is among the first concrete plans to evangelise the industry’s “ TV Everywhere” strategy to make all cable network programming free on the
internet, but only to paying cable subscribers.Across town, Journalism Online, aiming to offer struggling newspapers a way to start charging for online news and entertainment, unveiled plans for its e-commerce platform.This could enable newspaper publishers to convert about 10 per cent of their online readers to subscribers, while retaining 91 per cent of the advertising revenue their free sites currently generate, its co-founders argued. A typical 1m circulation newspaper, charging $7.50 monthly online subscriptions, could enjoy an $82.2m bottom line benefit within two years, they estimated.Jeffrey Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, has staked his reputation on simplifying the way pay TV subscribers can access the same shows on all devices. “As we move through time, every multichannel network would be online and on broadband,” said Mr Bewkes.But the details have yet to be worked out, executives admitted, including how many shows to offer and for what period.Although video consumption online is just a small sliver of overall television watching, the proliferation of more shows online could threaten traditional television advertising.Time Warner and other cable network owners are in discussions with Nielsen, the TV audience measurement firm, to include online videos in a new aggregate ratings system.Journalism Online would launch with “a significant number of publishers” this autumn, said Steven Brill, who founded The American Lawyer magazine.In a move likely to broaden its appeal to bloggers, Journalism Online also said publishers could earn credit for referring readers to other sites.The platform could offer a solution to newspapers, such as many UK titles, struggling to attract advertising for the large number of online readers outside their home markets, Mr Crovitz said.The announcements came a day after Les Hinton, chief executive of Dow Jones, likened Google to a “digital vampire” sucking on the newspaper industry’s blood. In committing the “colossal blunder” of giving content away online for free, publishers “gave Google’s fangs a great place to bite”."
677;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Secret war on web crooks revealed;;The people who run the world’s internet systems are a rather secretive bunch.Three times a year, senior technical officers from companies such as Google, Yahoo, AT&T, Comcast and Verizon meet to discuss ways of stopping the internet from being swamped by rising levels of spam, viruses and hacking attacks by organised criminals. They do not generally like discussing these meetings.“Some people might get nervous if they knew all the things we talked about,” said Michael O’Rierdan, chairman of the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG). “Its our job to make the internet safe, but we don’t want to put people off using the web.”They are also worried about being targeted by the cyber-criminals they are trying to thwart.Most of the spam and hacking on the internet is run by organised crime rings. There is an underground economy that hacks into computers, sells stolen identities and orchestrates the sending of spam e-mails about everything from fake Viagra pills to banking scams. There is a lot of money at stake in keeping these operations running.“We get threats every day,” said Larry, chief technical officer of Spamhaus, a non-profit organisation that exposes spammers. He prefers not to reveal his surname. “In the US it is people bringing lawsuits against us. And then there are organised criminals in Russia and Ukraine, who use different methods.”Steve Linford, the organisation’s founder, has been advised by police not to open unexpected packages arriving at his home.MAAWG meetings are also places to discuss some of the controversial measures that internet companies need to take in the fight against spam, such as blocking some types of e-mail traffic. This measure sits awkwardly with civil liberties bodies.The 270 delegates from 19 countries who met at Amsterdam’s venerable Hotel Krasnapolsky last week were far from the usual, suit-wearing conference crowd. An eclectic mix of tattoos, ponytails, high-waisted trousers and backpacks indicated that these were true operations people who work in the bowels of the network.Membership is strictly vetted and journalists are not normally invited to attend, but MAAWG has started to lift its veil a little. There is a growing feeling that the industry must reach out to consumers and get them to help fight cyber-crime.In 2008, 349.6bn spam messages were sent across the internet, according to Symantec, the internet security company. Spam accounts for an average of almost 94 per cent of all e-mail messages.Nearly 90 per cent of spam is sent from computers that have been hacked into and are being remotely programmed to send out spam.More than 9.4m computers have been hijacked in this way and their owners are usually entirely unaware it is going on. It will be impossible to clean up these machines without talking to consumers.“Sometimes we want people to know what we are doing, so they can yell at the politicians to give us more help,” said Jerry Upton, executive director of MAAWG.There is a rising sense of crisis among internet companies about the cost of spam. Few are willing to quantify how much they have to spend to fight spam, but Mr O’Rierdan estimated that big internet service providers employ five to 10 staff just to look at spam. In addition they must buy spare servers, routers and other equipment to cope with the volumes of junk mail, buy spam-filtering software and run support centres for their customers.Viriya Upatising, chief technical officer of True Internet, a Thai internet service provider, said junk mail was a crippling cost for the company because it was paying to send the unwanted data across undersea cable connections to destinations such as the US and Europe.“The cost of bandwidth is expensive in Asia,” Mr Upatising said. “It costs us $250 per megabit per month to send data internationally.”The company put in place a draconian system that prevents suspected spammers from using its network. The measures have cut unwanted messages from 3.5m a day to a more manageable 250,000.“We are all sharing these costs,” said Patrick Peterson, chief technology officer at Ironport Systems, Cisco’s e-mail security arm. “Spam is a stealth tax on consumers. ISPs have to pay for the spam, for the extra bandwidth, for equipment, and they are forced to put up their prices for consumers.”There is a fear among internet security professionals that they might be losing the battle to cyber-criminals. This may also be why they now want the public to know more about what they do, to show they have at least tried.“I don’t know if we can control it,” said Dave Crocker, one of the early pioneers of e-mail and now a senior technical adviser to MAAWG.He added: “It is an arms race. We are getting better at filtering out rogue messages but every day the criminals get better too, and they are better organised and more aggressive.”
678;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Chrysler failure sparks rally for Ford and GM;;US stocks gave up early gains on Thursday afternoon after President Barack Obama announced car maker Chrysler was to file for bankruptcy protection.The news triggered a one per cent fall in equities as investors worried about the effect on the wider economy.But the benchmark S&P 500 closed the month with a gain of 9.4 per cent, the best month since March 2000.Other troubled carmakers benefited from Chrysler’s news, with investors betting they were now more likely to survive. GM picked up 6.1 per cent to $1.92 while Ford gained 9.7 per cent to $5.98.But some analysts warned the bankruptcy could prove a turning point in the recent rally. “The market has absorbed some bad economic news recently, but you could see a pull back after a major event like today’s,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.Earlier in the day, several better-than-expected earnings announcements had led a strong rally. Industrial group Dow Chemical led the materials sector ahead of every other on the S&P after reporting a surprise profit as spending controls helped the company overcome falling sales. Its shares jumped 18.4 per cent to $16.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 872.81 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.2 per cent lower at 8,168.12 points. But the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.3 per cent to 1,717.30 points.Banks had gained earlier after a bullish note from Anthony Bolton, president of investments at Fidelity International, on the position of banks to lead equities out of the slump. But after the news on Chrysler, they fell back. Citigroup closed 2.2 per cent down at $3.05, while JPMorgan lost 4.3 per cent to $33.The early gains came amid mixed economic data, as personal income and spending both fell more sharply than predicted. But investors were buoyed by figures showing the number of people claiming jobless benefits continued to fall for the first time last week, even though the number continuing to claim such benefits reached a new record high.“It seems like we have turned a corner this week,” said Ian Griffiths, a dealer at CMC Markets. “There has been some pretty bad news, which the market has ignored to remain bullish.”There was also mixed news for consumer stocks, as weak sales at rivals Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive countered better-than-expected results at Starbucks and Kellogg.P&G and Colgate both met or beat analysts expectations with first-quarter profits. However, investors fretted over falling sales at each, and P&G lost 1.9 per cent to $49.44 while Colgate dropped 1.2 per cent to $59.Starbucks beat expectations as cost cuts compensated for sliding sales. The company has come under pressure from cheaper retailers, but its shares rallied on Thursday as chief executive Howard Schultz promised a marketing campaign focusing on value. The shares rose 5.6 per cent to $14.46.Kellogg also saw falling sales, but its cereal division showed strength, lifting profits and sending its stock up 6.6 per cent to $42.11.Changes to the number of people watching television led to mixed results for Comcast, the cable TV provider and Viacom, the media group that owns the MTV network.Comcast added subscribers and raised profits, helping to lift its share price 1.4 per cent to $15.46.Viacom found its viewing numbers under pressure though, which, added to slowing revenues from advertising, and saw the company report falling revenues and profits. But the market had predicted even worse and its shares picked up 5 per cent to $20.66.Meanwhile, Visareported rising revenues as more customers used the company’s debit cards. Cost cuts also helped boost profits above the level analysts had predicted and its shares gained 2.3 per cent to $64.96.There was good news for Expedia, the online travel agency, which has suffered recently as investors feared the outbreak of swine flu would discourage travel, after it announced its profits had not fallen as far as expected. Its shares surged 28.5 per cent to $13.61.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest publicly-traded company, reported lower profits than expected, as the recession weighed on demand for oil. Exxon shares fell 2.6 per cent to $66.67.
679;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-04-30T15:27:50Z;Banks and earnings fuel optimism on Wall St;;Wall Street continued rising above the three month high set during the previous session on Thursday morning after another bullish analyst note on banks added a sheen to several better-than-expected earnings announcements.Industrial group Dow Chemical led the materials sector ahead of every other on the benchmark S&P 500 index after reporting a surprise profit as low materials costs and tight spending controls helped the company overcome worse sales than expected. Its shares jumped 18.2 per cent to $15.97.Banks added to the earnings optimism after Anthony Bolton, the UK-based executive at Fidelity International, said he thought the recent equity market gains marked a bull market rather than a bear market rally. He added that beaten-down financials could lead the way out of the slump. This came the day after Fox-Pitt Kelton said any dilution to shareholder value resulting from capital raising following the government’s stress tests on the banks was already priced into banks’ shares.Citigroup gained 2.9 per cent to $3.21. Meanwhile Bank of America, where Ken Lewis was replaced as chairman on Wednesday night while keeping his role as chief executive, rose 4.3 per cent to $9.05.In the first half-hour of trade, the S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 884.86, while the Dow gained 1.2 per cent to 8,281.94 points and those the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 1.9 per cent to 1,743.69 points.The gains came amid mixed economic news, as personal income and spending both fell more sharply than predicted. But investors were buoyed by figures showing the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time continued to fall last week, even though the number continuing to claim such benefits made another record high.There was mixed news for consumer companies, as weak sales at rivals Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive subtracted from stronger than expected results at both Starbucks and Kellogg.Procter & Gamble, which makes consumer products from Head & Shoulders to Pringles crisps, reported better profits than analysts’ estimates and reaffirmed its full year profits outlook. But its shares fell as it warned that full-revenues might come in below expectations as the company foresaw another quarter of destocking by retailers. The stock lost 3.5 per cent to $48.64.Colgate-Palmolive gained however, after reporting rising profits which were in line with Wall Street’s expectations. The company successfully raised its prices and cut its costs to report earnings of $0.97 per share, but its stock fell as sales remained weak, losing 1.2 per cent to $59.Starbucks also beat analysts’ expectations as efforts to slash costs compensated for an 8 per cent fall in revenue. The company has come under pressure for customers from cheaper retailers such as McDonald’s and Dunkin Donuts, but its shares rallied on Thursday as Howard Schultz, its chief executive, promised a marketing campaign focusing on value. The shares rose 10.5 per cent to $15.13.Kellogg was another company involved in food to suffer falling sales during the first three months of the year, but its cereal division showed some strength, helping its profits rise and sending its shares up 8.2 per cent to $42.73.Changes to the number of people watching television led to mixed results for Comcast, the cable TV provider and Viacom, the media group that owns the MTV network among others. Comcast was able to add subscribers and boost profits, helping to raise its share price 5.8 per cent to $16.13.Viacom found its viewing numbers under pressure though, which, added to slowing revenues from advertising, saw the company report falling revenues and profits. But the market had predicted even worse from the group and its shares picked up 3.2 per cent to $22.43.Meanwhile, Visa, the credit card company, reported rising revenues as more customers used the company’s debit cards. Cost cuts also helped boost profits above the level analysts had predicted and its shares gained 3.8 per cent to $65.90.Health insurer Aflac also beat estimates, with a 20 per cent rise in profits being helped by the strength in the yen. The company, which gets most of its revenue from Japan, has fallen over 36 per cent this year as Wall Street worries about the quality of its investments. The shares rose however, gaining 1.3 per cent to $29.50.There was good news for travel stocks, which have suffered recently as investors feared the outbreak of swine flu would discourage people from travelling, after Expedia, the online travel agency, announced its profits had not fallen as far as expected. Its shares surged 24.7 per cent to $13.21.But Exxon Mobil, the world’s largest publicly traded company, fell after reporting lower profits than expected, as the recession translated into falling demand for oil. With oil prices also falling back from the previous session, the company gave up 1.3 per cent to $67.53.European stocks were up early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gaining 2.1 per cent to 833.50 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly up, as the FTSE Asia-Pacific index rose 3.5 per cent to 172.10 points.Bond yields were lower, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note falling 3 basis point to 0.922 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note losing 1bp to 3.1 per cent.The dollar was mixed against major currencies early in New York, and lost 0.5 per cent against the yen to $0.0102.Gold was trading $1.57 lower at $883.88 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York. US crude prices were $0.35 lower at $50.62 a barrel.
680;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-04-05T18:30:45Z;Talk of ‘TV Everywhere’ fills cable convention;;The music and newspaper industries have faced serious challenges and are struggling to survive in the form that we know them.The mis-steps of both – the former for reacting too slowly to the onslaught of digital technology and the latter for hesitating in the face of competition from free content on the internet – framed discussions at the annual National Cable & Telecommunications Association convention in Washington DC last week.Executives puzzled over the explosive demand of free online videos and whether that could lead customers to drop their cable TV service.Hardly any conversations went without mention of the cable industry’s answer to the threat – “TV Everywhere” or “Entitlement” – a broad concept spearheaded by Time Warner to offer a cable network’s programming line-up online for “free”, but only to paying subscribers to cable video services.“We’re all being too slow to take all these networks [and] put it on broadband. Do it right away.” Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner chief executive, urged some 12,000 cable executives attending the show last week.TV Everywhere, and a similar plan by Comcast, the top US cable operator, called OnDemand Online, is designed to preserve the lucrative 30-year-old cable business model where networks such as CNN, which sell advertising, are also paid a fee by cable operators like Comcast for the right to carry the channel.Mr Bewkes’s plan, a revision of a failed attempt to do the same for video-on-demand services, comes as the decline in advertising hits media businesses.Privately, executives at the show said executing the plan would be a nightmare.But doing nothing could be worse. The tough slog over the next two or more years to convince nearly everyone to go along with the plan will determine the future of media for the next 20, cable executives say.Talking to the Financial Times, Mr Bewkes conceded there were “some issues”. Among these: how many more adverts must programmers add to online videos, and in what form will these appear?Services such as Hulu, the free online video service that is a joint venture of News Corp and NBC Universal, carry only about a quarter of the amount of adverts that appear on television. It might prove hard to sell enough ads to fill the available slots for online video.Hulu, which boasted of selling out its inventory of ads last year, has resorted to running filler ads this year.“What emerges …has to result in a growth in advertising,” Philippe Dauman, chief of Viacom, told the FT.Better technology to attract viewers, as well as the ability of media sales teams to sell across multiple media platforms could offset dented revenue if viewers suddenly flocked to the web, Mr Bewkes said.For all the hullabaloo about online video, it has generated little revenue and almost no profits compared with TV. The average ad revenue per viewing hour for cable is about three times higher than for online video, media executives say.“How much more content can you put online until you have mechanisms to monetise [it]?” asks Denise Denson, executive vice-president of content distribution at Viacom’s MTV.Other programming executives were reticent about offering anywhere near their entire programming line-up on the internet. “We’re going to be as moderate as we can be,” said Joshua Sapan, chief executive of Rainbow Networks. Making TV Everywhere work would also require a massive, industry-wide co-ordination among rivals fearful of divulging valuable consumer data to each other. “There are at least as many questions associated with building it as there are elements that seem attractive about it,” said Bridget Baker, president of TV network distribution at NBC Universal.“Maybe it’s not such a good idea,” confided one top media executive by the end of the week-long cable show.In spite of uncertainty, some, like Time Warner Cable, are forging ahead with plans to roll out an online version of HBO, which carries no advertising. Tests later in the year with ad-supported networks from Turner Broadcast and NBC Universal will be a better barometer of future success.As to when programming schedules will be a key-press away for paying subscribers, “I don’t know the answer to that,” Mr Sapan confessed.
681;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Disney warns on restraints to web viewing;;Disney expressed caution on Thursday over the US cable industry’s move to restrict online viewing of television shows to cable subscribers, saying that the limits could provoke a backlash from consumers.Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive, said preventing viewers from accessing shows on the internet unless they paid for cable services – a cable industry plan called “TV Everywhere” or “authentication” – could be seen as anti-consumer.“We are open to exploring the possibility [of restricting online viewing],” Mr Iger told thousands of cable TV executives at the annual National Cable & Telecommunications Association in Washington DC. But “preventing people from watching any shows online unless they subscribe [to a cable TV service] can be viewed as anti-consumer and anti-technology”.Disney, owner of ABC television network and the ESPN sports cable network, does not operate a cable television service.The cable industry’s idea is designed to preserve a decades-old business model where cable networks, such as ESPN, are paid by cable operators for the right to offer the channel.The networks also can generate revenue by selling adverts.This business arrangement has made cable networks more resilient to economic cycles.Mr Iger’s proclamation could drive a wedge between cable programmers, like Disney, and cable operators, such as Comcast, who have been in negotiations to develop a strategy that would prevent online piracy while also offering programming wherever and whenever consumers want.TV Everywhere, a concept led by Time Warner, is a broad framework that would offer vastly more shows online to consumers who pay monthly fees for cable TV service. Comcast is working on a similar concept called “OnDemand Online.”Disney similarly shocked the cable industry a few years ago when it announced it would begin offering its top broadcast TV shows online for free on its website.This week, Disney struck a deal to offer clips of some shows from ABC and ESPN on Google’s YouTube online video service.Disney is also in late-stage negotiations to offer full-length shows from some of its networks on the Hulu online video service, a joint venture of NBC Universal and News Corp, according to people familiar with the discussions.Although Hulu, which mostly offers full-length and clips of shows from broadcast networks, cable operators fear that the site’s explosive growth and potential to attract more cable network programming – which would be offered for free – could lead consumers to dump their cable TV subscriptions.

By comparison, in the US all the top technology companies use the service for marketing or recruitment purposes.A study published last week by O2, the mobile operator owned by Telefónica, estimates that more than 700,000 smaller businesses are using Twitter, sending 3m messages on the network every day.According to O2’s survey, 16 per cent said they had saved more than £5,000 on marketing and recruitment costs, while almost a third had saved more than £1,000 since joining Twitter.Three-quarters of corporate Twitterers used the service to promote their business, while a third said they used it to monitor competitors. Many of the 500 companies surveyed by O2 said Twitter was more popular than blogging, or rival networks Facebook or LinkedIn. “The risk in not using Twitter is that these companies will fall behind transatlantic competitors,” said Stephen Beynon, managing director of ntl:Telewest Business.In the US, Comcast and Dell have become well known for using Twitter for fielding customer service enquiries and heading off online criticism. Twitter’s search function allows brands to scan for their name and see what people are saying about them.But more UK companies are expected to join three-year-old Twitter as its popularity rockets here, particularly in the wake of celebrity Twitterers such as Stephen Fry, Jonathan Ross and Phillip Schofield.Hitwise, a division of Experian which tracks web audiences, said Twitter entered the UK’s 100 most popular websites in March. Now ranking at number 44, it receives more traffic than each of the national newspapers’ homepages, apart from the Daily Mail.

The sector led the market’s declines in the morning session with a 3 per cent sell-off as the housing data underscored the scale of the economic and financial crises.Yet the sector was later one of the best performing, up as much as 2.4 per cent overall. “There is short covering in front of President Obama’s mortgage aid announcement,” said Nick Kalivas, analyst at MF Global. “Most of the plan has been leaked, but the trade is on guard for a surprise.”The financial sector finished little changed after the President unveiled the plan, although Citigroup and Bank of America were two key losers, down 4.9 per cent to $2.91 and 6.7 per cent to $4.57, respectively.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 788.42, the Dow Jones Industrial Average flat at 7,555.63 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 0.2 per cent lower at 1,467.97.In the previous session, the S&P slumped beneath the psychologically significant 800 level for the first time since November, which prompted concerns among technical analysts that the benchmark index would test an 11-year low.The S&P, which began the year more than 20 per cent above that November nadir, stands less than 5 per cent away from the bear market low.“It’s a little scary,” said Marc Groz, managing member of Topos, alternative investment manager.Modest gains in the technology sector, up 0.4 per cent overall, helped prop up the market. The sector was helped by some positive news, including that Intelwould invest in three United Arab ­Emirates-based technology companies. Shares in the chipmaker added 1.1 per cent to $13.36.However, Hewlett-Packard edged 0.8 per cent lower to $34.08 and lost a further 3.2 per cent in after-hours trade, after a worse-than-expected forecast for the coming year.Other downbeat earnings continued to weigh on the market. Deere & Colost 3.8 per cent to $32.23 after the world’s largest maker of farm equipment disclosed an unexpectedly sharp drop in quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecast.Goodyear Tire & Rubber climbed 6 per cent to $6.38 despite a worse-than-expected loss as investors appeared to welcome cost-cutting plans.General Motors fell 5.5 per cent to $2.06 following sharp losses in the previous session after Moody’s warned that the risk of a bankruptcy filing remained high in spite of a restructuring plans.The cable sector came under pressure after Comcast disclosed it had lost more video subscribers than expected in the fourth quarter and warned it was unlikely to complete a share buy-back by the end of the year. The shares fell 4.1 per cent to $12.36.US-listed shares in Rogers Communicationsdropped 4.3 per cent to $21.52 after the Canadian telecoms group disclosed worse-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.On the upside, Sprint Nextel rallied 1.8 per cent to $2.71 after David Dixon, analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, raised his recommendation on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”, citing cost-cutting measures.Elsewhere, Nalco rallied 5.4 per cent to $11.66 after it became the latest stock to be added to Warren Buffett’s portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway became the second-largest holder in the water treatment company with a 6.4 per cent stake.Airlines came under pressure after the International Air Transport Association warned that business-class air travel dropped in December. The Amex airline index shed 6.5 per cent overall.
684;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-02-18T19:40:56Z;Comcast subscriber growth slows;;Comcast subscriber growth slowed in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period as the impact of the declining economy exacerbated competition from rival satellite and phone companies.The top US cable operator, which delivers video, phone and broadband services to some 24m US customers, also lost basic video customers at a faster rate than any period last year, or about 233,000 during the quarter that Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, called “the toughest we have known in business”.Comcast added 537,000 video, broadband and phone customers in the fourth quarter compared with a 1.3m gain in the same period last yearIts shares fell 5.3 per cent to $12.21 on the weaker growth and Comcast’s statements that it did not plan to complete a share repurchase programme this year.Results contrast with those reported by rival DirecTV, the top US satellite TV company controlled by Liberty Media, which added more subscribers than expected for the fourth quarter and forecast strong growth in 2009.Liberty Media, run by media mogul John Malone, sealed a $530m deal to rescue Sirius XM, a US satellite radio company, this week that could have long-term benefits to DirecTV.But Comcast executives struck a confident tone and pointed to its strong financial growth, which included 2008 free cash flow rising by 56 per cent and average revenue per user remaining stable, in spite of concerns that customers would downgrade video services.“We anticipated the slowdown quite well and adjusted rapidly to this fast-changing environment,” said Mr Roberts said.Although cable network advertising is a small part of Comcast’s business, fourth-quarter advertising revenue fell 5 per cent, including the boost from political spending.Excluding political adverts, advertising revenue fell 20 per cent. Executives said they saw no improvements this year.In 2009, executives said it aims to focus on financial improvements rather than market share growth.Comcast raised its annual dividend by 8 per cent to 27 cents per share but said it was unlikely to complete a previously announced stock buy-back programme by 2009.The company’s 32 per cent decline in net profit from a year ago was largely attributed to a $600m writedown of its investment in Clearwire Corp, a wireless company.Net profit for the fourth quarter was $412m, or 14 cents per share, from $602m, or 20 cents per share a year earlier.Excluding the writedown, Comcast posted a better-than-expected profit per share of 27 cents, ahead of analyst estimates of 22 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.Revenue rose 7 per cent to $8.8bn.The company added 247,000 digital video subscribers, 184,000 broadband customers and 340,000 phone customers, which were below some Wall Street estimates.

Morgan Stanley under John Mack as a vice-chairman of investment banking.He has advised clients including Nextel in its $42bn merger with Sprint; Comcast in its $72bn purchase of AT&T Broadband; and Lucent in its $18bn merger with Alcatel.More recently, he advised on the sale of OMX to Nasdaq, the electronic stock exchange.Morgan Stanley ranks fourth in the list of global M&A advisers for 2009, after working on $95bn of announced deals, according to Dealogic.In the US, it ranks first with $86bn in deals, ahead of second-ranked Barclays
Capital and third-ranked Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Morgan Stanley advised Wyeth in its agreed $68bn takeover by Pfizer, which has inflated this year’s sharply lower overall M&A volume.The bank said in an internal memo that Michael
Boublik, its co-head of M&A in the Americas, will now become chairman of M&A for the region.Mr Boublik, who helped advise Wyeth, will turn his focus more heavily toward top-level client relationships.Mark Eichorn, the bank’s other Americas M&A co-head, will become head of M&A for the Americas.Michele Colocci will become Morgan Stanley’s chairman of M&A in Europe and remain its deputy head of European investment banking.Dieter Turowski, the bank’s German M&A head, will become its European M&A head. Scott Matlock will remain chairman of M&A for Asia.Mr MacDonald, the former European M&A head, died aged 47 following a heart attack in December. He became the bank’s global M&A head in mid-2007 when Paul Taubman was elevated to the role of global co-head of investment banking.Mr MacDonald collapsed at his desk in London’s Canary Wharf.Mr Kindler, a 55-year-old New York native, will be responsible for continuing Mr MacDonald’s efforts to restore confidence in Morgan Stanley and its advisory services, at a time when
the financial markets re-main in tumult and M&A volume has dropped precipitiously."
686;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Media convergence;;"Cable networks do not have to fear the internet. It may have killed the business models of many record labels and newspapers, but there good reasons to think that companies distributing programming can dodge the online bullet.For a start, making video of even moderate quality is a very different, and more expensive proposition than writing a blog or starting a band in the garage. User generated content fills a variety of niches but is unlikely to derail television. It is striking that the 10 most popular videos on YouTube in 2008 were all professional efforts.Also, for all the shows available on sites such as Hulu.com, a video streaming site owned by News Corp and NBC, the economics for content owners do not make sense. Even assuming that it is possible to charge the equivalent TV rate for an online advert, consumers do not tolerate as many ads online. Bernstein Research calculates that once lost affiliate fees (the carriage costs paid by other cable networks) are taken into account, the advertising yield on one 26-minute show is an eighth of that per traditional viewer. Furthermore, hit TV shows are bundled with another 23 hours a day of programming that generates further income. Internet viewers simply cherry pick the good stuff. Putting free content online only makes sense as a means to attract new viewers to a programme on the traditional distribution channels.Convenience and availability are still necessary to avoid pushing viewers toward illegitimate downloads. Ultimately, though, consumers will have to pay for what they watch. And the easiest way to do that is to have one company deal with all the charges and technology, piping it direct to the living room. Competition between those who lay cable or put satellites in space will erode revenues over time. But with the cable operators Time Warner, Comcast and Cablevision all trading at less than five times earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation, a record low, investors should not hide behind the sofa.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

687;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
688;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-01-08T16:56:42Z;New standard for home entertainment networks;;A new standard to simplify moving video from one device to another and around the home was announced on Thursday, with support from cable operators and a Hollywood studio.Silicon Image, the Silicon Valley company behind the HDMI standard that reduces audio and video cabling to a single wire, announced LiquidHD at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.It said the new technology would quickly and easily connect TVs, set-top boxes, PCs and portable devices in a seamless network. Consumers would be able to enjoy digital content from any source device on any LiquidHD-enabled display in their homes.Moving video around the growing number of CE devices in the home has proved problematic. Different cabling and internet-protocol technologies are available, but consumers need high levels of expertise to link everything together and not all devices and networks are compatible.LiquidHD can use coaxial cable, ethernet, wi-fi or powerlines in the home to connect devices, automatically discovering them and removing the need for the consumer to set up the network.A set-top box for example, with several tuners delivering channels and recording programs for a living room TV, could also provide the same service to other TVs around the house.Silicon Image has been privately working on the technology for nearly five years and has won the approval of the Fox Hollywood studio for the level of content security it has built in. Cable operators Comcast and Liberty Global have also endorsed the technology.It still faces the difficult task of persuading consumer electronics companies generally to adopt LiquidHD, but aims to follow the same route of establishing an industry consortium that led to the widespread take-up of HDMI.In a further advance, the International Telecommunication Union last month announced the first global standard for an in-home, high-speed network capable of delivering room-to-room HDTV.G.hn promises high-quality multimedia over power, coaxial, phone and other home network wiring, delivered three times faster than existing wired technologies.”What G.hn is trying to do is unify the different solutions in a single physical layer,” says Rob Tobias, director of product marketing at Silicon Image.”What LiquidHD does is add the final piece of the puzzle, where you need the protocols to enable all these devices to talk to one another.”The company is working with consumer electronics partners this year to incorporate its technology and expects them to make their first product announcements at CES in 2010.

690;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2009-01-04T19:24:57Z;Surfers should pay congestion charges;;Does it make sense to ban businesses from charging higher prices to some customers for giving them preferential treatment over others?That idea lies at the heart of Barack Obama’s promised policy towards the internet, a medium that had more than a passing role in his election to the White House. It is a proposal that should be dropped from the new administration’s agenda as soon as decently possible. Other countries where the issue has started to raise its head, such as the UK, should also tread carefully before attempting their own regulation.The issue in question is a central one for the information age. It concerns the rights and obligations of the companies that run the communications networks which, collectively, make up the internet. Should they be permitted to charge higher prices for giving priority treatment to some of the traffic they carry? And conversely, should they be allowed to downgrade the importance of other, lower-paying traffic, or even refuse to carry it?Under the banner of “network neutrality”, Google, Ebay and other internet companies fought this battle on Capitol Hill three years ago, to no avail. With little evidence of immediate harm, Congress chose not to regulate. At the same time AT&T, the company which had been agitating most aggressively to introduce discriminatory pricing, agreed to a two-year standstill. That period is now up, and the supposedly internet-savvy Obama administration has vowed to make network neutrality a central plank of its communications policy.In essence, the proposal would forbid communications companies from selling access to special fast lanes on the internet, while also outlawing bans on any type of internet traffic: let everyone on to the road and, if that results in congestion, make them all sit in the same traffic jams. That way, the networks remain open for all users on the same terms, and the network operators do not have an incentive to drive up demand for premium services by limiting capacity. Companies such as Google also claim that the next time two students come up with a great idea for changing the world they will get the chance to compete on equal terms with even the richest companies.This idea is well-meaning but misguided. It prevents the market from rationing a scarce resource. It ignores the fact that, in many industries, companies provide tiered levels of service without unfairly discriminating against certain classes of customer: economic self-interest leads them to try to maximise returns from each group. Also, it is worth noting that the supposed level playing field of the internet is a myth: rich companies already pay to have their services delivered faster, for instance by buying the services of a specialised “content delivery network” such as Akamai.A better option would be for politicians to leave well alone, particularly since legislation in such a fast-changing area could have unintended consequences. Some safeguards may well be needed in two important areas, but these should be left to regulators like the Federal Communications Commission in the US and Ofcom in the UK.One is to prevent network operators from deliberately slowing or blocking the traffic of particular internet services. The FCC has already shown itself up to this task, taking on cable company Comcast recently over its restrictions on file-swapping service BitTorrent. Anti-trust laws also act as a back-stop to prevent this sort of discrimination.A second area for regulatory attention will be to ensure that the quality of the internet’s “slow lane” does not deteriorate. Competition between broadband networks is the best answer, and the arrival of new high-speed wireless technologies such as WiMax should help. In the meantime, regulators need to keep a close eye on network performance: any generalised deterioration will give politicians the excuse they have been looking for to intervene.
691;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Clearwire plans push under ‘Clear’ brand;;Clearwire, the US-based 4G wireless broadband pioneer formed through the merger of Sprint Nextel and Clearwire’s WiMax interests, will launch a range of services next year under the “Clear” brand name, Ben Wolff, chief executive of the new venture, said on Monday.Mr Wolff was speaking during a conference call with investors following the completion of the $14.5bn merger transaction put together by Mr Wolff and Sprint Nextel’s chief executive, Dan Hesse, as part of a strategy to build a nationwide 4G network using WiMax technology.The deal, which closed on Friday and confounded sceptics, is seen as significantly increasing the chances that WiMax will emerge alongside another technology called LTE (Long Term Evolution) as one of the technologies that will power the next generation of high-speed wireless data networks.Sprint Nextel, the struggling third-largest US mobile operator, will retain a majority stake in the new company.Other investors include group of leading US cable TV companies including Time Warner Cable and Comcast and other technology investors including Intel, the US chipmaker, and Google, the internet search and advertising giant, which have together invested $3.2bn in the venture.Mr Wolff said the bulk of the new funds will be used to build the new network which has already launched operations under the old Xohm brand name in the Baltimore, Maryland area.The new company is expected to begin the roll-out of the network and services in additional metropolitan areas over the next 12 months and Mr Wolff said the company plans to upgrade most of the existing 46 Clearwire markets to WiMax next year.He said the new network will be an “open” standards-based network that will enable customers to use any WiMax device.He added that Clearwire’s cable partners are expected to offer wireless services under their own brands using the Clearwire network.US cable companies have aggressively rolled out broadband telephony services over the past two years as part of their ‘Triple Play’ bundled voice, video and data offerings and now see the Clearwire network as a way to add mobile services.Time Warner, which invested $550m in the venture, confirmed yesterday that it plans to offer limited wireless services in late-2009 or early-2010 using the Clearwire network
692;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-11-28T22:21:00Z;Eros shoots high on Bollywood appeal;;Eros, the world’s biggest distributor of Bollywood films, bucked the gloom in the media industry with a doubling of profits on the back of video-on-demand subscriptions and DVD sales.Kishore Lulla, chief executive, said over the next 12 months Eros would have to be “cautious” but would see growth from its digital and television syndication businesses.Eros, which listed on Aim in 2006, said pre-tax profits for the six months to September rose from $13.6m to $29.7m (£19.3m). Sales from its digital and home entertainment business rose threefold to $29.6m, on the back of Eros’s subscription video-on-demand service that was launched on Comcast cable systems and has been replicated on Cablevision, Cox and Time Warner platforms.Television syndication revenues increased from $6.6m to $20.1m following a host of deals with Sony Entertainment Television, Inx Network, Viacom and Channel 4. Mr Lulla said Eros’s 2007 release Om Shanti Om was now the highest-grossing Hindi language film of all time, taking $45m at the box office for a cost of about $10m.“We have efficiently invested in content, distribution, joint ventures and alliances and have achieved the first phase of content consolidation ahead of our initial expectations,” Mr Lulla said.Eros has invested more than $300m in a portfolio of 1,900 films that generated $19m of revenues. Bollywood was becoming more attractive to wider audiences, Eros said, with Poland, Kuwait, Russia and France representing growth markets.“This is family-orientated escapism cinema. Poland alone generated $1.3m in revenues in the second quarter alone,” said Mr Lulla.Eros has bank loans of $100m that mature in 2012 and in September had $52m in cash. The shares rose 2½p to close at 167½p.
693;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-11-25T00:14:04Z;Buying Twitter in $500m or less;;Twitter’s $500m takeover talks with Facebook may baffle its non-users. While Twitter has a devoted community of millions, sceptics have dismissed its 140-character “micro-blog” posts as nothing more than Facebook’s existing status update feature. Both allow people to answer Twitter’s central question: What are you doing?For Twitter’s co-founder, Biz Stone, the answer seems to be “quite a lot” towards making a greater distinction between a feature and a business.Speaking during the annual Silicon Valley comes to Oxford event at Said Business School, Mr Stone refused to discuss the Facebook reports. But he did say that Twitter has finally moved on from fixing its frequent service interruptions. Twitter is now looking at how to create a richer experience, to win over those sceptics – and start making money.Until recently, bringing new features to Twitter has taken second place to keeping the service online as it attracted new users. Innovation has largely come from third parties, who have used its API (which allows developers access to the Twitter back-end) to create new applications to post to Twitter, track contacts or display posts on maps. Such has been their success that Twitter gets 20 times more traffic through its API than to its own site.“Now that we have stabilised the technology, we are finally able to start focusing on creating a sustainable company,” Mr Stone tells the FT.Twitter will be “iterating on revenue products”, he says – trying several approaches to see what works. It’s a philosophy that stems from his time at Google, and also from Twitter’s own gestation as an accidental by-product of Odeo, an erstwhile podcasting company.Twitter’s first commercial targets are companies who have set up Twitter accounts – such as Comcast, JetBlue and Dunkin Donuts - which they use for a combination of marketing and customer support. Mr Stone hopes Twitter can “help [brands] to do it better… This is something we want to move towards because it creates value for our users, commercial account holders and potentially for us.”Twitter has raised three rounds of funding and grown to 26 employees but is yet to generate any revenues. “We aren’t worried about it,” says Mr Stone. “We think there is a lot of opportunity there, we think of it as an opportunity not a problem. We have enough money in the bank to be able to work on doing this for the amount of time we need to…. We are cautious in this [economic] environment but we are not freaking out. In the third round of funding, we sensed something was coming and said we had better be safe and raise enough money to do the things we need to do.”One of those aims is to grow the network tenfold in the next year. So Twitter is working to improve its user interface, which has evolved little from the basic sketch that sparked the idea in 2006.It is adding search and links to popular topics to Twitter’s start page, to make it easier for new users to understand. “Half the people that come to Twitter say: ‘What is this?’” admits Mr Stone.Twitter’s ability to spot trends in its thousands of simultaneous discussions was demonstrated during the US elections, he says. A special Twitter site brought together posts from the candidates, lists of the most popular topics, and charts tracking spikes in Twitter discussions about particular topics as they were raised in presidential debates.By adding information about global trends and local topics of discussion, Mr Stone hopes to “convert the naysayers who look at an individual [post] saying ‘I’m having toast and Marmite‘ and say: ‘Who cares?’”

As the session drew to a close, the market fell by a jaw-dropping 5 per cent within 10 minutes.The S&P 500 finished 1.1 per cent lower at 930.09 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.8 per cent at 8,990.96. The Nasdaq Composite index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,657.21.Contributing to the confusion, Dow Jones reported that General Electric, which has not provided guidance for 2009, aimed to keep profits next year at the same level as this year even if revenue declined by between 10 and 15 per cent. The shares closed down 1.5 per cent to $19.20. After the close, GE said the report was “out of context” and “inaccurate”.Observers were divided as to the impact of the Fed’s 50 basis point cut, which was already priced in to the equity market.“What’s really driving the market are the other programmes that are breaking the log jams,” said Doug Roberts, strategist at Channel Capital Research, with reference to government measures to shore up the banking sector.Other recent monetary policy interventions had done little to help sentiment, but Joe Cusick, market analyst at optionsXpress, said: “This one’s a little bit different.”Fears of widespread financial collapse that trumped all other concerns had dissipated, he added, and a move to lower the cost of borrowing was likely now to have a tangible effect.Procter & Gamble lost 3.5 per cent to $60.99 after the consumer products group met analyst earnings estimates but still lowered the bottom end of its full-year earnings guidance. Citigroup maintained its “hold” rating on the stock.Kraft and Kellogg fell 1.4 per cent to $28.47 and 1.3 per cent to $50.02, respectively, even after price increases helped the food groups beat forecasts.Telecoms was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500, down 3.3 per cent overall. Investors were concerned by a sharp drop in basic video subscribers at Comcast, which dropped 9.9 per cent to $15.28, although the group reported better-than-expected earnings and reiterated its full-year outlook. Smaller rival Qwest slid 7.7 per cent to $2.40 after lowering its guidance for the year.Motorola fell 6.5 per cent to $5.46 ahead of results due on Friday. Reports said that the phone group would streamline its cellphone division and cut thousands of jobs.Energy was the biggest sectoral winner, up 3.6 per cent as oil prices edged higher. Solar energy stocks rallied after First Solar, which gained 1.5 per cent to $115.75, entered the residential market with a deal to supply modules to SolarCity, an installation company.Education stocks rose, helped by better-than-expected figures from Apollo Group, the parent company of the University of Phoenix, which rallied 10.4 per cent to $65.01.Aetna tumbled 8.1 per cent to $25.55 after the health insurer trimmed its forecast for the year. Fears over the prospect of writedowns and a possible capital-raising have driven the sector down sharply in recent months.Corning fell 8 per cent to $10.51 after the glass and ceramics maker missed analysts’ estimates on lower demand for televisions.General Motors rose 8.2 per cent to $6.76 after Reuters reported that the car group had resolved “major issues” with Chrysler owner Cerberus Capital Management over a potential merger.Visa edged up 1.4 per cent to $50.69. After the bell, the credit card group cut its annual revenue growth target, citing a challenging economy and the shares lost 1.2 per cent in after-hours trade.Among a host of insurers to post results after the bell, Prudential Financialdisclosed it swung to a quarterly loss. The shares were down 3.3 per cent at $35.25 and remained flat in after-hours trade.In addition to the rate cut, traders took comfort from further signs of easing in money markets and data showing that durable goods orders rose unexpectedly last month.
695;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Sprint receives interest in iDen;;Dan Hesse, Sprint Nextel’s chief executive, confirmed on Wednesday that the struggling US mobile network operator had received “significant interest” from potential acquirers of its Nextel iDen unit, but also cast doubt on the prospects for any deal that would require the purchaser to raise additional capital.Sprint, the third largest US mobile network operator, paid $36bn for Nextel Communications and its iDen ‘push-to-talk’ network in 2005 but has struggled since then to integrate the Nextel operations.Speculation about a possible sale or spin-off of the Nextel unit first surfaced a year ago after Gary Forsee, Sprint’s former chief executive and architect of the merger, was forced out by the board.Most recently there has been speculation that Nextel might be sold to a consortium including private equity interests for about $5bn although most analysts have suggested such a deal was unlikely in the current credit environment.On Wednesday, Mr Hesse acknowledged that while there has been considerable interest in the asset, a sale was not the company’s only option and that any deal requiring a suitor to raise capital would be difficult in current market conditions.“There is no question that if a bidder was relying on financing that’s become more difficult,” he said.However, despite the credit crunch, Mr Hesse said he remained optimistic about closing a separate deal with Clearwire, the independent WiMax operator, by the end of the year. He said the venture partners were still “all systems go”.Sprint and Clearwire announced plans earlier this year to fold their WiMax operations into a new company which will also be called Clearwire but will be 51 per cent owned by Sprint Nextel.Under the agreement, which has yet to receive regulatory approval, a group of investors led by Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Intel and Google plan to invest an additional $3.2bn in the venture.Mr Hesse was speaking at the launch of the company’s Xohm 4G wireless mobile broadband service.Sprint Nextel and its partners plan to roll out the new high-speed network based on WiMax technology across the US over the next few years.
696;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;FCC should leave net neutrality to anti-trust courts;;US regulators have dropped the net neutrality bomb on Comcast, the country’s largest cable operator that supplies broadband service to14.4m households. The Federal Communications Commission ruled in August that the firm had secretly throttled certain “peer-to-peer” applications, such as Bit Torrent, that gobble bandwidth.The motive for the scheme, said the FCC, was not to optimise spectrum sharing but to “unduly squelch” an “open and accessible internet,” excluding products competing with Comcast’s own video-on-demand (VOD). Finding the cable operator a bad actor, it ordered the company to abandon its existing practices and to better disclose its network management methods to customers.It has already begun to do so – and the outrage in some quarters has only increased. Comcast, soon to be followed by other broadband providers, has announced it will levy explicit bandwidth limits on its subscribers. The days of “all you can eat” internet access are falling behind us. Not exactly what the plea for network neutrality regulation was said to be aiming for.The case for disclosure is secure, but the wild punch tossed by the term “unduly squelch” conveys the flailing spirit of this regulatory improv. In cable broadband networks a tiny minority of bandwidth hogs can clog links. This congestion destroys value for all users, even the hogs. Pricing or other rationing devices avert this tragedy. Networks, including those of non-profits with no commercial motive to squelch, widely take such measures.Regulators assert that Comcast’s methods were clumsy and inappropriate. This is exactly why we want well-informed customers to make choices. Accurate disclosure was already the law.But rather than enforce such rules, the FCC launched regulatory attack by asserting that Comcast’s network management choices evinced anti-competitive intent. The operator disrupted access to video streams to protect Comcast’s own cable products. The assertion was supported by nary a wisp of evidence or analysis in the 34-page FCC Order. Were the regulators the least bit serious, they would have seen their rationale for intervention as worthy of support. Surely, it needs some.Comcast, like other cable operators, has invested billions of dollars to extend capacious broadband conduits to millions over the past decade. This internet access service is offered to just that 40 per cent of US households that can buy Comcast video – serving up a fast gateway for “cannibalisation” via linkstopping out at 15 MBPS down/5 MBPS up. At first blush, perhaps one blush more than what the FCC has given the matter, this appears a curious strategy for squelching video rivals.The FCC writes that video-on-demand is the “particular competitive threat” which Comcast fears. But the company counts high-speed data revenue of over $7bn per year, a quarter of the company’s total. VOD brings in an estimated $350m. Is the government’s theory that Comcast materially degrades the broadband subscriber’s experience to protect revenues only 1/20th as large? Not arithmetically impossible. But the story is of interest.Perhaps after a federal court orders it (Comcast has already filed a suit that even staunch net neutrality proponents believe will overturn the order on jurisdictional grounds), the FCC will produce one. They should explain how, with cable operators free to set prices, they gain by thwarting their customers. Why not free them up and simply charge to capture lost VOD demand? Some potential reasons lurk, but not likely compelling. One clue: were the FCC holding such evidence or arguments, we would presumably have seen them.While many net neutrality advocates praised the FCC’s ruling (Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig told the Commission that it had made it “clear that those who wish to profit from the internet do so without harming the internet”), others are howling over the quick market migration to data caps. While Comcast’s 250 GB per month limit is loose – the average Comcast customer uses only 2-3 GBs per month – “a line has been crossed,” writes industry analyst Craig Moffett. Other cable operators are reported to be following.When one rationing scheme is excluded, others emerge. Download limits, upload limits and tiered service pricing are the most obvious. Lost upgrades or build-outs, where investors simply fail to commit more assets, are potentially unseen carnage. To craft better rules for the market, policymakers must understand that options have prices and rules have consequences.The FCC ignored these realities. The venerable Alfred Kahn, professor emeritus at Cornell and the dean of US regulatory economists, anticipated this result in arguing that net neutrality rules are best left to antitrust courts. Such proceedings, imperfect though they are, require evidence, economic analysis, and a verdict on consumer welfare. Noted telecommunications attorney Jon Nuechterlein’s recent article nicely explains why such standards are preferable to ad hoc agency rulings. As we stumble forth in the mist of duly and unduly squelches, this argument will become more and more compelling.The writer is professor of law economics at George Mason University, where he is director of the information economy project at the National Center for Technology and Law
697;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Telephone and internet boost for Comcast;;"Big customer gains for its broadband internet and internet telephony services helped Comcast, the largest US cable-television operator, boost second-quarter profit by 7.5 per cent. Net income increased to $632m, or 21 cents a share, from $588m, or 19 cents, a year earlier.The Philadelphia-based cable giant, which is locked in a fierce battle for voice, video and data subscribers with telecommunications companies, added 320,000 digital cable customers, 278,000 broadband customers and 555,000 new customers for its broadband phone service during the quarter.In contrast, AT&T and Verizon Communications, the two largest US telecommunications groups which both compete directly with Comcast, reported sharp residential-line losses during the latest quarter.Comcast sales gained 11 per cent to $8.55bn, in line with expectations. Excluding one-time items, profit totalled 21 cents while free cash flow, a closely-watched measure in the cable industry, more than tripled to $1.16bn, topping analysts’ estimates.Average revenue per customer rose 8.6 per cent to $109.66 as it focused on selling ""triple play"" service bundles, combining its services.The company, which expanded profits in part by throttling back capital spending by 19 per cent to $1.3bn, reiterated its forecast for growth of 8 per cent to 10 per cent in revenue and operating cash flow for the year.Capital spending will fall to about 18 per cent of sales while free cash flow will increase at least 20 per cent from the $2.3bn reported last year.Steve Burke, Comcast’s chief operating officer, told analysts on a conference call that the company’s faster broadband internet access speeds are helping to win over phone company DSL customers, particularly those who use bandwidth-hungry applictions such as online video services.He added that the company is on target to add more than 2m internet phone subscribers by the end of the year. It currently has 5.6m digital telephony subscribers, ranking it as the fourth largest US residential phone provider.“The free cash flow result is spectacular,"" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co in New York. He expects the stock to outperform the market and doesn’t own it. “Comcast’s capital spending was very restrained, and that leaves them ample headroom in the second half to meet or beat their free cash flow guidance for the full year.""Comcast rose 82 cents, or 4.3 per cent, to $20 in early Nasdaq trading. The shares have gained 5 per cent this year before Wednesday.The cable company is expected to be censured by the Federal Communications Commission on Friday. The federal regulator is expected to rule that Comcast violated federal rules by purposely slowing the transmission of BitTorrent video files shared among users."
698;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-07-23T15:34:42Z;On a Clearwire, you can see everything;;"In May, mobile carrier Sprint entered a venture with wireless broadband start-up Clearwire and a corporate cadre that includes Google and cable operators Comcast, Time Warner and Bright House. They joined previous investors Intel, Motorola, Bell Canada, cellular billionaire Craig McCaw and share buyers in Clearwire’s 2007 initial public offering to give the company, with just 500,000 subscribers, a market value of $14bn – dwarfing the rest of Sprint, which has 47m subscribers.To most, it is a yawn. Not even techies took much notice. Sprint and Clearwire, having bandwidth in the 2.5 GHz band (not far from PCS frequencies), formed a national network powered by a consortium of service, equipment and application suppliers. Ho hum. Business as usual.Ordinary – and sensational. Clearwire-Sprint-Intel-Google-Comcast-TimeWarner-McCaw blasts away barriers to broadband and a flock of public policy myths. Stories about the coming era of municipal wi-fi, the obsolescence of property rights to radio spectrum and the desperate need for “net neutrality” fall to pieces. For years these tales were spun from the triumphal assertion that the “innovation commons” of the post-internet economy changed everything. The “Chicago School” tools to prosperity – establish property rights, deregulate, let market competition rip – were dusty relics of a bygone era.So broadband was a crummy cable-DSL duopoly, and local governments’ wireless networks would fix that. Mobile telephony was a crummy oligopoly, and more unlicensed spectrum – as used for wi-fi and cordless phones – would fix that. And to protect it all, the internet’s “open end-to-end” environment needed some regulatory muscle: rules prohibiting discrimination by internet service providers, control freaks who, left to their grabby impulses, would increasingly squeeze customer choices. Network neutrality rules would fix that.But here’s “New Clearwire”. The chief advocates of muni networks are shelling out to build private networks, instead; the lobbyists for more unlicensed spectrum are paying to purchase licensed spectrum; the champions of net neutrality are getting preferential non-neutral customer access by buying the internet service provider.Municipal Wi-Fi Adieu. When local government networks were the rage, circa 2003, their loudest corporate backer was Google. Broadband for all via “free” unlicensed spectrum, smart radios and just a gentle nudge from City Hall. Politicians from Philadephia to Portland drank the Kool-Aid. But Google just paid $500m to jump to the Clearwire ship. The change in strategy speaks volumes: municipal wi-fi is considered small opportunity for Google and no threat to Clearwire.Fleeing the “Spectrum Commons”. Five years ago, Intel was pressuring US regulators for more unlicensed bands. It won – the Federal Communications Commission dumped hundreds of MHz into the market. The bump was little noticed – short-range apps continued to work, but not much else developed. Meanwhile, wireless phone networks – providing wide area, mobile service – were booming. But regulators held off new allocations for a decade, starving the sector just when it was upgrading to high-speed data networks.New Clearwire boasts WiMAX, “wi-fi on steroids”, as its technological innovation, but note: this WiMAX runs on licensed frequencies. That is an economic choice, not a technical one. Only with the control afforded by exclusivity will these companies invest in the networks that, they hope, will make consumers sing. The “spectrum commons”? Been there, done that. This wireless broadband innovation aims to do what no one has done in unlicensed – and betting $14bn on it.Net Neutrality Not. Clearwire consortium members are not passive investors. Buying in, they become network friends with benefits. The cable ops will retail service. McCaw’s NextNet is the lead gear maker. Motorola supplies handsets. Intel’s chips are plugged in. And Google’s search engine gets its own button on the phones, a cute efficiency copied from the wildly popular DoCoMo network in Japan. If the NTT model, where the carrier extracts payment from mobile apps for a preferred spot on the wireless web, is “open” – then “open” all capitalists must be. Richly, NTT is a member in good standing in Google’s Open Handset Alliance.New Clearwire tells us that a “fully-open, third pipe” has arrived in the broadband market – and their corporate network, crafted with exclusive spectrum and preferential access, and gobs of private capital – will deliver it. That, truly, is a great leap forward. Thank goodness for the “innovation commons”. The Chicago School could not have said it better.The writer is professor of law economics at George Mason University, where he is director of the information economy project at the National Center for Technology and Law"
699;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-06-08T22:32:35Z;Media groups on lookout for next big thing;;Bigpoint’s sell-out at a rich multiple is another sign of the boom in online gaming. Yet the deal also marks a coming-out party of sorts for Peacock Equity, a venture capital fund launched a year ago by General Electric siblings NBC Universal and GE Commercial Finance.Peacock made a modest debut last June with a $3m investment in Adify, a start-up that helps media companies create online advertising networks. Less than a year later, that bet paid off handsomely when Adify was sold to Cox Communications for $300m.Bolstered by that success, GE has since give Peacock authority to exceed its original $250m ceiling. The Bigpoint investment reflects those growing ambitions. It is far larger than the fund’s original deals, which ranged from $5m to $15m. It is also the first that gives Peacock a controlling stake in a company and is its first international deal.“Our mandate is to invest in spaces that are in some way strategic to the platform of NBC,” Thomas Byrne, Peacock’s managing director, explained.Peacock is one of several venture funds launched over the years by media and technology companies such as Disney, Time Warner, Hearst, Comcast and Intel, among others. The idea is that such funds can provide their parent companies with access to innovative ideas and products – something that has become particularly important for traditional media companies as they adapt to the internet era.“They are kind of the eyes and the ears in the market for [these companies] for new technology and new ideas,” said Dan Nova, managing general partner at Highland Capital Partners, a venture capital firm that has invested alongside Disney’s Steamboat Ventures, one of the best-known corporate funds.For a start-up, such well-connected investors can open the doors to business relations with larger parent companies. One Highland Capital investment, Quigo, a contextual advertising company, sealed deals with Disney’s ESPN division after Steamboat joined its funding. Quigo was subsequently sold to AOL last year for more than $300m.Hoping to replicate that success, Peacock executives travelled to Silicon Valley soon after the fund’s launch to introduce themselves to venture capital firms all along Sand Hill Road.The fund has since invested in nine companies, all of which now have operational relationships with its corporate parent. NBC, for example, has the right to sell ads through IGA Worldwide, a Peacock start-up that places ads in video games.Such funds sometimes stumble. The biggest knock against them is that making strategic investments is not always compatible with the goal of achieving competitive returns and vice versa. Some start-ups also prefer not to be formally aligned with one media company for fear of prejudicing other potential customers.Peacock executives believe that their joint-venture structure provides an added layer of financial discipline and that their corporate association is more a benefit than a burden to entrepreneurs.“They understand that we are relationship-driven, and that our focus is to assist in the growth of the underlying company,” Mr Byrne said.

Since then, it has concentrated on distributing films made by other companies, such as The Weinstein Company, rather than investing in its own production.However, it has yet to score a significant hit and is keen to bolster its library with new movies that it will own outright and be able to exploit in international markets.MGM and Relativity Media - which is backed by Elliot Associates, a New York-based hedge fund - are now in advanced talks on a deal that would see Relativity co-finance the production of a several new MGM releases, according to people familiar with the situation.These films would include the as yet untitled James Bond film and the big-screen adaptation of The Hobbit. MGM owns the largest film library in Hollywood and is also keen to revive franchises such as Fame, Robocop and Death Wish.Relativity declined to comment. MGM also declined to comment on the negotiations but said it was stepping up its film production efforts. “We’re moving forward with plans to enhance and expand our production slate and this will include additional financing,” said a spokesman. He added the studio would announce its financing plans “in the near future”.Mary Parent, one of Hollywood’s best-known production executives, was appointed in March to run production at the studio. Since joining she has aggressively acquired new properties, buying the rights to The Matarese Circle, which MGM will adapt from Robert Ludlum’s novel.Relativity has arranged billion dollar-financing deals for most of Hollywood’s big studios, including Universal Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment. But the company is increasingly financing and investing in its own releases.It has a two-picture deal with MGM although the proposal being discussed would extend this arrangement to include the company’s ‘tent pole’ releases, such as Bond. The co-financing talks with Relativity come several months after the credit crunch forced MGM to suspend a proposed $1bn film franchise fund.The company had been in negotiations about the fund with Goldman Sachs and several other banks but the plans were put on ice as market conditions deteriorated.MGM has released about 40 films made by other companies since it was taken private but has produced only two: Rocky Balboa, which was a modest success, and Lions For Lambs, made by its United Artists division. The film had an all-star cast including Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep, but was a flop at the box office.

The service has yet to generate revenues, but could become a platform for mobile advertising.“We are reinventing the address book,” said Tommy Ahlers, Zyb’s chief executive. “It’s the most used application on any mobile phone but it hasn’t changed in 10 years.”Zyb has about 250,000 users of its service round the world.The deal marks the first such acquisition for Pieter Knook, head of Vodafone’s newly created Internet Services division – part of its “total communications” strategy to provide services beyond the mobile phone. Mr Knook was Microsoft’s senior vice-president for mobile before his appointment at Vodafone earlier this year.The deal follows the acquisition this week by Comcast, a US cable operator, of Plaxo, a web-based company seeking to build a social network round its users’ address books.
702;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Cablevision plans wireless broadband network;;Cablevision Systems, the New York-based cable operator, plans to spend $350m over the next two years to build a wireless broadband service based upon WiFi technology.The announcement follows Comcast and Time Warner’s plans to invest in a nationwide 4G network that Sprint Nextel and Clearwire plan to build using a longer range, higher speed technology called WiMax.The Cablevision, run by the Dolan family, on Thursday reported an unexpected rise in cable subscribers in the first quarter but posted a net loss of $31.6m, partly caused by a $105m loss on derivative contracts.Sales rose by 10 per cent to $1.72bn helped by surprisingly strong basic video customer additions. The company adding 2,000 basic video subscribers and 93,000 phone customers.Tom Rutledge, Cablevision’s chief operating officer, said the new network would be accessible using WiFi-enabled portable devices including Apple’s iPhone, WiFi- enabled smartphones and laptops. “Ultimately it will be a mobile voice-capable network,” he said.Mr Rutledge said the network would be accessible for free to existing customers but that as average customer revenues and cash flows rise the company would benefit by offering a more comprehensive service for customers. “Creating this value proposition for customers will enhance our service and cement our relationship with customers for the long haul,” he said.Cablevision said it has been testing the new WiFi service, which will offer speeds of up to 1.5Mbps, comparable to traditional wireless networks, in small areas across its 3.1m strong customer base.Cablevision’s stock has fallen abou t 15 per cent since late February amid speculation the company will spend its cash to buy companies that are less profitable than its main business.On Thursday however Michael Huseby, chief financial officer, said the company plans to be “opportunistic” about potential deals while James Dolan, Cablevision’s chief executive, told analysts that a special dividend or stock buy-back was “certainly a possibility.”Cablevision is bidding against Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp for Newsday, Tribune’s New York-based newspaper.
703;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-05-07T21:46:05Z;Sprint and Clearwire;;The cats have been herded. A “who’s who” list of top US technology and media companies are joining forces to funnel $3.2bn into Clearwire, an ambitious next-generation wireless network venture. In an industry in which new technologies need to win big to justify their enormous fixed costs, the venture’s partners will have to retract their claws and put in every effort to make WiMax technology work.The deal will give Sprint and Clearwire, along with partners Comcast, Intel, Time Warner Cable and Google, a chance to control their wireless destiny by coming to market first. Sprint and Clearwire, the biggest owners of US 2.5GHz spectrum, needed each other to go nationwide. Comcast and Time Warner want to regain momentum in their war against AT&T and Verizon, which plan to build a 4th-generation wireless network using a different technology. Intel has placed a big bet on WiMax. And Google, for a relatively minimal price, is buying access to the growing mobile web market. Clearwire’s ability to use Sprint’s existing infrastructure should help speed development.But the tie-up has all the risks of a private equity “club” deal on steroids. Clearwire’s 13-member board will be stacked with high-profile executives who have various priorities. Clearwire’s aggressive push to get to market first may lead to mistakes that Verizon and AT&T can later avoid. And Sprint, which will own 51 per cent of the new company’s equity, has problems. Its merger with Nextel has turned it into the wireless industry’s O-negative universal blood donor, bleeding market share to all of its rivals.AT&T and Verizon will now have to check their own strategies, as will companies not included in this deal, such as Yahoo, AOL and the satellite TV providers. But if Clearwire gets bogged down in the details and risks inherent in launching WiMax, its headstart could be whittled down quickly.Post and read comments on this Lex
704;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-05-01T20:45:37Z;Wall St rises as tech stocks rally;;Wall Street stocks powered ahead on Thursday driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average, above 13,000 for the first time since early January after a rally in financial and technology stocks offset an earnings disappointment from ExxonMobil and a sagging energy sector.Analysts said that the vices of commodities rather than the virtues of the banking and technology sectors were behind the unlikely surge.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research said: “It seems that money is rotating from the previous leaders – commodity stocks, gold, agricultural stocks – into the laggards.”“ExxonMobil’s ‘poor’ earnings hurt oil stocks, and oil prices have also come off highs, so money moved out of the sector into financials and tech stocks.”An index of financial stocks added 3.9, its best one-day gain in a month, taking the sector to its highest level since February.The energy sector suffered however retreating 2.2 per cent as the dollar rallied and commodities prices slipped.A broad upswing carried eight out of 10 key sectors into positive territory and lifted the S&P 500 1.7 per cent to 1,409.33, its biggest gain in almost two weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 13,010, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.8 per cent to 2,465.76.On Wednesday the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate but an equivocal accompanying statement knocked equity markets.On Thursday began in similarly downbeat fashion after Exxon and weak employment data showing soaring first-time benefit claims initially weighed on the market. Still, an Institute for Supply Management index showing that manufacturing activity was weak but steady in April, helped calm nerves.Merrill Lynch was one of the leading beneficiaries from the volte face, jumping 5.1 per cent to $52.39 after the head of a Kuwait sovereign wealth fund said it may increase its holding in the investment bank.Comments overnight by Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, who said that the credit crisis was closer to the end than the beginning, supported the rally. Lehman Brothers rose 6.1 per cent to $46.93, Citigroup added 4.2 per cent to $25.99 and Bank of America gained 4.9 per cent to $39.39.CIT Group jumped 10.1 per cent to $11.99 on speculation that the independent finance company, which has been badly hit by credit market turmoil, would be sold.MBIA jumped 12.9 per cent to $11.74 after Jay Brown, its chief executive, told shareholders that the the embattled bond insurer, has enough capital to retain its triple A rating.Technology stocks were particularly strong last month after a number of industry heavyweights reported better-than-expected results and that trend continued on Thursday.The sector rose 3.2 per cent, thanks in part to Symantec. The maker of security software jumped 12.3 per cent to $19.34 after it said fourth-quarter profit tripled. Semiconductor companies also contributed to the rally after new data showed chip sales rose in March and a handful of decent earnings reports boosted sentiment. Intel rose 4.6 per cent to $23.29 while AMD added 4.4 per cent to $6.22.ExxonMobil took some of the shine of equity markets after it reported massive profits but undershot expectations super-charged by record high oil prices. Shares in the energy group fell 3.6 per cent to $89.70, while Chevron slipped 1.3 per cent to $94.94.Materials stocks also performed poorly. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold slumped 5.1 per cent to $107.96 while Nucor fell 2.2 per cent to $73.82.Larry Smith, chairman and chief investment officer of Third Wave Global Investors, said: “We may be seeing the end of the commodity bull run. There has been a lot of speculative money, some of it from hedge funds, chasing up prices. When prices stop going up that money will go away and we could see a big reversal.”Energy’s discomfort proved a boon for consumer discretionary stocks, which rose 3.3 per cent – their best showing in a month.Comcast, the largest cable operator in the US, was among the top performers, cheering investors with on-target first-quarter results.

705;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-04-21T22:57:32Z;Vuze finds users choking on bandwidth throttling;;Vuze, the online video service that uses peer-to-peer technology to distribute its content, has come up with hard data suggesting “bandwidth throttling” is more widespread than previously thought.Some internet service providers (ISPs) have not taken kindly to surges in P2P traffic on their network, with the file exchanges consuming large amounts of bandwidth. Although consumers can argue they have paid for unlimited bandwidth with their monthly subscriptions, companies such as Comcast have used techniques that disrupt P2P traffic and have become the subject of complaints to the Federal Communications Commission in the US.Vuze made available a software plug-in to users in January that looks for “reset packets”, used to interrupt a network connection, and sends such information back to Vuze for collation.Today it released its initial findings based on results from 8,000 users around the world.Comcast tops the table, with one of its networks interrupting 24 per cent of connections. Ten other Comcast networks figure in the top 20. Canada’s Cogeco is fourth with a 19 per cent interruption rate and others with high rates include Emirates Internet, Cablevision, BellSouth, AOL and Tiscali UK.For almost-interruption-free file downloads, the best bet seems to be Telecom Italia France with a 2.5 per cent rate.Vuze’s conclusion: “We believe that there is sufficient data to suggest that network management practices that ‘throttle’ internet traffic are widespread.”The company has written to Cablevision, Cogeco, BellSouth (now owned by AT&T) and AOL asking them to “clarify their broadband management practices in the interest of transparency for consumers.”
706;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-03-19T23:23:42Z;Wide-awake Webheads to take on Comcast;;No one should be nodding off when the Federal Communications Commission holds a hearing at Stanford University next month into “broadband network management practices.”Comcast can expect to hear some strong criticisms of its “practices” from technologists and Web activists in the heart of Silicon Valley with the FCC just announcing that a second “field hearing” is needed on the subject.At the first, at Harvard University on the East coast last month, the cable operator and internet service provider paid people on the street to take up seats, meaning many members of the public who might have wanted to have a say on its practices were kept out of the packed hall.Comcast said the seat-fillers were holding places for their own staff arriving later, but a Harvard administrator said they remained in their places. Some even fell asleep (pictured) during the hearing.Comcast is the subject of complaints from online video companies such as Vuze and activists Public Knowledge and Free Press of the SavetheInternet.com coalition. They claim it is blocking peer-to-peer traffic and limiting the delivery of rival video-on-demand services on its network.Comcast says it is managing its network and P2P traffic may be less timely.Free Press has welcomed the new hearing: “The threat posed by would-be gatekeepers like Comcast is very real and getting worse,” said Josh Silver, executive director.“Open internet policies are urgently needed.”
707;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-02-27T23:33:16Z;News Corp and Liberty seal deal on DirectTV;;Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp announced on Wednesday the completion of a roughly $11bn deal that gives Liberty Media control of the DirecTV satellite television business.The transaction, approved by News Corp shareholders last April, allowed Mr Murdoch to maintain his grip on the media conglomerate in the midst of a challenge from Liberty and John Malone, its chairman.As part of the deal, Liberty agreed to exchange the 16 per cent stake it had built up in News Corp for the company’s 41 per cent holding of DirecTV, three regional cable networks and $625m in cash.The deal was years in the making and then bogged down amid regulatory review, at one point leading Mr Murdoch to refer to the matter as a “cloud” over the company.It won approval from the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday. The deal was particularly noteworthy because Mr Murdoch and News Corp had spent years trying to gain control of DirecTV.The satellite television business has nearly 17m subscribers in the US and 5m more in Latin America.In a recent interview with BusinessWeek, Mr Malone indicated that he planned to strike alliances with EchoStar, another satellite television operator, and telecoms companies to challenge cable groups such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable.The transaction has closed when both moguls are becoming entangled in other high-profile deals. Yahoo has approached News Corp about merging MySpace and other internet assets into the internet company in exchange for a stake of roughly 20 per cent.The combination would be a means to fend off a bid from Microsoft, although several investors have expressed scepticism that such a deal would be likely to materialise.News Corp has also been building its stake in Premiere, the German pay-television operator, leading to speculation that it could push for full control.Meanwhile, Mr Malone is due to go to court next month after clashing with Barry Diller, chief executive of IAC/Interactive, over control of the internet company. Liberty holds a 24 per cent stake in IAC, although it granted Mr Diller the right to vote its shares.
708;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-02-18T23:38:56Z;Experian considers PriceGrabber sale;;Experian, the world’s largest credit-checking company, is considering selling PriceGrabber, its online price comparison shopping service, after interest from trade and private equity groups.The Dublin-based group said a review of the business was at an early stage and was intended to determine if PriceGrabber “fit within the Experian portfolio”.The admission comes a month after Experian announced the launch of a cost-cutting programme intended to save the company $80m (£41m) a year.It said then it faced what Don Robert, chief executive, called “the toughest environment in 20 years”.Experian is grappling with the liquidity crisis in the US and UK and has previously said it would focus on maximising profitability.But the group said there was “no pressing need” for Experian to sell PriceGrabber in the short term. While it had noticed a slowdown among its financial service customers, revenues at Experian’s interactive unit rose organically 9 per cent in the three months to the end of December.PriceGrabber was bought three years ago for $485m by GUS, the retail and business services group, to beef up its interactive consumer business.The division subsequently added acquisitions such as Lowermybills.com and ClassesUSA.com before it was folded into Experian as part of a demerger from GUS in 2006.Christian Koefoed-Nielsen, analyst at Panmure Gordon, suggested that AOL, MSN or Comcast might be interested in PriceGrabber, as the site did pricing for them.“Given that Experian does not break out what this business contributes to earnings, valuing it is a bit difficult,” he said. “PriceGrabber has grown in customer numbers and profits under Experian, which paid 27 to 28 times earnings when they acquired it. They are not likely to get that when they sell it.”Analysts said PriceGrabber looked more like a stand­alone business than most of Experian’s businesses, where there were clear synergies.“It is a product that deals directly with the consumer and you could relatively easily separate it from Experian without damaging the business there,” Mr Koefoed-Nielsen said.PriceGrabber is part of Experian’s interactive division, which recorded interim revenues of $376m and made an operating profit of $60m. Interim results showed an organic rise in sales at the interactive unit to $388m on the back of deals for co-branded partnerships with AOL Shopping and CNET.Experian shares rose 12p to 455p.
709;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-02-14T21:27:22Z;Comcast’s payout;;Comcast cleared up some of the static between its management and shareholders on Thursday by unfolding its wallet and agreeing to pay its first quarterly dividend in nine years. That, combined with Comcast’s decision to accelerate its timetable on its stock repurchase plan, tickled those who have long called for it to return more capital to shareholders.The company’s free cash flow sank 11 per cent last year to $2.3bn as it spent heavily on digital system upgrades, new television set-top boxes and the integration of Adelphia’s cable systems. With that out of the way, Comcast says free cash flow should rise by more than 20 per cent this year. Its decision to spend 30 per cent of that amount on dividends, combined with a buyback that will boost the effective yield to shareholders, suggests it foresees no big extra outlays on the horizon.Brian Roberts, chief executive, also worked to dispel investors’ other mortal fear – that he might again pursue a game-changing deal, as he did with his startling 2004 bid for Disney. Mr Roberts told analysts he was not spending time courting Sprint or chasing after Yahoo. That should narrow some of the related discount that has depressed Comcast’s shares.Comcast’s 1.4 per cent dividend yield pleased shareholders, helping to boost its share price by 7 per cent. Yet some investors have argued that in broadening its voice and data businesses, Comcast has become increasingly comparable to slower- growth telecommunications giants Verizon and AT&T – which offer dividend yields of more than 4 per cent.Comcast’s lower yield stems, in part, from its confidence that its growth should outstrip that of its telecoms rivals. It is probably right. In any case, its decision to satisfy investor demands by returning some cash ought to buy more time in order to prove it.Post and read comments on this Lex
710;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast in conciliatory moves;;Comcast, the largest US cable operator, sought to placate unhappy investors on Thursday by announcing a new dividend and $7bn in share repurchases.Comcast said it would pay investors a 6.25 per cent quarterly dividend in April, and totalling about $750m annually. It also said that it would spend roughly $7bn on buybacks this year and next in an effort to boost its slumping shares.The announcements came as the company reported a 54 per cent jump in fourth-quarter earnings compared with the same period a year ago, fuelled by acquisitions at its cable group and higher customer billings.Comcast shares have fallen by about a third over the past year amid concerns about a slowing economy, a weak housing market and competition from satellite and telecoms companies. One major investor, Chieftain Capital, had called for the removal of Comcast’s chief executive, Brian Roberts.The shares rose $1.34, or 7.5 per cent, to $19.16 in early trading. For the quarter, Comcast earned $602m, or 20 cents per share. Revenue rose 14 per cent to just over $8bn.
711;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
712;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-02-06T21:10:58Z;Microsoft not only option, Yahoo says;;Jerry Yang, Yahoo chief executive, on Wednesday tried to boost declining morale at the besieged internet company, by telling staff in a message that a number of alternatives to Microsoft’s bid were being considered.Mr Yang broke four days of silence on Microsoft’s unsolicited approach, valued at $42.2bn at Tuesday night’s close, to send an e-mail to all “yahoos”.“No decisions have been made about Microsoft’s proposal,” he said.“Our board is thoughtfully evaluating a wide range of potential strategic alternatives in what is a complex and evolving landscape.”Mr Yang gave no details of Yahoo’s other options, but the list of potential “white knights” has been shortening, with News Corp and NBC this week ruling out any approach, and Comcast and AT&T also thought to be not interested.His e-mail came as Yahoo insiders voiced concern over low morale, a lack of leadership and the possibility of paralysis in product development at the Silicon Valley company.Their feelings were echoed by Barry Diller, chairman of rival InterActive Corp, on a fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.“I don’t think many people at Yahoo are concentrating much on innovation at the moment. I think the same is true at Microsoft,” he said.He added that his Ask search engine should benefit from Microsoft and Yahoo’s distraction.In his message, Mr Yang mentioned a new product launch by Yahoo’s Zimbra e-mail subsidiary and announcements due at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week as evidence that Yahoo was maintaining momentum.He said the board was “going to take the time it needs to do [its review process] right …we’ve hired top advisers to assist through the process.”Yahoo is being advised by investment bankers Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, by legal firm Skadden Arps and has brought in public relations groups Abernathy McGregor and Robinson Lerer & Montgomery.But Yahoo’s delay in responding directly to last Friday’s offer from Microsoft suggests it may have few realistic alternatives, analysts believe.Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Citigroup, outlined five scenarios for Yahoo in a note.He said the most likely was that Yahoo would reject Microsoft’s bid but then accept a higher offer, although there was also a good chance that the existing bid could be accepted.The second most likely scenario was that Yahoo would outsource search to Google to boost its revenues.
713;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-01-28T22:45:05Z;U2 manager urges ISPs to help fight web piracy;;The music industry should shift the focus of its battle with internet piracy towards the technological industries which have “built multibillion dollar industries on the back of our content without paying for it”, according to Paul McGuinness, manager of rock group U2.Mr McGuinness, a highly-respected figure in the industry, told delegates to Midem, the music industry’s international trade show being staged in France, that they had concerned themselves for too long with the small fries who organised illegal peer-to-peer file-sharing on the internet.Mr McGuinness, who has managed U2 for 30 years, said: “I suggest we shift the focus of moral pressure away from the individual P2P file thief and on to the multibillion dollar industries that benefit from these countless tiny crimes. The ISPs [internet service providers] the telcos [telecoms companies], the device-makers.”Mr McGuinness listed some companies that should be pressurised to help “save the recorded music industry”. Huge corporations, such as Microsoft, Google, AOL, Yahoo, Comcast, Vodafone, Facebook and Apple, should be helping “not on the basis of reluctantly sharing advertising revenue, but collecting revenue for the use and sale of our content”.Speaking at the event, sponsored by the International Music Managers’ Forum in Cannes, Mr McGuinness turned particular attention on the ISPs.He said that such companies could help if they wanted to. Their ability to block various kinds of activity, for example visits to controversial websites, showed that they also had the ability to target the P2P offenders who used their services.He added: “We must shame them into wanting to help us. Their snouts have been at our trough feeding free for too long.”The call for action from ISPs follows on from a French government study that led President Nicolas Sarkozy to appeal to the industry to co-operate in catching pirates rather than face legislation.Other agencies at Midem offered their support for Mr McGuinness’s words, which at times were interrupted by bursts of spontaneous app­lause from his audience.The organisations backing him include the IFPI, the international body that represents the entire recording industry, the British Phonographic Industry, the Recording Industry Association of America, and British Music Rights.Mr McGuinness said he envisaged a partnership with ISPs in the future.“For me the business model of the future is one where music is bundled into an ISP or other subscription service and the revenues are shared between the distributor and the content owners,” he said.Last week, IFPI released figures showing that while digital sales increased by 40 per cent from $2.1bn globally to $2.9bn, it was not enough to counter a fall in physical sales – CDs, tapes and vinyl – from $17.5bn to $15bn.
714;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-01-20T18:55:21Z;Digital delivery breaks out of periphery;;In the great hierarchy that rules Hollywood, studio executives working in digital distribution used to be marginal figures, their obsession with new technology keeping them on the periphery of industry decision-making.But after the video-on-demand deal struck last week between Apple and the film industry’s biggest players, the executives running digital distribution have moved to centre stage.The Apple rental deal, which allows consumers to rent films digitally, is particularly significant because it has received rare, across the board backing from the biggest studios. Walt Disney, Universal, Sony, Twentieth Century Fox, Paramount and Warner Brothers have all signed up.However, they are not restricting themselves to one digital platform and have also struck download deals with Microsoft’s Xbox Live service and Amazon, which offer film downloads.“There is room in the market place for a number of different platforms,” says Thomas Gewecke, president of Warner Bros digital distribution. He expects more deals this year.The studios’ enthusiasm for digital distribution stems from the slowdown in the DVD market, where sales fell last year for the first time in a decade.While the Apple deal benefits consumers who want to watch movies on computer or iPod, doubts remain about online video in the living room, where most films are watched.Consumers will have to pay $229 for an Apple TV set-top box to get Apple rentals to play on their TV sets, in addition to renting the film. By contrast, Cable companies such as Comcast can distribute films directly to the set-top boxes included in customers’ cable subscriptions.“I don’t think it’s fair to say that Apple will win in the [on-demand] market,” said Bobby Tulsiani, an analyst at Jupiter Research. “I would always bet on cable and anybody else with direct access to homes.”Apple’s move into on-demand video is likely to affect video rental services. Shares in Blockbuster and Netflix fell sharply when Apple’s Steve Jobs unveiled the deal at the Macworld show.However, Hollywood has been keen to maintain relationships with its distribution partners. “Choosing a favourite among Apple, Netflix and cable is great news for the studios,” says Mr Tulsiani. “They don’t want to have one bully to deal with, which is the situation the music industry is faced with.”
715;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-01-04T19:14:01Z;A question of competition;;"A business can occasionally bring out products that are too popular for its own good. Such a product is the New England Patriots football team. Such a business is the National Football League and specifically its pay-television spin-off, the NFL Network.It has dawned on American football fans in recent weeks that they may be watching the greatest team in the history of the sport. The Pats (as they are sometimes called) are a fascinating collection of people, too. Tom Brady, who has just completed the best season any quarterback has ever had, dates a Brazilian supermodel. The team’s toughest tackler, Tedy Bruschi, is recovering from a stroke. The Patriots’ coach, Bill Belichick, is reviled as a cheat by some football fans (for the zealous videotaping of other teams) and revered by all for his savvy.The beloved and despised Pats have become a national obsession and a media gold mine. The top four broadcasts on US television since last summer have all been Patriots games. Their game on December 3 was the most widely watched programme in the history of cable television. Last Saturday, the Patriots, with 15 wins and no losses, faced the New York Giants with a chance to become the first team ever to go undefeated in a 16-game season. The NFL Network had exclusive rights to broadcast this historic game in the country’s largest media market in prime time on a Saturday night. That seeming bonanza has landed the league in a world of woe.For the past two years, the NFL, which earns $3.7bn in broadcast fees annually, has withheld eight games from its usual cable and network broadcasters to air on its own network, forgoing $400m worth of revenue to do so. Is the NFL just cutting out the middleman? Maybe, but just as likely it is looking for a quick buck. Avid fans willingly buy the giant sports channel ESPN, which costs $3 a month. They will even pay $259 a season for the NFL’s “Sunday Ticket” satellite package. But the NFL Network – with a lacklustre announcer and just eight games a year – is not much of a product.The big cable companies – Time Warner,Cablevision et al – would offer the channel on their “sports tier” to all those who want it. But the NFL insists on being included in the “basic” cable package, which would force even those who do not want the channel to pay for it. Although cable executives are reluctant to cross the mighty NFL brand, they are even less keen, with profit margins shrinking, to alienate their whole customer base with price hikes. The NFL has refused to release the games on any other terms. The resulting stalemate has caused a lot of local inconvenience. But when the Pats were scheduled to play on a network that only 8m households get on cable (many more get it via satellite), the situation got serious.Throughout its battle with Big Cable, the NFL had lobbied for maximum regulatory advantage rather than negotiating for maximum business advantage. It had used e-mail blasts, spam-generating websites and on-air propaganda. It had sued Comcast for demoting the network to an optional tier. Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, called on loyal fans to drop their cable subscriptions. And when the big Patriots windfall presented itself, the NFL Network, true to form, decided to use the game as a gun to the head of the cable companies.It was a terrible mistake. Whether or not New England retains a distinct regional culture, it is unquestionably a distinct US sports market – and it is the only one with 12 senators in it. Several of them, led by John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, began to make reference to the 1961 Sports Broadcasting Act under which the NFL operates (or believes it does), which exempts professional sports leagues from anti-trust statutes. Senators noted that the 1961 act had been passed at a time when NFL was committed to showing as many football games as it could, gratis, and that the act does not apply to paid transmissions.The NFL was already in bad odour with the Senate. When one of its lawyers testified in November 2006 that an increase in programming costs to cable companies need not mean an increase in prices to consumers, Roger Noll, a Stanford economics professor who was also testifying, began to laugh. “The right template that we economists use for deciding whether an action such as the creation of the NFL Network is pro- or anti-competitive,” Mr Noll said that day, “is whether there is a profit-enhancing reduction in output.” The then-chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, leaned towards the view that there was such a reduction. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who succeeded Mr Specter as chairman when Democrats regained the Senate, agrees. In a letter to the NFL sent just before Christmas, both senators accused the league of “adopting strategies to limit distribution of game programming to their own networks” and urged it to put the Pats on television.The NFL backed down, allowing the game to be aired on two national networks, NBC and CBS; 35m viewers saw the Patriots complete their perfect season. But the NFL Network had awakened a sleeping giant. What was surprising is that, while their passions were roused by the Patriots, the US sports-watching public remained sufficiently dispassionate about the business issues to side, generally, against the league that is producing the very programming it wants to see.More questions arose, such as why US cable subscribers need to pay for so many expensive channels they do not want, why they cannot have à la carte pricing, why certain satellite programming is not made available on cable and so on. It will be surprising if next autumn’s coincidence of football season and election season does not produce a candidate eager to tackle these issues.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard"
716;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2008-01-04T00:53:11Z;Weather Channel faces sell-off;;Landmark Communications, the privately owned US media company that owns The Weather Channel, on Thursday said it was considering a sale in a move that could draw interest from rivals NBC and News Corp.According to people familiar with the matter, the company could be worth more than $5bn (£2.5bn), although moves are under way to split the business in two.Bankers at JPMorgan are advising Landmark on the sale of The Weather Channel, which runs on cable television, and its weather.com website.Also, Lehman Brothers is working with Landmark on the disposal of its print assets. These include The Virginian-Pilot in the company’s hometown of Norfolk, as well as The Roanoke Times, also in Virginia, and The News & Record, which covers the Greensboro, North Carolina region.Landmark has about $1.8bn in annual revenues.“Landmark’s weather, publishing, broadcasting, interactive and information businesses all have leading positions in their markets and have strong growth opportunities,” said Frank Batten, Jr, the chairman and chief executive whose family founded the company in 1904. The Weather Channel was formed in 1982.A sale of Landmark would extend a string of moves by family controlled media companies in the US to cash out of their businesses in recent years. The most high-profile deal was last year’s purchase of Dow Jones, which owns the Wall Street Journal newspaper, by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.Clear Channel Communications, the largest US radio station chain, run by the Mays family, has a pending agreement to be sold to Bain Capital and Thomas H Lee Partners, the private equity groups.The announcement of an auction for Landmark is a sign that the credit squeeze has not entirely damped confidence among chief executives that they can secure reasonable valuations for their assets if they are sufficiently attractive to strategic buyers. As well as News Corp and NBC, which is owned by General Electric, Comcast, the cable group, has also been touted as a potential buyer of The Weather Channel.Private equity firms might take a look at the newspaper properties but the scarcity of cheap financing for leveraged buy-outs could make it difficult for them to play a big role.If The Weather Channel does indeed fetch the $5bn that some suggested, it would represent vindication for Frank Batten Sr, the family patriarch who, despite naysayers, pushed ahead with the launch of the channel.At the time, most observers expressed doubts about demand for a 24-hour-a-day TV weather service. Today the channel is piped into more than 96m US homes and is credited with turning weather watching into a US national pastime akin to baseball or football.

Tolkien’s The Hobbit. Mr Jackson and Fran Walsh, Mr Jackson’s production partner, will produce the two films.Mr Jackson had sued New Line over profits from the first three Lord of the Rings films, which generated almost $3bn in box office receipts. He had also asked that the company submit to an independent audit of its accounts.The suit had sparked an angry retort from Bob Shaye, founder and co-chairman of New Line, who told a magazine: “I don’t care about Peter Jackson any more.”However, the two sides on Tuesday said they had settled the litigation.Mr Shaye said New Line was pleased that Mr Jackson and Ms Walsh would be “actively and creatively involved” in the two Hobbit films.Harry Sloan, the chairman of MGM, which will distribute the two new films internationally, was thanked by Mr Jackson for “helping us find …common ground”.Mr Sloan was brought in to run MGM by Providence, Texas Pacific Group, Sony and Comcast, which acquired the company in 2004.He said the deal with Mr Jackson was a boost for MGM, which is seeking to re-establish itself as a Hollywood force.“It’s incredibly important because when we took over the studio one of our first goals was to create new franchises.”The group will take over the James Bond franchise after completion of the next film in the series, which is being produced by Sony.The two Hobbit films will be shot simultaneously, with pre-production beginning “as soon as possible”, according to MGM and New Line. No script has been written, so the film is likely to be delayed by the Hollywood writers’ strike.The strike has disrupted US television, with top dramas and comedy shows pulled from the airwaves. It has hit film productions, notably Sony’s big-budget sequel to The Da Vinci Code, which has been postponed.More ominous for Hollywood is the prospect of its showpiece events – the Golden Globes and the Oscars – being disrupted. The Writers Guild of America said on Tuesday it would not grant a waiver to allow the Globes to go ahead, which could result in cancellation of the January show.
718;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-12-18T23:48:12Z;FCC votes to open media markets;;Media companies were on Tuesday given new authority to expand their holdings in the 20 largest cities in the US following a vote by the Federal Communications Commission.The 3-2 vote by the Republican-led commission will eradicate a 32-year-old regulation that has until now prevented media companies from owning broadcasters and newspaper companies in the same market. The rule will apply only to the largest 20 markets in the US.In pushing through the deregulatory measure, Kevin Martin, the chairman of the media regulator, defied the wishes of more than two dozen senators and congressmen who had called on him to delay the vote.Senator Byron Dorgan on Tuesday repeated his threat to see the vote “nullified”, though it is unclear if such an attempt would ­survive a potential veto by George W. Bush, the president.“We’ve got a lot of people, from both parties, as well as millions of American citizens saying hold on a minute here. Don’t do this,” Mr Dorgan said. “We’re not done with this, not by a long shot.”John Dingell, the Democratic chairman of the House energy and commerce committee, accused Republicans at the FCC of acting “arrogantly and brazenly” but stopped short of threatening to reverse the vote.Democrats at the FCC who voted against the proposal said the revised rules would lead to a “bazaar of consolidation”. But newspaper groups, including News Corp and Tribune, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, had criticised the new regulation for not going far enough.An attempt by the FCC to pass a broad overhaul of media regulations under Michael Powell, Mr Martin’s predecessor, was blocked by an appeals court in 2004. The court ruled that the FCC had failed to justify the changes.Mr Martin could face a similar court challenge to yesterday’s vote but is expected to fare better than Mr Powell as the new proposal was more narrow.Mr Martin, who is facing intense criticism for his leadership of the FCC, on Tuesday rejected suggestions that the overhaul had been “rushed”.The FCC also voted on Tuesday to limit the size of cable operators like Comcast, by barring the companies from owning more than 30 per cent of US multi-channel video subscribers.
719;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-12-07T21:36:36Z;Wall St achieves back-to-back weekly gains;;Wall Street achieved back-to-back weekly gains on Friday. Investors are hoping that another Federal Reserve rate cut, and a White House plan to resolve some of the pain afflicting holders of subprime mortgages, can prevent the credit squeeze from freezing the broad economy.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,504.66, but was higher by 1.6 per cent this week. For the year, the S&P is up 6.1 per cent, about 4 per cent below its 2007 peak of 1,565.15, set in October.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,706.16 on Friday, a rise of 1.7 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a fraction higher to 13,625.58, up 1.9 per cent since Monday.The worst fears of investors about the economy were not met on Friday, when the November employment report recorded a gain of 94,000 jobs. The report was not strong enough to change expectations that policymakers will ease the Fed funds rate to 4.25 per cent from 4.50 per cent next week.“I think the Fed will still cut rates, as they would rather be safe than sorry,” said Scott Wren, senior equity analyst at AG Edwards.Analysts are worried about how the economy and earnings will fare in the coming months as banks scale back their lending and house prices are seen falling further.The US administration’s plan to help some holders of subprime mortgage modify their loans was described as being no “silver bullet“ by Hank Paulson, the Treasury secretary.That came after data showed the share of mortgages more than 30-days delinquent reached 5.6 per cent in the third quarter, the highest level since 1986.“Investors are attempting to fathom the depths of the credit crunch and its subsequent impact on consumer borrowing and the housing market,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Financials rebounded 0.5 per cent this week, but remain 15.6 per cent lower for the year. The outlook for the sector’s earnings in the fourth quarter darkened and these are now seen falling 35 per cent after a 27 per cent slide in the third quarter, according to Thomson Financial.With materials companies facing a decline of 6 per cent in their fourth-quarter earnings, overall average S&P 500 earnings are now seen falling 0.8 per cent.This bleak outlook for the current quarter follows a fall of 4.5 per cent in S&P earnings for the third quarter. The last time S&P earnings fell in two consecutive quarters was in the last quarter of 2001 and the first three months of 2002.“History has shown that the equities do not fare well in the face of a recession,’’ said Mr Ablin. “The S&P 500 dropped more than 20 per cent in the 12 months leading up to the last recession in March 2001.’’This year, as financials and consumer discretionary stocks and other areas of the market – such as small companies – have been hit hard by the credit squeeze, investors have sought large companies with exposure to the global economy.The falling dollar has inflated foreign based earnings, but this week central banks in Canada and the UK cut interest rates, weakening their currencies.“The recession clock in the US ticks steadily closer to midnight,’’ said William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS. “We see developing economic weakness among key US trading partners as another link in the chain that ends with a recession in the US with the vital export sector as a transmission.’’Mr Wren said consumer staples and healthcare stocks, up 13.8 per cent and 9.4 per cent in the S&P, respectively, this year, are safe places for investors.He added that financials may be a story next year. “If the Fed cuts rates to 3 per cent, financials will benefit.”Among stocks in the news this week, Lennar, the home builder, rose 15.7 per cent to $18.32 after it announced a joint venture with Morgan Stanley’s real estate unit.A sense that homebuilders are getting on top of their inventory problems powered a 16.6 per cent rally in S&P homebuilder index this week. Since making a low of 291.55 in late November, the index has risen more than 30 per cent, clipping its loss this year to 57 per cent.Mixed retail sales for November were reflected in the share prices of retailers. JC Penney gained 8.6 per cent to $47.92, while Target lost 7.4 per cent to $55.51.Financials did experience a number of downgrades this week, and on Friday American Express fell 4.3 per cent to $56.96 after Merrill Lynch cut it to a “sell”. Bond insurers were hit after Moody’s said MBIA might need additional capital and the stock fell 17.8 per cent to $30.American International Group rallied 5.7 per cent to $61.45 as the insurer soothed investors after announcing its exposure to subprime losses.Research In Motion, the maker of BlackBerry devices, fell 8.9 per cent to $103.65 after a brokerage downgrade.Activision, the video game publisher rose 20.9 per cent at $26.79, after Vivendi said it planned to buy a controlling stake in the company.Comcast said 2007 revenue would be lower and expenses higher than previously forecast. The cable operator fell 11 per cent to $18.28.Intel rose 6.3 per cent to $27.73, and is up 37 per cent in 2007, after the chip maker was upgraded to overweight by Thomas Weisel Partners.Macrovision, a developer of technology that prevents unauthorised copying and viewing of video, said it would buy Gemstar, the television listings provider, for $2.8bn in cash and stock on Friday. Shares in Macrovision were 21.4 per cent lower at $20.44, while Gemstar had dropped 16.6 per cent to $4.99.At the start of trading, Wall Street was set for gains after a modest rise in the number of jobs created in November left the door open to a rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week.Non-farm payrolls expanded by 94,000, down from a revised gain of 170,000 in October. Economists had expected a rise of 75,000 jobs last month, but in recent days some had raised their estimate to 125,000 after a strong private-sector reading on Wednesday. The unemployment rate was steady at 4.7 per cent.“Overall, these data should not change anyone’s mind at the Fed or otherwise regarding the health of the economy or the prospect of rate cuts,” said Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers.Within the US jobs report, average hourly earnings increased 0.5 per cent and were up 3.8 per cent from a year earlier. September job creation was revised sharply lower from 96,000 to 44,000.Construction employment fell 24,000, the fifth-straight monthly decline, while financial services payrolls fell 20,000. In contrast, service-sector employment rose 127,000. Retail payrolls rose 24,200, breaking a run of three straight monthly declines.
720;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast wobbles;;Has D-Day finally arrived for the cable operators? Investors have long feared the impact of powerful telecoms companies muscling into the video business. Worries of a price war in TV, broadband internet and telephony helped keep cable stocks in the doldrums during 2004 and 2005.They rallied last year, as the battle failed to materialise, and the likes of Comcast started enjoying real growth in telephony. But the respite has not lasted. Shares in Comcast slumped 12 per cent on Wednesday after the cable market leader reduced guidance – notably for free cash flow, which it expects to fall 20 per cent in 2007. Comcast and Time Warner Cable’s shares have slumped by more than a third this year.Comcast blamed the shortfall partly on the US economy. Reduced home sales and increased foreclosures mean less demand for subscriptions. But more ominously, Comcast also talked about increased competition. It is facing pressure from satellite companies, which have spent aggressively on marketing, and from telecoms operators, whose video operations are gathering momentum.That means lower subscriber growth across cable services, or even losses in basic video. There is also the risk that prices will start to come under real pressure – even though Comcast has so far kept telephony and broadband rates pretty flat while continuing to raise prices on video.What really scared investors, though, was capital spending. Instead of Comcast projecting lower capex, in the face of slowing subscriber growth, it is set to rise. There might be good reasons – for example expenditure on profitable products such as high definition. Meanwhile, competition is probably not as bad as many fear. And Comcast’s undemanding valuation offers a buying opportunity. But shareholders, after years of heavy investment, want to see the rewards. Until Comcast shows it can deliver the cash flow, its shares will continue to struggle.
721;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-12-06T00:49:45Z;Competition weighs on Comcast;;Shares in Comcast took another big hit on Wednesday after the largest cable company in the US reduced its forecasts for revenues on the back of increased competition from telecoms rivals and a tougher economic environment.By the close in New York, Comcast’s shares were down 12.3 per cent at $18.18. The shares had a similar sharp drop in October after warnings over performance.The move follows sharp falls in the value of Comcast shares this year, which were down more than 25 per cent before yesterday’s drop. Shares in other cable groups, such as Time Warner Cable and Cablevision, have also been under pressure.Comcast, controlled by the Roberts family and run by Brian Roberts, lowered its forecast for cable revenue growth in 2007 from at least 12 per cent to 11 per cent, citing a challenging competitive environment.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said this reflected the “extreme downside scenario”, and that the environment for Comcast was “playing out worse than we thought”.“[There are] deteriorating fundamental trends as…secular competitive challenges and now the economy are offsetting seasonality and the defensive nature of the subscription model,” the analysts said, cutting their share price target for the end of next year from $25 to $22.Comcast’s reduced revenue forecasts, plus an increase in its capital expenditure forecast for 2007 by 5 per cent to about $6bn, tapped into investor concerns about cable operators. Increasingly, as operators offer internet and telephone services to their video customers, telecoms rivals have started to roll out video services to their telephony and internet users. Verizon Communications has been aggressive in releasing its video services, and AT&T is planning to offer more.In spite of the growing competition, in which satellite rivals are increasing pressure as they offer a bigger range of high-definition video content, cable operators have continued to face regulatory pressure.Kevin Martin, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, tried to get backing to increase oversight of the cable industry by arguing that it now had too big a proportion of the US population as its customers.Although Mr Martin failed to get backing for this move, he is still reported to be seeking a proposed ownership cap for cable companies. Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said: “Chairman Martin apparently isn’t done with cable yet.”
722;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-12-05T22:28:09Z;Wall St rallies led by tech stocks;;Wall Street stocks rose on Wednesday for the first time this week, boosted by a solid gauge of private sector employment hiring in November.The S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent at 1,485.01 near its high for the day.Among leading sectors, technology lead with a gain of 2.5 per cent, followed by a 2 per cent rise in financials and a 1.9 per cent rally in energy stocks.Not all the news was good for financials however. Concerns about US bond insurers sparked a dramatic turnaround in that sector.Moody’s issued a statement saying that MBIA “was at greater risk of a capital shortfall than previously communicated, and a shortfall is now considered somewhat likely”. This could threaten its AAA rating.MBIA swiftly surrendered its gains from early trade and the stock fell 15.9 per cent to $27.42. Meanwhile, Ambac dropped 8.9 per cent to $23.52. The cost to insure MBIA and Ambac debt against default also rose.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 per cent to 2,666.36, while the Nasdaq 100 gained 2 per cent to close at 2,099.31.Blue-chips also rose sharply and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.5 per cent higher at 13,444.96.Shares in AIG led bluechips, as they rose 4.9 per cent to close at $58.15. Another Dow financial, Citigroup rallied 3.5 per cent to $33.69, while a 4.2 per cent rise in Microsoft to $34.15 also boosted the blue-chip barometer.Smaller companies were not ignored by investors and the Russell 2000 index rose 1.8 per cent to 765.64. “The reason for today’s rally is, for the first time in a long time, a good old-fashioned reason – that the economy is doing well and not whether the Fed will cut rates or not,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management.In economic news, the ADP national employment report estimated that 189,000 private sector jobs were created in November. Economists had expected a 50,000 gain, and the news pushed bond yields higher.“As long as people have jobs, consumers will spend money,” said Mr Paulsen.The ADP number suggests that the November employment report, due on Friday, will expand by around 210,000 jobs. Economists, however expect a gain of 70,000 jobs.Other data did little to dissuade investors that the Federal Reserve will ease its stance on rates next week.The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses, slipped more than expected to a reading of 54.1 in November from 55.8 the previous month.Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said: “This mix of decelerating growth, with higher price indications, tends to play more to the crowd expecting a 25bp cut in the funds rate next week, rather than a 50bp cut.”A bullish note was struck for technology after Thomas Weisel Partners said demand for notebook computers would increase in emerging markets, particularly Brazil, Russia, India and China. The broker upgraded Intel to “overweight”.The Philadelphia Exchange’s semiconductor index gained 2.3 per cent.IBM was up 1.4 per cent at $108.16 on the news but AMD gave up gains closing down 3.7 per cent at $8.91. Apple rose 3.2 per cent to $185.50.Energy was also in favour and the sector held much of its gains in spite of oil prices falling after a surge in early trade.ExxonMobil rose 2 per cent at $89.92 as the American oil index rose 1.6 per cent.Among laggards, cable operator Comcast said 2007 revenue would be lower and expenses higher than previously forecast, citing greater competition and a slowing economy. Shares in the company plunged 8.7 per cent to $18.92.Among gainers in the financial sector, Fannie Mae recovered after initial falls. Its shares added 2.7 per cent to $36.13.The mortgage financier said late on Tuesday that it would issue $7bn in preferred stock and cut its dividend to raise cash.Fellow government-backed mortgage company Freddie Mac made a similar move last week. Its shares gained 7.3 per cent to 34.67.Countrywide advanced 4.2 per cent to $10.42, but still remains 77 per cent down on the year.
723;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-11-28T02:34:38Z;FCC cable regulation effort in jeopardy;;Kevin Martin, Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, on Tuesday appeared to back down from a controversial effort to expand regulatory control over the cable industry after failing to secure backing from fellow regulators.The FCC, which regulates the communications and media industries, on Tuesday had planned to vote on a report backed by Mr Martin which found that companies such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable had reached a large enough share of the US population to allow the government to impose new regulatory powers.Ahead of Tuesday night’s meeting, it appeared the report might be modified with new data provided by cable companies ahead of a vote.Mr Martin’s proposal has created a rift within the FCC, with fellow Republican commissioners questioning the “trustworthiness” and “truthfulness” of data being used to make the case for increased oversight of cable companies.Republican lawmakers have also protested against the plans, with more than 20 members of the House of Representatives calling his proposal “misguided” and “harmful”.The cable industry had also fought hard against Mr Martin’s so-called 70/70 rule on market reach, a measure cable companies regarded as a further step in his campaign to damage the sector due to its refusal to allow customers to pay for programming on a channel-by-channel basis. Mr Martin’s plan led to a public spat between him and the cable industry, with the main lobbyist calling the FCC “broken”. Cable lobbyists said Mr Martin had favoured companies in the telecoms sector over those which operate in cable alone.The arguments come as cable, telecoms and satellite companies increasingly compete for the same customers, as they all offer video, internet and telephony.
724;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-11-21T02:09:39Z;AT&T remains silent on Echostar bid;;As one might expect, AT&T, the world’s largest telecoms group, is skilled in the art of communications. But on the persistent rumours that the company might bid for Echostar, the company has remained tight-lipped.Wall Street rumours about a potential takeover of the second-biggest US satellite operator have swirled around both companies for several years. However, they peaked this week after reports in Barron’s and the financial website TheStreet.com said that AT&T was preparing a takeover bid worth as much as $26bn (£12bn) and that both companies have been in talks.The reports sent Echostar’s share price, depressed by recent disappointing quarterly results, soaring. The stock closed up 27 per cent at $47.49 on Monday, but slipped a little on Tuesday when no bid materialised.Echostar was founded by Charles Ergen, who retains control of the satellite company. In spite of recent indications that Echostar’s subscriber growth may be slowing, there is no sign that Mr Ergen wants to lose control or leave the business.Monday’s share price gain however, reflects the belief among some investors that a deal is not just plausible, but likely.The speculation surrounding AT&T and Echostar comes amid a realignment of the industry in the US.Echostar and DirecTV, the largest US satellite operator, have succeeded in taking millions of customers from cable operators such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable in the past decade by offering high-quality multi-channel video and good customer services.Meanwhile, AT&T and Verizon Communications, the second largest US carrier, are both scrambling to roll out their own television and video services, targeting customers who pay $100 or more a month for their multi-channel TV offerings, internet access and landline phone services.Cable companies have reported in recent weeks that they are starting to feel the pinch, particularly from Verizon, which had signed 717,000 subscribers to its advanced fibre optic-based video service by the end of September.Shares in Comcast and Time Warner Cable have been hard hit, partly because of investor fears of a price war as competition heats up.Proponents of an AT&T-Echostar deal argue that Echostar’s Dish Network – with 13.7m satellite-TV subscribers – would bolster AT&T’s U-verse IPTV (Internet Protocol TV) offering, which has just 126,000 customers. Others are not so sure.“A takeout of EchoStar by AT&T is possible, but not certain,” said Todd Mitchell, of Kaufman Bros, in a note on Tuesday. Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, is also doubtful. “There is nothing AT&T can do by bolting a satellite provider on to the phone network to give it a cost advantage against cable,” he said.AT&T already resells both Echostar’s Dish and Direct­TV services to its customers and is likely to continue to do so in areas where the fibre optic-based U-verse service is not viable.As a result of AT&T’s acquisition of BellSouth late last year, the contracts between AT&T and the satellite companies became due for renegotiation, further fuelling the takeover speculation. As far as talk about a possible takeover, however, AT&T, like Echostar, declines to comment.
725;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Cablevision result compounds woes;;"Cablevision, the cable operator whose controlling Dolan family recently failed in a bid to take it private, added further gloom to the cable sector with weaker-than-expected results.The third-quarter results and Cablevision’s lower guidance for the full-year cash flow reflected the increased competition from telecommunications rivals.Cablevision, based in the New York area, is facing particular competition for customers from Verizon, which covers about 90 per cent of the area that Cablevision does. Churn rates – the number of customers who stop subscribing to video, internet and telephone services – rose relative to last year. For basis cable customers, churn was at 2.2 per cent versus 2 per cent a year ago; for digital customers it went up to 2.5 per cent from 2.2 and for internet customers 2.7 per cent from 2.3.“Cable operators are increasingly facing a costly battle as more triple bundle choices proliferate,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.Churn rates are crucial for the profitability of cable and telecom operators because the longer a customer stays, the more money can be made to offset a period during which a customer is unprofitable.Verizon and AT&T are rolling out video services to add to the phone and internet access already provided, and teaming up with satellite operators to offer packages of services. In addition, cable operators such as Comcast, Time Warner and Cablevision are trying to lure phone customers from telecoms groups.Cablevision shares fell 2.3 per cent to just under $26.The company reported a loss of $79.3m, or 27 cents per share, versus a loss of $59.2m, or 21 cents per share, a year ago.Revenues rose 9.4 per cent to $1.51bn, with operating income up 59 per cent to $202.1m."
726;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-10-30T20:29:44Z;Mixed response to FCC’s customer drive;;Time is running out for Kevin Martin. When the ambitious Republican head of the Federal Communications Commission, the US media and telecommunications regulator, was designated chairman in 2005, he set forth an agenda that would challenge the cable industry by pressuring companies to give consumers more choice and by giving telecommunications companies more opportunities to take on cable monopolies.But with just over a year left before next year’s presidential election, which will precede Mr Martin’s likely departure from the chairman’s seat, there are mixed views on what he will be able to achieve in his final months in office and the lasting impact his tenure will have on the industry he regulates.On Wednesday, cable will again be at the centre of Mr Martin’s focus, when the FCC is expected to pass a measure that would eradicate the ability of cable companies such as Comcast to sign exclusive deals with apartment owners that bar competitors from offering video services to residents.Presented by some as a blow to the cable industry, others say the vote will have little practical impact on cable operator businesses, because there are already bans on exclusive contracts in place in 17 US states and Washington DC.Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, said last week that about 10 per cent of its customers would be affected by the ruling. “We don’t anticipate it being a huge thing,” said Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast.Although most cable companies continue to be diplomatic in public comments about the FCC, many cable industry executives privately feel the expected vote today is part of a broader “anti-cable” campaign by Mr Martin, fuelled by his desire to force companies such as Comcast and Time Warner to unbundle their cable offerings and give customers the chance to pick and choose the channels they wish to subscribe to, a practice known as à la carte programming that is strongly opposed by cable operators.“The one issue that’s been the hallmark of his commission has been à la carte, and by all accounts that has gotten nowhere,” says Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. Mr Moffett added that “the damage up to now has been limited and it does not look like that’s going to change over the next year”.When asked in an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday about his reputation for singling out the cable industry, Mr Martin points out that nearly every sector the FCC regulates, from the long-distance industry to wireless, has seen dramatic price decreases during the last 10 years.“The exact opposite has occurred in the cable industry. During the same exact time frame, you’ve seen 100 per cent increases in cable prices on average, almost double,” he says.Mr Martin says his broad objective, not only for the cable industry but for the broad scope of companies he regulates, has been to remove barriers to competition in order to lower prices and drive innovation. The à la carte initiative has nevertheless failed to gain traction so far.“While Kevin’s tenure would have introduced more competition for the multi-channel TV marketplace, only technology and innovation on the web will disrupt the current multi-channel TV model and lead to à la carte,” says one media industry lobbyist.“Right now, there is nothing the FCC has done that will hasten à la carte,” the person added.Mr Martin brushes aside criticism he has not made more progress on the à la carte debate, pointing to the fact that the FCC technically lacks jurisdiction to force any changes on the cable industry without support from Congress.In the meantime, he says, it is premature to be talking about what his legacy will be. “Don’t cut me short. I’ve got a while left,” he says.
727;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-10-25T22:15:13Z;Fears over economy and rivals hit Comcast;;Shares in Comcast, the biggest US cable television operator, fell more than 10 per cent Thursday after executives warned that US economic weakness and competition from satellite and telecoms rivals might affect results this year.The company lost more video subscribers – down 65,000 in the third quarter – than many analysts had forecast, and added fewer high-speed internet and phone customers than had been predicted.“We’re seeing increasing competition and a softer economy and as a result a slightly slower growth rate,” said Brian Roberts, chief executive, whose family controls the company.The warnings of potential weakness tapped into investor concerns about the position of cable operators, with fears of tougher competition already hitting Comcast shares. Prior to the results on Thursday, Comcast shares had fallen by 15 per cent so far this year.Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the US economy was a more important factor for Comcast than competition.“Fewer additions to the occupied housing supply mean fewer new pay-TV subscriptions – and fewer broadband subscriptions – for all players,” Mr Moffett said, adding Comcast now covered 40 per cent of the US.The impact of competition has led to investor concerns that Comcast might try to make an acquisition to be able to offer wireless connections. Mr Roberts said he and other executives were working on figuring out the “strategic fit” that wireless had for a cable company.Comcast increased its share buybacks by $7bn. Net profit in the third quarter was $560m, or 18 cents a share, down from $1.22bn the previous year when the quarter included one-off transaction gains. Revenue grew 21 per cent to $7.78bn.At midday in New York, shares were trading at $21.43, down just over 10 per cent.
728;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-10-25T20:44:37Z;Writedown concerns weigh on Wall Street;;US stocks were weaker on Thursday during another volatile session in which concerns about further writedowns linked to credit market losses spooked the market.American International Group fell on concerns about its exposure to subprime mortgages. Investors were also troubled by the suggestion that Merrill Lynch may have to make more writedowns in the current quarter. The bank on Wednesday reported $7.9bn in writedowns.The S&P 500 fell as much as 1 per cent but closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1514.39. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed fractionally lower at 13671.92 after another 200-point intraday swing.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.9 per cent lower at 2,750.86. The Nasdaq 100 fell as much as 1.9 per cent before closing 1.2 per cent lower at 2,161.52. Weakness in chipmaker stocks persisted and the PHLX semiconductor sector index slipped 2.1 per cent to 452.29.After the market closed Microsoft, up 2.4 per cent at $31.99 on the day, reported fiscal first quarter earnings which beat expectations. The company increased earnings by 23 per cent to $4.29bn on revenues of $13.76bn. The shares advanced in after hours trade.Of the 10 leading sectors on the S&P 500, financials and consumer discretionary were laggards while utilities fared best. Energy stocks also gained strongly as crude oil futures rose to a new record high above $90 a barrel. The S&P energy index gained 0.6 per cent to 581.77.Financial stocks again weighed on the market amid fears over credit market losses. The S&P financial index has closed lower for 10 of the last 12 days. On Thursday the index fell 0.6 per cent at 440.31. The investment bank index fell 1 per cent at 195.21.During a volatile session AIG fell as much as 8.5 per cent, and was the weakest stock on the Dow, as rumours circulated about its exposure to sub-prime mortgages. The company reports quarterly earnings after the market closes. The stock rebounded in late trade and closed 3.2 per cent lower at $61.79.Merrill Lynch fell 3.7 per cent to $60.90 after a Goldman Sachs analyst noted that Merrill might have to write down another $4.5bn in the current quarter. Bank of America fell 1 per cent to $47 after it announced 3,000 job cuts.Mortgage insurers were also hit. MGIC Investment fell 9.3 per cent to $17.90 after it cut its dividend. Triad Guaranty shed 26.6 per cent to $6.04 after S&P said it might cut its rating after the company posted a surprise loss.Stocks rallied early in the session after new-home sales recorded an unexpected gain in September.According to the Commerce Department, sales of new homes rose 4.8 per cent to an annual rate of 770,000 units. Economists had predicted a 2.5 per cent decline.But optimism was tempered by news of a downward revision of August’s figures to an 11-year low of 735,000, from 795,000 units.New-home sales remain 23.3 per cent lower than a year ago.The S&P homebuilder index slipped 0.2 per cent to 410.34, having traded higher early in the session. The S&P retail index also shot into positive territory after the home sales data but later slipped 0.1 per cent lower at 456.49.Pulte Homes shed 3.1 per cent to $14.53 after it posted a $787.9m loss in the third quarter as it took a $1.18bn charge to reflect the declining land values.In other earnings news, Aetna, the health insurer, posted a 4.3 per cent rise in third quarter net income and raised its full-year guidance. The stock gained 5.7 per cent to $55.90.Telecoms had a mixed day. Motorola reported a 94 per cent drop in profits for the third quarter during the past year but the result beat analysts’ estimates. The shares rose 4 per cent to $19.30.But Comcast fell 10.8 per cent to $21.28 after third quarter profit at the cable TV and broadband provider fell 54 per cent. However, revenues increased 21 per cent to $7.78bn.Although technology stocks were generally weaker there were pockets of strength in the market. Akamai Technologies, a web-content delivery company, jumped 12.6 per cent to $37.13 after it raised its outlook for the year. Monster Worldwide, parent of the Monster.com jobs website, rose 7.6 per cent to $38.80 after quarterly profit beat expectations. VMware rose 10.1 per cent to $114 after third quarter profit tripled, again beating expectations.In economic news, durable goods orders declined 1.7 per cent in September, compared with an expected rise of 1.5 per cent.Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims fell by 8,000 to 331,000, fewer than the expected fall to 320,000.
729;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-10-14T18:17:40Z;Telecom and cable companies;;Whatever happened to the cable operators? Since the beginning of the year, shares in Comcast and Time Warner Cable have sunk by 15 and 20 per cent respectively, while their big telecom rivals AT&T and Verizon are up by about a fifth.The divergence seems to stem from one overarching concern, and a series of specific data points that have spooked investors. First, the big picture. Some investors still feel the cable operators are stuck promising jam tomorrow. Just as they begin to see the cash flows materialising from the last big capital expenditure binge, there are fears that a new wave of capex (say for high-definition services) will emerge. Alternatively, cash could go into empire building rather than being returned to shareholders. Take Comcast. Controlled by the Roberts family, it takes a long-term view, leading to fears that the company wants to build or buy a substantial wireless presence.As for the core business, cable operators appeared to acknowledge strong competition earlier this year while the telecom operators made bullish noises about their new video services, using newly laid fibre networks. The telecom sector also has big, fast-growing wireless units, cost-saving opportunities stemming from past deals, healthy dividend yields, and signs of improvement from difficult voice operations.Investors, however, seem to have gone too far. Admittedly, new subscriber numbers are under pressure because of inroads made by telecom operators and satellite, worsened by a fall in new home building. Broadband growth is slowing after a great run.But the positive contribution from internet telephony still has a way to go. JPMorgan estimates Comcast and Time Warner Cable will increase annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by about 10 per cent for the next three years, compared with 5-7 per cent for AT&T and Verizon. Yet they trade on about seven times next year’s ebitda against 6.5 times for the telecom companies.Proof of real discipline from the cable operators would go a long way to addressing this year’s dramatic underperformance.
730;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-09-17T22:46:44Z;Zimbra purchase boosts Yahoo’s profile;;"Competition for corporate e-mail accounts increased on Monday as Yahoo announced an acquisition that would enable it to rival the services of Microsoft and Google for enterprise customers.Yahoo said it was buying Zimbra, which offers web-based e-mail and collaboration software, for about $350m.The Silicon Valley company said Zimbra would help it to expand its presence in universities, businesses and through internet service providers by enabling organisations to host e-mail with their own web address, on or off their premises.Yahoo Mail is 10 years old this year and had 250m users worldwide in July, according to comScore World Metrix. It recently improved its web interface to resemble desktop e-mail applications such as Microsoft Outlook.The improvement came with the help of Oddpost, software developed by an earlier acquisition, but Zimbra also adds rich calendar and contact management features and enables “mash-ups” of different applications. This means an e-mail can contain highlighted links, for example a purchase order number can be clicked on to open the actual document; clicking on a phone number can call it using an application such as Skype, and an address can be clicked to produce a map with the location.While Yahoo Mail has been popular among consumers, Zimbra has been aimed at corporate customers and internet service providers such as Comcast, who want to offer web-based e-mail to customers. The acquisition puts Yahoo in competition with Google Apps, a suite of applications for businesses, and Microsoft software and services such as Outlook and SharePoint.Tim Haley, a partner with Redpoint Ventures, a venture capital firm that incubated Zimbra, said the company’s software represented a leap forward over the competition. Zimbra is reported to have raised $30.5m in three rounds of VC funding. Its sale represents a healthy return for Redpoint and other VC backers Benchmark Capital and Accel Partners."
731;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Signal ruling boosts US cable groups;;The Federal Communications Commission has agreed to a compromise related to the broadcasting of local signals, dealing a welcome break to US cable groups such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable that were threatened under original reform plans.Instead of the FCC’s plans to require cable companies to air both digital and analogue signals for local broadcasters after a planned switch to digital television in 2009, rules were voted on that would require them to do this for just three years after the digital switchover.“Cable dodged a potentially serious blow,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “The vote removes a material risk from the stocks for the foreseeable future.”Relations between the cable industry and Kevin Martin, the FCC’s commissioner, have on occasion been strained because Mr Martin advocates certain policies such as à la carte programming, which the cable industry believes would undermine its business model.The new rules, voted on late on Tuesday, follow months of discussions in which the cable industry lobbied for a three-year limit to the requirement for “dual carriage” of signals.Analogue signals take up large amounts of space in cable systems, which cable operators instead want to use to introduce more high-definition programming and to allow internet customers access to more high-speed connections.“What we asked for, we largely got,” said Kyle McSlarrow, president of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, which represents the cable industry.“The cable industry looked smart to do a compromise,” said one media industry lobbyist.In a statement, Mr Martin said it was not acceptable as “a policy matter or as a legal matter” that cable companies “believe that it is appropriate for them to choose which stations analogue customers should be able to watch”.The remark hints at another issue facing the cable industry: Mr Martin’s advocacy of an à la carte pricing model that would allow consumers to pick and choose the channels they subscribe to instead of buying pre-packaged bundles.While the FCC lacks the statutory authority to impose à la carte rules on the industry, some Washington analysts believe Mr Martin’s support of the idea has coloured his dealings with the industry on other issues.
732;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Yahoo and Bebo in adverts move;;"Yahoo is seeking to boost advertising revenues via a deal to sell most of the display ads on Bebo, the leading social networking site in the UK which is also growing quickly in the US.This will be the first time Yahoo supplies advertising to a social networking site, and is part of the company’s efforts to extend its advertising reach beyond its own web pages.Bebo had 18m unique visitors in June, mainly in the 13-24 age group, with 63 per cent from Europe and 22 per cent from North America, according to ComScore World Metrix.Yahoo already has deals in the US with Ebay, Comcast and about 250 newspaper internet sites, but the agreement made by its UK and Ireland unit will be its largest deal in Europe. Yahoo declined to reveal financial details.Yahoo’s rivals, Google and Microsoft, have already signed similar advertising partnerships with MySpace and Facebook respectively.Social networking sites are becoming increasingly popular with advertisers as teenagers and young adults flock to them. Some analysts are predicting that these sites will be the next internet powerhouse, as they become young people’s entry point to the internet.Joanna Shields, president of Bebo’s international operations, said the company had been courted by several internet advertising companies, but chose Yahoo in part because of the company’s behavioural targeting technology, which allows it to tailor ads very closely to a particular audience.“We are quite conservative on advertising on our site. There is only one ad on each profile page; there is just that one opportunity, and we have to be careful who we choose. Distasteful ads could really detract from the site,” Ms Shields said."
733;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-09-06T22:26:35Z;Net neutrality hopes hit by DoJ criticism;;The US Department of Justice threw its weight behind telecommunications operators on Thursday, warning telecom regulators against imposing so-called ‘net neutrality’ rules that would block carriers from charging content providers premium prices to prioritise some web traffic.While the ultimate decision over whether to impose new regulations on how broadband internet providers transmit and deliver internet traffic over their networks rests with the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Justice’s comments represent a significant blow to content companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and eBay.The companies have been pushing for net neutrality regulations in an effort to restrict the ability of the big telecoms carriers such as AT&T and Verizon Communications and cable operators like Comcast that would like the option to charge some users extra fees for carrying certain web content such as video.In comments submitted to the Federal Communications Commission, which is considering the highly contentious issue, the DoJ said that precluding broadband providers from charging content and application providers directly for faster or more reliable service, “could shift the entire burden of implementing costly network expansions and improvements on to consumers”.Thomas Barnett, the department’s antitrust chief, added: “Consumers and the economy are benefitting from the innovative and dynamic nature of the Internet. Regulators should be careful not to impose regulations that could limit consumer choice and investment in broadband facilities.”The DoJ’s comments follow a report in June by antitrust experts at the Federal Trade Commission that expressed similar views and recommended that regulators “proceed with caution” on any such proposals.The issue came to a head last year in Congress when some lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to pass legislation that would have enshrined the so-called net neutrality principle. Since then the FCC has been studying the issue but the five commissioners are believed to be deeply divided on the issue..Last year, the FCC approved AT&T’s $86bn purchase of BellSouth after AT&T promised to maintain net neutrality for two years. It was one of several key concessions that AT&T made to ease concerns about competition.On Thursday, the DoJ said proponents of new regulations had failed to show that many consumers had been harmed in a way that would justify government intervention. It noted that differentiating service levels and pricing is a common and often efficient way of allocating scarce resources and satisfying consumer demand.“The US Postal Service, for example, allows consumers to send packages with a variety of different delivery guarantees and speeds, from bulk mail to overnight delivery. These differentiated services respond to market demand and expand consumer choice,” the department said.“Whether or not the same type of differentiated products and services will develop on the Internet should be determined by market forces, not regulatory intervention.”
734;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Virgin Media selects headhunters;;Virgin Media has appointed Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm, to find a new chief executive, amid uncertainty over whether an outsider will be willing to take on the role as potential bidders evaluate the cable company.The move follows last month’s sudden departure of Steve Burch, who became chief executive just 19 months earlier after a search also led by Spencer Stuart.The terms of his departure meant Mr Burch received a lump sum of $1.5m, or two years’ salary, and up to 250,000 shares, worth $5.9m at the last trading price, after signing a non-compete agreement and agreeing to remain available to the company for six months. Neil Berkett has been promoted from chief operating officer to acting chief executive officer.Mr Burch came from Comcast, and the choice of Spencer Stuart’s US office has been seen by some people familiar with their appointment as evidence that Virgin Media may again look for a veteran of the US cable industry.However, Virgin is understood to have instructed the firm to conduct a global search. It is also understood to have made clear that it would favour an executive with experience of the UK media market, where intense competition from British Sky Broadcasting, BT, Carphone Warehouse and the publicly funded BBC has hampered Virgin Media’s growth.Spencer Stuart’s mandate could favour Mr Berkett, who has led the operational integration of the former NTL and Telewest cable platforms. Mr Berkettt declared his interest in the chief executive’s job in an interview last month with the Financial Times.Many other executives are thought to be wary of joining the company at a time when its talks with private equity groups and other suitors are on hold.Disclosures about the extent to which Mr Burch had been left out of discussions with bidders have highlighted the hands-on role played by Jim Mooney, Virgin Media’s chairman.Mr Mooney, based in the US, took the lead on the negotiations with private equity groups and other suitors, leaving potential bidders with the impression that Mr Burch had been sidelined from strategic discussions.The auction, prompted by a $33-per-share approach from Carlyle Group, was delayed indefinitely by volatility in the credit markets, which raised questions about the feasibility of raising the estimated $20bn-plus debt and equity package needed to take over Virgin Media.Virgin Media declined to comment.
735;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
736;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-08-30T23:01:11Z;GE pays price for credit crunch;;General Electric, the world’s biggest corporate borrower, on Thursday highlighted the sea-change in the markets since the summer’s turmoil when it paid much higher interest rates to raise debt.The world’s second-biggest company by market value, and a benchmark for other companies looking to issue, will have to pay an extra €7.2m a year to borrow about €1.9bn as investors demanded much higher premiums in the post-liquidity crunch climate.The deal, the first significant corporate bond issue in the European markets since July, is a warning sign to other lower rated issuers as September, traditionally a heavy month for raising debt, approaches.Other issuers forced to pay higher interest rate charges recently have included Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Comcast, the US cable operator.GE Capital Corp, GE’s financing arm, is rated Aa1 by Moody’s and AA+ by Standard & Poor’s, the second-highest level on the investment grade scale.If GECC has to pay higher debt charges, then lower rated issuers, especially those in the junk-grade arena, could face serious difficulties as they seek to refinance.The uncertainty forced the high-yield market to shut down in Europe this month.Not a single deal was attempted, according to Dealogic, while in the US only $2bn (€1.46bn) was raised in high-yield bonds.Robert Whichello, head of European debt markets at BNP Paribas, said: “The world has fundamentally changed. It is a much tougher credit market, particularly for lower rated issuers.”Dominic White, a fund manager at Morley Fund Management, agreed: “It is a buyers’ market now. The pendulum has certainly shifted in the favour of investors.”However, bankers and corporate finance directors drew positive conclusions from the deal and praised GECC for pushing ahead in an uncertain market.GECC priced €1.5bn and £600m (€890m) in 60-year subordinated bonds to yield 100 basis points over mid-swap rates – the pricing reference point for European bond issues.The company priced a bond structured in the same way in September 2006 at 62 basis points over mid-swaps, which means it had to pay an extra 0.38 percentage points in today’s market.
737;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-08-17T02:06:43Z;MGM closes $500m United Artists fund deal;;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s United Artists subsidiary on Thursday closed a $500m financing deal amid a tightening credit environment that has seen plans for a separate $1bn slate fund postponed by MGM.The United Artists financing, which was arranged by Merrill Lynch, is for a slate of 15-18 films to be developed by Paula Wagner and Tom Cruise over five years. The two took over the running of the subsidiary last year when they left Paramount.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has shelved plans to raise a $1bn fund for MGM amid a global credit crunch. Goldman Sachs was one of a number of banks, including Deutsche Bank, which had pitched financing proposals to the studio.However, Harry Sloan, MGM’s chief executive, said the decision to delay the financing was taken by MGM. “It was us that slowed it down,” he said. “We slowed it down because we wanted to get the UA deal out of the way.” He added that MGM was “never pushing to close” its own slate deal.MGM is keen to raise funding for its own productions from third-party investors. Like other Hollywood studios, it hopes to spread the risk associated with costly film productions.But with global credit markets tightening on the collapse in the subprime lending market, raising finance from outside investors has become difficult.Mr Sloan said he was relaxed about any delay because none of the films the company wants to make using third-party money are to go into production imminently. Films in the fund include the next James Bond film, The Hobbit and Terminator 4.Mr Sloan also expressed optimism that the studio would succeed in raising the fund. “There’s never been an opportunity to invest in the Lord of the Rings movies or in James Bond,” he said. “This is truly unique and it will stand out, which is why so many banks are so interested.”Mr Sloan is overseeing the turnaround of MGM, having been brought in to run the studio by Providence, Texas Pacific Group, Sony and Comcast, which acquired the company in 2004.He moved to revive MGM’s United Artist brand last year by bringing in Mr Cruise and Ms Wagner, who had left Paramount in bitter circumstances. Under the pair, United Artists will release four to six films a year. The first to be developed by them, Lions for Lambs, will be released later this year.The second, Valkyrie, a second world war drama starring Mr Cruise, will also be covered by the financing. The film is being shot in Germany and will be released next summer.“The closing of this financing is an important milestone for the new United Artists,” said Ms Wagner. “It leaves us perfectly poised to realise our vision of making movies that are both important and commercial.”Mr Sloan added he was ”pleased to see such strong support from Wall Street for Tom and Paula and their team, which has enabled us to close this significant transaction within nine months of launching a new United Artists”.
738;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-08-16T19:39:30Z;Credit crunch hits $1bn MGM finance plan;;The credit crunch shaking world markets has hit Hollywood after Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, which were trying to raise up to $1bn to finance films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, withdrew their offer to underwrite the deal.Bringing in private equity, hedge fund and institutional investors to fund “slates” of several films has become a popular way for Hollywood studios to spread the risk attached to production.But with credit markets tightening, proposals by the banks to raise $700m-$1bn for MGM productions and co-productions have been put on ice, according to people close to the situation.The financing would have provided funds for films including The Hobbit, an MGM co-production with New Line Entertainment, and the fourth instalment in the Terminator franchise. It is also likely that funds would have gone towards the next James Bond film, an MGM coproduction with Sony.Goldman declined to comment and Deutsche did not return calls. Plans for the financing have not been abandoned, however, and could be revived later this year, people familiar with the matter said.But the underwriting withdrawal amid a broader credit crunch means the deal will be delayed. It is unclear when it will be revived.MGM also declined to comment. However, the studio is understood to be relaxed about the delay because none of the films in line to receive funds from the financing is due to start production imminently.MGM was sold to Texas Pacific Group, Providence Equity Partners, Sony and Comcast in 2004. The four shareholders bought the studio and its 4,000-title library from Kirk Kerkorian for $4.8bn.Since the sale, MGM, under Harry Sloan, has changed its business model, streamlining operations and beefing up its distribution business, where it has deals with independent producers including The Weinstein Company.Mr Sloan has also revived the United Artists label, which is controlled by MGM, bringing in Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner, the film star’s production partner, to run the division.UA is close to securing $500m financing for its productions. The deal is being arranged by Merrill Lynch.Meanwhile, MGM is keen to boost its film library by producing a limited number of “tent-pole” movies each year. With the average cost of a Hollywood film close to $100m, the studio is keen to tap other sources for production funds.Other studios, such as Warner Bros Entertainment and 20th Century Fox, have raised funds from private equity and hedge fund investors. More than $12bn has been committed to film financing projects in the last year, with investors attracted by deals that allow them to share in the success of films that perform well at the box office.
739;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-08-14T01:54:37Z;Qwest names telecoms veteran as CEO;;Qwest Communications, the fourth largest US telecommunications group, on Monday named an experienced telecoms executive and retail manager, Edward Mueller, as its new chief executive.He will succeed Richard Notebaert, who is retiring on Wednesday, having steered the Denver-based telecoms group back from the brink of bankruptcy. Mr Notebaert flagged his intention to step down several months ago.Mr Mueller, the former chief executive of the Williams-Sonoma retail chain, said he wanted Qwest to continue to provide good customer service and have profitable growth while keeping spending disciplined.Before joining Williams-Sonoma, Mr Mueller spent more than 34 years in the telecoms industry, holding senior executive positions at SBC, Pacific Bell and Ameritech where he was chief executive from 2000 to 2002.Commenting on his appointment on Monday, Mr Mueller, 60, said: “I think we do win through people and service. When you combine the company’s improved financial position and impressive set of assets, there’s a great opportunity for continued growth.”Mr Mueller will take over at a time when Qwest is struggling to expand revenues in the face of the continuing decline in traditional voice revenues and growing competition from cable TV network operators.Qwest’s revenues have been little changed for five straight quarters, reflecting the residential phone customers lost to cable rival Comcast. In the latest quarter, Qwest, the main telephone service provider in 14 mostly western states, lost 279,000 phone lines overshadowing the addition of 100,000 broadband customers.Until recently the company’s expansion has been constrained by a hefty debt burden, which totalled $26bn when Mr Notebaert took over as chief executive in June 2002 following the departure of Joseph Nacchio amid a multi-billion-dollar accounting scandal.
740;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-08-09T18:40:48Z;Telecoms switches on to web TV;;"The flat-screen television in Randall Stephenson’s office in downtown San Antonio, Texas is tuned to the CNBC business news channel. But AT&T’s chief executive is not watching broadcast, cable or even satellite television. The video signal feeding his desktop television is running over the telecommunications company’s new broadband video network, dubbed “U-verse”.AT&T’s U-verse service uses a rapidly emerging technology called IPTV (internet protocol television) that many analysts and industry insiders believe is poised to become the standard for next-generation television delivery. Despite some early technology hiccups, IPTV could help revitalise a telecoms industry facing the steady decline of traditional fixed-line voice revenues. In the process, it could also disrupt the traditional television broadcasting industry and create a new distribution channel for media companies and content creators big and small.“We are in the calm before the storm,” says iSuppli, a California-based market research company. “As the major telecom carriers deploy services, there will be an escalating battle for subscribers between cable, satellite, IPTV and internet TV/video-on-demand.”IPTV services are mostly being rolled out by telecoms companies and internet service providers. They can deliver multiple channels of high-quality television and video content over dedicated broadband links to specialised television set-top boxes in consumers’ living rooms. Programmes are typically viewed on ordinary television sets.IPTV has the same technology underpinnings as internet television services, which are usually watched on PCs – they are based on the IP technology standard that powers the internet and the web, in which small packets of data are sent down a communications link and then reassembled at the other end. But while internet television services are offered on a “best-effort” basis, IPTV operators generally control the network from end to end and are therefore able to provide guaranteed quality of service. This is important because viewers – particularly those who pay to receive a signal – have grown to expect a high-quality service free from picture freezes, interference and other anomalies.In addition, IPTV services are usually bundled with broadband internet access and other video services such as video-on-demand. Most also include interactive options that enable consumers to control aspects of the viewing experience such as camera angles, watch multiple channels simultaneously and receive e-mail messages or incoming caller ID information on their television set.IPTV works quite differently from traditional broadcast TV networks such as cable or satellite systems. In these systems, all the content is pushed down to the consumer’s set-top box. With IPTV, by contrast, only the content selected is pulled from the network.This frees up precious bandwidth and makes IP-based networks much more efficient than their traditional counterparts. So, for example, a 25Mbps (megabits per second) broadband connection of the type being installed by AT&T in the US can support the viewing of two simultaneous high-definition channels and two standard-definition TV programmes.AT&T is one of dozens of telecoms groups – led by operators in Europe and Asia – that have turned to IPTV technology in the past few years to deploy the television and advanced video services that they believe are necessary to compete head-to-head with cable operators and drive a new video-based wave of growth.“The total number of IPTV households will grow dramatically over the next five years, rising from just under 6m homes worldwide in 2006 to more than 80m in 2011,” predicts Strategy Analytics, a US-based telecoms consultancy.European telecoms groups have been in the vanguard of this trend. “Western Europe dominates the IPTV market, with 68 per cent of global IPTV subscribers,” says Ditterberner, an international market research company that tracks broadband usage. “Only Asia, with 28 per cent, has a comparable slice of the market.”While Hong Kong-based PCCW claims the largest number of IPTV subscribers, with around 700,000, six of the top 10 providers are based in Europe and include France Telecom, Spain’s Telefónica, Belgacom and Italy’s FastWeb. France Telecom, which had around 450,000 IPTV subscribers at the end of last year, ranks as Europe’s biggest supplier, while rival operators Free and Neuf Cegetel are both in the top five.Meanwhile, Telefónica is exporting its IPTV model to its subsidiaries in Latin America – CTC Chile and Telesp Brazil – as well as O2 in the Czech Republic, and has set a target of garnering between 1.2m and 1.4m subscribers for its Imagenio service by the end of next year.The strength of the IPTV market in Europe reflects a combination of factors: particularly intense competition, which has forced service providers to be more aggressive in signing up IPTV subscribers; the recent launch of many operators’ IPTV services; and the spread of pan-European carriers such as BT, France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and Telefónica.The US is noticeably absent from the top 10 IPTV nations, partly because of the strong position of incumbent cable and satellite providers and the fact that most commercial IPTV deployments to date have involved small local and rural carriers. About 85 per cent of US households subscribe to cable or satellite services.“In North America, the IPTV battle lines have been drawn between the cable television companies and the telecommunications providers,” says Frank Dickson of iSuppli. “The cable companies offer a significant installed base of pay television subscribers and fast data rates using their cable modem technology as they expand their services into data and voice communications. “For their part, the telecommunications providers view the cable companies’ incursion into the voice realm as an act of war. The telcos have little choice but to respond.”The launch of new IPTV services provides telecoms companies with the opportunity to hit back at cable companies that are using their own broadband internet pipes to offer high-speed internet access and voice telephony based on VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology. Both groups are hoping that by offering cut-price “triple” or “quad-play” bundles of data, video and voice – potentially both wireless and fixed-line – they can attract and retain customers.AT&T’s Mr Stephenson believes that the ability to offer mobile services gives the telecoms operators a key advantage in this “battle for the living room”. “Wireless service is the most personal of the services,” he says, “and that gives us an advantage.”AT&T is spending $6bn (€4.4bn, £3bn) to roll out the U-verse network based on hybrid copper/fibre-optic communications links, set-top boxes from Motorola and Cisco’s Scientific Atlanta unit and the core IPTV “middleware” (software that glues other components together) from Microsoft.“Here is how I think about IPTV,” says Mr Stephenson. “Every decade we do one major infrastructure, transformative-type technology deployment. If you go back to the 1980s it was wireless – we started from zero and we invested billions in building a business. Now it is a $40bn business growing at double-digit rates.“In the 1990s that foray was broadband and we invested billions in deploying broadband into the infrastructure and it changed the company. In the 2000 decade, it is IPTV. IPTV is a transformative type of architecture and infrastructure that I think will change what this company looks like five years from now.”For AT&T and its counterparts in Europe and Asia, the move into television and advanced video services comes at a critical time. “Telecommunications companies increasingly are looking to IPTV offerings to augment their declining voice communications revenue,” points out iSuppli’s Mr Dickson.But industry executives say the rush to offer IPTV services is about much more than simply offsetting the loss of traditional fixed telephone access lines. “Operators clearly want IPTV to do more than just plug the dam of leaking subscribers,” noted a recent report from Accenture, the IT consultancy. “As attested by their aggressive roll-outs, hope is building in the industry that IPTV will translate into major revenue growth.”IPTV is expected to deliver more than just video, offering access to digital music, on-demand gaming and data services, as well as having home security applications. As a result, iSuppli expects the global market for IPTV video services to grow to $26.3bn in 2011, up from just $779.2m in 2006.“Telcos view IPTV as an opportunity to recapture the revenue generated by many of the internet-based services that have bypassed them by travelling through their broadband pipes,” says Mr Dickson. In the past few years both cable and telecoms network operators have watched as internet start-ups such as Google’s YouTube, News Corp’s MySpace and social networking services such as Facebook have built huge new internet audiences.The move towards IPTV is part of a much broader trend towards converged IP-based services. Ultimately, as telecoms companies and other network operators move towards an entirely IP-based architecture, analysts believe that video will be offered as “just another service” alongside voice and data.In the meantime, the impact of the rush to develop IPTV services and the shift towards IP-based infrastructure has triggered a slew of mergers and acquisitions among telecoms and network equipment makers. “A spate of corporate acquisitions is redrawing the competitive landscape in the world of IPTV and telco TV,” says Michael Arden of ABI Research.Motorola, one of the leading set-top box makers, Cisco Systems, Alcatel and Ericsson have all made strategic acquisitions in the past 18 months. As Carl-Henric Svanberg, Ericsson’s chief executive, told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting: “IPTV will drive traffic and generate more equipment needs as well as exciting opportunities in services and multimedia.”But even IPTV’s most ardent boosters agree that technical prowess and even discounted prices will not assure IPTV’s success. Ultimately, they note, IPTV service providers will have to offer differentiated services including unique content in order to win customers away from established video providers such as cable television and satellite operators.That could prove a challenge for telecoms operators which, despite recruiting from the ranks of cable companies and Hollywood, have little or no experience negotiating content deals, let alone creating their own content. IPTV providers are, however, already beginning to offer other features designed to differentiate their services, including niche programming, user-generated video and interactive features such as user-selected camera angles and instant polling.If the new players on the video block get it right, the potential for IPTV could be substantial. “Subscriber and revenue growth in the IPTV market will be awesome,” predicts iSuppli’s Mr Dickson. But while he sees enormous potential growth for IPTV services, he is also careful to put the numbers in perspective.“Comcast [the largest US cable TV operator] had 2006 pro-forma cable revenue of more than $26bn,” he notes. “It is very likely that the entire worldwide IPTV industry in 2011 will not be as large as Comcast alone is.”"
741;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-07-26T20:45:15Z;Wall Street suffers heavy losses;;Wall Street stocks declined sharply on Thursday as disappointing company earnings and housing data compounded growing fear over the US credit market.Bad earnings news from the housing sector continued as DR Horton, the homebuilder, reported its first-ever quarterly loss. Its shares were down 1.8 per cent at $17.16. Beazer Homes also posted a $123m quarterly loss, sending its shares down 8.7 per cent at $15.56. This followed second quarter losses reported late on Wednesday from Pulte Homes, whose shares sank 3.1 per cent to $20.04 on Thursday. Ryland Group bucked the trend in the sector and its shares gained 1.3 per cent to close at $33.36.“The credit market does not feel great. Liquidity and sentiment are the worst since 2002,” said Tom Murphy, corporate sector team leader at Ameriprise Financial. He said the speed of the repricing seen in credit valuations and the decline in liquidity had made investors question their overall investment thesis. “The market has issues and people are rethinking their views on valuations,” he said.At the close of trade in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 2.3 per cent at 1,483.17 having rebounded from its low of the day of 1,465.30, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1.8 per cent down at 2,599.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.3 per cent lower at 13,473.82.“The S&P 500 has steadily appreciated for nearly five years without a 10 per cent correction and the market is concerned that a pullback of that magnitude is due,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.The CBOE’s Vix index of market volatility hit a new high for the year of 23.36 during the day before settling at 20.79.Purchases of new homes in the US dropped more than forecast in June, signalling no end to the real estate slump and further hurting investor estimates.Sales fell 6.6 per cent, the sharpest drop since January, to an annual pace of 834,000 last month from a revised 893,000 rate the prior month. It was less than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said.Investors were further rattled when Standard & Poor’s said in a Sydney conference call that US subprime losses were exceeding their expectations and historical losses.“Prices and spreads have become much more volatile as traders and portfolios back away from markets that they used to know and love,” said William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS.A barometer of bank risk in the derivative market is the 10-year swap spread. It was trading at 73 basis points early on Thursday, its widest level over the 10-year Treasury yield since 2003.“There is zero confidence among market traders as to whether 10-year swap spreads are 20bp too wide or too narrow,” said Mr O’Donnell. “Treasuries remain the one market still functioning and, as such, the place where most desire to be these days.”In other earnings news, Exxon Mobil reported a 1 per cent decline in in second-quarter net income, hurt by weakness in natural-gas. Its shares fell 5.4 per cent to $87.81, despite rising crude oil prices.3M posted a quarterly profit rise of 4 per cent and also raised its outlook for 2007 profit. The stock was 0.5 per cent higher at $90.05.Shares in recently floated private equity and hedge fund groups Blackstone and Fortress Investment Group also suffered, although Blackstone later recovered.Shares of Fortress tumbled 6.6 per cent to $19.3 but Blackstone closed 0.7 per cent higher at $25.70, from a low for the day of $23.27.Financials were once again hit by continuing subprime concerns. Bear Stearns shares were down 3.9 per cent at $124.25 while Citigroup lost 2.9 per cent to close at $47.81, JP Morgan fell 2.6 per cent to $44.08 and Goldman Sachs fell 4 per cent to close at $195.12.Ford swung a second-quarter profit sending its shares up 1.5 per cent to $8.09.Apple was the one bright spot. Its announcement that its profits had jumped 83 per cent in the second quarter prompted a gain of 6.4 per cent to $146.00.In economic news, durable goods rose 1.4 per cent in June after a decline of 2.3 per cent in May. Orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a gauge of business investment, fell 0.7 per cent after a decline of 1.5 per cent in May.Bristol-Myers Squibb raised its earnings outlook, but the midpoint of its new range was still below Wall Street estimates. Its shares fell 5.5 per cent to $29.85.Comcast declined 4.7 per cent to $27.21 amid a large number of cancelled subscriptions despite largely positive results.Dow Chemical narrowly beat estimates with a 2 per cent profit rise but still fell 4.9 per cent, to $43.45.
742;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-07-15T18:54:13Z;Providence revives its Virgin Media interest;;Virgin Media is understood to have been approached by Providence, the private equity group, about reviving its interest in taking over the cable group.An information memorandum is being prepared for Virgin Media, which received an offer proposal this month from private equity group Carlyle Group, for at least $32 (£15.73) per share, valuing the cable group at about $23bn including debt.Providence is understood to be part of a consortium of rival private equity firms considering a counter-offer. Last year, it led a group including Blackstone and KKR, which approached the cable company with an offer of about $34 a share.First-round offers are expected next month, with the second round in August.There is growing concern about volatility in debt markets and the effect on private equity investors’ ability to finance their acquisitions.Virgin Media recently hired UBS to search for trade buyers, but companies such as Comcast and Liberty Global may be wary of buying a company facing intensifying competition.
743;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-07-12T23:01:00Z;Virgin Media to pursue buyer potential;;Virgin Media, the UK cable company that is the target of private equity investors, on Thursday appointed a second investment bank in an effort to attract buying interest from US and international cable companies amid concerns that market volatility could make a private equity deal less of a safe bet.The company, formerly called NTL Telewest but rebranded as Virgin Media after British billionaire Sir Richard Branson took a 10.1 per cent stake, held a board meeting in New York on Thursday to discuss its options, according to people familiar with Virgin Media’s plans.Last week, Virgin Media’s board appointed Goldman Sachs to review “strategic alternatives” after it received an offer proposal from Carlyle Group, the private equity company, for at least $32 per share, valuing Virgin Media at about $23bn (£11.3bn), including debt.UBS was hired Thursday to pursue the potential for “strategic buyers”, and bankers have already started a round of phone calls to US cable industry giants Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable, people familiar with the events said. They are also talking to Liberty Global, which owns cable properties throughout Europe.None of the companies would comment.However, people familiar with their strategies indicated none of these would be likely buyers of Virgin Media, which has recently lost market share in UK broadband internet connections to British rival BSkyB, the satellite operator controlled by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. Virgin Media and BSkyB have also clashed over BSkyB’s purchase of a stake in ITV, done to prevent an acquisition by Virgin Media.Private equity investors are considered to be more likely eventual buyers of Virgin Media, although due diligence and the sales process is expected to take several more months and is in its early stages.In the meantime, volatility in debt markets has led to some concerns about whether private equity investors will be able to continue to finance their acquisitions at the current low interest rates.A consortium led by Providence Equity Partners, which was rebuffed by the former NTL last year, is still considering its options.
744;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-07-05T19:47:04Z;Cablevision Systems;;Could the Dolans miss out on the prize yet again? Their third offer, in May, to take Cablevision private for $22bn, finally won over the special committee – which deserves credit for pushing the price up a full 54 per cent from the original June 2005 bid (adjusted for the special dividend).But even at $36.26 a share, the price is no knock-out when compared with other cable valuations. A few high-profile investors, including T Rowe Price and Gabelli Asset Management, have signalled that they believe the offer is still too low. Their views are being reinforced by Cablevision’s performance. The company’s own projections in a recent proxy filing underline the expected cash flow improvement ahead, partly as heavy capital spending tapers off. That is a reminder of why the Dolans want the asset. It also shows how they could justify paying more, even though Cablevision faces increasing competition from Verizon.There remains the thorny problem of Dolan family control through super-voting shares. In a straight auction, Cablevision would probably fetch a price well above $40 from a strategic bidder. But the Dolans have said they will not sell, meaning the rest of the shareholder base cannot realise that full value. All they can do is vote down the Dolans’ offer if they think the company is worth more.The fact that Cablevision shares are trading above the offer price suggests that is possible. But it is not the best solution for either side. Instead, external shareholders could accept that the Dolan family votes have real monetary value. How about a deal that secures the best value for all shareholders from a sale of the key cable assets to Time Warner or Comcast while offering the Dolans the chance to buy Cablevision’s other assets, including Madison Square Garden, at an attractive price? That might just keep everyone happy.
745;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-06-11T22:07:58Z;T Rowe Price happy to buck trends;;T he stock market has been driven by value rather than growth investing for seven years, and few fund managers have ridden the cycle more comfortably than T Rowe Price.Investors have poured money into the conservative Baltimore-based firm. Its assets under management have risen by almost 50 per cent in the past two years, to $350bn. T Rowe’s own share price has almost doubled in three years.The group’s refusal to participate in the dotcom boom, which at the time made it appear something of a dinosaur, turned out to be a boon.Brian Rogers, who has managed the group’s flagship $25bn Equity Income fund since its inception in 1985, has been chief investment officer since 2004 and also stepped up to become chairman of the company last year.Mr Rogers is one of a few managers who have consistently outperformed the market. Since 1985, his fund has returned an annual average of more than 13 per cent – coincidentally, about the same return as the average hedge fund over that time.His unpretentious style reflects the company. His cluttered office is festooned with books, awards and his children’s drawings, and he is accompanied at his interview with the Financial Times by a high school intern instead of the usual public relations team.Like others, Mr Rogers believes the stock market is overdue for a shift from value to growth stocks: “The value structure of the market now is tilted towards growth, it’s also probably tilted in favour of large-cap stocks . . . the shift has taken longer than most people expected, because these shifts always take longer than expected.”As a value investor, how does he manage money in a growth cycle?“You move incrementally away from where you traditionally are, without making a quantum change in your investment strategy. A lot of it is fairly easily done,” he says.For the past two years, for example, Mr Rogers – like a few other leading value managers – has been heavily buying General Electric, which is now the biggest stock in his portfolio.“I compare GE with our local electric and gas utility, Constellation Energy, which sells at 21 times [earnings] with a 1.8 per cent dividend yield. GE sells at 15 times with a 3 per cent yield. So which is the cheaper stock?”He contrasts GE with Citigroup, which is one of a handful of stocks he has held since the 1980s and is lagging in its share price. Both companies have chief executives following near-legendary predecessors – Jack Welch at GE and Sandy Weill at Citi.“A lot of the problems at Citigroup are leadership-related. There’s a lot of turnover, it’s a huge institution, a couple of hundred thousand. Managing that has to be difficult. Is Chuck Prince an inspirational enough leader to run a company that big and that global? I think that’s the fundamental question,” he says.“It is tough for someone to succeed Sandy Weill, and that’s Chuck’s biggest challenge. But nothing can help a stock succeed more than a very concerned management team, and I think the management team is quite concerned over how the company is being perceived. As an investor today that’s what you bet on.“But I have a much higher exposure to JPMorgan Chase, because they don’t face the leadership issues.“At GE, look at the actual performance and the profitability of its divisions. Jeff Immelt (chief executive) has done a lot to reshape their business, and their financial results have been quite good. Their stock performance hasn’t been as strong. Investors wonder what will it take to notice good performance at General Electric?”“At Citigroup the company appears to be struggling, concerns about expense growth relative to revenue growth, a lot of change in top management in a company not known for developing its management as much as GE would be.Mr Rogers has more than 120 stocks in the Equity Income fund portfolio, with turnover of less than 20 per cent a year (the typical actively managed fund has a turnover of close to 100 per cent).Like many value investors, he has made some big plays in old media, with mixed results.“Comcast was off 50 per cent last year, we moved out of that …Tribune will be probably a break-even investment for us. Dow Jones will be great if it (the $5bn takeover bid by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation) happens. New York Times, we’re in quicksand for the rest of our lives,” he says, ticking them off.Mr Rogers happily discusses his stock-picking mistakes, which include Eastman Kodak.“The perpetual value trap,” he says cheerfully. “It now has a $7bn market cap, it’s a small-cap stock. Thirty years ago it was probably $25bn when that was real money. What we didn’t know was just how quickly their traditional film business would fall out of bed, and how they were unable to replace that profitability through digital business.”“Boston Scientific, that was another one. We didn’t lose a lot on that, but shame on me, because I know that after a giant overpriced deal, you wait. In the case of Boston, they bid a lot for Guidant, paid a huge price.”“I timed a very good investment in AOL/Time Warner after that humunguous deal and $100m-plus loss of shareholder value. I became a shareholder after the deal fell apart.”T Rowe Price is not known as an activist investor, but one area where its hackles have been raised is the trend to leveraged buy-outs by private equity firms. It has recently voted against several such deals.“We have been frustrated by the dynamic of management involvement with an LBO firm taking a company private. There are all sorts of conflicts …it might not result in the optimal price for the owners of the company,” Mr Rogers says.He believes that taking a company private, then doing an initial public offering again a few years later at a higher price, enriches the private equity firm and possibly the management, but not the shareholders.He also thinks the private equity industry is in a bubble. “This reminds me so much of the deal activity we saw in the late 1980s, just before the implosion of Drexel, the massive widening of spreads as the economy slowed. The behaviour, the number of deals, the bidding, the little cultural symptoms, [Blackstone chief executive] Steve Schwarzman’s birthday party – how is that different?”In keeping with its conservative investment philosophy, T Rowe Price has grown almost entirely organically, unlike its Baltimore neighbour, Legg Mason, which has grown largely through acquisition. That appears unlikely to change.“There are ample growth opportunities out there that we can benefit from without doing a big acquisition,” says Mr Rogers, who also points out that the inflows have been so high that the group is almost in danger of taking in more than it can manage.“Our observation as investors has been that it’s tough to make deals work. History is littered with promises of operating synergies, etc. Look at Daimler: buys Chrysler for $30bn-plus, and they’re selling it for $7bn. The failures are much more commonplace than the successes.“From time to time we have thought if there were the right deal in fixed income, we would contemplate that, but we can also do that organically. Also, the thing about fixed income is [that] those businesses command high prices to buy, but they are a lower-fee business than equities. Would we entertain or consider the right fixed-income deal? Absolutely. Would we do a very big deal? No.”He says fixed income is one field where he expects the company to grow, especially in quantitative fixed income. Non-US investors are also growing rapidly, and now account for about $24bn of total assets under management.The flavour of the month, hedge funds, is something T Rowe Price is unlikely to entertain. “If that were a huge underserved market where we had a unique capability, we would go into it. It is a huge market, but absolutely not under-served. There are 8,000 competitors out there, 8,000 funds. Do we have a distinctive capability there? Unclear.”For an investor, what is good value now?“Quality fixed-income investments are inexpensive because there’s been such a narrowing of spreads and everyone wants credit risk, and nobody wants the 10-year T bonds,” Mr Rogers says.“Big growth companies are relatively cheap. European equities are reasonably valued, things related to the housing sector in the US are becoming interesting value because so many have been corrected.“One questions is: what will happen in relation to commercial real estate? There are signs of fragility. Can residential real estate fall out of bed and not take commercial with it?“But valuations generally aren’t that high. I’m fairly optimistic, and have felt that this year will be a good year. I went into it thinking it wouldn’t be as profitable as last year, with the S&P up 15 per cent. The market is up 7 to 8 per cent, earnings have been good, it hasn’t been a bad time.”
746;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-06-10T21:07:49Z;Hollywood studios in video talks with Apple;;Apple is in advanced talks with Hollywood’s largest movie studios about launching an online film rental service to challenge cable and satellite TV operators.The service could be significant for Apple. If it signs enough studios, the group will get access to more premium film content.Apple already sells films that can be downloaded and owned, and has distribution deals with Walt Disney and Paramount. Other studios have shied from tie-ups with Apple because of concerns that digital downloading may hit DVD sales.But studios will be more enthusiastic about joining its video-on-demand service. Films downloaded to rent are unlikely to affect DVD sales.Apple, which declined to comment, is believed to be aiming for an autumn release.A film would cost $2.99 for a 30-day rental. Its digital rights-management software would allow films to be moved from a computer to at least one other device such as the video iPod or iPhone. The software would prevent movies being copied.One studio executive said the service would “compete against cable companies and anyone else offering VOD into the home”.VOD is a growing revenue stream for cable companies, such as Comcast, and satellite operators, such as DirecTV. Online services also offer VOD, including Microsoft’s Xbox Live, Movie­link and Unbox, a joint venture between Amazon and TiVo.However, none of these has a customer base as large as Apple.Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Warner Bros and Disney declined to comment. Privately, though, the studios are excited about Apple getting into VOD. “When you think about Apple customers they are so connected to the brand they will try anything to do with it,” said one senior studio executive.
747;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-06-10T21:07:49Z;Apple gets head start in online rental;;After selling film and television downloads and changing the way people consume music with the iPod, Apple’s latest venture will see it enter a business normally associated with Blockbuster and other DVD rental chains.The group has been quietly working on a new online film rental service, which will allow movies to be downloaded and viewed on a rental basis. The move has big implications for the DVD rental industry, as well as cable and satellite operators, which are waking up to the power of video-on-demand.Films tend to be released on VOD after they have appeared in cinemas and after they have been made available to rent or buy on DVD.However, Comcast, one of the largest cable operators in the US, recently completed a test in Denver and Pittsburgh where films were made available on VOD at the same time as they were released on DVD.The group reported a sharp increase in VOD sales and is hoping to extend the service, provided it can secure the agreement of Hollywood studios.This is not expected to be too difficult because profit margins on films rented via VOD are much higher than on DVD rentals. Studios receive almost $2.50 for every $4 movie rented via VOD by a cable subscriber. But the studios receive only $1.20 per $4 movie rented on DVD.With Apple set to enter the fray with its own service, pressure on the studios to bring forward the VOD “release window” is likely to increase. This would spell bad news for Blockbuster, as well as Comcast, DirecTV and other US pay-TV operators.VOD is one of several services that US pay-TV operators bundle together to make their subscriptions more attractive to consumers. “With cable and satellite, you pay for the privilege of accessing content that you may never watch,” says Jeff Rutenbeck, dean of communication and creative media at Champlain College in Vermont.Apple’s VOD service would allow consumers to rent films without having to take out a costly cable or satellite subscription, he adds. Apple would not be the first company to launch an online VOD service. Microsoft, Amazon and Movielink all have online film rental services.But Apple has a built-in advantage: its hardware.It has sold an estimated 15m video iPods and will soon launch its keenly anticipated iPhone, which will also be able to play film and video content. Apple’s proprietary digital rights management system means only content downloaded from iTunes can be played on these devices.The device that stands to benefit most from the launch of an Apple VOD service is Apple TV, however. The box allows content downloaded from iTunes to be viewed on a normal TV set. The company has not disclosed Apple TV sales but reports have suggested the product is struggling.That could change once there is high-quality content available to download and rent. “VOD gives the Apple TV box a lot more utility,” says one senior Hollywood studio executive. “Right now it’s just a way to move stuff from iTunes to your TV but it will end up becoming a way to directly order a movie to your TV.”Apple has already dabbled with online movie downloads selling several million titles. But Jonathan Weitz, a principal with IBB Consulting, a media consulting firm, says a VOD service from Apple will be more popular with consumers.“Consumers don’t want to own media – they want to consume it,” he says.“We believe that VOD on TV and online will eventually be larger than electronic sell through of video content.”Apple’s iTunes store, he adds, “started its life as a way to get people to buy - and keep – their iPods. Now [Apple] knows there’s also this vast market in the living room. iTunes and VOD can get them into the living room in a much bigger way.”
748;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-05-02T02:34:29Z;Key legal characters begin to emerge;;As the curtain lifted on Rupert Murdoch’s bid for Dow Jones, a little-known Boston lawyer and the most famous mergers and acquisitions attorney on Wall Street emerged as key characters.Since 2005, Michael Elefante, a lawyer at Hemenway & Barnes, has been the primary trustee for the Bancroft family on the board of Dow Jones.Two weeks ago, that role thrust him into the spotlight when he began polling family members for their reaction to News Corp’s proposal.It was Mr Elefante who communicated the Bancrofts’ initial rejection of the News Corp bid on Tuesday, and his role could grow further if Dow Jones and News Corp were to enter negotiations.The family has retained Martin Lipton, the founding partner at Wachtell Lipton and one of corporate America’s top rainmakers, to advise it. Credited with devising the “poison pill” takeover defence, in 2004 he helped Walt Disney fend off a $60bn hostile bid by the cable operator Comcast.A number of banks have also been engaged, including Merrill Lynch for the Bancrofts, Goldman Sachs for Dow Jones, and JPMorgan, Centerview Partners, and Allen & Company for News Corp.
749;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-04-26T17:50:39Z;Comcast hails US video-on-demand trials;;Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, on Thursday reported success in early trials to make movies available through on-demand downloads on the same day as they are released for sale on DVDs.The trials, which are taking place in Denver and Pittsburgh, include movies from seven studios: NBC Universal, Warner Brothers, Paramount, Disney, Fox, Lionsgate and New Line Cinema.Comcast said its revenues from pay-per-view movie downloads had grown steadily in the past few quarters. For the first time the company released specific information about this segment, saying that, in the first quarter of the year, pay-per-view revenue was $181m, up 26 per cent on the previous quarter.“The trials show an increase in purchasing of movies,” said Steve Burke, president and chief operating officer at Comcast. He said the service, with movies priced at $3.99, would be extended to at least one other city and could be made available to all of Comcast’s customers.The trials, which started a few months ago, are part of Hollywood’s efforts to find new ways to distribute movies digitally.The profit margins of digital distribution - either through cable companies or the internet - are higher because there are fewer costs but there are concerns that these new methods might eat into other source of profits such as DVD sales or movie sales to television networks.Although there are efforts to build up distribution of movies online, there are concerns about piracy, which is less worrying when distributing on a closed system like a cable network.Comcast itself is also moving into online video distribution, recently acquiring movie information site Fandango.com and announcing plans for a site to distribute professionally produced television and movie content on the web.As well as selling cable television services, Comcast offers high-speed internet connections and telephone connections, and demand for these has soared, especially as Comcast offers broadband speeds which are faster than some telecom offerings.“Cable is now unmistakably regaining market share [from telecoms rivals] in broadband,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.Specifically, Comcast, increased its quarterly profits by 80 per cent to $837m (including a one-off $300m gain from the dissolution of a cable partnership), and saw revenues increase by 32 per cent to $$7.39bn.
750;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-04-16T21:59:30Z;Comcast agrees online video deal;;Comcast, the US cable group, on Monday became the first media company to sign a content deal with an online video venture being developed by News Corp and NBC Universal.Under terms of the deal, Comcast will supply clips from its E!, Style and Golf Channel networks for distribution on the new venture in exchange for a share of associated advertising revenue.Comcast will also serve as a distribution partner, adding its Comcast.net website, which draws 15m unique visitors a month, and Fancast.net, an entertainment site the company plans to launch this summer, to an internet network that already includes AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo, MySpace and others.The agreement is another sign of the frantic efforts by media companies to move into the burgeoning market for online video, which is fast attracting audiences and advertisers. YouTube, the video site acquired by Google last year for $1.65bn, has so far dominated the field.Yet traditional media companies, wary of being dependent on Google, are rushing to develop their own online alternatives. Last month, News Corp and NBC announced their venture, which will offer viewers their television, films and other video content and be supported by advertising.The companies pledged that their roster of distributors would immediately allow the new venture to reach more than 90 per cent of the internet audience.In spite of those benefits, major content companies have yet to sign on. CBS last week announced the formation of its own online distribution network in what was seen as a rebuttal to the partnership. In a sign of the multiple bets being cast by the companies, Comcast is also part of the CBS network.George Kliavkoff, NBC’s chief digital officer, said NBC and News Corp had been overwhelmed by requests from content companies, and expected others to follow Comcast’s lead. “It does validate the business model we’ve put in place – both in terms of content and distribution,” Mr Klilavkoff said.He also noted that Comcast would be supplying video syndication technology to the News Corp and NBC venture.The deal follows Comast’s acquisition last week of Fandango, a website that includes film information and ticket sales. Comast plans to turn the site into an entertainment portal, Fancast, that will guide users to television, films and other content on a range of digital devices.
751;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-03-23T22:28:55Z;Vonage shares dive on patents ruling;;Vonage, the leading voice over internet protocol company, was dealt a blow on Friday when a judge ruled that it should be barred from using key Verizon patents, sending its already battered share price reeling further.It said the decision would not affect service for its customers, but investors remained unconvinced as its shares plunged 26 per cent, or $1.05, to $3.The ruling by a court in Virginia is a fillip for traditional telecoms companies against their internet telephony rivals, and could prove to be a landmark case affecting the ability of other emerging VoIP providers, such as Packet8 and Sunrocket, to operate without licences.The rulings are the latest troubles to hit Vonage, which has suffered a baptism of fire since it launched as a public company last year. It made one of the worst market debuts in New York in recent memory on its IPO last May as its shares dropped 13 per cent on their first day.Verizon welcomed the decision, which bans Vonage from using VoIP technologies, including features such as call waiting and the conversion process from internet protocol to telephone, as well as certain Wi-Fi patents.“We’re pleased the court has decided to issue a permanent injunction to protect Verizon’s patented innovations for offering commercial quality VoIP and Wi-Fi services,” said John Thorne, Verizon’s deputy general counsel.Vonage will have two weeks to convince the court to stay the injunction, while it appeals the ruling delivered earlier this month that it had infringed Verizon’s VoIP patents, granting the telecoms giant $58m in damages plus monthly royalties.“We remain confident that Vonage has not infringed on any of Verizon’s patents,” said Sharon O’Leary, Vonage’s chief legal officer. Analysts think it unlikely that Vonage will be forced to shut down service as a result of the rulings, arguing that it will be able to find a way around the patents, or sign a licensing agreement with Verizon.Vonage, a pioneer in VoIP, has struggled to make money since its troublesome flotation. Although it has managed to add customers, they have proved expensive to attract, while it has experienced a very high churn rate. The ruling is likely to be a big distraction for Vonage from its aim of breaking even next year. Vonage’s sales doubled to more than $607.4m last year, whereas Verizon delivered sales of $88.1bn.Verizon and other big telecoms companies will welcome the ruling in helping to reduce the threat of independent VoIP providers.However, cable companies such as Time Warner and Comcast, and their VoIP offerings, packaged in with television and internet, pose a more serious worry than the small internet telephony providers to the telecoms giants.
752;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Apple aiming to tempt traditional TV viewers;;Millions of video clips are available for viewing free on the internet, through video sharing sites such as YouTube or MySpace and hundreds of other websites.Yet the appetite for watching traditional television does not appear to be waning. Nielsen, the media research company, released a study this week showing that the average US home now receives a record 104 television channels, eight more than a year ago.The actual television set itself is also featuring more prominently than ever before: the average US home now has more televisions than people, according to Nielsen, with 2.8 sets compared with 2.5 people.Connecting the 110m US households that watch television with the hundreds of channels that they increasingly demand is a hugely profitable business for cable and satellite operators, such as Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable and DirecTV.However, there is a question whether the imminent introduction of Apple TV – potentially the most user-friendly device yet to allow people to set up a wireless connection between their television and computers and watch video content stored on their hard drives – could undermine the business of cable and satellite operators.“It [Apple TV] isn’t the first attempt at solving the ‘last 10 foot problem’ of connecting the PC to the TV but in light of Apple’s track record with music it is likely to be regarded as the most credible,” says Douglas Shapiro, analyst at Bank of America.Yet to have any impact on the business of providing multi-channel television, such online video needs to be a replacement for the services offered by cable and satellite. Operators are increasing choice for the viewing public by making popular programmes available on-demand.Also, in the US the growing use of digital video recorders means people can easily record favourite programmes and watch them when they want.Indeed, the focus is on providing more high-definition channels to allow the growing number of people who are investing $500 and more in top-range, flat-panel televisions to watch high-quality content. In contrast, internet videos, such as that on YouTube, are generally of relatively poor quality, and short in duration.The Apple TV does not offer unlimited access to video on the internet but instead mainly allows users to watch content stored on Apple’s iTunes online music and video service. As a result, Mr Shapiro says it is a “supplement to traditional pay-TV: it isn’t a threat to cable or satellite within a reasonable investment time horizon”.Indeed, large cable companies such as Comcast have stressed that the growing demand for internet video is good for them, not bad, as it is one of the factors fuelling consumer willingness to pay for faster broadband connections, many of which are provided by cable operators.For the media and entertainment companies that make movies and television shows, the introduction of Apple TV and other digital outlets is also increasingly being regarded as an opportunity to make more money, not less.Beth Comstock, president of digital media and market development at NBC Universal, said even a year ago there was a concern that digital distribution would eat into television audiences.“Growth [of digital businesses] is not at the expense of TV audience,” Ms Comstock said. “The internet does not cannibalise our TV audience, a fear we had even a year ago. We find it reinforces and actively builds brands.”Apple’s iTunes service is already one of the most popular ways of watching professionally produced video content on computers. Many media groups are licensing their movies and shows to iTunes, and people are paying to download them.Yet in terms of concrete revenues, these distribution methods are barely significant relative to the large amounts generated from cable and satellite operators and the sale of DVDs.Ms Comstock herself is charged with ensuring that NBC Universal generates $1bn of digital revenues by 2009. Although significant, even such an ambitious target compares to total revenues last year of more than $16bn.The real loser of a successful Apple TV launch could be DVD sales and rentals. “Efforts to connect the PC to the TV, particularly Apple’s, could eat into the home video rental or DVD sales pie,” says Mr Shapiro.
753;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-03-17T01:00:00Z;Still images capture hi-def market;;"Creators of expensive high-definition video and TV channels may be dismayed to learn that the second most popular HD channel on the Comcast cable network is made up entirely of still pictures.
GalleryPlayer’s channel is second only to the ESPN sports channel in the ratings, although the Seattle company admits its viewers may not always have their eyes on the screen.
It believes it has created a new category, which Kevin Akeroyd, chief executive, labeled as “HD Lifestyle Imagery” when I spoke to him on the fringes of the TV of Tomorrow show in San Francisco this week.
Consumers want to have some kind of visual muzak to show on their big-screen HDTVs when they host parties rather than have the equivalent of a black hole in their wall.
GalleryPlayer has negotiated rights with picture libraries and museums to create tasteful high-definition slideshows from the Art of Claude Monet to pictures of great golf course and 1,000 Places To See Before You Die.
After the considerable start-up costs of acquiring images and the technology to ensure correct formatting, the company expects to be making profits by next year.
It is exploiting numerous distribution methods – PC screensavers distributed through Google Pack and Windows Media Center, DVD sales of images, channels on HD providers such as Comcast and hotel channels.
Moving images will be next. Don’t expect any live sports action, said Mr Akeroyd, but burning log fires, aquaria and spectacular waterfalls are expected to be just as popular with his big-screen customers."
754;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-03-08T22:28:12Z;Time Warner Cable plugs into consolidation war;;Time Warner Cable’s timing was not the best. It chose March 1 to become a publicly traded company – the week stock markets around the world fell sharply.Time Warner Cable’s top management joked about their timing in a call to investors about the company’s growth prospects, led by the strong demand for its video, internet and telephone services. They also flagged up last year’s $17bn acquisition of Adelphia, the bankrupt cable operator, as a growth opportunity, which gave it a strong position in the key Los Angeles market.Since then, they have no doubt been watching the hourly moves in Time Warner Cable’s shares. Launched at just over $39 per share, a week later they were trading at just under $37. So far, just 16 per cent of Time Warner Cable shares are traded. Its parent, media giant Time Warner, retains the other 84 per cent.What will matter more than their short-term moves, however, is what happens to the shares over the next year or more. Although Time Warner Cable is the second-biggest US cable operator with over 13m television subscribers (Comcast is number one with 24m) at some point analysts anticipate the company will need to expand.Cable companies already offer many of their TV subscribers high-speed internet access. Increasingly, they are selling a third service, telephone access, and mobile phone connections could follow. The popularity of such bundles, dubbed triple play, is leading telecom rivals like AT&T and Verizon to step up investment in television.One benefit of scale is the ability to negotiate better terms for television content. For most cable companies, one of the biggest factors putting pressure on margins has been rising programming costs, and containing those is crucial.“Time Warner Cable shares will be boosted this year through the effective integration of the Adelphia systems and the success of the triple play offering. This will be a prerequisite before its newfound currency can be used to ultimately consolidate the smaller cable companies in the industry,” says Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.He adds: “Being number two in cable will be less important in a few years. Time Warner Cable will need to be bigger to have a seat at the table with Comcast, AT&T and Verizon.”Last year, cable companies such as Comcast and Cablevision were among the year’s top performers, with Comcast’s shares rising over 60 per cent. Investors, who had fled the sector amid fears of a price wars among cable, satellite and telecom giants, returned, drawn by the popularity of the service bundles.This year, values have declined, but many analysts remain positive.“We continue to be bullish on the operating fundamentals for the cable industry and believe that valuations for cable stocks have lots of upside to them,” says Katherine Styponias, analyst at Prudential Equity Group.Even if markets continue to wobble on economic concerns, she said this might not be bad for cable. “Cable businesses tend to hold up very well in tough economic times as consumers rarely turn off their cable TV subscriptions as a way to save money,” says Ms Styponias.Consolidation in the cable business is widely regarded as likely to start next year. Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, recently said he thought it was a “three- to five-year process.”With many cable companies controlled by families or individuals, it is hard to predict what might trigger decisions to sell.Cablevision, based in the New York area, has been a potential acquisition target for Time Warner for decades. Although Charles Dolan, whose family controls the group, came close to selling in the past there is no sign that he is willing to cede control.There are other possibilities. Atlanta-based Cox Communications, one of the first to go private, might be a target.Charter Communications, in which Paul Allen of Microsoft fame is the biggest shareholder, would also be a natural fit for Time Warner, not least because buying it would allow it to control all of Los Angeles, a city it now dominates following the Adelphia deal. Another possible target is Insight Communications, which is focused on the Midwest.Time Warner Cable is already preparing for the battles ahead. “We are going to evaluate how we manage our capital structure,” John Martin, Time Warner Cable’s chief financial officer, said last week. “We are looking to maintain enough financial capacity to fund our current business plans, as well as keep enough flexibility to be able to go out and seize on any unique opportunities, should they present themselves.”
755;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-03-01T00:03:41Z;DirecTV looking at broadband bundles;;DirecTV is still considering ways of offering 15m satellite television customers high-speed internet access, but whether such services are essential and whether technology needs to be owned or leased are “open questions”, said Greg Maffei, chief executive of Liberty Media.Liberty, controlled by cable industry pioneer John Malone, in December agreed to buy a 38 per cent stake in DirecTV in exchange for its 19 per cent voting stake in News Corp, the media group controlled by Rupert Murdoch.The deal, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by July. News Corp shareholders are due to vote on April 3.Mr Maffei said Liberty’s investments and experience in telecommunications and technology companies, such as satellite broadband provider Wild Blue, allowed the company to “be a good partner” to DirecTV as the satellite group continues to map out its strategy.Strong competition from cable operators, such as Comcast and Time Warner, offering high-speed internet connections and telephone services, in addition to multi-channel television, has led to some concerns that it will be more difficult for satellite operators to compete.Mr Maffei said the questions relating to such bundles were important, but there were still a lot of unknowns.In the meantime, DirecTV would continue to offer bundled products to customers through partnerships with telecoms companies such as Qwest, Verizon and AT&T.However, in the future, Mr Maffei said, wireless internet access could be more important. “There continue to be new forms of broadband arising. Whether we need to buy or lease and whether we need to have the bundle supertight are open questions,” he said.Liberty Media said on Wednesday that profits rose at Starz, its content company, and QVC, the home shopping business. The company also announced that it planned to buy back up to $1bn of shares.Separately, Time Warner Cable, the second-biggest US cable operator, said it was expecting sales and operating profit to grow more than 30 per cent this year.The forecast comes as the company prepares for its shares to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. About 16 per cent of its shares will be publicly traded, with media group Time Warner retaining the other 84 per cent. Time Warner Cable said on Wednesday its revenue in 2006 was $11.8bn and operating profit was $4.2bn.Much of the focus for Time Warner Cable this year will be to integrate the cable systems it acquired from Adelphia.
756;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-02-27T18:06:22Z;Cablevision sees surge in subscribers;;Cablevision, the cable operator based in the New York area, strongly increased its subscribers for its video, internet and telephone services in the fourth quarter despite growing competition from telephone rival Verizon.The company reported revenue growth of 18.6 per cent for its cable business, but its overall performance was lower due to a weaker performance of other divisions such as its cable networks and the Madison Square Garden sports venue.The Dolan family, which controls Cablevision, tried to take the group private but its offer was rejected by a committee advising the board after the family refused to raise it further.The company’s results show that its ability to gain customers due to its popular “triple-play” bundle continues, but Cablevision suggested its growth had peaked. In 2007, Cablevision said cable revenues would be in the “mid-teens”, down from over 18 per cent in 2006.“Growth is no longer accelerating but it is certainly not hitting a wall, either,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.“Despite the impressive growth, we remain cautious about Cablevision’s ability to sustain their industry-leading momentum in the face of mounting penetration for all of their advanced services and a Verizon competitive threat,” he said.Verizon, one of two telecoms giants in the US, is upgrading its systems and offering high-speed internet and video services alongside its traditional telephone connections in the New York area, meaning it will particularly compete with Cablevision.Higher interest expenses and charges related to contract disputes, as well as expenses related to its New York Knicks basketball team, led to a loss in the fourth quarter of $23.9m, compared with earnings of $64.6m a year ago.Total revenues rose 13 per cent of $1.69bn, from $1.49bn a year ago, Cablevision said.For the cable business, revenues increased by 18 per cent to $1.2bn, with operating income up 12 per cent versus a year ago to $195m, Cablevision said.The company said it would reduce its capital expenditure in 2007. Comcast, the biggest cable operator in the US, caused investor concerns after it said it would increase its capital expenditure.Comcast is behind Cablevision in terms of the number of subscribers it offer the triple-play bundle to.“[Cablevision’s] capex guidance implies a decline in 2007,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS. “This is a positive read-through for Comcast as some investors have been concerned that capex is on the rise for the industry.”Cablevision shares were steady on Tuesday at around $28.9 per share. Together with other companies in the cable sector, the company’s shares have gone up sharply since last April when they were trading at just over $19 per share.
757;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-02-09T01:51:03Z;Fox takes ‘business-friendly’ stance;;"Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp will launch a Fox business channel in the fourth quarter, taking a more “business-friendly” approach than rival CNBC which currently dominates television business news.Mr Murdoch, speaking at a conference in New York, said the Fox Business would cover business scandals but would not “leap” on them the way he said CNBC did.“It [CNBC] has an atmosphere which is a little bit negative,” he said.Roger Ailes, the head of Fox Television and father of the Fox News Channel, went a step further, saying that CNBC’s reporters only got excited about profits “the day they negotiate their own contracts”. CNBC shot back, saying they were “not surprised that the alleged competition has begun its typical onslaught of lies and propaganda”, adding: “Bring it on.”The new Fox channel will reach 30m US homes at its launch through cable operators such as Time Warner and Comcast.It cleared a crucial hurdle last month when News Corp secured distribution in the vital New York market.However, media executives have questioned whether there is room in the market for another business channel, particularly given CNBC’s dominance.Aided by strong markets and distribution in 80m homes, the NBC Universal network earned more than $275m in profits last year, according to people familiar with the matter.While he acknowledged CNBC’s popularity, Mr Ailes predicted that Fox’s business channel could overtake it in less than five years. He declined to comment on the specific nature of the programming, but suggested that he would focus on retail investors.“The investor group of citizens is growing,” he told the Financial Times. “People are becoming more interested in their own security – both physical security and financial security.”Mr Ailes also said that Fox Business would benefit from synergies with the news channel, such as sharing studio and production space.Fox’s plans have already spurred speculation as to whether the network would try to poach talent from CNBC, particularly Maria Bartiromo, the star anchor who came under scrutiny for her relationship with Todd Thomson, a recently fired Citigroup
executive.Mr Ailes said he was not speaking to Ms Bartiromo about a Fox job at the moment."
758;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Comcast unveils large investment plans;;Comcast, the biggest cable operator in the US, on Thursday revealed a further sharp increase in subscribers and profits in the fourth quarter.But its shares fell on the back of higher-than-expected capital spending plans for this year.The cable group has been rapidly rolling out telephone connections in addition to its internet and video services. Offering this bundle of products – triple play – has resulted in more subscribers across the board and higher profitability.“I think simply it may have been our best year ever,” said Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive, referring to 2006. “Triple play …is the driver of what has changed in the business.”On the video side, Comcast added 110,000 basic subscribers in the fourth quarter of last year, its strongest growth in 10 years. The total of 24.2m exceeded many analysts’ expectations. It added 488,000 high-speed internet subscribers, and 508,000 new telephone customers in the quarter.Net profit in the fourth quarter rose to $390m, or 18 cents per share, from $133m, or 6 cents a share. Revenue was up 30 per cent to just over $7bn.Comcast shares were trading 3.4 per cent lower at $41.97 in midday trading in New York, mainly because of the company’s estimate that capital expenditure this year would total $5.7bn, nearly $1bn more than most analysts had expected.The shares have had a dramatic rise, up more than 55 per cent from a year ago, as investors put aside concerns about a price war with telecom rivals and decided that cable operators would gain customers as they offered a wider range of products in more places.Mr Roberts said he wanted to build on this “first-to-market advantage”.“We can capture market share now,” he said. “We’re going to invest capital to drive that growth.”
759;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Time Warner calls cable spin-off a priority;;Turning Time Warner Cable into a separately traded company is top of the list of priorities at Time Warner this year as the media group tries to increase its share price further, Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive, said on Wednesday.Once the listing is completed, however, Mr Parsons indicated he did not think the shares would be used for other big cable acquisitions in the immediate term. Further consolidation in the US cable market was a “three- to five-year process”, he told the Financial Times.When new shares of Time Warner Cable could begin trading remains unclear. The timing partly hinges on decisions by a bankruptcy judge about a plan to pay the creditors of Adelphia Communications, the cable group acquired last year by Time Warner and Comcast for more than $17bn.Mr Parsons stressed that Time Warner was still working on a second route to listing the cable business, through a traditional initial public offering. The company would not comment on timing, but a listing by one of these routes is expected in the next three months.Shares in Time Warner – which owns Warner Brothers film studios, cable channels such as CNN and Cartoon Network, Time Inc magazine publishing and the AOL internet business – have risen about 25 per cent in the past year.Results for the fourth quarter of 2006, released on Wednesday, showed that cable remained strong, with operating income up 26 per cent to $633m and revenue up 58 per cent to $3.65bn. Total revenues for the quarter were $12.5bn.Analysts have said Time Warner shares could move higher if cable is spun off, as they have not gained as much as cable rivals such as Comcast.Time Warner’s shares underperformed for years but have recently improved. Confidence stems from the prospects for AOL, as it gains online advertising market share, the cable business and the company’s $20bn stock buy-back plan, which will be completed in the first half of this year.Mr Parsons said that changing the stock market’s perception of AOL “as a company that will grow again” remained key, as was developing “digital extrapolations” for all businesses.
760;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
761;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Verizon spin-off frees up resources;;Verizon Communications further reduced its debt on Tuesday by agreeing a $2.7bn deal to spin off part of its fixed-line business in New England and merge it with FairPoint Communications, a company focused on rural and small urban markets.The deal, part of Verizon’s strategy to sell non-core assets in order to free up resources to build new services for its urban customers and faster-growing wireless business, is expected to reduce Verizon’s debt by $1.7bn.The Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont ex-changes include around 1.5m access lines, 180,000 high-speed internet customers and around 600,000 long-distance customers, Verizon said in a statement.Once the deal is completed, which is expected within the next 12 months, Verizon said its shareholders would own about 60 per cent of the new company and shareholders in North Carolina-based FairPoint the remainder.Verizon shareholders will receive about $1bn in stock, and the new company will take on around $1.7bn of debt.“This agreement provides a fair value for this property and allows Verizon to focus more intently on operations in other markets,” said Virginia Ruesterholz, president of Verizon Telecom. Analysts at Bear Stearns said Verizon was getting a “relatively attractive” price of around $1,800 a line.Telecom, cable and satellite companies are increasingly aiming to sell video, internet and telephone services to each other’s customers. Cable operators such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable are rolling out telephone services bundled with video and high-speed internet offerings. In response, Verizon and others such as AT&T are upgrading their networks to offer high-quality television and high-speed internet.The costs of doing this are considerable, with Verizon planning to spend $18bn.
762;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Cablevision;;It is amusing to hear the Dolans warn that the uncertainty created by their bid for Cablevision risks harming the company (and that independent directors should make a speedy decision on their latest take-private offer). After all, the controlling shareholders have done their best to keep the US cable operator in flux for two years, with strategic U-turns, family feuds and more than one attempt to buy it on the cheap.So what should outside shareholders make of the latest bid? Not much. The family has added 11 per cent to its (hardly knock-out) October offer. Over the same period, shares in sector heavyweight Comcast have risen 17 per cent. According to Sanford Bernstein, the Dolans’ latest bid values Cablevision’s cable assets at a discount to those of Comcast. That is hardly the takeover premium shareholders might expect, especially given Cablevision’s high-quality customer base in the New York area and the potential for the Dolans to sell the business to Time Warner.The special committee has been right to hold out so far. Shareholders are certainly better off than they would have been if the June 2005 offer (equivalent to $23.50 a share on Friday) had been accepted. But cable valuations keep running away from the Dolans. Given where the sector stands today, the committee should reject the $30 now on the table.
763;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-01-03T22:51:07Z;Time Warner Cable nears trading date;;New shares of Time Warner Cable could begin trading in January following the approval by a bankruptcy judge of a plan to pay the creditors of Adelphia Communications, the cable group acquired by Time Warner in 2005.Once the plan is confirmed in the courts, it is expected that the Time Warner Cable shares could start trading soon after, removing the need for a lengthy and potentially expensive initial public offering process to list the cable division of media group Time Warner.“Based on when the plan is actually confirmed, it likely means the Time Warner Cable shares will be declared effective [and trade] some time in mid-January,” said Katherine Styponias, analyst at Prudential Equity Group.Adelphia, once the fifth-biggest cable companies in the US, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002, just before its founder, John Rigas, was arrested. Mr Rigas and his son, Timothy, were convicted in 2004 of conspiracy and securities fraud and were sentenced to 15 and 20 years in prison respectively.The cable group was jointly acquired in 2005 by US cable giants Time Warner and Comcast for more than $17bn in cash and shares. The plan is for Adelphia to use a 16 per cent stake in Time Warner Cable to pay its creditors, a move that analysts said could also increase the value of Time Warner shares if a higher value is attributed to its cable division as a result.Spinning off part of Time Warner Cable could also make it easier for the cable group to make future acquisitions.Last year, cable stock prices rose strongly due to a switch in investor sentiment, as fears of a price war with telephone rivals for bundles of television, internet and telephone services were set aside. Although Time Warner’s shares rose in 2006, they underperformed those of cable companies such as Comcast, with shares up more than 65 per cent last year. Time Warner on Wednesday said it had no comment on the timing of the trading of Time Warner Cable shares.
764;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2007-01-02T22:39:33Z;Fox Business in NY distribution deal;;News Corp on Wednesday secured a distribution deal in the New York market for its proposed Fox Business Channel, clearing one of the key hurdles to the cable network’s expected launch later this year.The agreement was struck with Time Warner Cable, the second-largest US cable operator, as part of a broader pact that included a multi-year renewal and big pay raise for News Corp’s Fox News Channel.Under the agreement, Time Warner will pay News Corp 10-15 cents per subscriber for the right to carry the business channel, according to an executive briefed on the agreement.Although that rate is relatively low, the deal is vital because it will give Fox Business coverage in the New York market, where Time Warner’s 11m subscribers are concentrated – something Rupert Murdoch, News Corp’s chief executive, had set as a precondition to the channel’s launch. In November, News Corp lined up a commitment from Comcast, the largest US cable operator, to carry the planned business network.Meanwhile, News Corp is also set to receive a windfall from Time Warner for Fox News. Beginning later this summer, the cable operator will begin to pay about 75 cents per subscriber as part of the new agreement. That amount is roughly three times what Time Warner paid a decade ago when its first agreed to carry Fox News, and similar to a deal agreed late last year by Cablevision.A Fox spokeswoman confirmed the deal, but declined to comment on its financial terms. Time Warner Cable did not immediately return a call for comment.When Fox News debuted in 1996, the network generally settled for “carriage” agreements in which the nation’s cable operators paid it 15 to 25 cents per subscriber. News Corp executives have been looking toward a round of renewal deals with cable operators as validation for Fox News as well as a potential source for hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenues.While Fox News still dominates Time Warner’s CNN and other cable news rivals, its 2006 ratings were down about 15 per cent from last year.Some analysts have predicted that Fox would suffer as the Republican revolution has ebbed. But Roger Ailes, head of the Fox Television and the network’s founder, has pointed to ratings declines throughout the cable news industry – CNN lost 9 per cent from 2005 – and attributed the losses to a weak news season compared with the prior year.
765;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-12-05T20:41:11Z;Line Losses;;"US phone companies have been losing access lines to cable rivals (and to a lesser extent, VoIP companies like Vonage) for the past few years. But could the trend be slowing?Richard Lindner, AT&T’s chief financial officer, says he believes the access line losses have reached a plateau. ""Cable companies tend to make big penetration gains in the first year and then tail off,"" he told his audience at a Credit Suisse Media and Telecoms conference in New York.""Our expectation is that 2007 will not see an increase in access line losses.""AT&T, which faces telephony competition from Cox, Time Warner and most recently Comcast across much of its geographic footprint, is hitting back by deploying IPTV (Internet Protocol TV) service dubbed U-Verse.AT&T chose to invest in FTTN (Fibre to the Node) technology that uses copper for the final connection to the home rather than more expensive FTTH (Fibre to the Home) being deployed by rival Verizon Communications.Nevertheless AT&T says it remains confident that it will be able to meet demand for faster broadband data and advanced video services.""Our view at this point is that we’re not going to have go ‘fiber to the home,’ ""said Lindner. ""We are pleased with the bandwidth that we are seeing over copper. On average, at this point, we’re producing about 25Mbps (megabits per second), but in many, many locations, we are producing substantially more than that,” he said."
766;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-11-30T22:00:58Z;Providence to raise $8bn fund for deals;;Providence Equity Partners, the US buy-out group focused on media and telecommunications investments, is rapidly raising a fund worth at least $8bn for new deals, highlighting the ravenous appetite among pension funds for private equity.People familiar with the matter say letters marketing the new fund to potential investors were sent out less than a month ago, and Providence is gearing up for a “first close” as early as next week.On a fundraising drive of that scale, a “first close”, allowing Providence to begin drawing down money from the new fund for deals, would only be set once the firm had raised about $2bn, observers said. Providence declined to comment.The speed of Providence’s fundraising efforts offers further evidence of the attractiveness of private equity to pension funds, university endowments and specialist fund-of-funds.These investors have become increasingly ready to accept the higher risks of the buy-out industry in exchange for returns that typically exceed traditional equity and bond portfolios.This year more than $300bn has been poured into private equity, with most of the largest buy-out funds, from Blackstone to Texas Pacific Group in the US and Permira in the UK, benefiting from the inflows.Providence is targeting at least $8bn for its new fund, but could raise as much as $10bn if interest from investors continues to be strong, several limited partners said.The Rhode Island-based group, founded in 1990 by a trio of Brown University alumni, raised its most recent fund last year, worth $4.25bn.Providence has differentiated itself from larger rivals such as TPG and Blackstone by focusing exclusively on one area of expertise: media, telecommunications, and information technology.According to the Oregon Public Employees Fund, Providence’s 2000 fund returned 1.56 times its money, for a 30 per cent internal rate of return.It is too early to evaluate the performance of the 2005 fund, because many of the investments have not been exited.“We have a long-standing relationship with Providence and will be a cornerstone supporter in the new fund,” said Jim Leech, head of the private investment arm of the $88bn Ontario Teachers Pension Plan. “They have been a top performer.”Some of Providence’s most notable deals include its takeover of Casema, the Dutch cable group, that offered a return of about five times its money after it was sold this year. In addition, Providence is an investor in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film studio, and Warner Music, the US music group that went public last year. Providence is also part of a consortium that won the auction for Univision, the Spanish-language broadcasting group, and is bidding for Tribune.This week, Michael Angelakis, one of Providence’s top dealmakers, announced he would leave the company after seven years to become co-chief financial officer at Comcast, the cable group.
767;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-11-29T20:17:44Z;Executive poaching;;For a long time it has felt like one-way traffic. In a world of booming buy-outs and Sarbanes-Oxley regulation, executives have fled public markets for the privacy and financial incentives of private equity. That has been the case both for those running the companies in portfolios and for those joining funds to do deals.So it is rare to see somebody going against the flow. Michael Angelakis, a managing director at Providence Equity Partners, is heading to cable operator Comcast to be chief financial officer. Perhaps there is an element of lifestyle involved. With a young family, Mr Angelakis should have a more predictable schedule at Comcast than as a dealmaker. He will also have a different challenge, going back to his roots in management at a cable operator during a period of rapid change in the industry.His move highlights quite how much it costs to lure someone back from the lucrative world of private equity – where in many cases senior talent costs even more than at public companies. A chunk of his package is presumably to compensate him for money left on the table at Providence. But, on top of a $5m signing bonus and $5m in stock for walking in the door, he will get a $6m deferred compensation credit in 2007. He will also receive $4.9m worth of restricted stock and options. That is before his base salary of $1.5m, with a bonus of at least $4.5m a year if he meets performance targets.There is also an interesting question on Mr Angelakis’s timing. Is he getting out of private equity on a high? After all, a stable position at Comcast might look increasingly attractive in a few years’ time if today’s red hot buy-out market makes way for leaner years.
768;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-11-29T11:12:11Z;Telecoms: Big deals dominate industry;;The industry was electrified in March when AT&T of the US agreed to buy BellSouth, a smaller rival, for $89.4bn including debt. It is the second biggest telecoms transaction ever, and will create the world’s biggest telephone company if approved by regulators.But 2006 will also be notable for the deals that did not happen. Telecom Italia, Italy’s biggest telecoms company, abandoned any thought of selling off its domestic mobile business after running into opposition from the country’s prime minister. China Mobile, the country’s state-owned mobile operator, dropped plans to buy Millicom, a wireless business in emerging markets, at the eleventh hour, in an apparent loss of nerve.The value of telecoms deals in 2006 reached $309.6bn by November 20, according to Thomson Financial, the data company. That makes it the best year since 2000, before the internet and telecoms bubble burst.AT&T’s merger with BellSouth is driven by how cable television and telecoms companies in the US are squaring up for a fight to provide the same services: fixed line phone, mobile, broadband and TV. Just four companies are likely to dominate the landscape. From telecoms, AT&T and Verizon, and from cable TV, Comcast and Time Warner. Through the merger with BellSouth, AT&T acquires control of Cingular, the mobile business previously run by both companies. AT&T and BellSouth will be able to pool their efforts to deliver TV over broadband, called Internet Protocol TV (IPTV). The merger will also generate significant economies of scale, achieving annual synergies of $2bn from 2008.In Europe, some telecoms companies have put the brakes on deals after activity in 2005. Telefonica, Spain’s biggest telecoms company, has imposed a €1.5bn limit on net financial investments in 2006 after some of its investors expressed concern at the £17.7bn purchase of O2, the UK based mobile operator.Vodafone also put constraints on deals after investors last year accused it of overpaying for Telsim, Turkey’s second biggest mobile operator, which was bought for £2.6bn. In April, Vodafone sold Vodafone KK, its loss-making Japanese mobile business, to SoftBank, for £6.9bn in cash, and returned £6bn to shareholders.Expectations were raised that the private equity industry would purchase more telecoms assets after five companies joined forces to buy TDC, Denmark’s leading phone company, for DKr74.5bn last December. It was Europe’s biggest ever leveraged buy out.But some potential targets such as KPN, Holland’s leading telecoms company, appear to be out of private equity’s reach, at least for the time being, because strong operating performances have driven their shares higher.Bill Kennish, co-head of European telecoms, media and technology at Citigroup, says private equity is capable of deals that surpass the TDC buy out. But he adds: “There are value questions associated with some of the natural targets.”The one notable piece of private equity activity was Blackstone’s purchase in April of a 4.5 per cent stake in Deutsche Telekom, Germany’s leading telecoms company, for €2.7bn. Investment bankers say Blackstone’s purchase of a minority stake may be a one-off for private equity. But the lack of a controlling stake has not left Blackstone without influence. It was instrumental in the resignation of Kai-Uwe Ricke, Deutsche Telekom’s chief executive, earlier this month, after the company issued profit and revenue warnings in August.As with AT&T and BellSouth in the US, some European telecoms companies are trying to achieve economies of scale through deals. In February, Sonaecom made a €11.1bn offer for Portugal Telecom, its bigger rival. The offer has turned hostile after rejection by Portugal Telecom’s management.In April, France’s Alcatel announced plans to buy Lucent of the US, to create one of the world’s leading telecoms equipment makers. In June, Finland’s Nokia and Germany’s Siemens outlined a joint venture to produce network equipment.Many of the smaller European telecoms deals in 2006 have involved broadband, because high speed internet access is regarded as the core around which to sell bundles of services to customers. Time Warner sold its AOL internet access operations in France, Germany and the UK to Neuf Cegetel, Telecom Italia and Carphone Warehouse respectively.Next year could see cross border deals between Europe’s former monopolies for post, telegraph and telephone (PTT). The Greek government is expected to sell part of its 38 per cent stake in OTE, the country’s leading telecoms company, which also has mobile operations in Albania, Bulgaria and Macedonia. The government said in September that it wanted another European telecoms company to buy a stake in OTE and assist with management.Tom Wells, head of telecoms at Merrill Lynch for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says: “I think there is potential for some consolidation between PTTs, triggered by reductions in government ownership and the desire of buyers to get access to attractive asset portfolios.”Telecoms companies in emerging markets continue to see their valuations, based on multiples of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, increase markedly, because they are reporting strong revenue growth.MTN, Africa’s biggest mobile operator, which is listed in Johannesburg, agreed to pay $5.5bn for Investcom, a wireless business focused on Africa and the Middle East, in May. Investment bankers gasped when Etisalat, the Dubai based telecoms company owned by the federal government of the United Arab Emirates, won the auction for Egypt’s third mobile licence in July after it agreed to pay $2.9bn.Andrew Tisdale, global co-head of media and communications at Morgan Stanley, says: “The area where you have seen multiples go up in the last 12 months is in emerging markets, particularly for wireless operators. The forward multiples have gone up from eight to nine times, to 10-11 times.”In Asia, the Australian government finalised plans this month to complete the privatisation of Telstra, the country’s leading telecoms company, by selling the bulk of its 51.8 per cent stake to investors for A$15.5bn.PCCW, Hong Kong’s leading telecoms company, could come under new ownership after months of controversy. Richard Li, PCCW’s chairman, wanted to sell its main assets to foreign private equity companies, but in June he was blocked by China Netcom, the state- owned telecoms company, which has a 20 per cent stake. He then sold his controlling 23 per cent stake in PCCW to a consortium led by Francis Leung, an investment banker who disclosed that his backers included Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s richest man and Mr Li’s father. The sale has yet to be approved by regulators, but China Netcom could emerge as PCCW’s biggest shareholder.Meanwhile, in July, China Mobile pulled out of a $5.3bn purchase of Millicom, and the last minute withdrawal raised some uncomfortable questions.Some investment bankers claim the aborted purchase damaged the credibility of China, and its state-owned telecoms companies, to pursue global expansion. But Mr Wells says: “If we look forward some years and ask how powerful they can be outside of their home market, the answer is ‘Very’.”In a league of their ownBy James PolitiFour of the five investment banks in the top half of a global league table of telecoms M&A advisers owe their positions principally to AT&T’s agreement in March to buy BellSouth for $89bn. The advisory work on the mega-merger by Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Evercore Partners and Lehman Brothers helped distance themselves from most of their rivals.Clinching the mandates was the result of years of relationship-building by telecoms rainmakers at the banks. In 2004, Lehman worked for SBC Communications, AT&T’s predecessor, on the $41bn purchase of AT&T Wireless by Cingular, SBC’s wireless joint venture with BellSouth. In 2005, when SBC bought AT&T and took its name in a $16bn acquisition, Lehman worked for Ed Whitacre, the company’s chief executive. Fast forward to 2006, and Lehman was once again on the list of advisers when AT&T made its long-rumoured move on BellSouth.Citigroup’s relationship with BellSouth followed a similar path, from the company’s aborted merger discussions with the old AT&T and the sale of its Latin American mobile businesses, to the acquisition of AT&T Wireless by Cingular. BellSouth sat out much of the telecoms sector’s consolidation frenzy over the next few years, as Verizon bought MCI and Sprint combined with Nextel. But when Duane Ackerman, BellSouth’s chief executive, was finally ready to sell to AT&T, he once again turned to Citigroup.Among the boutique investment banks, Evercore Partners has developed a niche in media and telecoms banking. Led by Roger Altman, a former US Treasury official, Evercore worked on the AT&T-BellSouth merger and four more telecoms deals this year, which places it fifth in Thomson’s league table of telecoms M&A advisers.All the banks have been eclipsed by Goldman Sachs. It has almost $178bn of telecoms deals under its belt in 2006, according to Thomson’s data from January 1 to November 20. Given AT&T’s purchase of BellSouth dominates Thomson’s league table, some banks with strong telecoms groups that failed to obtain work on the merger have slipped behind. However, Morgan Stanley, which worked for Lucent during its acquisition by Alcatel, is fourth in the table. JP Morgan and Credit Suisse are sixth and seventh respectively. UBS was eighth, partly because of work for Vodafone on the sale of its loss making Japanese business. Deutsche Bank, which worked for Deutsche Telekom when Blackstone, the private equity firm, bought its 4.5 per cent stake, is ninth. Merrill Lynch is 10th.
769;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-11-29T00:21:13Z;Comcast names new CFO;;Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, has hired a senior private equity executive, Michael Angelakis from Providence Equity Partners, to become its new chief financial officer.Mr Angelakis is expected to join Comcast at the end of first quarter of next year as co-chief financial officer and to become CFO in 2008, when the current co-CFOs Lawrence Smith and John Alchin retire.He will join Comcast, which became the biggest cable group following a series of large acquisitions, at a time of intense competition between cable, telecom and satellite operators for television, internet and telephony customers.Providence is a private equity firm specialising in media investments which manages over $9bn. Mr Angelakis, who will receive a $5m signing bonus when he joins Comcast, is one of the few recent examples of private equity executives leaving this booming sector to join a large company.Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer of Comcast, said Mr Angelakis has “an outstanding background in media, finance, management and deal making”. “Providence Equity’s track record in media investing is best in class, and Mike has played an integral role in that success.”Mr Angelakis joined Providence in 1999. Before that, he was president and chief executive officer of State Cable TV Corp and Aurora Telecommunications.Following Comcast’s failed bid for Walt Disney a few years ago, stock market investors continue to speculate what the next target might be, with rumours regularly swirling that Comcast might seek to acquire a large mobile operator or a media company.Comcast’s shares have soared this year as investor concerns about a price war between cable operators and telecommunications rivals have eased. Comcast has produced strong financial results by selling customers a bundle of products, a strategy which is helping retain customers for longer too.
770;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-11-12T19:18:02Z;Internet optimism replaces depression;;American, British and other internet users are constantly bombarded with offers of low-priced internet connections.Accessing the web via a telephone line – which may sound old-fashioned but is still used by millions – costs just a few dollars a month.Yet people’s willingness to pay more than the absolute minimum needed for a basic web connection has surprised stock market investors. So much so that last year’s fears of an all-out price war that would erode profits – which hit cable and telecoms stocks – have all but disappeared.Many investors now think data distribution via the internet is not the commodity it was feared to be. This switch has led to an increase of more than 50 per cent this year in the shares of Comcast Corp, the biggest US cable operator, and sharp rises in cable and telecoms stocks in the US, Europe and elsewhere.“Providing broadband connections is the one element of communications services still seeing growth in the overall pie,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.“The view that distribution services are a commodity is being reconsidered. With the growth in new uses of the internet, such as watching videos online, people are paying more for using the broadband pipe.”Other factors that have contributed to the share rally include a switch of focus by investors from the potential for competition for subscribers to television, internet and phone services, and a realisation that there are other business lines.For telecoms groups, the growth of mobile services – as well as cost savings after huge mergers in the US and a reduction of price falls for business customers – has underpinned share prices.The potential for gains from mergers and acquisitions has fuelled shares of US satellite groups Echostar and DirecTV in particular. “Satellite TV investors are drunk with speculation about M&A,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. In addition, as cable, telecoms and satellite companies compete to provide customers with bundles of services, the reality has sunk in that it may take a long time for these companies really to battle head-to-head in large parts of the US.“It’s a bit like Coke and Pepsi,” said Larry Haverty, portfolio manager at Gabelli, which owns shares in the cable and telecom sectors. “There is room for both.” Nevertheless, analysts and investors say they are concerned that the replacement of last year’s gloom by an unquestioning optimism could lead to some dents later.For telecoms companies, the progress of the mergers will be closely watched, particularly following US government changes last week. Competition between cable and telecoms companies for both video and high-speed internet customers may come back into focus. Whether DirecTV and Echostar merge or are acquired could become clearer too.“Last year everyone was a loser. Now everyone is a winner,” Mr Moffett said. “That positive perception is unlikely to last for all the sectors.”
771;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;You can’t win ‘em all;;Explain this: a year ago, everybody was set to be a loser. Investors were paralysed by fear of a competition bloodbath between telecoms, cable, and satellite operators, leaving share prices in all three sectors in the doldrums. Now they seem to think all three sectors can be winners.In the past year, shares in Comcast, AT&T and DirecTV, the biggest cable, telecoms and satellite operators, are all up by between 45 and 60 per cent. That has occurred while the timing of any real clash has got closer – telecoms operators are starting to offer video, while cable is ratcheting up internet telephony.Why? Most obviously, operating results have been strong. Comcast has started to get its act together on internet telephony and is adding subscribers rapidly. At the same time, broadband continues to grow and bundling products together has even breathed some life back into its video business. AT&T has benefited from the flow of cost savings from its acquisitions, the continuing strength of mobile and less price competition in the business market. DirecTV, meanwhile, has jumped partly on overblown hopes that control will shift from Rupert Murdoch to John Malone, who will magically release a chunk of shareholder value.However, the longer-term threats have not gone away. Telecoms operators will still have to compete aggressively to fill the new fibre they are laying with video, voice and broadband services. That means competing directly with the cable companies. Satellite will still end up fighting an increasingly painful war, against two big enemies instead of one, with inferior weaponry. Satellite cannot offer its own competitive broadband and telephony products alongside video.Investors need to start being more discerning about the winners and losers. They have already penalised Verizon to an extent, which is making a bigger fibre bet than AT&T. And Echostar has underperformed DirecTV because it lacks the Malone factor. But such differentiation has further to go. Satellite operators look the most exposed when investors refocus on the risks ahead.

This number may rise in the future.The deal comes after Mr Cruise had been all but written off by the Hollywood community following his separation from Paramount. A committed Scientologist, Mr Cruise was accused by Sumner Redstone, chairman of Paramount’s parent company Viacom, of alienating his female fanbase with outbursts on television.Mr Cruise and Ms Wagner will control the setting of UA’s production slate, from development to the “green-lighting” of certain projects, although MGM said this would be “subject to certain parameters”.Ms Wagner will become chief executive of UA and be responsible for day-to-day operations of the studio. Mr Cruise will produce and star in UA films but will also be free to appear in films for other studios.MGM will be responsible for worldwide marketing and distribution. UA will supply feature films to MGM, with production and development of UA movies being fully financed by MGM and its partners.MGM is the only one of Hollywood’s big studios to be controlled by private equity firms. Its owners include Providence Equity Partners and Texas Pacific Group. Comcast, the cable TV company, and Sony also have a stake in the studio.“Partnering with Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner, we have the ideal creative foundation from which to reintroduce the United Artists brand,” said Harry Sloan, chairman and chief executive of MGM.“Tom and Paula are the modern versions of the iconic founders of United Artists - Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin and D. W. Griffith - and our partnership with them reaffirms our commitment to providing creative talent with a comfortable home at United Artists and a dedicated distribution partner in MGM.”Mr Cruise said he and Ms Wagner were “very respectful of the rich history and tradition of United Artists, and we welcome the opportunity to contribute to that legacy by providing a wide range of releases that appeal to all audiences. It’s our desire to create an environment where filmmakers can thrive and see their visions realized”.
773;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Brightcove to compete in online video;;"Brightcove, an online video company, will on Monday launch an ambitious effort to become a main competitor in the emerging market for internet video that Google is also seeking to dominate.Aiming at professional content-makers rather than the amateur videos favoured by sites such as YouTube, Brightcove will launch a service that allows users to start online television channels. Advertising revenues will be split evenly between Brightcove and the content-makers.The push is the latest initiative in the online video market, which has grown rapidly as high-speed internet connections proliferate and videos become easier to view on the web.In spite of the potential of this market, it is not yet clear who will dominate in the distribution of online video and the expected increase in advertising.Google’s recent $1.65bn purchase of YouTube, the lossmaking start-up, has again raised questions among media companies whether the internet giant is a partner or a rival. Google and large media groups are still negotiating about how online video revenues should be shared.“That acquisition was one of those watershed moments that has forced attention on to the questions around internet video and who controls it,” said Jeremy Allaire, chairman and chief executive of Brightcove. “Media companies want others to be big enough to rival Google.”Sony BMG Music, Warner Music, Reuters, New York Times and MTV are among the media clients Brightcove has worked with since its inception in 2004. Time Warner’s AOL is one of Brightcove’s shareholders.The company now hopes to expand its client list with
the launch of Brightcove Network, where large and small content-makers can launch online video.In addition to Google’s interest in video, media companies and other start-ups have launched online video sites.NBC set up an online syndication market called NBBC.

Exxon shares were up 0.9 per cent, or 39 cents, at $71.62 at the close.Health insurer Aetna rose 7 per cent to $41.14 after it reported a 28 per cent increase in third quarter profit.At the close of trading, the S&P 500 index was up 0.5 per cent, or 6.71 points, at 1,3889.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 1 per cent, or 22.51 points, higher at 2,379.10. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent, or 29 points, at 12,163.66, closing at a record high for the 13th time in the past 17 sessions.Shares in Clear Channel, the US radio station, soared almost 10 per cent to $35.48 after it said it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore “strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value”, amid media reports that the firm was going private.Pulte Homes the second-largest US home builder in terms of revenue, reported a sharp drop in earnings and said fourth quarter earnings would fall far short of current forecasts. Its shares were 1.4 per cent higher at $32.66 having been lower earlier in the session.Pulte’s results came as the commerce department said the median price of a new home plunged in September by the largest amount in more than 35 years, even as the pace of sales rebounded for a second month. The median price was $217,100, down 9.7 per cent from September 2005.Dow Chemical, the largest US chemical company, was up 1.4 per cent at $40.72 after it posted improved earnings and announced a $2bn share repurchase plan.Wal-Mart said its $4 generic prescription programme would be expanded to a further 12 states, a week after it added 14 states to the programme that made its debut in Florida.

775;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-10-23T17:12:02Z;AT&T offers upbeat forecast for HDTV service;;AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, plans to roll out a high definition version of its U-verse IPTV service in 15 markets by year end.AT&T gave and upbeat assessment of the outlook for its IPTV service on Monday during a conference call with investors to discuss the company’s third quarter results.The results highlighted continued gains by AT&T’s Cingular Wireless joint venture, stabilising enterprise revenues as companies migrate to IP-based services and signs that line losses to wireless and cable TV rivals could be peaking.AT&T has been investing heavily in a new fibre optic network called Project Lightspeed in order to support the U-verse advanced video and data service and compete directly with cable TV operators including Comcast and Time Warner.Rick Lindner, AT&T’s chief financial officer, said on Monday that the initial customer response to U-verse – launched first in San Antonio, Texas in June – had been “ very positive.”He said AT&T plans to upgrade the 3,000 subscribers in San Antonio to HDTV service in late November and expects to launch HDTV U-verse services in approximately 15 metropolitan markets across its traditional 13-state region by the end of 2006.Like Verizon, which is also rolling out a advanced network capable of delivering TV and video content, AT&T is relying on growth markets including video, broadband and wireless to offset flat or falling revenues in traditional voice markets.Consolidated third-quarter net income at AT&T, which was formed through the merger of SBC Communications and the old AT&T a year ago, increased by 74 per cent as earnings at Cingular Wireless quadrupled and post merger job losses helped cut costs. Net income advanced to $2.17bn, or 56 cents a share, from $1.25bn, or 38 cents, a year earlier, before on revenues that totaled $15.6bn, up from a per-merger $10.3bn.Among significant changes, AT&T reported that customers switched off 824,000 local lines, fewer than the 857,000 in the second quarter. “I think we are reaching a peak [of line losses],” said Mr Lindner. He also noted that regional business revenues increased by 6.6 per cent, driven mostly by the switch to IP-based telephony.AT&T waiting for Federal Communication Commission approval to complete its planned purchase of BellSouth.

776;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-10-09T21:30:20Z;Cablevision;;The temptation is to take the money and run. After the rollercoaster share price ride of recent years, long-suffering Cablevision shareholders are being offered $27 a share in cash by the controlling family. That is a 13 per cent premium to Friday’s close. And it would offer investors a clean exit from the Dolan family’s unpredictable whims.But investors should not run for the door yet. Monday’s bid is certainly better than the offer the Dolans made last year. It is straight cash, compared with the hard-to-value equity stub last time. It is also 15 per cent higher, after adjusting for this year’s special dividend.The problem is that cable valuations in general have raced higher over the same period. Comcast, the largest in the sector, has risen about 17 per cent since the Dolans launched last year’s bid. As a multiple of 2007 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, UBS estimates the offer values Cablevision’s cable assets at about 7.5 times. That is broadly in line with Comcast, making the Dolans’ premium feel even skinnier.After successfully holding out last time and getting a better offer, Cablevision’s independent directors should not roll over. Importantly, they know that the group would probably fetch a higher price if strategic bidders were able to make an offer. The Dolans’ 74 per cent voting stake makes that impossible – because they are not sellers. But it does mean the family could turn round at any stage in the future and probably auction the assets for a higher price.In a sense, shareholders have themselves to blame for accepting the dual-voting structure in the first place – and allowing the current situation to be possible. But they should still try to share in at least some of that potential value. The independent directors should push for a richer premium.
777;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;T-Mobile USA to set up nationwide 3G network;;T-Mobile USA, the fourth largest US mobile carrier, is expected to announce plans on Friday to deploy a nationwide 3G wireless network.The mobile carrier, which is owned by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, was the top bidder in the recent Federal Communications Commission spectrum auction paying $4.2bn for new licences - a move widely interpreted as signaling its commitment to the US market.The new spectrum will enable T-Mobile, which has lagged behind its US rivals in launching 3G services because of spectrum constraints, to play catch-up and roll out new 3G services built on top of its underlying GSM network.“We believe T-Mobile intends to deploy a nationwide 3G network with its new spectrum given it’s the only major US wireless carrier without a high-speed network,” said Tal Liani of Merrill Lynch in a note to investors.Analysts believe T-Mobile could spend over $3bn over the next two-and-a-half years building it 3G network which they expect to be based on so-called WCDMA/HSDPA technology, the natural upgrade path from T-Mobile’s current GSM network.That would enable T-Mobile to target higher value customers including business users with mobile data services including video, offsetting the continung pricing pressures on standard voice services.Meanwhile US cable TV operators led by Comcast, indicated on Thursday that they may begin testing wireless services using some of the spectrum they purchased during the recent FCC auction.The group, called SpectrumCo, spent $2.37bn, to purchase 137 wireless licenses covering most major cities including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. “In coming months the members of SpectrumCo will fully evaluate all options including possible testing in limited markets,”’ the group said on Thursday in a statement.Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, will pay $1.29bn towards the cost of the spectrum, followed by Time Warner Cable with $632.2m and Cox communications, which will pay $248.3m.The consortium did not say how much Sprint Nextel, the third largest US wireless operator and a partner in SpectrumCo, will contribute. However Sprint, which announced a partnership with four of the largest US cable companies to co-market mobile phone services last year, is expected to pay about $100m. towards the total cost of the spectrum.
778;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-09-21T20:23:49Z;US cable spectrum;;If anybody knows the importance of providing a clear signal it should be the cable industry. When it comes to investors, however, the likes of Comcast have recently given a patchy service. A consortium of cable operators is shelling out $2.4bn to buy wireless spectrum without a clear message on how it will be used.The numbers so far are manageable. Comcast, the consortium leader, is on the hook for about $1.2bn – less than 2 per cent of its market value. But the upfront payment is not the problem. Of more concern is the heavy investment that would be needed to build out a national wireless footprint. That scares investors, particularly given there are already four established mobile operators and industry growth is likely to slow.The spectrum was probably purchased for two reasons. One is a simple hedge – in case wireless one day becomes a pivotal product that cable needs to offer alongside video, broadband and internet telephony. The other, related issue, is a hope of wielding extra leverage when it one day comes to renegotiating an existing wireless alliance with Sprint Nextel. The cable companies could, theoretically, threaten to go it alone and thereby drive a harder bargain.Neither of these is a great reason. If wireless becomes so pivotal, a tighter alliance, or even merger with Sprint, would probably make more sense. Meanwhile, building from scratch would be such an expensive and risky option that it would probably not scare Sprint as a realistic threat.Fortunately, the consortium got a cheap deal, paying less than Verizon and T-Mobile. It has to make no capital investments for 15 years. And spectrum is a scarce resource that is unlikely to depreciate greatly in value. The cable consortium does need to reassure investors about its motives. But, in the meantime, the downside looks limited.
779;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-09-13T22:31:38Z;Wal-Mart plays a key role in digital drama;;As Hollywood film studios plot their digital future, it appears that all roads lead through Bentonville, Arkansas.Bentonville is the home of Wal-Mart, the retailer that is the largest seller of DVDs, which – in turn – are the studios’ biggest source of revenue.As a result, any move that the studios make to sell films online must be weighed against the damage that it could do to their most important business relationship.“There’s been a lot of indigestion because of Wal-Mart,” one studio executive says. “They’re 35 to 40 per cent of our business.”That tension came into view this week when Apple announced a new service to sell film downloads through its iTunes store. Disney’s new releases will cost $12.99 during their first week, and then $14.99 – less than a typical DVD.While Apple courted all the studios, only Disney agreed to sign on. The others were dissuaded, at least in part, by fear of offending Wal-Mart, according to studio executives.Earlier this year, Disney learned the consequences of crossing Wal-Mart after it began selling High School Musical, its made-for-television film, on iTunes days before copies of the DVD hit the retailer’s shelves.Wal-Mart, which relies on DVDs to draw customers to its stores, immediately punished the company by cutting its order. The spat was only resolved after Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive, intervened.Neither the studios nor Wal-Mart was available to comment.Hollywood has so far taken only tentative steps into the download business through two start-up companies, CinemaNow and MovieLink.The studios have powerful motivations to ramp up digital distribution.For one, they want to avoid the disastrous experience of the music industry. Record companies were reluctant to go digital and subsequently saw five years of sales growth wiped out by illegal file-sharing.They are also looking for a new source of revenue to replace the slowdown in the $24bn DVD market. After years of double-digit growth, it is expected to expand by just 5 per cent this year, according to Adams Media Research.“We’re running out of steam in the DVD business, and there is no other growth story in Hollywood right now,” says one executive.Some studios have sought to persuade Wal-Mart that download customers are a unique audience, and therefore will not cannibalise their DVD sales.Warner Brothers and Universal, two of the largest studios, have talked in the past about making Wal-Mart and other retailers their partners as they move into digital distribution.While neither studio has spelled out what that would mean, it could involve helping the company develop its own online film business, or offering it preferential pricing.Yet some in Hollywood have expressed frustration at Wal-Mart’s sluggish progress. The retailer has experimented over the years with electronic kiosks that would allow consumers to download films to DVDs and other ideas without settling on a plan.This week, Wal-Mart posted a job advertisement for a business manager to oversee a new digital video category at Walmart.com.As Wal-Mart tries to recreate its bricks-and-mortar dominance of the DVD market online, it will face tough competition. In addition to iTunes, it will have to contend with Amazon.com, which has greater experience at selling content to consumers online.A host of other players are also pushing into the business of transmitting video direct to the living room, including other retailers, cable operators such as Comcast, and internet portals such as Yahoo and Google.One consideration for the studios is how quickly they believe that the digital market will take hold. Under Mr Iger, Disney appears to be bullish. Its ABC television unit was the first to strike a deal with iTunes last October.But other studios believe that it will be years before the market takes off, and that there is little value to antagonising the folks in Bentonville in the meantime.“We’re in a period of transition, and that transition will last three to five years,” one studio executive predicts.In the meantime, he says, Hollywood is “setting the table” with its various business partners. “We’re trying to figure out under what terms and conditions we’ll all be able to do business together.”
780;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Icahn plans fund for Time Warner stake;;Carl Icahn, an activist investor, is hoping to set up a new fund to house his $1bn Time Warner investment in the coming weeks, potentially opening the way for him to increase his stake in the media company for a long-term investment.In a letter to investors in his fund, details of which were published by the New York Times on Thursday, Mr Icahn said he wanted to increase his stake in Time Warner but did not feel comfortable doing so within his current fund as his 1.5 per cent stake in the media group represented about 27 per cent of the fund’s value.He said the sharp underperformance of Time Warner’s shares – which led him to build up a stake with a group of hedge funds just over a year ago and try to stage a fight for board control aimed at breaking up the media group’s conglomerate structure – reflected irrational market behaviour.“Every once in a while, markets act irrationally, providing the patient investor with great opportunities for reward with little risk,” he said.“RJR Nabisco was a good example of this – over the course of a few years, I made many times my investment. Today I believe Time Warner represents such a situation,” the letter stated.This week, regulatory filings revealed his funds had bought a further $80m worth of shares in the media group during the second quarter, increasing his stake to about 1.5 per cent of the company.People familiar with Mr Icahn’s strategy said he had continued to buy in July and August too.The investment comes in spite of a sharp fall in Time Warner’s share price since Mr Icahn first took his stake in the media conglomerate just over a year ago.Mr Icahn targeted Time Warner, which includes Warner Brothers studios, Time Inc magazine publishing, cable channels such as CNN and HBO, and the AOL internet business, due to the poor performance of its shares in recent years.In spite of a $20bn share buy-back programme – agreed by Time Warner following pressure from Mr Icahn – and cost-cutting measures and plans to turn around AOL, Time Warner shares have continued to do worse than those of rivals such as News Corp, Walt Disney and Comcast this year.On Thursday, Time Warner’s shares rose 1.73 per cent in early trading to $16.42.Although Mr Icahn agreed to end his proxy fight in February, he left open the possibility of renewing it in the future.Meanwhile, Time Warner is planning to restate its financial results going back to 2000 after an independent auditor found problems with the way it accounted for a number of transactions in 2000 and 2001, mainly involving online advertising.The restatement came as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over accounting problems at its AOL unit, which was announced in March of last year. The company also agreed to pay a $300m penalty.
781;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-08-17T20:01:09Z;Icahn/Time Warner;;Right idea, shame about the target. Carl Icahn saw value in old media companies early. If he had bought a stake in Disney, News Corporation or Comcast last year he would be sitting on a healthy profit. Instead he chose Time Warner. Its shares have fallen in the past 12 months, while those of the other three have all risen by about 10 per cent or more.Even so, he is hunkering down for a long game. In recent months he has increased his Time Warner stake. It now accounts for about 27 per cent of his fund. With such a concentrated position he would be pushed to justify buying more. Instead he is now offering his clients the chance to ramp up their own exposure to Time Warner through a special purpose vehicle administered by him. That could feasibly increase his voting clout if he takes another tilt at Time Warner management.Mr Icahn’s persistence has some logic. After all, a 30 per cent rise in Comcast’s shares since January has not helped Time Warner – even though about 40 per cent of its earning before interest tax depreciation and amortisation come from cable. At the same time, however, businesses such as filmed entertainment and publishing have not been at their best. And AOL remains unpredictable given the scale of its planned transformation.Time Warner needs a catalyst. That could be the listing of a minority stake in cable early next year – although investors should already be able to value that asset appropriately. Another would be proof of an AOL turnround. Again, that could be some quarters away.It looks feasible that, if Time Warner’s shares remain lifeless into the winter, Mr Icahn will again try being a catalyst himself. If so, the difference compared with last time around could be a bigger willingness within Time Warner itself to consider more radical action.
782;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-08-16T05:48:08Z;Internet could suffer more DNS ‘brown-outs’;;Internet users in the US and potentially elsewhere face the prospect of slower Web page access and frustrating “broken” page links and outages unless leading internet service providers invest more in their DNS (Domain Name Server) infrastructure, Paul Mockapetris, the inventor of the DNS system has warned.DNS, the system for naming internet locations (such as ‘ft.com’), is a critical component for most online tools. Internet communications - whether through a browser, e-mail or VoIP (voice-over-internet protocol) voice traffic - rely heavily on a well-functioning DNS service.“The performance of DNS routinely impacts IP applications and ultimately the experience of the end user as they load web pages, receive emails, or place VoIP calls,” says Mr Mockapetris, who is chief scientist and chairman of Nominum, the internet infrastructure provider.However he warns that new internet applications and the arrival of Microsoft’s Vista operating system could both add to the strain on existing DNS software potentially causing more internet service outages.Microsoft Vista will ship later this year with a new version of internet addressing called IPv6 enabled by default which has the potential to more than double the amount of queries to the DNS, resulting in an additional slowing effect on DNS response time.To back up his claims, Nominum commissioned a survey from VeriTest, the testing service of Lionbridge, to measure DNS performance of eight leading cable and telecommunications service providers in the US which is published on Thursday.Among its findings, the survey reveals that US cable network operators appear to have a significant edge over their telecommunications rivals when it comes to their DNS performance.The results from the survey show that DNS response time and the percentage of unanswered queries vary widely across providers. In addition, many service providers have inconsistent performance results depending on the date and time, with dropped query rates varying by more than a factor of ten and DNS response time growing from a few milliseconds to several seconds.The report concludes: “Of all the providers measured in this test, Comcast DNS servers have the fastest average response time, the lowest dropped query rate, and the most consistent response.”At the other end of the spectrum, Verizon’s DSL and Fios fibre optic services appear to have the slowest response times, “which proves that fibre optics on its own does not necessarily guarantee the fastest speed,” Mr Mockapetris says.“While DNS might not have been an area of investment historically, service providers are realising that the performance of DNS routinely impacts IP applications and ultimately the experience of the end user.If not addressed, consumers across the US will experience “internet brownouts,” or random slowdowns in the middle of their online experiences,” said Albert Gouyet, vice president of marketing at Nominum. “This survey demonstrates that service providers such as Comcast are clearly ahead in providing consumers with a market leading DNS service in the core of their network.”
783;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-08-14T22:43:16Z;Icahn signals confidence in Time Warner;;Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist who tried unsuccessfully to push Time Warner to break up, bought a further $80m worth of shares in the media group during the second quarter, increasing his stake to about 1.5 per cent of the company.The move comes in spite of the sharp decline in Time Warner’s share price since Mr Icahn first took his stake in the media conglomerate just over a year ago.Mr Icahn targeted Time Warner, which includes Warner Brothers studios, Time Inc magazine publishing, cable channels such as CNN and HBO, and the AOL internet business, due to the poor performance of its shares.In spite of a $20bn share buy-back programme – agreed by Time Warner following pressure from Mr Icahn – and cost-cutting measures and plans to turn around AOL, Time Warner shares have continued to do worse than those of rivals such as News Corp and Walt Disney this year.On Monday, Time Warner’s shares closed at $16.05, compared with just under $18.50 a year ago, a drop of 13 per cent, meaning Mr Icahn is likely to be sitting on a sizeable loss on his positions, worth about $1bn.Mr Icahn declined to comment. However, people familiar with his group’s plans said he and other hedge funds invested in Time Warner hope shares will rise by the end of this year on the back of improvements at AOL and the planned listing of a stake in Time Warner Cable.Comcast, the largest US cable group, has seen its shares soar this year, yet market confidence in the cable sector has not fed through to Time Warner, and a partial listing might change that.Jana Partners, one of the three hedge funds that teamed up with Mr Icahn in an audacious attempt to seize control of Time Warner’s board in spite of a joint stake of less than 2.5 per cent in the group, sold about $90m worth of shares, reducing its stake to 0.6 per cent.Of the other two hedge funds, Franklin Mutual slightly added to its stake. SAC has not reported its latest holdings yet, but is believed to have held on to its position.Although Mr Icahn agreed to end his proxy fight in February, he left open the possibility of renewing it in the future.Mr Icahn also reported that his funds had increased their stakes in Cendant, and took new stakes in Take-Two Interactive Software and Symantec.
784;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-08-13T18:25:13Z;US media;;If content is king and distribution is under pressure from the advance of new technologies, how come Comcast has quietly become the most valuable media company in the US? Since the beginning of April, the cable operator’s shares have soared 30 per cent, to produce a market capitalisation of $72bn. Shares in Time Warner, the broad-based media group with exposure to content creation that once dwarfed its peers, has fallen 4 per cent over the same period, giving it a market value of $65bn.Cable operators do face threats from shifts in technology. For example, consumers will increasingly select the content they want to watch online, rather than simply being fed packages by cable companies. And telecoms operators are laying cable to offer competing services. But all that will take a while to have a real impact.For now the changes on the internet are actually working to the advantage of the cable operators. Take video. While some choice is beginning to appear online, consumers are not about to switch off their cable video service – as they might cancel their traditional phone line in favour of wireless or internet telephony. In fact, an explosion of online content is encouraging a desire for ever faster internet connections. That is helping to keep cable broadband subscriptions growing at a healthy rate and underpin pricing. Meanwhile, cable is adding internet telephony as a third service across those broadband connections. Pricing of that service is sure to come under pressure, but it is currently driving new growth.Meanwhile, after years of heavy investment, cable cash flows are improving. And amidst fears of a consumer slowdown, the relative predictability of a subscription-focused distribution business can be reassuring, compared with, say, largely advertising-funded businesses.Admittedly, Comcast is not the only one to have crept up on Time Warner. Disney and News Corporation are both within striking distance of its market value. It remains likely that companies with the best content will receive a boost over time as distribution opportunities proliferate. Still, while life will undoubtedly get tougher in a few years, investors should not underestimate the resilience of the cable operators.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
786;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-08-10T19:57:51Z;EchoStar suffers slower rate of take-up;;EchoStar, the satellite operator controlled by Charlie Ergen, has acquired 195,000 new subscribers in the second quarter of the year, down 13 per cent on last year.The slower rate of new customers, echoing similar trends reported by its satellite rival DirecTV this week, did not affect EchoStar’s profitability and the average revenue per user rose 7 per cent to $62.71. However, with cable rivals such as Cablevision, Comcast and Time Warner accelerating the pace at which they are adding new video subscribers, satellite operators will face further pressure to come up with a way to offer broadband too.Cable companies’ edge over satellite is largely due to their ability to offer high-speed internet access and telephone connections alongside multi-channel television.“The strategic question is competition, and the slowing growth in gross additions, as well as the higher churn rate, may reflect greater competitive pressure from cable, which has been reporting record basic subscriber adds in the first half of 2006,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. He has downgraded the satellite groups to neutral this week, causing their share prices to fall.Shares of EchoStar and DirecTV, controlled by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, had risen to highs in recent months on the back of speculation that the two groups could try to merge, not least as a strategy to reduce the potential costs of providing broadband internet access.Mr Murdoch said this week that so far there had been no negotiations between the groups.The two satellite players’ previous merger attempt was blocked by regulators, but changes in the competitive environment might mean a tie-up would be approved.The two companies are jointly bidding for spectrum that could be used to provide broadband services. The auctions, being held by the Federal Communications Commission, started this week and could last until October. So far, the joint venture has submitted the highest bids.EchoStar said it was continuing to look at various alternatives for providing broadband. This week, DirecTV also said it was still looking at broadband options and that it was particularly interested in developments in the wireless broadband markets.Carl Vogel, vice-chairman of EchoStar, said mobile broadband was not a “must have” for the company, although it was still looking at opportunities closely.EchoStar, with 12.5m customers, is focusing on increasing the availability of high-definition television, and says it offers more high-definition programming than any of its rivals.
787;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-08-01T20:27:45Z;Vonage earnings hit by loss of customers;;Vonage Holdings, the VoIP group that went public in May, on Tuesday posted a wider second-quarter loss as revenue missed analysts’ estimates because of customer defections.The company’s net loss increased to $74.1m, or $1.16 a share, from $63.6m a year earlier. Vonage said it had 1.85m lines at the end of the second quarter, up from 1.6m three months earlier.Buoyed by extensive TV advertising, revenues more than doubled to $143m but still missed analysts’ predictions. Vonage, whose stock plunged in the immediate wake of its flotation, said full-year sales would also miss analysts’ estimates.Vonage boosted total marketing spending by 46 per cent in the latest quarter in an effort to keep customers. For each added subscriber, the company spent $239 on marketing, up from $236 a year earlier.The company also revealed that its customer turnover rate, or churn, rose to 2.3 per cent from 2.1 per cent in the first quarter, while average revenue per line rose 4 per cent to $27.70 as customers signed up for its premium calling plans.Vonage pioneered VoIP services in the US with cut-price call packages costing as little as $15 a month for 500 minutes but has faced a growing challenge from bigger competitors including cable operators such as Comcast and Time Warner as well as traditional telecoms carriers such as AT&T.On Tuesday, Vonage shares fell by 5.5 per cent to $6.70, bringing the decline since the company’s initial public offering to more than 60 per cent. The shares were valued at $17 each at the IPO but soon after the shares fell, some customers baulked at paying for shares they had committed to buy.The company said it still intended to collect payment from these investors but revealed it had paid $17.9m to underwriters as compensation. The company said it had bought $11.7m worth of its own stock to meet its obligations to the IPO underwriters and would reimburse another $6.2m to cover underwriter costs.The share sale has also sparked at least nine lawsuits, with some investors alleging Vonage failed to disclose certain risks.

Microsoft’s shares fell 2.1 per cent to $23.87.Shares in Aetna were in a critical condition after the health insurer reported a 1 per cent fall in second-quarter earnings. While the results were in line with Wall Street forecasts, investors were worried by claims on its Stop-Loss product.Its shares plunged 16.8 per cent to $33.25, their lowest level since February 2005. The stock has dropped 32 per cent this year.Other health insurers followed suit. Humana dropped 6.3 per cent to $52.94 and Cigna shed 8.4 per cent to $95.43.Symantec, a maker of anti-virus software, reported a 52 per cent fall in first-quarter profits as operating expenses more than doubled. The results were still better than analysts had forecast, however, and shares leapt 9.1 per cent to $17.24.Bristol Myers-Squibb fell 7.5 per cent to $24.04 after it announced that the federal government was conducting an anti-trust investigation into a settlement reached by it and its marketing partner Sanofi-Aventis with generic drug maker Apotex.Investors reacted negatively to earnings from Dow Chemical, which reported a 19 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings as higher fuel costs offset record revenue, sending shares plunging 10 per cent to $33.54.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent, or 5.20 points, at 1,263.20, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent, or 15.99 points, to 2,054.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, down 2.08 points at 11,100.43.“The real issue that is facing the market today is hard landing or soft landing,” said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors.“Investors don’t know the answer to that, and the stock market is reflecting that uncertainty.”Pharmaceuticals benefitted from a flight to defensive stocks. Merck gained 2 per cent to $40.98, and Pfizer added 2.2 per cent to $25.65.Comcast jumped 4.6 per cent to $34.02 after it raised its forecast for subscriber growth in 2006 and reported a 7 per cent increase in second-quarter profit.Investment manager T Rowe Price beat Wall Street estimates when it reported a 32 per cent rise in second quarter profit, pushing shares up 5.3 per cent to $39.03.Fortune Brands, maker of hardware and home-products, jumped 5.2 per cent to $74.20 after reporting a 24 per cent increase in second-quarter profits.
789;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-07-27T20:24:12Z;Comcast reaps as price war fails to materialise;;Comcast, the largest cable operator in the US, on Thursday offered further evidence that strong competition among cable and telecom providers of high-speed internet connections is not yet pushing prices down.Comcast said that in its second quarter the average revenue made from each broadband customer rose to $43.78 from $43.35 a year ago.“Broadband bears have been predicting a price war in broadband for more than two years, and the ‘just wait’ arguments are wearing thin,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “Consistent with comments from [telecommunications companies] AT&T and BellSouth this week, both of whom saw strength in higher-speed internet tiers, the action in broadband seems to be at the high end, not the low end, of the market,” he said.Comcast’s shares rose 5.2 per cent by midday in New York to $34.21. The company, run by Brian Roberts whose family has control over the group, has seen its shares rise 32 per cent this year, making it the sixth-biggest riser in the S&P 100 index of US companies.As well as strong results across its cable television and internet businesses, Comcast was beginning to benefit from the extended roll-out of telephony services.Cable rivals Cablevision and Time Warner Cable, which have rolled out telephone services more rapidly than Comcast, have been able to retain more customers and even lure back some from satellite rivals by offering a bundle of services including television, internet and telephone.So far, about 25 per cent of Comcast’s customers are offered a “triple play” bundle of services. This will rise to close to 60 per cent by the end of the month and increase from there.Comcast management raised its guidance for earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation for this year to at least 13 per cent growth versus previous guidance of 10-11 per cent.The strength of demand and profitability of broadband services, combined with the appeal of bundled packages, is putting pressure on satellite rivals DirecTV and Echostar to find a way to provide similar products.
790;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-07-03T21:40:54Z;NTL ready to take on BSkyB;;"NTL’s new management is hoping to challenge British Sky Broadcasting with an aggressive expansion of the cable operator’s on-demand film offerings and a renewed commitment to television programming.“Content is going to be the battleground,” Stephen Burch said in his first interview since becoming chief executive of NTL in January. He admitted that Sky had better films and sports rights, but said he was looking for ways to exploit cable’s on-demand capabilities.“I don’t think the movie offering on Sky is as robust as it could be,” he said. He added that NTL’s merger with Telewest strengthened his hand in negotiations with film studios interested in the distribution opportunities offered by broadband, video-on-demand and pay-per-view technologies.Theresa Wise, a partner at Accenture, said NTL’s greater scale should help improve the low profit margins for video-on-demand, but cautioned that Sky spent more with Hollywood studios than any UK rival, making its deals with studios hard to break.Mr Burch, recruited from Comcast, the US cable group, after NTL and Telewest announced their merger, hopes video-on-demand will narrow the gap with Sky.“VOD will be a strong retention tool and, when people understand it better, [a customer] acquisition tool,” he said. He also plans to expand Flextech, the television content business which has a joint venture with the BBC called UKTV.“We are finding new programmes we can create and buy and ventures we can do to expand our content,” Mr Burch said.He added that relations with the BBC, which had been frustrated by its lack of US distribution, have improved since the merger.NTL is today expected to complete its £961m acquisition of Virgin Mobile, making it the first company in the UK able to offer the “quadruple play” of broadband internet access, television, and fixed-line and mobile telephony.Mr Burch said NTL would adopt the Virgin brand name for its services “no later than early next year”.

791;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-07-03T21:00:20Z;‘We are no longer going to be unloved’;;"As with so many other spheres of activity, the internet has transformed the way people complain about bad service. The emergence of websites where people can share videos or audio recordings has created a new phenomenon: customer revenge.Two of the most popular recent items on video hosting services such as
YouTube have been a telephone recording of an AOL customer’s vain attempts to cancel his account in the face of an employee determined not to; and a video of a Comcast technician, who spends so long trying to reach his own office from a customer’s house that he falls asleep on the couch.“I have spent my entire career in an industry about which people all have an opinion,” says Stephen Burch, the “cable guy” called in from Comcast in January to fix a chronic bad customer service reputation at NTL, the UK cable ­operator.Other executives might recount the way customers assail them at parties with annoyance, but Mr Burch is a relentless optimist. After 17 years at Comcast, where he rose to run its large Atlantic division, he says: “In a weird way, the job got too easy. This is so ­invigorating.”The cheerful assessment belies the daunting task he has taken on. He was
ap­pointed in the middle of NTL’s $6bn merger with Tele­west, its only UK rival, and its simultaneous £961m ($1.8bn) takeover of Virgin Mobile, Sir Richard Branson’s mobile phone operator.The NTL-Telewest merger was seen as a last ditch attempt to re-establish the credibility of the cable industry in a country where its growth had been eclipsed by British Sky Broadcasting’s satellite offering and threatened by a host of new rivals. Doubters dismissed the Virgin deal as just a pricey rebranding effort.Mr Burch not only has to repair the image of an entire industry, but faces the unique task of creating the UK’s first “quadruple play” entertainment and communications group, able to offer television, broadband, and both landline and mobile telephone services.In his first interview since taking the job, he claims to be unworried by the challenge of integrating three businesses with more than 5m customers. “So what?” he asks. “We multi-task. We’re not a single entity where all we are is a television business or a broadband business or a telecoms business. This is not as difficult as it seems.”The expatriate American will on Tuesday celebrate the Fourth of July by visiting Virgin Mobile’s offices to mark the official completion of the takeover. The smaller of NTL’s two deals could prove the more transformative, as it will give NTL both the unique ability to offer mobile services alongside voice, video and broadband, and a new brand under which to do so.Asked why NTL had to buy a mobile operator to achieve this, rather than simply sign a partnership, Mr Burch replies: “In bacon and eggs, the chicken is involved but the pig is committed. By owning the mobile phone company, we’re completely ­com­mitted.”The NTL and Telewest brands and – he hopes – their reputations will disappear “no later than early next year”, to be replaced by an as yet undecided new name, “Virgin something”. Whatever their efforts, the two companies combined “would never have come close” to the power of the brand Sir Richard has applied to everything from airlines to credit cards, Mr Burch says.The new brand will be as significant within the company as it is for customers. “My message to the people in this company is we are no longer going to be an unloved company. We are going to have the number one name in the UK.”Virgin Mobile will need to bring more than a new name to fix the cable industry’s service problems. “I think people in this country are more forgiving [than in the US],” he observes. “But Virgin has worked very hard to ensure they don’t create a situation where the customer has to forgive them.”The best brand can be quickly tarnished by a shoddy product, so Mr Burch is not waiting for Sir Richard’s arrival as a shareholder to make changes.He has put the former head of customer care at Telewest, which had the better reputation of the two companies, in charge of both operations. Having announced plans for 6,000 job cuts, reducing headcount by one-third, Mr Burch is replacing NTL’s computer systems, enhancing its training operation and hiring more people to answer customers’ calls.If you get more of the right people answering calls, customers get the right answer first time and don’t have to call back, he notes. “We have changed the model of what person we are looking for to answer the phones. We are looking for the people we had at ­Telewest.”NTL’s mistake, he believes, was to lose many of its trainers, then to take the best people it had answering phones and use them to train new staff. Its employees have embraced the changes, he says: “They don’t want to be yelled at.”Mr Burch trained as a lawyer, working briefly as a prosecutor before deciding that he had “more of a public defender personality” when he had to prosecute a 63-year-old woman charged with stealing from a grocery store. But he has spent 26 years in the cable industry, and earned the NTL job by pulling off what NTL’s chairman called the “industry gold standard” – absorption of 2m AT&T Broadband subscribers into Comcast in just 18 months.This time, Mr Burch is having to repeat the trick in the face of rapid technological change and gathering competition, in a market with different characteristics.He admits there are dangers in simply applying a US model to the UK market. In the US, the cable companies had the advantage of being first to market, he notes. In the UK, NTL is fighting Sky, a larger satellite rival that will this month unveil its broadband plans; BT Group, the former telecoms monopoly, which is diversifying into internet television to preserve its revenues; and countless new entrants to its markets such as Carphone Warehouse, whose “free broadband” promotions threaten to drag the industry into a price war.Although NTL has the benefit of a coaxial fibre network with capacity to carry new services, Sky and BT have the advantage of national coverage, while cable serves only half of the country. Mr Burch admits that he is looking at the opportunity to fill in gaps in its coverage through local loop unbundling – putting NTL equipment into BT exchanges to reach new ­customers.He also sees opportunities in the fact that the UK lags behind the US in adopting technology such as video-on-demand, personal video recorders and high-definition television, which have proved powerful retention tools for US cable ­companies.But the decisive factor in the battle between providers of converged telecoms and entertainment services will be in content, he argues. “I’m very pro-content,” he declares – a sharp contrast with his predecessors’ apparent vacillation over their commitment to Flextech, Telewest’s channels business, which was put on the market last year only to be taken off again.Mr Burch admits that Sky has the advantage of better sports and movies coverage. He is less interested in catching up on sports than on films (at the start of the interview, he switches off Germany’s World Cup game against Argentina, playing on a tiny set with a Telewest box balanced on top). “I don’t think the movie offering on Sky is as robust as it could be,” he says.The next challenge is to spread beyond traditional television programming to content for broadband and mobile phones. “The good news is that [in these new areas] everybody’s a smaller player right now, and our pipeline gives us more opportunities,” he says.He has instructed the new management at Flextech to look for more content acquisitions, joint ventures and international opportunities. The difference since the merger, he adds, is that Flextech is now taken more seriously in such negotiations.“With the merger of NTL and Telewest we have size and substance,” he says. “We are no longer the ugly ducklings or step-children of communications in this ­company.”It will take time to see whether NTL can live up to Mr Burch’s optimism. He admits that the next year will be taken up with integration, before “we really start to move the company next year”. For now, the cable guy is undaunted. “Fixing these things is fun for me,” he says.THE NTL CHALLENGE: MARKETING AND MULTI-TASKING■ Stephen Burch must repair cable’s reputation in the UK, where the industry never had the advantages it enjoyed in the US and where the competition is intensifying from old rivals such as Sky and BT and from new broadband providers. The Virgin brand will be key: “We are going to have the number one name in the UK.”■ The expatriate American has to merge NTL with Telewest, its former arch-rival, at the same time as integrating Virgin Mobile, Sir Richard Branson’s mobile phone operator, and raising the standard of service for its 5m-plus customers: “So what? We multi-task,” he says.■ He faces the unique task of creating and marketing the UK’s first “quadruple play” entertainment and communications group, offering television, broadband, and both landline and mobile phone services.■ The new NTL must win the battle for content, extending beyond traditional television programming to buy or make content for broadband and mobile phones."
792;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-06-29T00:32:38Z;Net neutrality suffers another defeat in Senate;;US telecommunications and cable companies on Wednesday scored a big victory in the US Congress by defeating proposals in a key Senate committee for strict price controls on the high-speed networks that will form the next generation of internet connectivity.In an 11-11 vote, the Senate commerce committee on Wednesday failed to include amendments to a broader telecommunications bill that would have prevented AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and other broadband providers from charging more for priority access to the high-speed networks of the future. Similar amendments failed earlier this month in the House.Despite the defeat, the debate over “net neutrality” – the principle that all content providers should be treated equally on the internet – is far from over, lobbyists close to the issue said on Wednesday. The issue pits big telecoms companies against giants of the internet content world, like Google, Yahoo and Ebay. Proponents of net neutrality are expected to keep pressing the issue, including on the floor of the US Senate, where efforts will again be made to add net neutrality language to the bill.“Imposing heavy handed regulation before there is a demonstrated need is wrong,” said Senator Ted Stevens, the Republican committee chair, who was supported by most committee Republicans.But another Republican Senator, Olympia Snowe, who co-sponsored tough neutrality amendments with a Democrat, said before the vote that failure would jeopardise the openness of the internet. “What you will have is a monopolistic, duopolistic controlled network,” she said. “Broadband operators will be able to pick the winners and losers.”The defeat is a big blow to the campaign by internet companies to get tough regulations on internet pricing and discrimination written into law. Telecoms companies say that unless they are allowed to charge more to construct a “fast lane” on the internet, they will not be able to build the new high-speed networks that can handle broadband-hungry services like videos.But internet content companies – backed by an eclectic coalition that includes not just internet civil libertarians and consumer groups, but gun rights groups, the Christian Coaltion and musicians like the Dixie Chicks – say that price differentiation would jeopardise the freedom that has fostered innovation in cyberspace. They want stricter regulation of broadband services, which have been very lightly regulated up to now.Lobbyists close to the issue say that pressure on Congress’s calendar in an election year makes it unlikely that a telecoms bill will make it all the way through the legislative process this year.
793;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Adelphia deal approval may face condition;;Time Warner and Comcast will be forced under the terms of a proposal being circulated at the Federal Communications Commission to offer regional sports programming to competitors to win approval of their $17.6bn takeover of Adelphia.The condition, which people familiar with the situation say was proposed for consideration to the FCC’s four commissioners by chairman Kevin Martin last week, will be welcome news for the cable giants’ rivals, including EchoStar and DirecTV.The condition, in effect, will prevent the two largest cable operators from being able to offer exclusive sports programming to their users - a provision that does not apply across the board to other companies that offer both programming and distribution networks. Time Warner and Comcast declined to comment.Satellite operators and lawmakers have in the past expressed deep reservations about the merger, emphasising concerns that Comcast and Time Warner could get exclusive rights to local sports programming and shut out other broadcasters. The companies are also likely to be subject to a condition that mirrors a provision imposed on News Corporation when it merged with DirecTV involving “baseball-style” arbitration - in which an arbitrator must side with one of two parties - to resolve disputes over local programming.The FCC’s expected approval of the deal, which Mr Martin has indicated would be voted on by mid-July, represents the last significant hurdle facing Time Warner and Comcast’s takeover of Adelphia, the bankrupt cable operator.Mr Martin, who oversaw the approval of two mega-telecommunications deals last year without any onerous conditions, has supported a tougher regulatory approach to the cable industry than his predecessor at the FCC, Michael Powell. Although the FCC chairman has put pressure on the industry to adopt a different pricing model - one that would allow consumers to pick and choose the channels they wish to subscribe to - Mr Martin is not expected to include a provision involving so-called “a la carte” pricing on Time Warner or Comcast in connection to the deal.The Federal Trade Commission approved the deal without imposing any conditions on the companies in February.
794;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-06-09T19:19:40Z;Telecoms groups hail price controls defeat;;US telecommunications and cable companies have scored a big victory in Congress by defeating proposals for strict price controls on the high-speed networks that will form the next generation of internet connectivity.In a vote late Thursday, the House of Representatives resoundingly defeated an amendment that would have prevented AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and other broadband providers from charging more for priority access to the networks.The amendment, which failed by a vote of 269-152, was part of a telecoms bill that passed by a lopsided margin. It included several provisions sought by the phone companies, including making it easier and cheaper for them to offer video services to compete with cable.The debate over “net neutrality” – the principle that all content providers should be treated equally on the internet – is far from over, however. The issue pits big telecoms companies against giants of the internet content world, such as Google, Yahoo and Ebay. They will now take their lobbying campaign to the Senate.But the magnitude of the defeat is a blow to the campaign by internet companies to get tough regulations on internet pricing and discrimination written into law. “The House vote against net neutrality should be a wake-up call to anyone who cares about the future of the internet,” Alan Davidson, Goo-gle’s chief Washington lobbyist, said on Friday, adding that his side expects to fare better in the Senate.Telecoms companies say that unless they are allowed to charge more to construct a “fast lane” on the internet, they will not be able to build high-speed networks that can handle broadband-hungry services such as videos.But internet content companies say price differentiation would jeopardise the freedom that has fostered innovation in cyberspace.
795;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-06-08T22:49:11Z;October date set for Cablevision DVR hearing;;A hearing to determine whether copyright is infringed by a cable company’s plans to introduce remotely-stored recordings of television programmes has been set for October 30, fuelling media industry hopes for a quick ruling on what could have been a protracted legal fight.Cablevision, the cable company that operates in the New York region, has agreed to delay its planned “remote storage” digital video recorders until the suit filed against it by Hollywood studios and television networks to block the service is resolved, according to court filings.DVRs have become popular in the US, with cable companies offering the set-top boxes for free in many cases to encourage their take-up.Advertisers are concerned about the use of DVRs because viewers often use the technology to fast-forward through commercials.The remote storage DVRs, if legal, are expected to be introduced by Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the big US cable operators. It would be cheaper than continuing the deployment of set-box DVRs, which incur the cost of the box and the cost of sending a person to install it.Cablevision, which has about 3m subscribers, would be easily able to offer DVR services to all its 2m digital customer if it was able to store their recorded information on its servers.However, it could potentially increase DVR use from about 10 per cent of cable customers, adding to advertiser unease about the effectiveness of television advertising if more programmes can easily be paused, rewound or fast-forwarded.Analysts said the four studios and five television networks suing Cablevision wanted to be able to play a role in selling advertising related to stored content.Technological advances are making it increasingly possible to, for example, update commercials in programmes or to insert different commercials for different regions or viewing times.
796;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-06-01T19:11:56Z;Cablevision faces network battle;;Hollywood studios and US television networks have joined forces in a legal battle against cable operator Cablevision over the group’s plans to allow many of its customers to easily record TV programmes.The outcome of the recently filed copyright suits could have implications far beyond the services Cablevision is allowed to offer its 3m TV subscribers.Whether Cablevision, which is based in the New York area, can proceed with plans to offer a “network digital video recorder” – a service which would allow viewers to digitally record programmes which are then stored on Cablevision servers and played back at any time – could have a profound effect on television viewing habits and advertising spending.Already, about 10 per cent of American households have digital video recorders (DVRs) installed. These boxes enable viewers to simply record programmes. When they are later viewed, the advertisements can be fast-forwarded.“Although the functionality of the network DVR is identical to that of an in-home DVR, the threat posed to advertising is much greater,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “It would instantly put ad-skipping in front of every digital subscriber, and indeed every room in the house with a digital set-top box, in one stroke. The number of viewing hours affected would dwarf the impact of in-home DVRs.”Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two biggest cable groups in the US, with more than 30m subscribers between them, have declined to comment on Cablevision’s plans. But privately, many executives in the cable industry are hoping for legal clarity on whether network DVRs violate copyright.Currently, DVRs are not subject to any legal wrangling because home recording “fair use” precedents, established when video recorders were introduced, apply. However, content makers argue Cablevision’s plans are, in effect, an offer of all their content “on demand” – a service cable operators provide now but only with the express permission of content groups.If Cablevision does get the all-clear, others are expected to quickly follow. That would cut the cost of offering DVRs, which currently require boxes worth about $200 each and a costly visit by an installer, and would give cable companies another service with which to tempt customers as telephone and satellite companies try to poach them.“If Cablevision gets some resolution to this it will very soon allow network DVRs to spread across the cable industry,” said Josh Bernoff, analyst at Forrester Research.Hollywood studios, TV networks and cable channels have made dramatic moves recently to embrace digital distribution. The growth of broadband connections is making video viewing on the web attractive, and TV programmes are increasingly being shown there, too.In addition, top content is being made available – either for a one-off charge, a subscription price or with advertising – on iPods and other portable devices, mobile phones, for viewing on computers and “on demand” television.Advertisers still spend most of their money on traditional television spots, a sector that was worth nearly $200bn in the US last year. But shifts in attention and the increased ability to speed through commercials has raised questions about its effectiveness. “The television networks are very much concerned about the advertising implications of a jump in DVR usage,” said Mr Bernoff.A legal tussle in the courts could last many years. A compromise could instead be struck, allowing content makers to retain some control over advertising, such as preventing fast-forwarding or allowing commercials to be updated.“There has been a lot of innovation in the last year to meet consumer demands for more flexible television viewing,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS. “This is the first time the programmers are fighting back. It may be a negotiating tactic to ensure they retain control rather than have the distributors taking over.”VIDEO RECORDERS NOT SO BAD FOR ADSThe impact of personal video recorders on television advertising viewing has been greatly exaggerated, according to research released on Thursday by London Business School, writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson.The ethnographic study, in which eight English families were filmed for up to three weeks, found that less than a fifth of programmes were “time-shifted” – recorded to be viewed later – in homes with equipment such as the Sky+ satellite set top box from British Sky Broadcasting.The findings will be jumped on by broadcasters as evidence that their business model is less threatened than many investors and advertisers have feared.LBS found 30 per cent of the commercials were time-shifted. Adjusting for TV sets without recorders, about 80 per cent of ads were viewed live.Cablevision copyright suit timelineMarch 2006 - Cablevision announces plans to test network DVRMay 24 - 20th Century Fox (News Corp), Paramount Pictures (Viacom), Universal Studios (GE), CBS, ABC (Walt Disney), NBC (GE) file suit against Cablevision in US District Court in ManhattanMay 26 - Cartoon Network and CNN (both owned by Time Warner) file suit against Cablevision in US District Court in Manhattan
797;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-05-23T18:54:48Z;Advertisers struggle to reach webwise teens;;"The guitar strums and a male voice intones: “I always tell myself, just a half hour. But six hours later I’m still on.” The chorus kicks in: “MySpace is the place where I can go to be free. MySpace is the place where I can go to read about me . . . “The song is a satirical rock track written by a Los Angeles band called The Fresh which, like many others, uses the hugely popular social networking site to promote its music. But it is an anthem that rings uncomfortably in the ears of many advertising executives as they confront perhaps the biggest challenge to the industry since radio gave way to television half a century ago.For MySpace, the site bought by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp last year for $580m, is dramatically changing the way young people consume media. It is not alone. Facebook, YouTube and Bolt are other sites that have grown rapidly by offering networking opportunities and a forum in which to watch and share user-generated video and music.Teenagers’ disposable income and brand-awareness means they are coveted by advertisers. Internet companies, too, are vying for a share of the spoils: it emerged earlier this week that MySpace was in talks about forging a search link with either Google or Microsoft.Youngsters are no longer content to be passive recipients of the programmes scheduled by television stations. The industry is struggling to come to terms with the switch - as the jargon has it - from a “push” to a “pull” model. In other words, this assertive generation is watching what it wants, when it wants, where it wants.It is all sending a chill through advertising’s bastions. “There is a palpable sense of discomfort,” admits Peter Stabler, head of media at Goodby, Silverstein, a San Francisco-based agency whose clients include Anheuser-Busch, Hewlett-Packard, Netflix.com, Elizabeth Arden, Comcast, Motorola and Doritos. “The media industry has been rather static for 40 years. Now, even in just the last year, there has been more change in media behaviour than at any time since the invention of television. This is leaving many of our clients unsettled.”Although online chat groups, social networks and internet surfing have been consuming a greater proportion of people’s time for years, the ability easily to show, edit and share videos did not exist until the advent of MySpace and its ilk.The result? There is now a real alternative to television viewing. And that matters badly to a television industry largely financed by advertising.Fuelling scepticism about television advertising in the US market, the increased use of digital video recorders allows viewers to record shows and then fast forward through the ads.It is becoming harder to grab the attention even of youngsters who do not have DVRs. Advertisers have realised that members of this generation are skilled “multi-taskers”, using laptops or mobile phones to exchange text messages or e-mails while they are watching television.It is not just the commercial imperative that is driving change. Even Britain’s BBC, the ad-free public broadcaster funded through a mandatory charge made to every British household with a television, is planning to relaunch its website to feature more user-generated content. The aim is to assert its place in the “web 2.0 world” but the move has annoyed commercial rivals, who have criticised the BBC for invading their territory without having to compete for advertising.But it was driven by research that showed large numbers of young Britons never watch BBC television channels.The convulsions are being felt especially strongly in the US. It is the biggest market for advertising, with nearly $190bn spent in total in 2004, according to Veronis Suhler Stevenson. Television advertising took a large share of this. A total of $46bn was spent on broadcast TV advertising in the US and another $19bn on cable and satellite television.But internet advertising is the big growth area. Last year’s record expenditure of $12.5bn - while still relatively small - represented a 30 per cent increase on 2004 according to PwC, and there is no expectation it will slow. So far, most of the internet advertising money is being spent on search-word advertising, a market dominated by Google. But changes in technology, which make it easier to insert interactive video ads onto a large number of websites, are expected to fuel growth in branded advertising on the web.“You have to go where the audience is,” remarks Ross Levinsohn, the head of Fox Interactive Media, News Corp’s new internet division: MySpace is the jewel in its crown. “Consumers under the age of 30 are clearly more oriented towards interactive media. So you have to be authentic as advertisers and publishers to ensure your message [to them] is not diluted or tossed aside.”Advertisers must do more than simply switch their attention from TV or print to the internet. They must change their marketing tactics as well. Many are already doing so ingeniously.This week Burger King started sponsoring a special “Have it your way” page on MySpace.com, where users will be able to download-to-own, free of charge, two episodes of 24, the Fox drama series. Wendy’s, another burger chain, recently created a fictional character called the Square (the shape of the company’s burgers) with a MySpace page which attracted 100,000 users. McDonald’s has also experimented, sponsoring a sports writing competition in conjunction with Fox, which invited people to submit entries via blogs on the Fox sports site.A key moment of realisation for the industry came last year when Mr Murdoch grasped how dramatically the internet was changing the media business. Since his very public damascene conversion, embracing digital media has become a priority for all News Corp’s businesses, from television to newspapers to movies. The media mogul has spent around $1.5bn on acquiring internet companies.Following his lead, all other media companies have in recent months dropped their resistance to making content available in digital formats - on the web, mobile phones and portable devices such as the iPod. Disney’s ABC, for example, has made one its biggest current hits, Desperate Housewives, available on iPods, on-demand, online. It is delivered free with ads - and for a fee without.The shift was strikingly apparent in New York last week when the big US broadcasters - ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC - made their annual pitches to advertisers. For the first time, the stations fell over themselves to trumpet their capacity to reach online viewers.“Television is still the lead dog in the game,” insists Mr Levinsohn. He is increasingly working with his television counterparts at Fox to sell deals to advertisers which offer both television and online exposure - the latter on MySpace and its rivals.But just as content on the web is different to TV content, video-based web advertising is expected to be different too. And that poses its own challengers to advertisers. “Internet advertising is not a toy any more,” adds Pam Zucker, senior vice-president at Marketplace Ignition, part of the media-buying agency MediaVest. “We have really reached a tipping point now because the television guys are taking it seriously. But [marketers] are struggling with what the message should be. As a first step, putting your television ads online is OK. But you have to get to step two quickly and most people are not doing it quickly enough.”So how will this medium change the message? Internet audiences are more fragmented but equally online viewers leave a more visible footprint about their interests, dreams and desires.This means that advertising is likely to become more targeted, with companies developing an array of different messages for different audiences.“Advertising needs to be managed across platforms and [unlike for television] has to be something that isn’t annoying or repetitive” says Adam Gerber, vice-presidnet of ad products and strategy at Brightcove, a company focused on making it easier to advertise and market on the internet.But this diffuse approach may alarm companies used to commanding every aspect of a centralised campaign. “[The new methods] involve a loss of control over your message which is a very scary proposition for all marketers,” says Ms Zucker.Attracting advertisers to user-generated content brings further complications. Much of the content may be unsuitable. As well as potentially distasteful, many of the home videos are very short. The second part of the “MySpace” song describes hunting for pornography on the internet but opting for an exchange on MySpace - not a substitution with which most big brands would want to be associated.Until recently many executives had sought to deny the seismic nature of the changes the media business has undergone. Now most acknowledge them - but are frank about how much they have to learn about the Web 2:0 generation.Says Mr Gerber: “We know the media experience of a 15-year-old today is changing but how does it change in terms of how they control content and choose to view it? We dont know the answers and we will not know the answers until technology and content owners evolve.”GILLY’S GENERATION: “KIND OF GEEKY” BUT WEB 2.0 RULESGilly Bertram embodies the generation that is forcing media executives to re-examine their business models, writes Tom Braithwaite.“I went to bed at, like, six [am],” confides the 22- year-old, who is studying in Paris. “I couldn’t stop watching television.” The note of surprise in the aspiring singer’s voice reveals that, while the late nights are not unusual, an evening in front of the TV is.“Most of the time I just download stuff,” she adds. Music and video arrive down one of France’s ubiquitous broadband lines to her Apple notebook computer. The computer manufacturer also provides that essential of style-conscious youth - the iPod music player.The media content consumed by Ms Bertram and her friends has usually been selected on the internet rather than from the TV listings. If they read a newspaper, it is online; if they watch a TV show, it may have been downloaded onto a laptop.Advertisers are desperate to find new ways of targeting these young people, who often have high disposable incomes and short attention spans. When the content is generated by the users themselves, on sites such as MySpace or Flickr, the job gets even harder.Ms Bertram admits to checking for messages and chatting with friends on the social networking site “religiously” - on top of the three e-mail accounts she uses. “I’ve got a friend, Noella, her whole life is based on MySpace; I met her on MySpace; and she met her band through MySpace. It’s kind of geeky. But it’s just getting to that meeting point.”"
798;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-05-12T22:32:13Z;US telecoms giants give in to NSA;;With one notable exception - Qwest Communications - America?s biggest telecommunications companies appear to have put up little resistance when the National Security Agency requested access to phone call records in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon.The government has separately sought to elicit data from a host of search engine operators in connection to an ongoing debate over the merits of a law governing minors - access to pornography on the internet.Google initially refused a government subpoena to turn over to the Justice Department a wide-ranging demand for information about how individuals use the internet. A court ruled in March that Google had to comply with a portion of that request. Other companies, including Time Warner?s AOL, Yahoo, and Microsoft, had already agreed to the demand.Of the four phone companies the NSA asked for information about customer calls, only Denver based Qwest, the smallest of the big four US telecommunications companies, refused.Qwest’s former chief executive, Joseph Nacchio, backed the company’s attorneys who argued that surrendering its customers’ call-detail records to the NSA was wrong - a decision all the more surprising given Qwest’s extensive contracts with the US government.Mr Nacchio, who is now facing charges of insider trading, confirmed in a statement issued by his attorney that Qwest was approached in the fall of 2001 to permit the government access to the private telephone records of Qwest customers.Mr Nacchio, the statement says, inquired whether a warrant or other legal process had been secured in support of the request, and decided not to comply with the demand after he learned the government had not sought such permission.The decision was based, according to the statement, on Mr Nacchio’s belief that complying with the request would violate the privacy requirements of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.But that fact will probably be strongly opposed by the government. An official at the Federal Communications Commission, the telecommunications regulator, on Friday declined to comment on whether the agency would investigate the matter, but said that an exception in the law governing telecoms operators allowed the companies to provide phone data as required by law.Qwest’s current management, led by Dick Notebaert, chief executive, reportedly broke off talks with the NSA in 2004 after failing to agree on the details. The company has declined to comment on the affair.But unlike Qwest, the three biggest US telecommunications companies ? AT&T, Verizon Communications, and BellSouth - acceded to the NSA requests and began sharing records of tens of millions of their customers’ phone calls with the security agency.While all three have declined to comment in detail on their reasons, lawyers suggest they would have had to balance the NSA request with Federal Communications Commission rules that bar unauthorised releases of customer information ? rules that the carriers insist they did not break.Nevertheless, their compliance with the NSA request paved the way for the a class action suit filed in January against AT&T, the biggest US telecommunications group, by the California-based Electronics Frontier Foundation.The privacy watchdog’s suit, based in part on the claims of a retired AT&T engineer, accuses the phone giant of violating the law and the privacy of its customers by collaborating with the NSA, in its massive and illegal programme to wiretap and data-mine Americans’ communication.The lawsuit, which is due to be heard next week, alleges that AT&T opened its key telecommunications facilities and databases to direct access by the NSA and that AT&T has given the government unfettered access to its over 300 terabyte “Daytona” database of caller information - one of the largest databases in the world.AT&T and the government lawyers have asked the courts to dismiss the suit, arguing that even if the allegations are true, that telecommunications companies have been granted immunity from lawsuits stemming from high level administration requests. In a brief statement on Friday, AT&T said it has had a long history of vigorously protecting customer privacy.But the company added that it also has an obligation to assist law enforcement and other government agencies responsible for protecting the public welfare, whether it be an individual or the security interests of the entire nations.“We prize the trust our customers place in us. If and when AT&T is asked to help, we do so strictly within the law and under the most stringent conditions. Beyond that, we don’t comment on matters of national security.”Similarly Verizon Comminications said: “We do not comment on national security matters. “Questions about national security policies and practices should be directed to the relevant government policymakers, it continued. “Verizon acts in full compliance with the law, and we are committed to safeguarding our customers’ privacy.”However the renewed focus and growing suspicions over the US telecoms giants could cloud the companies legislative agenda, says David Kaut, an analyst at Stifel. The big telecoms companies are involved in a series of contentious issues including the debates over so-called “net neutrality” and video franchising and reform of the current telecommunications legislation. AT&T is also seeking approval for its planned $68bn acquistion of BellSouth.Significantly, the furore over the NSA requests could also highlight the disparity between the regulation of the telecommunications companies and their cable TV broadband telephony rivals whose activities are regulated by the 1984 Cable Act.Despite the growing convergence of the two industries, US cable companies that offer broadband telephony are understood not to have been approached by the NSA perhaps because their share of the telephony market which, while growing quickly, remains relatively small.Like internet service providers that have resisted other attempts by the US government and others to obtain customer information, the cable companies have generally adopted a robust attitude towards information requests.“It is Comcast’s policy and practice to require valid, appropriate legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant, in response to all requests for customer information,” said the largest US cable group on Friday. “It is not company policy to provide the federal government access to customer records or the ability to monitor customer communications in the absence of valid legal process.”
799;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-05-10T20:58:46Z;Sale could alter balance of power in wireless;;The auction of wireless spectrum in the US next month is likely to attract multi-billion dollar bids from not just from established mobile carriers, but also from others seeking to enter a booming market.Indeed, as a recent Lehman Brothers investor briefing paper noted: ?The Federal Communications Commission?s auction of a massive amount of spectrum in late June could alter the balance of power in the US wireless services industry ? now dominated by three or four companies.?It could also have significant implications for the current wireless service providers, tower operators and many technology companies hit by the long term shift of telecoms traffic towards wireless networks.Significantly, the number of minutes of voice traffic carried over US mobile networks is expected to match the declining volume of voice minutes carried over the traditional fixed line networks for the first time this year.The auction covers 90 Megahertz of so-called Advanced Wireless Spectrum (AWS) covering most of the US in the popular 1.7Gigahertz and 2.1Ghz bands and will take place on June 29. Initial applications were due in to the FCC by May 10, which has introduced new anti-collusion rules designed to prevent participants from discussing bids with each other.Time Warner Cable said on Wednesday that it might bid for the auction together with the partners in its mobile telephony joint venture, which include cable operators Comcast, Cox and Advance/Newhouse and Sprint Nextel, the third-biggest US mobile carrier.T-Mobile USA, the fourth largest US wireless operator which is owned by Deutsch Telecom?s T-Mobile unit, is expected to be one of the most aggresive bidders because it needs the spectrum in order to launch 3G and other services.?T-Mobile is in the weakest spectrum position of the four national players,? notes the Lehman report. ?Consequently, despite management?s consistent talking point that ?it will be rational,? we expect T-Mobile to be an aggressive player in Auction 66.?Analysts estimate that T-Mobile will spend as much as $6bn although the company has declined to comment. If T-Mobile USA fails to win a significant slice of the nationwide spectrum up for sale, some analysts believe the carrier will be forced to scale back its ambitions dramatically, or sell out to a rival.Since spectrum is the basic ?raw material? for wireless carriers, the three other leading mobile operators ? Cingular Communications, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel ? have all said they are would be interested ?at the right price,? but are unlikely to be particularly aggressive bidders.However, Sprint Nextel might have greater clout if it bids with the cable companies, which have enormous financial muscle, analysts said.Verizon Wireless, the joint venture between Verizon Communications and Britain?s Vodafone, spent $3bn last year to acquire spectrum in 23 markets from the bankrupt NextWave Wireless but might be willing to bid up to about $3bn to accumulate more ?headroom.?Similarly Cingular has plenty of spare capacity having acquired AT&T Wireless last year and says it has no need to bid for additional spectrum. Nevertheless, the nation?s largest carrier could still register it interest in bidding.Sprint Nextel has arguably the most advantageous spectrum position. Current network traffic uses only a small percentage of the spectrum in the 1900 range that Sprint acquired in the mid 1990s and company has additional spare spectrum in the 2.5Ghz range which it is expected to use to launch a 4G wireless broadband data service.Other potential wireless bidders that have been mentioned include rural regional carriers, Dallas, Texas-based Metro PCS, California-based Leap Wireless.However much of the attention leading up to the auction has focused on what the Lehman note calls ?non-traditional bidders.??We believe non-traditional companies acting alone or in partnerships with current wireless service providers will be active in part to change the negotiating dynamics with the national telecoms service providers regarding ?net neutrality,?? said Lehman. ?Non traditional bidders could include technology companies, cable operators or satellite operators.?While the report did not identify any potential non traditional bidders by name, among companies that have been mentioned are Google, the internet search and advertising giant, and Microsoft although neither has voiced public plans.These companies are at the forefront of the so-called ?net-neutrality? debate and the ability to deliver their advanced services over a broadband wireless connection rather than the Internet could provide them with leverage over traditional carriers like AT&T, Verizon and BellSouth which would like to charge them additional fees for delivering video and other services over their fixed line networks.
800;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-05-10T20:20:51Z;Cable TV groups eye joint bid in wireless auction;;Leading US cable television operators including Time Warner Cable and Comcast are considering a joint bid with Sprint Nextel, the third largest mobile carrier, for wireless spectrum in a high stakes auction set to attract bids from a wide swathe of media and telecoms companies.Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, said the companies, already part of a joint venture to develop wireless offerings for cable customers, would register their interest with the US Federal Communications Commission. They have ruled out separate, independent offers.The cable companies? move signals the growing importance of mobile telephony in the mix of voice, video and data that both cable operators and their telecommunications rivals are seeking to offer customers as part of a services ?bundle?.It also suggests bidding in next month?s FCC auction of 90Mhz of wireless spectrum suitable for 3G services will be fierce and attract attention not just from established wireless carriers, but also new entrants such as technology companies and satellite operators.?The auction of a massive amount of spectrum in late June could alter the balance of power in the US wireless services industry ? now dominated by three or four companies,? said analysts at Lehman Brothers.The filing on Wednesday by the cable consortium and Sprint Nextel does not commit the group to a bid in the auction on June 29, but is necessary for a chance to bid.Other interested parties also needed to register by the end of the day.Mr Britt said Time Warner would ?be very disciplined? about deciding whether to enter the spectrum auction. Other members of the consortium, which was formed with Sprint in November, include Cox Communications and Advance/Newhouse Communications.The auction covers wireless airwaves across the US that can be used for both voice and advanced data services such as broadband wireless and mobile video services. Analysts have estimated that the sale, which could last weeks, could bring in between $8bn and $15bn.While that figure would be far less than the sums raised in Europe through the 3G auctions at the end of the 1990s, it would be one of the biggest spectrum auctions ever in the US.Among the likely bidders are Deutsche Telekom?s T-Mobile USA, the fourth largest US wireless carrier, which needs new spectrum in order to launch 3G services.The auction could also attract bids from companies outside the traditional communications sector, such as Google and Microsoft. Some analysts have suggested such a move would make sense for internet companies seeking to ensure access to broadband delivery systems for their content.
801;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-05-09T17:17:18Z;Cablevision proves value of triple-play;;Cablevision on Tuesday offered further evidence of the popularity of bundled video, telephony and internet services with subscriber growth in the first quarter the strongest since 2000.The Dolan family-run cable operator, based in New York state, with more than 3m subscribers, said its first-quarter loss fell on the back of the higher than anticipated subscriber growth and raised its full-year forecast for new customers.“The Cablevision results were outstanding,” said Douglas Shapiro, analyst at Bank of America. “It beat on every key metric … with the second consecutive quarter of margin expansion.”The strong results echo those recently seen from bigger cable operators.Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the biggest in the US, have also reported better than anticipated results. The ability to offer telephony services alongside video and high-speed internet connections are pulling in more people and keeping them as subscribers for longer.Shares in the sector have risen as a result. Cablevision’s shares rose 1.63 per cent in New York morning trade to $21.24.Investors had marked down valuations for cable companies amid concerns about a price war with telecommunications rivals such as Verizon and AT&T. Although these companies are rolling out video services too, they only offer a bundle of three products in a relatively small part of the US.“The [Cablevision] results continue to show the competitive advantage conferred by cable’s low cost/high capacity plant versus both telcos and satellite,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.Cablevision said its quarterly net loss fell to $58.9m, or 21 cents a share, from $118.9m, or 41 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. Revenue for the quarter rose 16.2 per cent to $1.41bn from $1.2bn.The company raised its 2006 outlook for basic video subscriber growth, saying it expected an increase of 2.5 to 3 per cent, compared with previous guidance of an increase of 2 to 2.5 per cent rise.Revenue growth in the quarter was also boosted by the company’s sports unit.
802;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-05-04T18:43:56Z;Cable plugs wares in living room ‘phoney’ war;;"On the giant screen, an old man in a dark, old-fashioned suit shuffles along in a dusky office, his clumpy shoes bringing up dust. Thousands of cable industry executives laugh at the video clip – an extract from a commercial being shown in the Washington area.It makes fun of the “phoneys” – telephone companies, which the advertisement says have failed to meet promises of innovation and change made in exchange for favourable regulation. It urges no more “sweetheart deals” for the telecommunications giants.The advert was being shown last month to delegates at the US cable industry’s biggest annual gathering with a plea from industry leaders to intensify their efforts to secure a better regulatory climate.“I am sure it is obvious to everyone in this room that the policy environment is fully as intense as the competitive environment,” said Kyle McSlarrow, chief executive of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, cable’s main trade organisation. “And if it feels like we are at the centre of the storm . . . well, we are.”The US communications industry – embracing telecoms behemoths such as Verizon and AT&T, wireless players such as Sprint Nextel, cable companies including Comcast and Time Warner, satellite operators DirecTV and EchoStar, internet groups like Google and Yahoo and also broadcasters such as ABC, CBS and NBC – is arguably entering its fiercest period of competition. Executives from all sides are spending more and more time in Washington and lobbying budgets have ballooned.The NCTA says it is pushing a positive campaign, focusing on the achievements of the cable industry and the jobs it has created. “A great American success story” is the slogan it has adopted in its message to policymakers. Yet the “phoneys” commercial that targets its opponents is a sign of the heightened tensions.Behind this are technological advances that mean companies can increasingly sell similar products. Cable groups offer video, internet and telephone connections. Telecoms groups are beginning to offer television alongside phone and internet services. Internet groups plan free voice services. Content can be seen on computers almost as easily as on television.At the same time, US legislators are beginning to rewrite the rules underpinning the entire industry. The 1996 Telecommunications Act – already woefully out of date, with no mention, for example, of the internet – has to be updated. Regulation has always played a big role in the media and communications sectors, in part to temper the power of monopolistic industries and also to ensure that the public has access to basic services.With telecoms, cable and satellite increasingly at each other’s throats, and with legislative decisions potentially affecting the profitability of businesses or the ease with which new competitors can emerge, a great deal is at stake.“This is something I pay a lot of attention to,” says Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable. “If the wrong sets of rules are passed, investment in the industry could dry up.” Cable executives shudder at the memory of the tough 1992 Cable Act, which cost the industry billions of dollars.These days, issues include the “net neutrality” debate about whether cable or telecoms operators should be allowed to charge for access to high-speed networks or be subject to price controls; whether telecoms operators need to obtain local licences to sell video services in the same way cable operators have done; and whether new providers of telephony should be charged the same taxes that telecoms groups have to pay.In addition, there are questions about consumer access to programming, driven by concerns about the proliferation of “indecent” content. Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission is debating whether packaged multichannel television should be replaced by à-la-carte offers, which the cable, satellite and television industries say would undermine their business model.Most executives say they want a “light touch”, that they want deregulation and that they want the market to decide. “What we are most worried about in all of this is the law of unintended consequences,” Anne Sweeney, president of Disney-ABC Television, said at the cable conference in Atlanta, adding that the market was the best way to allow consumers to get what they needed and wanted.The debate is being held not just in relation to federal regulations but also at state and local levels. State regulators want to retain some powers even as rules change. Often, states have been in control of issues relating to consumer protection, such as handling complaints about billing and false promises.“These [communications] industries are becoming more global but problems will still be local,” Philip Jones, of the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, said during a conference debate. “We are closest to consumers when problems come up. We need to keep our seat at the table.”For some in the industry, there are encouraging signs. For example, a recent congressional committee called on a number of cable industry analysts to testify, a relatively rare request. “I heard that it was considered to be very useful,” says Mr Britt. “The problem is when there is misinformation and misunderstanding.”Regulatory uncertainty is one reason shares in the communications sector have underperformed. So the fights will be ferocious. Telecoms companies are “putting millions of dollars behind false and negative attacks on the cable industry”, Mr McSlarrow maintained, promising the cable executives he represents: “No false and negative ad campaign is going to go without a response.”"
803;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Verizon cuts VoIP charges to match Vonage;;Verizon Communications, the second-largest US telephone company, cut the cost of its VoiceWing broadband VoIP (voice over Internet Protocol) service which includes unlimited local and long distance calling by $5 to $24.95 a month ? the same price as rival Vonage Holdings, the VoIP pioneer that recently filed for an initial public offering.The move signals a more aggressive response from Verizon to the challenge posed by cable TV operators and independent VoIP providers like Vonage that have been signing up traditional telephone customers with cut price telephony deals.Just last week Comcast, the biggest US cable TV network operators, said its first-quarter profit tripled after it signed up more customers for its new telephone service than it did in all of last year .Meanwhile traditional telecommunications companies, including Verizon, continue to report customer defections ? in the latest quarter Verizon reported a 6.9 per cent decline in total access lines to 48m.In order to compete, all the major US telecommunications companies have announced their own cut-price VoIP offering, but have spent little marketing or promoting these services, perhaps because they compete directly with their higher-priced regular voice services.Indeed, some consumers have reported that they have only become aware of the telecoms company VoIP offerings when they call up to cancel their traditional phone service.Like the other leading US telecommunications carriers, Verizon?s senior management, led by Ivan Seidenberg, chief executive, has focused on selling bundles of services built around a broadband DSL or high speed Fios fibre optic connection.
804;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-05-03T15:44:57Z;Cable boosts Time Warner profits;;Time Warner, the world’s largest media company, said its cable systems division “delivered the best quarter in its history”, but the performance of its AOL internet business and Time magazine unit was less stellar.The film division, the company’s biggest, also saw a drop in revenues but cost cuts pushed profitability up more than expected.In the first quarter, Time Warner reported that net income rose to $1.5bn, or 32 cents per share, up from $915m, in the same quarter of last year. Revenue was up 1 per cent to $10.46bn, slightly below average expectations of analysts.Specifically, Time Warner Cable gained subscribers, with customers keen on buying a bundle of video, internet and telephony services.“Time Warner Cable delivered the best quarter in its history,” said Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner. “The triple play bundle is working, driving customer satisfaction up and churn down.” Cable sector shares have rallied following similar results from other cable groups, easing investor fears of an all-out price war with telecoms rivals planning to offer a similar bundle.Time Warner Cable is preparing for a 16 per cent spin-off, as part of the purchase of bankrupt operator Adelphia by Time Warner and Comcast. Mr Parsons said he expected the Federal Communications Commission to approve the Adelphia merger “shortly”.Time Warner’s shares fell 1.8 per cent to $17.11 in morning trade.The results were the first since Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, called off a proxy fight for board control in mid-February. As part of the settlement, Mr Parsons agreed to a $20bn share buyback and to cut costs by $1bn by the end of 2007 in an effort to lift the share price, and said the company was on track to achieve both.So far, $8bn has been spent buying back shares, around 10 per cent of shares outstanding.Mr Parsons confirmed that Time Warner was in talks with Liberty Media about buying out its 50 per cent stake in CourtTV for cash. In addition, Time Warner is in talks to exchange part of Liberty’s 4 per cent stake in Time Warner for assets, believed to include the Atlanta Braves baseball team. A deal is expected soon.Revenue at AOL and Time Warner’s film division, its largest, fell in the first quarter.AOL’s loss of 835,000 dial-up customers pushed profits down 17 per cent to $442m. Advertising revenues at AOL rose by 26 per cent, however, as the restructuring of this part of the business is starting to pay off. Time Warner said it was looking into whether the “ownership structure” of AOL’s European businesses should change.Film’s EBITDA exceeded expectations, rising 19 per cent on cost cuts and gains from selling international film rights. The Time Inc magazine business was “less robust” than Mr Parsons had anticipated, he said, reflecting weak advertising in sectors such as autos and the continued shift online.
805;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-05-02T17:31:50Z;Icahn’s Time Warner stake back in black;;The value of Carl Icahn’s stake in Time Warner, the world’s biggest media company, is back in the black following a rally in the US cable sector. Analysts are expecting that the company’s results on Wednesday will offer a further boost.Time Warner’s share price fell steadily after the billionaire activist called off his efforts to seek board control and push for a break-up of the company.The decline was particularly painful for Mr Icahn, as the 1.35 per cent stake he accumulated was worth less than he paid for it. Most of his stake was believed to have been acquired last August, at just over $17 per share. The three other hedge funds who teamed up with him own a further 2 per cent of Time Warner shares. “It’s a relief that we are at least even again,” said one of the hedge funds.“Although it was a long-term investment, it was still difficult to see it in the red because it is a large position for all of us.”Now, with stock market investors casting off some of their negative views on cable companies in light of the strong take-up of their bundle of video, internet and telephony services, Time Warner’s shares are up again. They were trading on Tuesday at $17.29.The moves follow strong results from rival cable operators. Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, last week reported better-than-expected results, sending its shares higher and giving the whole sector a lift.Time Warner’s results today are expected to show another strong performance for Time Warner Cable. The division accounts for about 40 per cent of the value of the company, which also owns AOL, the Warner Brothers and New Line studios, the Time magazine business and cable groups such as HBO and CNN.In a recent interview with the FT, Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive of the group, said the strong performance of cable could drive the share price higher and he planned to emphasise this in the coming months.Time Warner Cable is preparing to complete its acquisition of Adelphia, a bankrupt operator. As part of the deal, 16 per cent of Time Warner Cable will be spun off.
806;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-05-01T16:38:40Z;BASF stays firm on bid for catalyst group;;"BASF, the world’s largest chemicals group, on Monday set the scene for a showdown over its proposed acquisition of US catalytic converter specialist Engelhard.A the long-running bid battle now looks set to be decided at Engelhard’s annual meeting on June 2.The German chemicals group refused to raise its $38 a share bid but extended its $4.9bn all-cash offer until June 5 and proposed a total of five nominees to join the Engelhard board at the AGM three days earlier.Jürgen Hambrecht, chief executive, said: “Clearly we believe that this will lead them to facilitate the BASF offer and terminate Engelhard’s proposed leveraged recapitalisation and 20 per cent share buy-back.”Last week, Engelhard scotched hopes of a negotiated deal with BASF, after three months of ding-dong talks, unveiling instead a defence strategy centred on a planned $1.2bn share buy-back at $45 a share.Engelhard also said it would extend its board from six to nine, proposing its own nominees. However, if BASF’s nominees are all elected, they would gain the majority on the board.BASF’s three new nominees are Arthur de Graffenried, a former Citigroup banker; William Vinson, a lawyer with Lockheed Martin; and Stanford Warshawsky, an investment banker, former chemicals company director and member of the German-American chamber of commerce.BASF had already proposed Julian Brodsky, chairman of Comcast, and John Linehan, a director of Pacific Energy Partners.Some Engelhard shareholders signalled last week that they expected BASF’s offer – increased from $37 to $38 a share after the group conducted due diligence – to be raised to at least $40.By the previous bid deadline of April 28, less than 1 per cent of Engelhard stock had been tendered by its shareholders.But advisers have stressed that the German company is convinced its offer is already fair and point to Engelhard’s share price, which is only a touch above $38.Mr Hambrecht said on Monday: “If Engelhard’s shareholders don’t vote in favour of our nominees, we will allow our tender offer to expire on June 5 and turn our attention to other opportunities.”Last week, BASF announced a potentially lucrative asset swap deal with Russia’s Gazprom.BASF has been drawn to Engelhard by its catalyst business, which is growing fast thanks to tightening emissions standards around the world. Last week, Engelhard reported first-quarter net income of $69m, up 19 per cent, on revenues of $1.5bn, up 43 per cent.A Reuters poll of analysts yesterday forecast that BASF, which reports first-quarter results on Thursday, would see a 10 per cent increase in revenue."
807;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-04-27T20:29:15Z;Lex: Comcast;;Better late than never. Comcast has finally lumbered onto the trail blazed by rival Cablevision. Strong growth in high-speed internet and telephony customers drove revenues 10 per cent higher in the first quarter. The strength of those products is also helping to reduce basic cable TV cancellations and even to stimulate some growth.UBS estimates cable will take 25 per cent of new pay-TV subscribers in the first quarter. In recent years, satellite operators have taken more than100 per cent – with cable going backwards. Comcast has also demonstrated that it can ratchet up growth without too much extra capital expenditure, resulting in stronger cash flows.It is only one quarter. And the threat from the big telecoms operators – who are laying new fibre to offer their own “triple-play” bundle – is still looming. That will eat into cable’s market share and could affect pricing within the next couple of years, just as cable’s natural momentum slows. But, in the meantime, cable should thrive. Only a tiny proportion of the homes passed by Comcast take its telephony service and 22 per cent take high speed internet. The more customers sign up to multiple products the tougher it will be for telecoms operators to steal them. Investor greed for a slice of the growth is starting to outweigh their fear of pricing Armaggedon further down the line. In spite of rising 17 per cent from their March lows, Comcast’s shares have further to run.
808;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Comcast shares leap as phones pick up;;Shares in Comcast, the world’s biggest cable television operator, rose more than 5 per cent on Thursday after the company reported record numbers of new subscribers for its telephone, high speed internet and digital television services.The results echo similar strong performance by smaller operators, such as Cablevision, and suggest that customers are keen to sign up for bundled telephone, internet and video packages.Comcast has rolled out its digital phone services later than other cable groups, and the first quarter of the year is the first time take-up has been significant. That lag, together with fears of a price war with telecoms groups offering similar bundles, has led to a recent, sharp underperformance of cable stocks.“After many quarters of frustration at its [digital phone] deployment pace, it appears that Comcast is finally in the thick of its phone ramp-up,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “Just as importantly, their voice launch appears to have boosted results in other areas as well.”In the first quarter, Comcast, which has 21.5m video subscribers, added record digital, high-speed internet and voice subscribers, with its increase of 47,000 subscribers to its basic video package the highest for the first quarter in three years.First-quarter net income more than tripled to $466m, from $143m last time. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said the company was “feeling more vibrant than at any other time”.“We are definitely on the offensive,” he told the FT.Even before the strong results, Comcast shares had risen nearly 12 per cent from a low-point in mid-March. By midday in New York, the shares were at $30.75, up 5.3 per cent on the day.The message from cable executives that competition from telecoms companies – which are rolling out video services in addition to their phone and internet connections – is still very limited in much of the US is starting to be heard by investors. The shift has also benefited Time Warner, the world’s biggest media company and second-biggest US cable operator.In recent years, cable companies have lost millions of subscribers to satellite rivals DirecTV and Echostar, but that trend appears to have halted as cable groups offer a broader range of services. Satellite companies are currently trying to find ways to offer two-way services such as high-speed internet access, one of the strongest areas of growth in the US market.Thursday’s Comcast results are likely to fuel this trend. “We expect strong performance to continue this year ahead of burgeoning competition from the telcos, which is not material enough currently to impact the industry,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.Looking ahead, Mr Roberts said this year’s focus would continue to be on selling bundled products, but that next year selling services to companies as well as increasing revenues from interactive advertising would become more important.
809;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-04-26T22:39:48Z;Telecoms groups win ‘net neutrality’ battle in Congress;;Telecommunications and cable companies scored a victory in the US Congress on Wednesday when a key House committee defeated plans for strict price controls on the high-speed networks that will form the next generation of internet connectivity.The House energy and commerce committee voted 34-22 on Wednesday to defeat a Democrat-sponsored amendment that would have prevented AT&T, Verizon and Comcast from charging more for priority access to the high-speed networks of the future. Despite the defeat, the debate on “net neutrality” – the principle that all content providers should be treated equally on the internet – is far from over, say lobbyists, which pits big telecoms companies against giants of the internet content world, such as Google, Yahoo and eBay.Net neutrality emerged as an issue as lawmakers re­write US telecoms law. Both sides agree the future of the internet could be at stake: telecoms companies say that unless they are allowed to charge more to construct a “fast lane” on the internet, they will not be able to build the high-speed networks that can handle broadband-hungry services such as video.But internet content companies, backed by internet civil libertarians and consumer groups, say that price differentiation of this kind would jeopardise the freedom that has fostered innovation in cyberspace. They want stricter regulation of broadband services, which have been very lightly regulated up to now.Ahead of Wednesday’s vote several powerful consumers’ groups, including AARP, the retired people’s lobby, Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America, sent a letter to the committee saying that network neutrality was “the first amendment of the internet” and that the absence of such a provision would “profoundly undermine innovation on the free and open internet”. Most American consumers have at most two choices of broadband service and, in this atmosphere of slim competition, “it is imperative that consumers enjoy the fruits of a non-discriminatory marketplace,” the letter said.Congressmen Rick Boucher, one of the Democrats who sponsored the net neutrality amendment, said that without it start-up companies would face insuperable barriers to entry since they could not afford to compete with established companies offering their services in the fast lane. Google, Yahoo and others have been lobbying hard for network neutrality to be written into the legislation.The version of the bill passed on Wednesday includes four “principles” put forward by Michael Powell, former chairman of the FCC, the communications regulator. It would allow the FCC to take action against service providers if they block subscribers’ access to legal websites or services but does not prevent price differentiation.
810;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-04-11T19:33:06Z;Observer - US;;The cable industry had never quite seen anything like it.Brian Roberts, the youthful chairman and chief executive of Comcast, the biggest cable operator in the US, had never spoken on a panel before with the most senior executives of Cisco, Sprint Nextel, Time Warner, Walt Disney and Motorola. Clearly, the confab – at the big cable show in Atlanta this week – was a sign of the convergence of the media and telecommunications industries.Perhaps a better sign of the convergence might be the fact that all these executives have Roberts on their mobile phone speed-dials. John Chambers, Gary Forsee, Dick Parsons, Anne Sweeney and Ed Zander all confessed they could reach Brian at a touch of a button.The only part of the industry that was not on the panel were executives from the telecoms giants Verizon and AT&T.Presumably, with the cable industry gearing up for a gloves-off fight over regulatory changes – a commercial currently running in the Washington area refers to the false promises of the “phoneys” – Ed Whitacre and Ivan Seidenburg do not have much nice to say to Roberts, the king of cable.Adidas had its first proper chance yesterday to wax lyrical about its acquisition of troubled US rival Reebok and it used it to provide a full array of clichéd sporting and business metaphors.Addressing journalists and analysts separately in marathon four-hour sessions, Adidas’ chief executive, Herbert Hainer, described how the group’s “games plan...and skills” with its “new player” Reebok would allow it to score “more goals”. Both he and Paul Harrington, in his first performance before the press and investors as head of Reebok, made the comment that: “We will show one and one is three and not two.”Unfortunately, the linguistic gymnastics did not end there. Reebok unveiled French and Arsenal footballer Thierry Henry as its new sponsorship deal but Harrington unfortunately insisted on calling him “Terry”.Even Nike – Adidas’ bigger rival – came under the same spell, as a total of six executives refused to pronounce its name, referring only to “our main competitor”.A recent spat between Empire Online and PartyGaming over an operating platform resulted in a $250m payment by PartyGaming after its rival threatened legal action.Now the two online gaming groups are to clash again – only this time the battleground will be an artificial ski-slope instead of a courtroom.Noam Lanir, Empire’s chief executive, and Mitch Garber, the new chief executive of PartyGaming, are to don Velcro ski boots boots and race each other on a 24ft “soft track” at a Global Interactive Gaming Summit and Expo charity event in Montreal next month.Also racing on the ungruelling course will be Casino City’s Michael Corfman, who will be taking on Ken Dreifach of the New York Attorney-General’s Office. The pair should have a lot to talk about, given the hostility of Eliot Spitzer – Dreifach’s boss – towards online gaming.The gaming companies have, so far, pledged more than $50,000 to a London-based charity that provides residential support to gamblers recovering from addiction.
811;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
812;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-04-10T22:32:27Z;Baby boomers force telecoms to explore new shores;;Ed Zander, chairman and chief executive of Motorola, carries around one of the snazziest phones in the world. Yet Mr Zander no longer thinks of the handsets his company makes as just phones. “This becomes my new remote control,” he says, waving a thin, gold-coloured handset around.Motorola is just one of the many companies seeking to ride the dramatic shifts in consumer behaviour. With more than 40 per cent of US households having access to high-speed internet connections, viewing video content on your computer or your mobile phone and downloading it is no longer time-consuming or difficult.In Motorola’s case, the company is developing products that easily allow people to network their homes, connecting all their devices – televisions, DVRs, computers, mobile phones – and sending content such as television shows, music or photos from one to the other.The question is whether these shifts will shake the foundations of the entertainment and communications industries. Worth $500bn a year in the US, the way people have watched television has attracted billions of dollars of advertising that has underpinned the content industry. In addition, about 85 per cent of households pay cable or satellite operators for multi-channel television.Both components of the media – content and distribution – are having to adapt. Content makers, such as Walt Disney, are increasingly willing to experiment with new business models. In Disney’s case, a pioneering move to provide hit series to iPod users was yesterday followed by a plan to make the shows, including Desperate Housewives and Lost, available for free on their website.Anne Sweeney, president of Disney-ABC Television Group, told a cable industry conference that the audience for Disney and others was changing. In particular, she said, studies showed that 40 per cent of the eight-to-27-year-old audience came home after school or work and used between five and eight devices, many at the same time, before going to bed.“Forty per cent of baby boomers go home and watch TV,” she said. “[These differences] are directing my experiments and efforts in technology and content.” Although Ms Sweeney admitted she did not yet know whether internet channels or traditional TV channels would be bigger, she said the overall market for content was growing.That growth will depend, in part, on technology and how quickly it develops. One question is how long it will take Microsoft and other companies to ease the link between the television and the personal computer. Although consumers can download content from the internet and view it on their television today, it is cumbersome to do so.Also, there is a question as to the picture quality the internet will provide. “The viewing experience is not there yet,” says David Card, an analyst at Jupiter Research. “The internet wasn’t engineered to be a mass broadcast medium.”In spite of those kinks, cable industry executives tend to share Ms Sweeney’s optimism that the overall market for media and communications will expand. Consumers in countries such as Japan, Korea and Britain, where mobile content is more easily available than in the US, have already shown they will spend more and consume more.“The pie is going to grow,” says Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner. “When you look at the way people are consuming telecoms and communications services, it has already been shown the pie will grow.”Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, the biggest cable operator in the US, says that increased viewing of television content on, for example, mobile phones, did not threaten the cable industry. In contrast, he says it will increase demand for reliable, high-quality content and also for broadband access, which cable increasingly bundles with video and telephone services.“All those people Anne was talking about will have broadband,” he says. “The biggest disruption is likely to be in the advertising business…advertisers are going to want to go to places where they can target audiences.”This realisation is driving content providers to experiment. The internet test from Disney will include versions of top shows with commercials included.“The horse is out of the barn,” says Bob Clasen, chief executive of Starz, a movie content business.“For the next three to five years all these new distribution platforms will offer incremental growth. But at some point, there will be cannibalisation.”Additional reporting by Joshua Chaffin
813;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-04-09T18:22:39Z;Lex: Satellite operators;;Is satellite television facing the big squeeze? US cable operators are rapidly signing up telephone customers. Telecoms companies have responded with big fibre investment plans – to allow them to offer a rival package of telephone, broadband and video services over one pipe.That leaves satellite stuck in the middle. It cannot yet offer a “triple-play” bundle, leaving it to fight without the same weapons as rivals. So far, satellite operators have not suffered disproportionately. In fact EchoStar and DirecTV shares have outperformed those of Comcast – the biggest US cable operator – by about 10 and 20 per cent respectively since the beginning of 2005. That is largely due to Comcast’s weakness rather than their strength. But, in their defence, DirecTV and EchoStar are adding video subscribers at a good clip compared with Comcast. They are focused on differentiating their TV offerings through high definition services. Their more rural exposure offers some protection. And cash flow should rise rapidly for a few years.Satellite has outfoxed cable before. This time, however, the long-term picture looks more challenging. The cable industry is getting its act together, selling keenly-priced “triple-play” bundles. On top of providing revenue growth, the bundles show signs of boosting customer loyalty and breathing some life into cable operators’ mature video businesses. If, and it remains an if, telecoms operators also make real inroads in the next few years, it would add a competitor and potentially put pressure on video pricing. It could also turn partnerships – telecoms operators currently re-sell satellite video services – into competitive rivalries.It is hard to see many silver linings to the cloud of new competition. Satellite operators will look increasingly naked without a bundle and they are likely to suffer more than the cable operators. But, at least, tougher competition could one day make regulators less adverse to the idea of a DirecTV/EchoStar merger than they were in 2002.
814;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-04-06T22:14:06Z;Report deals blow to a la carte pricing of TV;;The debate over whether cable companies should be forced to unbundle pay-TV packages took a new turn yesterday after an independent congressional report said the benefit of giving consumers more choice “cannot be proven”.The emergence of the report by the Congressional Research Service, which is only released to members of Congress, represents a small victory for cable companies, which have been locked in battle with the Federal Communications Commission about whether a radical change in the industry’s business model would lower prices for consumers.The CRS report flies in the face of a separate study that was released in February by the FCC, which found that allowing customers to pick and choose the channels to which they want to subscribe, also known as the “a la carte” model, would provide “substantial benefits” to subscribers, and cut prices by up to 13 per cent.FCC chairman Kevin Martin has been a vigorous supporter of a la carte, reversing the position the media regulator took on the issue under the leadership of Mr Martin’s predecessor, fellow Republican Michael Powell. Mr Martin’s stance is part of a wider strategy to combat indecency on television.Some of the largest US cable groups, including Comcast, have sought to reach a compromise with the FCC by creating a “family friendly” tier of channels - but critics of the cable industry have said the companies are not going far enough and have used Mr Martin’s February report as ammunition to support their claims.The congressional study yesterday appeared to partially vindicate Mr Powell’s stance on the issue, after Mr Martin said that a study that was released under Mr Powell’s tenure - the “initial report”, which found a la carte was not economically feasible - relied on unrealistic assumptions and presented biased analysis.“It appears that most of the criticisms of the initial report that are presented in the further report [under Mr Martin] either are not supported by available market data or cannot be proven one way or the other,” the CRS said.It did not completely exonerate the FCC’s original position, however, pointing out that the original FCC report, which relied on a Booz Allen study that was paid for by the cable industry, may have overstated the negative impact a la carte pricing might have had on programme networks and operators, and, therefore, the extent to which a la carte would increase prices.

Mr Dyson announced his retirement in September.The company last year signed contracts with two big US cable companies, Comcast and DirecTV, but earnings from the deals were pushed from the first to the second half, and then to the next financial year as the orders were recast and Pace suffered from industry-wide component shortages. The company in March issued its third profit warning in six months after more delays to the US deliveries.In January Pace reported a first-half loss of £9.8m for the six months to December 3, compared with a £4.7m profit for the same period in the previous year.The UK market is maturing and is expected to show little growth until mid-next year, when high-definition TV will begin to take hold. However, Mr Dyson said in January he expected to see second-half revenues boosted by shipments to UPC, the Dutch cable operator, Premiere in Germany, Foxtel in Australia and Sky New Zealand. Pace is the exclusive provider of PVRs to Sky Italia, which bought a record 1.9m set-top boxes last year.The shares were 1p lower to 62.57p in mid-morning trade.
816;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-03-26T18:16:45Z;Debate over ‘net neutrality’ is misplaced;;"Politicians, business and consumer groups used to agree on one government policy: “Hands off the internet.” Now, some internet service providers such as Verizon, AT&T and Comcast want to change the game. They want to stick it both to content providers such as CNN and to consumers, instead of just charging end-users as they do now.Critics fret that this could end the internet as we know it. We think it may bring a better internet if government weighs policies carefully.Both sides agree that it is fine to charge consumers different prices for different speed connections, but the agreement ends there. Some consumer groups and internet content providers such as Google and Microsoft want the government to intervene. Ron Wyden, Democratic senator from Oregon, recently introduced the Internet Non-Discrimination Act of 2006, which would mandate “net neutrality”.Net neutrality means that ISPs charge consumers only once for internet access, and never favour one content provider over another or ask them to pay more. Net neutrality enthusiasts argue that ISPs should not be allowed to charge consumers more for, say, streaming Star Wars than for downloading a recipe. They further argue it should be illegal for ISPs to charge companies such as Google for sending its bits to consumers. Of course, the people supplying high-speed connections see it differently. Fortunately, they face pressure from two sides to behave.Competition among providers for end-users is the best way to spur them to innovate, invest and keep prices down. In 2004, 83 per cent of US zip codes had two or more broadband providers; 67 per cent had three or more. Whether that is enough competition is debatable, but the trend is good: more providers are serving more people.But competition for subscribers is not the only thing keeping providers in check. They also need content, which is why they will think twice before restricting it. Other businesses requiring different types of customers face similar challenges. Some newspapers charge advertisers and readers, while others give papers away. There is no single “right” way to charge different customers in these markets. Broadband providers should be able to price freely, unless consumers are clearly harmed.Rapidly changing technologies mean the boundaries of net neutrality blur quickly. Google, one of the louder advocates, may itself be poised to violate the principle with its bid to provide “free” WiFi in San Francisco. In particular, Google might deliver paid advertisements to users and therefore control how some internet content goes to computers – exactly what net neutralists fear. The way out of the net neutrality box is to drop the slogan and replace it with sound economics. Suppose you believe that broadband providers do not face enough competition. Rather than mandating someone’s notion of an ideal internet architecture, policymakers should consider whether some factors are blocking competition and consumer choice.Two barriers currently reduce choice. The first restricts the use of spectrum – the airwaves that carry wireless signals. Outdated regulations prevent much spectrum from going to its highest-valued use. Lawmakers could give the economy a boost of at least $100bn (€83.1bn) by making more spectrum available and allowing spectrum rights to be traded. One attractive use could be more wireless broadband options.Second, local governments block competition by limiting entry and services that can be provided over broadband lines. New entrants often must obtain local approval and pay fees. Congress should eliminate most of these wasteful, anti-consumer rules.Both these suggestions would improve competition, but a government role is still important. Say a monopoly broadband provider favours itself when providing internet telephone services by charging a competitor a fortune for access. The government should police such behaviour, as it has done, through antitrust laws.The dynamic nature of internet technologies makes it difficult to know what is best for consumers today and in the future. Companies should be able to experiment with different pricing methods. If government regulates who can be charged and how much, it risks snuffing out new competitors who could usher in the next internet revolution. “Hands off the internet” was good policy when it was a new phenomenon; it is good policy now.Robert Hahn is executive director of the AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, where Scott Wallsten is a senior fellow"
817;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;AOL chases broadband growth;;AOL, Time Warner’s struggling internet subsidiary, estimates that it will add 1m subscribers to its US broadband service by the end of the year following an initiative to persuade dial-up customers to convert to high-speed internet.Jonathan Miller, AOL’s chief executive, told FT Deutschland, the FT’s sister paper, that the conversion scheme was unlikely to boost 2006 revenues and might lead to lower profits. “This year, we are certainly creating some pressure on the bottom line by this move in the US to broadband. That’s a conscious decision. It is a classic short-term versus long-term trade-off.”Mr Miller has been attempting to offset declining subscriber revenues with an increase in advertisements. Last summer AOL revamped its free web portal to offer a similar service to Yahoo or Microsoft’s MSN in an effort to boost viewers and attract more ads.While AOL’s overall revenues declined 5 per cent to $8.3bn in 2005, it managed to increase its advertising revenues by 33 per cent, assisted by a buoyant online ad market. However, online traffic has remained flat, leading AOL this year to sign partnership deals with US telecoms operators and cable companies including Verizon and BellSouth to offer its narrowband subscribers a direct conversion to broadband.But by increasing the price of its dial-up service to the same price as its broadband offering – about $26 per month – AOL runs the risk of angry subscribers simply quitting the service instead of converting.Joe Redling, AOL’s chief marketing officer, said hopes for a conversion rate of 10 per cent of AOL’s narrowband subscriber base from its roughly 13m targeted dial-up users were “running pretty much on what we expected or a little above”.AOL’s broadband service, with about 5m customers in the US, has failed to establish itself as a premium internet service while AOL’s dial-up service in the US has lost 7m subscribers over three years. By comparison, AT&T had 6.9m broadband customers at the end of 2005, while Comcast, the US cable group, was the biggest broadband supplier with 8.5m customers.Mr Redling said revenue was expected to suffer as the division had factored in a stronger decline of dial-up customers because of the price increase, as well as having to split the subscription fees for broadband customers with its telecoms and cable partners.According to industry estimates, less than 50 per cent of broadband fees will go to AOL compared with more than 80 per cent of dial-up fees.
818;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-03-21T23:36:10Z;Verizon pays for CBS retransmission;;Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS, has predicted that his media group will earn hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue by getting cable, satellite and telecommunications companies to pay for showing its free-to-air television stations.Payments for so-called “retransmission consent” – for which television stations have often waived fees in exchange for carriage of, for example, cable television channels – is becoming more important as a potential source of revenue amid pressure on advertising revenues and growing content expenses.This week, Mr Moonves’s plan gained credibility after CBS, the part of Sumner Redstone’s Viacom media group that was split in two and therefore shed its ties to cable stations such as MTV, reached an agreement with Verizon’s new television service that involves a payment by the telecoms group for “retransmission consent”.According to people familiar with the deal, Verizon will pay about 50 cents per month per subscriber, similar to fees paid for some cable channels.CBS is leading TV station owners in their efforts to generate extra revenues. Some of the other biggest TV owners, such as News Corp, which owns Fox, and Walt Disney, which owns ABC, are not expected to push payments as they are likely to continue to bundle retransmission with deals for carriage of cable channels.However, others are pursuing the CBS route, including Hearst Broadcasting, Belo Corp, Clear Channel and Nextar Broadcasting Group.“TV station owners, led by CBS, are making a concerted effort to receive cash payments for retransmission of its signal versus the historical practice of bundling retrans with cable network carriage fees,” said Michael Nathanson, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.He said CBS was likely to be successful – as shown by the Verizon deal – but many of the potential benefits would not come for some years. Deals for free transmission with large cable operators such as Comcast do not expire until 2009. However, assuming monthly fees of 20 cents per subscriber for cable and 50 cents for satellite and telecoms, $245m – or about 7 per cent – could be added to earnings before interest depreciation and amortisation in 2010.In spite of the likely benefits for CBS and others – and much of this will depend on negotiating clout and the willingness of TV stations to withdraw their signals if cable operators refuse to pay up – the issue could be a factor for the relative positions of cable, satellite and telecoms operators as they increasingly compete for the same customer base.Just as Verizon and other telecoms players such as AT&T are planning to offer multi-channel television to their customers in addition to telephony services and internet access, cable companies are increasingly bund-ling telephone and internet connections with their traditional television offerings.Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said deals such as the one struck between CBS and Verizon could erode margins for the telecoms companies.“Incumbent cable operators enjoy much greater leverage,” said Mr Moffett.“The local cable operator typically represents 70 per cent of more of a local broadcast station’s distribution and thus its advertising reach.”He added: “Over the longer term, a cash-for-carriage precedent could mean higher programming costs for all players, ultimately resulting in higher consumer prices.”
819;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-03-16T20:16:03Z;Battle of the bundle is at the doorstep;;"Herndon, Virginia prides itself on its small-town charm, preserved despite its proximity to Washington’s Dulles airport and a rapidly rising population. Yet the town is more commercially cutting-edge than it looks.Its 21,000 residents are able to get hundreds of television channels, fast internet access and telephone services, all for less than $100 (£57, €83) a month – one of the few places in the US where that is possible. The reason: a price war between two telephony and cable operators, each offering a “triple-play” package made up of the three services.Technological advances mean companies that previously provided different services are now in a race to meet customers’ entire range of communications needs, in what is being called the “battle for the bundle”.This intensifying competition is set to play a big part in determining the companies’ future and, for the winners, should help provide protection from new entrants and evolving technologies. It is already driving spectacular merger deals in the industry as well as cheaper bills for consumers.In Herndon, the privately owned Cox Communications has been providing bundled services for some time but was charging nearly $130 a month until the larger Verizon Communications, which is moving aggressively into video services, introduced a cheaper package of $109. In response, Cox customers who threaten to close their accounts are being offered a $90 monthly rate to stay.“Telephone companies are discounting advertised entry-level triple-play rates 15 per cent versus cable, nearly double the discount a year ago,” say Bank of America analysts. “Cable companies are not advertising these prices at all, but the discounts to cable advertised prices run to 20 per cent or more.”The Herndon pricing scenario is the sort that has caused stock market investors to fret. Shares in many big telecommunications and cable groups are at lows despite continued improvements in revenues and profits. Investors fear that in the rush to sign up customers to their bundles of communications services, the companies will enter a self-destructive price war.Cable groups across the world are increasingly providing internet and telephony alongside their television services, while telecoms providers are investing tens of billions of dollars to be able to sell television subscriptions alongside phone and internet services. Satellite broadcasters, which for years have taken subscribers away from cable by offering often better channel choices, are trying to find a way around the limits of satellite technology that restrict their ability to offer internet and telephone services.The competition is pushing merger and acquisition activity in telecoms, notably AT&T’s $67bn acquisition of BellSouth to become the world’s biggest player. (The few companies whose shares are performing well are mostly doing so in anticipation of acquisitions.) “It’s a realisation that the world is changing and it’s changing faster and faster,’’ Ed Whitacre, AT&T’s chief executive, says of the deal. “We saw that the sooner we did this, the better off we’d be.”Cable companies are also consolidating: Comcast, the US operator that is the largest cable group in the world, and Time Warner, the second biggest, last year jointly bought the bankrupt Adelphia for close to $18bn.Yet despite the stock market’s focus on the head-on competition among telecoms, cable and satellite groups, the reality on the ground in the US is that, apart from in places like Herndon, there is not yet an actual like-for-like fight. Indeed, in the vast majority of the country, cable companies are the only ones that can offer a bundle of three services.Steve Burke, president and chief operating officer at Comcast, recently observed that all the telecoms companies in the US combined could offer an integrated three-product bundle to about 1 per cent of the same homes that can get these from Comcast. “We have a real head start ... and we’re going to be very aggressive in 2006 and beyond,” Mr Burke said.Indeed, financial results from cable operators that are ahead of Comcast in rolling out triple-play show why hooking up customers to more than one service is one of the recipes for success. Cablevision, based in the New York region and more usually in the headlines due to the various feuds and strategic U-turns taken by members of its controlling Dolan family, surprised investors last month with the strength of its financial performance. About 24 per cent of its subscribers are triple-play customers, a proportion that analysts expect to grow to 37 per cent this year and nearly 50 per cent in 2007.The rate at which customers are leaving their traditional telecoms providers has exceeded expectations. Yet bundling reduces the rate at which customers are subsequently inclined to switch services. This improved loyalty can vastly improve the profitability of cable companies: the longer a customer stays, the more they make because the initial costs of installation and marketing are already covered. Importantly, Cablevision has shown it can increase prices for its bundle once promotional offers are over – subscribers paying $115 a month face a jump to $140.The trend has two implications for cable’s competitors. First, for telecoms groups, it is bad if customers close their telephone accounts – “cutting the copper”, as one cable executive calls it – and switch to cable operators. With most of their video services still some way off – within seven years the telecoms groups are on course to offer video services to around only 40 per cent of the US – the costs of getting these customers back could rise a lot.“The challenge for the telecom companies in getting video customers will not be the cost of laying fibre or of electronics to receive it – that might even be the cheap part,” says Richard Nespola, chairman of TMNG, a consulting group that advises many in the industry. “The real challenge is the marketing costs associated with converting a customer. If there is no relationship with customers at all, then these costs could be very high.”Second, cable companies – which historically have had a reputation for poor service, reflecting their long-held local monopoly status – have invested about $100bn in recent years in upgrading their pipes. As a result, their television offering now compares favourably with what satellite rivals DirecTV and EchoStar offer. The bundle allows cable operators to stem defections to satellite alternatives. “Some cable companies are taking back market share from satellite companies for the first time in 10 years,” says Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “This is all because of the bundle.”In some other parts of the world, competition among communications groups is more advanced than it is in the US. For example, in many countries a “quadruple play” of bundled services – which adds wireless telephony as the fourth leg – is already being provided. In Canada, Rogers Communications, the biggest cable operator, and Bell Canada, its telecoms rival, are thriving: the two both compete and, to an extent, collaborate on broadband.According to Mike Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global, now the biggest cable group in Europe and Japan, the experiences outside the US bode well for cable operators. In particular, he says, customers are more emotionally attached to their television services: telephone and internet connections are regarded as more of a commodity. “We are already fighting tomorrow’s [US] battles today [outside the US] and are largely winning.”One of the lessons of fierce competition is that lower prices are not always negative. Indeed, cutting the cost of, for example, fast internet access has tended dramatically to increase take-up, boosting profits by enhancing overall revenues. Mr Fries anticipates more tiering – with customers able to chose cheaper services that are, for instance, slower to connect to the internet.Telecoms groups have their own advantages over cable, such as vast operations in wireless and business markets. AT&T, for example, will own all of Cingular Wireless after its acquisition, which it will rebrand at AT&T Wireless. Cable companies have tied up with Sprint Nextel, another mobile phone operator, to integrate their services but they do not own mobile networks – widely considered as crucial to keeping customers in the future.In addition, the bundle battle so far is centred mainly on the consumer market. Telecoms companies dominate the business market, which dwarfs the consumer segment. Tom Rutledge, Cablevision’s chief operating officer, says this is the next frontier for cable groups. “Cablevision has moved into that space and the rest of the industry will follow,” says Mr Rutledge.Yet cable may face the same hurdles of getting companies to switch as telecoms groups do to recruit television subscribers. And as the land grab for customers continues, the competitive landscape may keep shifting. Ebay has bought Skype; Google and Yahoo have amassed huge customer bases; Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp is experimenting with ways to offer mobile broadband alongside DirecTV’s satellite TV.Says TMNG’s Mr Nespola: “At the moment there are four big competitors – AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner. Who’s to say there won’t be two more, now unknown, big competitors in the phone business in a few years’ time?”By then, though, residents of Herndon may have been joined by many others able to dial, surf or channel-hop at a cut-price package rate."
820;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-03-15T20:28:25Z;Observer - US;;Tony Ridder’s biggest regretIt did not take long for Tony Ridder to develop seller’s remorse.Ridder, chairman and chief executive of the Knight Ridder newspaper empire, agreed to sell the group his family started in 1892 to a rival clan, the McClatchy family.He has not been shy about showing his displeasure over how it has all played out. One point in particular hurts: McClatchy is selling 12 of the 32 papers, prompting Ridder to comment that that it would lead to continued uncertainty for staff.It must be tough for Ridder, who was under relentless pressure from restless shareholders in recent years to cut staff and other expenses. These moves made him a particularly unloved person in the chain’s newsrooms, as well as in the wider journalistic community.Despite these moves, large shareholders pushed Ridder to sell the group. He says there was no way he could have avoided their taking control of the company if he did not accept the McClatchy offer – which sold the group at 25 per cent above where it was trading before it went on the block.He traces his unfortunate situation back to the merger of the Knight and Ridder family empires in 1974. Then, the families owned such a large part of the company they decided they did not need to split shares into voting and non-voting ones.This mechanism ensures families have control even when they own only a small part of the shares.With media shares in general performing poorly – and newspaper shares in particular – the Murdoch (News Corp), Roberts (Comcast), Redstone (Viacom/CBS), Sulzberger (New York Times), Bancroft (Dow Jones) and Graham (Washington Post) families must be very pleased that they did follow the dual share structure, meaning they do not have to answer to angry shareholders threatening to force their hand.Give some credit to Robert Holmes Tuttle, the US ambassador to the UK, for doing his part to soften his country’s reputation abroad.Tuttle, a California Republican, this week invited a group of British journalists to a screening of Good Night and Good Luck, the George Clooney film about legendary newsman Edward R. Murrow. The hacks munched popcorn and sipped Coke, and afterwards there was a panel discussion about press issues.Needless to say, Tuttle’s choice of film could have been controversial in some circles back home. Clooney, an outspoken liberal, is not a big favourite among some US Republicans. But Tuttle said he had hoped the film would stimulate a lively discussion, which it did. “This is the kind of engagement I want to have here in London,” he says.Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand’s embattled prime minister, has always sought to portray himself as a quintessentially modern leader: the technologically savvy entrepreneur who built his own mobile phone and satellite empire and was the ideal man to “modernise” Thailand to deal with globalisation.But as he now confronts the most serious crisis of his political career, Thaksin has displayed a very old-fashioned characteristic of Thai politicians: deep superstition. In a recent speech to civil servants working at Government House – the seat of his administration – Thaksin accused his political enemies of resorting to black magic against him.Thaksin’s rivals are already staging mass protests to press for his resignation, while opposition parties are boycotting April 2 snap elections, raising the spectre of a one-party parliament with limited legitimacy, or of an election that technically fails to fill all 500 parliament seats, due to low turnout.But the premier said his enemies are also trying to undermine his position with “black magic and superstition”, including using photographs and voodoo-like dolls to cast spells on him.However, he assured them that he was countering such black magic with Buddha amulets and other talismans. He also said that his good deeds for the country over the last five years would help him, giving him “good karma to protect him from evil”.Thaksin – now spending most of his time outside the capital, Bangkok, campaigning for the April 2 polls in which his party is running uncontested – is apparently resorting to other measures to shore up his luck and ward off his enemies’ curses.On a campaign stop in the impoverished north-east – where he remains hugely popular – Thaksin rode a 34-year-old male elephant, which had previously featured in a Thai film, King Naresuan the Great. North-easterners believe that riding an elephant – a highly auspicious animal in Thai tradition and mythology – wards off danger. During his 500m ride, Thaksin was seated astride the neck of the giant pachyderm, which is considered something of a danger itself, since it often results in a fall.But a local expert in elephants – and the supernatural – told bemused journalists at the scene that a powerful man who can successfully control the elephant from such a position will be shielded from harm.After his ride, Thaksin was given a magical elephant prod, which he said he would use to “control” his enemies. And possibly those pesky protesters back in Bangkok.Canny commentBritish architect Lord Foster, in Cannes this week for a big property summit, gave a presentation of his project to build a supertower in Moscow.He was asked whether it would block out the sun. “I think all buildings cast a shadow,” Foster replied helpfully, “but the shadow moves around.”
821;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Texan crests M&A wave;;Ed Whitacre, AT&T’s chief executive, has ridden a wave of mergers and acquisitions to the top of the global telecoms industry. His latest transaction will create the world’s biggest telecoms carrier and consolidate his reputation as a dealmaker.In the process Whitacre, a Texan with a reputation as a conservative business manager with outspoken views, has built Cingular Wireless into the nation’s largest mobile carrier and restored the AT&T name – one of the most widely recognised corporate brands – to its former pre-eminence.After joining the former Southwestern Bell Telephone company in 1963 as facility engineer, Whitacre moved up the executive ladder during a period of technological and regulatory change to become SBC’s chairman and chief executive at the start of the 1990s.Since then he has led SBC – one of the “Baby Bells” formed out of the court mandated breakup of the former AT&T – through an era of exceptional growth and merger and acquisition activity that has reshaped the US telecoms landscape.Those deals included the purchases of Pacific Telesis (1997), SNET (1998), Comcast Cellular (1999) and Ameritech (1999) during the 1990s and the formation of the Cingular Wireless’s joint venture with BellSouth earlier this century.Whitacre anticipated the importance of wireless as a growth driver to offset the growing pressure on traditional fixed telecoms. He was also quick to appreciate the importance of providing broadband internet service as part of a bundle of consumer services that would make it easier to win and retain customers. AT&T is the biggest DSL operator in the US, offering services from $15 a month cheaper than most dial-up services.But perhaps his greatest coup was persuading his counterpart at BellSouth, Duane Ackerman, to raise Cingular’s bid for AT&T Wireless in February 2004 – a move that trumped a competing offer from Britain’s Vodafone.If it had been successful, Vodafone’s bid would have freed Verizon Communications to buy out Vodafone’s 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless, then the largest US mobile carrier – a strategic objective that Verizon has yet to accomplish.Whitacre followed the AT&T Wireless deal with a surprise $16bn bid for AT&T, a move that again outflanked Verizon and triggered Verizon’s bid battle with Qwest Communications for MCI.The AT&T deal closed late last year with SBC adopting the AT&T name and set the stage for what Whitacre now describes as “the next logical move’ – the acquisition of BellSouth that was announced on Sunday.In a recent interview with the FT, Whitacre made it clear that he believed further industry consolidation was inevitable as telecoms companies managed the transition to internet protocol-based technology and geared up for the battle with cable operators to dominate the digital home.“No industry has been as affected by technological change as the telecommunications industry,” he said. “It threw out all the business models – you have to be a survivor.”He confirmed that SBC had looked at potential overseas acquisitions in the past but noted that there were a lot of “roadblocks”.For Whitacre, who had been expected to retire later this year, the BellSouth deal represents the pinnacle of achievement. It also means he is likely to stay on at the telecoms giant he has built at least until the BellSouth deal is completed – perhaps a year from now.
822;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-03-07T00:01:27Z;TV and internet could feel effects of deal;;The creation of the world’s biggest telecommunications company – which is what a combined AT&T and BellSouth would be – will have ripple effects beyond the market for telephone services.The most immediate impact might be an acceleration of deals by telecoms rivals, particularly the US number-two player Verizon Communications. But the $67bn acquisition could also affect the television and internet markets.Already, Shares in the cable and satellite sectors are trading at historically low valuation levels amid investor concerns over the creation of full-service communications companies offering telephony, television and internet services, which could lead to price wars.Technological developments, particularly the growing use of delivery of voice and data over the internet, are letting cable companies such as Comcast Corp and Time Warner offer telephony and internet services alongside television. The driving force behind these initiatives is to lock customers into a bundle of services, from which they are less likely to switch, from, reducing subscriber churn rates.In response, telecoms groups are building networks to provide television services in addition to traditional telephony and high-speed internet and wireless subscriptions. Satellite broadcasters such as DirecTV and Echostar in the US are trying to find a way to extend their services beyond multi-channel television, and are in discussions to provide mobile broadband to subscribers.The new AT&T could fuel concerns about price wars, analysts said, especially because AT&T was the US carrier with the most ambitious television roll-out plans through its Operation Lightspeed plan, and had been willing to offer low prices to customers opting to use its services for internet connections.“The deal will exert some pressure …because of fears that it will increase competition, foremost that AT&T will export its aggressive pricing and [television] strategies to the BellSouth footprint,” said Douglas Shapiro, analyst at Bank of America.The deal might be particularly troublesome for DirecTV, in which News Corp has a controlling stake. DirecTV currently co-markets bundled offerings with BellSouth, and AT&T has a similar agreement with Echostar.“There could be downside pressure to DirecTV subscriber growth targets in the likely event that BellSouth/DirecTV migrates to the broader AT&T/Echostar deal,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.Verizon and rival Qwest may be hurt by the deal as direct competition increases, particularly for business customers, increases, according to Jason Armstrong, analyst at Goldman Sachs. He also predicted the deal would will benefit second-tier and regional telecoms carriers such as AllTel, since it increased the potential for additional rural spin-offs.Both AT&T and Verizon have made clear in the past that they would like to spin off at least some rural lines, while BellSouth had shown much less interest. With AT&T executives likely to dominate the merged company, their strategies are likely to extend into the BellSouth footprint.Outside the telecoms industry, the deal could be positive for companies providing the infrastructure and software that will power the next-generation television networks planned by AT&T – especially Alcatel, the French equipment vendor, and Microsoft, which is supplying AT&T with the software for its television expansion.Yet all of AT&T’s competitors can probably count on a one-year window before big changes come, as it the company deals with the regulatory process and other merger issues. “The initial one to two years will require meaningful integration and potentially make AT&T less nimble than its cable and satellite competitors,” said Doug Mitchelson, analyst at Deutsche Bank. “[This] is clearly a critical period for cable and [satellite] operators to complete their advanced service roll-outs and tie up customers.”
823;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-03-05T20:45:33Z;AT&T regains supremacy with purchase of BellSouth;;AT&T’s supremacy in the telecommunications industry seems assured following its transformation into the largest US telecoms group on the back of a $67bn acquisition of rival BellSouth.The group has been rebuilt into a company with broad similarities to the government-sanctioned monopoly that was broken up more than 20 years ago, but, in terms of its scale and geographic reach, the competitive landscape has changed beyond all recognition from that period.Just a few decades ago the telecoms business was defined by the provision of voice connections over wires, locally or internationally.Today the traditional wireline business is declining, overtaken by strong growth in wireless phone services, high-speed internet connections and the transmission of data.Already, telecoms groups are venturing into a fourth area: providing the video and multi-channel television services currently dominated by cable and satellite operators.This means competition is not just between traditional telecoms groups such as AT&T and Verizon Communications – the number two in the US – but also cable operators.“AT&T will be competing to provide a full bundle of telecommunications services on an increasingly national scale,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS. “This is going to be a four-player race between AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner.”At the start of last year, there were doubts that the once-dominant AT&T could even survive. Its profitable businesses declined after the forced break-up of “Ma Bell” into regional “Baby Bells”.SBC Communications, the Texas-based regional telecoms group that began as one of the “Baby Bells”, acquired AT&T for $16bn just over a year ago. By then, AT&T’s business was mainly focused on corporate clients. It was well regarded by its global customer base although competition had pushed pricing in this sector so low that it was largely unprofitable.Edward Whitacre, the chairman and chief executive of SBC who has spearheaded the group’s $200bn acquisition spree, decided to rename the entire company AT&T last year, thus ensuring the survival of a name closely linked with the development of telephony itself.Now, AT&T is planning to rebrand its Cingular wireless services as AT&T, and facilitate the bundling of wired and wireless services.The bundling of services has so far reduced the churn rate for telecoms and cable companies, a key factor in terms of the profitability of customers.“Together, we will lead the way into a new era of converged and bundled communications, video and entertainment services while also improving our ability to manage complex networks,” said Mr Whitacre yesterday, when the deal was announced.The AT&T and BellSouth combination is not expected to immediately effect pricing in the wired or wireless sectors, analysts said.
824;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-02-24T21:16:52Z;Activist team goes on hunt for votes;;"Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, has so far made
few references to Carl Icahn and his five-month campaign to force a break-up of
the world’s biggest media group.Yesterday, however, Mr Parsons made clear that he was taking the activist shareholder seriously: two of the best-known mergers and acquisitions bankers will be making the case against Mr Icahn’s proposals.Gene Sykes, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs’ global mergers group, and Alan Schwartz, co-president of Bear Stearns, will be poring over the roughly 350 pages of analysis of Time Warner put out by Bruce Wasserstein, another mergers and acquisitions veteran, who heads Lazard and who has teamed up with Mr Icahn.The two bankers – whose previous jobs include defending Walt Disney against a takeover attempt by Comcast – have long been advisers to Time Warner.They have previously considered whether the media conglomerate, which in-cludes AOL, Time Warner Cable, Time Inc magazine publishing and the Warner Brothers studios and cable channels such as CNN and HBO, should be split up.Their roles are now shifting from general advisers to forming the core part of a defence team.With Mr Icahn, Mr Wasserstein and Frank Biondi, a former Viacom chief executive who will lead the proxy fight against Mr Parsons and the Time Warner board, taking the stage yesterday afternoon in front of a Manhattan audience to argue for a four-way split of the media giant, the fight is entering a new phase.“This situation is going to demonstrate less about how activism can generate shareholder value enhancements than about how to conduct an all-out fight for winning the contest,” says Gary Lutin, an investment banker.“Similar to a political campaign, both sides will now offer whatever policies they think will get them the most votes.”Mr Icahn, who has joined forces with three hedge funds and whose group
owns just under 3.5 per cent, has to obtain the backing
of more than 50 per cent
of Time Warner shareholders.At the media company’s annual meeting in May, Mr Icahn is planning to put forward an alternative slate of directors. The slate is expected to be revealed next week.Mr Icahn’s campaign has had little effect on the Time Warner share price, but in the past week there has been a lot of activity in Time Warner shares.The volume of Time Warner shares traded per day has more than doubled from its daily average. The stock price has also outperformed the market, edging to over $18.The question is whether this is the result of strong results from Time Warner or the result of support for Mr Icahn.“There is a feeling the campaign is picking up a bit of momentum,” says one hedge fund that owns Time Warner shares but has not joined the Icahn group.Some of the share strength reflects the purchase of up to $2bn worth of Time Warner shares via derivative positions by a fund in Dubai that is being advised by Mr Icahn.Other analysts attribute the rise in the share price to Time Warner’s strong year-end results, released last week.In addition, moves by Mr Parsons – such as his decision to double the pace of share buy-backs and the sale of the group’s book division to Lagardère of France – show he is being active and focused on taking steps to boost the group’s share price, which has been stagnant for years.Yesterday’s presentation of the “Lazard study” of Time Warner could be a make or break moment in the Icahn campaign – the veteran activist’s biggest proxy fight yet.Hundreds of investors, analysts and media industry onlookers gathered to hear the case for a break-up of Time Warner.If Mr Wasserstein, Mr Icahn and Mr Biondi make a persuasive case, more investors might decide to back the moves."
825;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-02-08T23:14:47Z;Lazard’s Time Warner report under fire;;In spite of filling 343 pages with analysis of Time Warner, the Lazard study unveiled on Tuesday contained little new information. And some of its assumptions were questionable, according to some Wall Street analysts.The report – which Carl Icahn, the activist investor, commissioned from Bruce Wasserstein, the head of Lazard – argued that management mis-steps had cost shareholders $40bn. It recommended Time Warner be split into four companies, that debt be increased to allow a $20bn share buy-back and costs be cut to boost shares beyond their current $18 range.But Doug Mitchelson at Deutsche Bank said: “We were disappointed that nothing really new came out of their presentation or their report.” He added that a $20bn repurchase could over-leverage the company and that some of the valuation assumptions used were too optimistic.The report will form the basis of Mr Icahn’s campaign to push through a restructuring at Time Warner. He plans to put forward an alternative slate of directors at Time Warner’s annual meeting in May, although Mr Icahn only speaks for 3.3 per cent of the group’s shareholders.Analysts questioned Lazard’s estimate of the value of Time Warner Cable in particular. The report assumes it would trade at a multiple of 8 or 9 times operating cash flow, whereas cable groups such as Comcast trade at a lower level of 7.5 times.Mr Wasserstein stressed that his assumptions were conservative and reflected the fact that Time Warner’s businesses were top of the line.Jason Bazinet at Citigroup, who advocates a split of Time Warner, said this would increase the share price to $21. He said the key difference was the extra $1.76 per share, or $863m Lazard attributed to overhead reductions. “This may be too optimistic,” Mr Bazinet said, adding that it was not clear that costs would be reduced by splitting the company.Another question raised was why Mr Wasserstein had not discussed the stock price performance of Viacom, which split from CBS at the beginning of this year. “The glaring omission . . . is the share price performance of the companies, in and out of media, that have already split apart,” said Laura Martin at Soleil.Mr Icahn’s efforts have pushed Dick Parsons, Time Warner chairman and chief executive, into increasing share buy-backs and renewing efforts to cut costs.Douglas Shapiro at Bank of America was sceptical the Icahn plan would muster investor support. However, he said Time Warner shares might still rise. “[Mr Icahn] has already lit a fire under management.”
826;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-02-08T00:47:36Z;Parsons lines up Time Warner defence;;Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, has so far made few references to Carl Icahn and his five-month campaign to force a break-up of the world’s biggest media group.On Tuesday, however, Mr Parsons made clear that he was taking the activist shareholder seriously: two of the best-known mergers and acquisitions bankers will be making the case against Mr Icahn’s proposals.Gene Sykes, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs’ global mergers group, and Alan Schwartz, co-president of Bear Stearns, will be poring over the roughly 350 pages of analysis of Time Warner put out by Bruce Wasserstein, another mergers and acquisitions veteran, who heads Lazard and who has teamed up with Mr Icahn.The two bankers – whose previous jobs include defending Walt Disney against a takeover attempt by Comcast – have long been advisers to Time Warner.They have previously considered whether the media conglomerate, which in-cludes AOL, Time Warner Cable, Time Inc magazine publishing and the Warner Brothers studios and cable channels such as CNN and HBO, should be split up.Their roles are now shifting from general advisers to forming the core part of a defence team.With Mr Icahn, Mr Wasserstein and Frank Biondi, a former Viacom chief executive who will lead the proxy fight against Mr Parsons and the Time Warner board, taking the stage on Tuesday afternoon in front of a Manhattan audience to argue for a four-way split of the media giant, the fight is entering a new phase.“This situation is going to demonstrate less about how activism can generate shareholder value enhancements than about how to conduct an all-out fight for winning the contest,” says Gary Lutin, an investment banker.“Similar to a political campaign, both sides will now offer whatever policies they think will get them the most votes.”Mr Icahn, who has joined forces with three hedge funds and whose group owns just under 3.5 per cent, has to obtain the backing of more than 50 per cent of Time Warner shareholders.At the media company’s annual meeting in May, Mr Icahn is planning to put forward an alternative slate of directors. The slate is expected to be revealed next week.Mr Icahn’s campaign has had little effect on the Time Warner share price, but in the past week there has been a lot of activity in Time Warner shares.The volume of Time Warner shares traded per day has more than doubled from its daily average. The stock price has also outperformed the market, edging to over $18.The question is whether this is the result of strong results from Time Warner or the result of support for Mr Icahn.“There is a feeling the campaign is picking up a bit of momentum,” says one hedge fund that owns Time Warner shares but has not joined the Icahn group.Some of the share strength reflects the purchase of up to $2bn worth of Time Warner shares via derivative positions by a fund in Dubai that is being advised by Mr Icahn.Other analysts attribute the rise in the share price to Time Warner’s strong year-end results, released last week.In addition, moves by Mr Parsons – such as his decision to double the pace of share buy-backs and the sale of the group’s book division to Lagardère of France – show he is being active and focused on taking steps to boost the group’s share price, which has been stagnant for years.Tuesday’s presentation of the “Lazard study” of Time Warner could be a make or break moment in the Icahn campaign – the veteran activist’s biggest proxy fight yet.Hundreds of investors, analysts and media industry onlookers gathered to hear the case for a break-up of Time Warner.If Mr Wasserstein, Mr Icahn and Mr Biondi make a persuasive case, more investors might decide to back the moves.
827;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Telephony delays hit Comcast;;"Investor concerns that Comcast is lagging its cable industry peers in the provision of telephony services – an essential part of the popular “triple-play” bundle increasingly available to consumers – on Thursday pushed shares in the world’s largest cable operator lower.By the close in New York, Comcast shares were down 3.3 per cent to $27, close to their lowest-ever in terms of valuation. Concerns about a price war between cable and telecommunications companies as they extend television, internet and tele
phony services to the same customers have pushed down valuations across the sector.Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS, said: “Comcast is taking a bit longer [than Time Warner Cable or Cablevision] to get the full benefit of the bundle.”Comcast reported consolidated fourth quarter revenue of $5.41bn, versus a consensus forecast of $5.71bn. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were $2.17bn, versus a consensus forecast of $2.18bn. Net income fell by 69 per cent relative to the fourth quarter of 2004, Comcast said, adding this reflected a fall in investment income and a higher tax rate.Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said: “There are a couple of clear positives. In cable, basic subscriber adds of 60,000 met our expectations and beat consensus, and digital subscriber adds were slightly higher than expected.”In addition, a new $5bn share repurchase programme would be “reassuring to investors”, Mr Moffett said.However, Comcast’s cable revenue guidance growth of 9-10 per cent for this year appeared to be lower than its rivals. Time Warner on Wednesday reported strong results for its cable business and revenue grew 13 per cent, whereas Cablevision has reported growth of 15-16 per cent.Comcast began rolling out telephone services over its cable system later than many of its rivals. “Investors have been waiting for two years for [telephony] to ramp up,” said Mr Moffett. “It now looks like they will have to wait another year.”Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive, said the cable group would this year be able to offer a triple-play bundle to more customers than ever. Comcast has reorganised its marketing efforts, which are now integrated to better focus on bundled offerings rather than organised by product line.Additional reporting by Paul Taylor in New York"
828;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-02-02T21:59:49Z;US stocks end down in spite of resilient retailers;;Strong January retail sales failed to prevent a sharp fall in US stocks on Thursday.Federal Department Stores, owner of Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, Gap and Wal-Mart all reported higher monthly sales as shoppers were tempted out by warmer weather.Federated Department Stores gained 4 per cent to $69.73 after it lifted earnings guidance, Gap rose 3.2 per cent to $18.55 as it delivered higher sales when the market expected a fall, while the popularity of youth clothing label Abercrombie & Fitch sent its shares 4.1 per cent higher to $69.27. Wal-Mart rose 0.3 per cent to $46.28 after its figures came in ahead of expectations.While the wider market ended sharply lower, the S&P 500 retail index managed a gain of 0.2 per cent.“The warm weather helped to bring people out and the use of gift cards” also boosted sales, said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The retailers posted good numbers, their guidance was good, and that’s why they are bucking the market.”However, he said that concern remained about a consumer spending slowdown should the wealth effect from the strong housing market end.In the wider market, stocks fell sharply as investors worried about an unexpected drop in productivity in the fourth-quarter and the effect on interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.9 per cent at 10,851.98, the broader S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent to 1,270.84 and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.2 per cent at 2,281.57.Disappointing earnings from Tyco International, the troubled conglomerate, and cable group Comcast also weighed on sentiment. Those stocks fell 5 per cent to $24.80 and 3.5 per cent to $27.02 respectively.General Motors, off 3.7 per cent to $23.60, was the worst performer on the Dow after a downgrade from UBS, while carparts group Dana lost 8.4 per cent to $4.68 as the Securities and Exchange Commission began a formal inquiry into company’s accounting practices.Dana is the worst performing S&P 500 stock this year, off 35 per cent.United Airlines slumped 10.3 per cent to $35.89 on its first day of trading following its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.There were some gainers. Starbucks, the coffee chain, jumped 9.7 per cent to $34.40 after it raised guidance on earnings following a record quarter and confirmed plans to open 1,800 new outlets this year.Ashley Reed Woodruff, at Bear Stearns, raised her price target on the stock by $2 to $39-$40. “Starbucks is off to a strong start in 2006. We expect strong US sales growth and profit improvement internationally to continue to drive the shares going forward,” she said.A sharp jump in quarterly profit boosted washing machine maker Whirlpool. Its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $86.37.
829;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-01-17T10:57:08Z;Pace Micro interims disappoint investors;;Pace Micro, the UK set-top box maker, said delays affecting delivery on two important US contracts could continue as it reported a loss for the first half.The shares fell more than 8 per cent on the news.The loss before tax and restructuring costs for the six months to December 3 was £8.9m, compared to a £4.7m profit for the same period a year earlier. Pace also booked a £970,000 restructuring charge. The company made a loss per share of 4.6p, compared to earnings of 4.4p, and sales almost halved from £150.5m to £78.9m.The York-based company, whose customers include BSkyB and Comcast, has issued three profit warnings since early September, with the latest statement in December warning its 2006 earnings before tax and exceptional items were unlikely to exceed breakeven point.The revisions were mainly due to two significant US contracts with Comcast and DirecTV, won in May and June respectively. Delivery on the contracts has been delayed by changing specifications and industry-wide component shortages.Pace said it was in the “final development stages before delivery of the first products” on both these orders.However, it warned of continued shipment risks: “A number of risks in completing the engineering development for the US shipments still remain and the group is committed to substantial orders of components to fulfil its delivery schedules and to provide a level of protection against possible component shortages.”Of its other markets, continental Europe shipments fell from 1.9m to 500,000 which was attributed mainly to large shipments for the Sky Italia launch the previous year. UK shipments fell by a fifth to 400,000. Pace won a contract in Hong Kong and has begun shipping personal video recorders (PVRs) in Italy, Scandinavia, Australia and New Zealand, along with the first high definition digital set-top boxes for Premiere in Europe.The company said revenues were expected to improve “significantly” in the second half due to shipments growth in the US, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. However Pace cautioned this would be “offset somewhat as in the UK we expect units to continue to decline in the short term”.Nick Hyslop, an analyst at Oriel Securities, said in a note to investors he believed the results published on Tuesday represented a nadir for the company and that the Comcast deal was expected to transform performance. However Ian Robertson from Altium Securities was more bearish, and said the shares appeared to have risen recently on takeover rumours, which he regarded as unlikely.The company said the search for a new chief executive was in its final stages and an appointment would be announced shortly. John Dyson, current chief executive, announced in September he would step down when a replacement was found.The shares were 56p in early morning trade, down from 61p.
830;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2006-01-08T19:50:07Z;Lex: US media;;The logic goes something like this: as technology creates new ways for users to access media products, companies focused on distribution suffer from the fragmentation, while content creators benefit from new ways to sell products. If only life were so simple.Almost all old media companies shared the pain last year, whether focused on distribution (Comcast shares fell 22 per cent) or content (Disney fell 14 per cent). In fact the biggest beneficiaries of the digital revolution have been new “distribution” companies from the technology sector.Take the iPod. The music industry is still struggling with piracy and the decline in CD sales unleashed by digital distribution over the internet. Apple’s iPod created a way for the music industry to benefit from legal downloads.But growth there has not yet offset the decline in CD sales. The real winner has been Apple, whose combined hardware and software distribution platform has taken the lion’s share of profits from new digital sales. Apple’s shares have soared seven-fold in two years.Google’s rise has been even more extreme, and disruptive. Now boasting a market capitalisation bigger than Time Warner and Disney combined, Google has become a powerful gateway for free internet content. As Google, and others such as Yahoo, have grown in popularity, advertising dollars have naturally followed audiences online.But the likes of Google are not simply competitors for the same advertising pie. They pose a deeper threat to some media business models.Take newspapers. Google users do not have to buy specific newspaper titles. Instead, they can select individual stories on a topic of their choice from a range of online publications, usually for free. That harms readership of established offline brands. It also cuts newspapers’ online advertising opportunities by taking readers straight to the relevant page of a site.Separately, search-based advertising targets individuals seeking specific information. That contrasts with traditional branded advertising on, say, television, where effectiveness is harder to measure.New technology allows consumers to choose what media they consume and when – through digital video recorders, video-on-demand or, increasingly, broadband internet connections. Google last week unveiled a service for consumers to pay for video downloads.That all poses serious questions over owners’ ability to keep a firm grip on their content – as the music industry failed to do. Top-quality content will still thrive – see Pixar’s valuation. However, in a more transparent world, media companies will have to respond better to what consumers really want and will find it tougher to push second-rate products down people’s throats.Media executives are rightly scared. Rupert Murdoch has made no secret of his belief in the power of new media, investing heavily in richly-priced acquisitions last year.The success of new business models has reinforced the bear case for US media, which has underperformed the S&P 500 by 16 per cent over one year and 25 per cent over two.Technology shifts have exacerbated the problems of slowing growth in some businesses. Advertising has been relatively lacklustre in areas such as network television and radio. For films, the DVD wave that long boosted profits is ebbing. A slowing economy could put pressure on advertising revenues, piracy could increase for filmed content, and new technologies could continue sucking money from old media.However, not everything is negative. Big media groups still enjoy robust growth from their international arms, their largely fledgling online properties, and, for now, cable networks.With managements under pressure to breathe life back into their share prices, and facing new technology threats, they could start taking tough decisions. That means restructuring cost bases in some areas and experimenting with business models (recent examples include selling episodes of TV shows on iTunes). A healthy dose of fear could be exactly what the businesses need to spur them into action.Having been stripped of their traditional premium, old media stocks could be due a bounce.Merrill Lynch estimates US media majors trade on just over 17 times earnings, slightly above the S&P 500 – but that they will increase earnings by over 15 per cent this year against 10 per cent for the market.Admittedly, that is only one year. Growth further out will be tougher and investors have so far ignored possible catalysts for a bounce. Time Warner, for example, has faced calls for a break-up, increased its share buy-backs and achieved a headline valuation of $20bn for AOL through Google’s investment. In response, the shares have hardly budged.But optimists are right that there are opportunities for the best content companies, as well as threats. Their skills are hard for new media companies to replicate. And new forms of digital distribution, including mobile devices, should add new audiences (and potentially new revenues). The coming years will be full of uncertainty as profits shift around the industry. But consumers overall are likely to keep increasing the amount they spend on media-related products.In 2005, Google and Apple could do no wrong. Traditional media could do no right. That is reflected in the relative valuations. But the resilience of old media’s earnings, coupled with any signs that fear is prompting real action, should trigger a stronger performance in 2006.
831;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-12-22T22:53:26Z;Comcast the latest to clean up its act;;Comcast, the largest US cable operator, plans to offer “family-friendly” programming next year, to assuage religious conservatives and regulators concerned about racy shows.The package will include 16 networks in addition to the company’s basic cable offering, including Disney Kids, C-Span, Nickelodeon, CNN, and the Food Network. It would cost $31.20 a month.The announcement comes a week after Time Warner Cable, the second-largest US operator, unveiled plans for its own “family-friendly” tier. The new services, expected to be mimicked by other cable operators, are seen as an effort by the industry to head off more far-reaching reforms from the Federal Communications Commission.The cable companies are particularly concerned about calls by indecency opponents for an “a la carte” system, in which customers would be able to select and pay for channels individually. Industry groups have argued that such a system would undermine their business model, driving up subscription rates for consumers and forcing many niche channels out of business.The Faith and Family Broadcasting Coalition praised Comcast’s move as “an important step in the right direction”.However, the introduction of such services has sparked debate about which programming should qualify as “family friendly”. While Comcast included Nickelodeon, the top-rated children’s network for the last decade, in its package, Time Warner excluded it.Some conservative groups have accused Time Warner of deliberately creating a bland package to undermine the project.
832;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-12-19T21:50:40Z;Cablevision scraps $3bn dividend;;Cablevision, the New York cable-TV operator run by the Dolan family, scrapped a $3bn special dividend after discovering covenant violations that forced it to cancel $1bn of bonds sold to finance the pay-out.Cablevision, which proposed the dividend after a failed bid by the family to take the group private, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing it had identified “certain technical covenant violations” under a bank loan agreement, and possible issues in other debt documentation.The violations were discovered after Cablevision sold $1bn of bonds last week. The bonds were part of a $4.5bn loan package the company was seeking, with most coming from bank loans.The company might opt to issue the debt and the $3bn special dividend next year once the covenant issues are resolved, said bankers in-volved. However, analysts said it was hard to predict Cablevision’s next move.The company has made a number of strategic shifts in the past year. Charles Dolan, the founder, had a public dispute with his son James over the company’s direction and its loss-making high-definition TV business. Following the row, during which Mr Dolan tried to gain control of the company’s board by firing a number of directors, the loss-making Voom division was sold.Cablevision later made a last-minute bid for bankrupt cable operator Adelphia, acquired by Time Warner and Comcast, the two biggest US cable operators.Then, Mr Dolan made a $7.9bn bid to take the company private, but the plan was ditched after a special committee of independent board members failed to agree on the price offered by the Dolans. The $3bn dividend, which would have meant a $600m pay-out for the family, was the latest strategic plan.Cablevision said its operations had not been affected by the covenant violations, and that it had sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements.The company was able to cancel the $1bn of bonds, sold last week by Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, Banc of America Securities, Bear Stearns, Citigroup and CSFB, because investors had not paid out the money. Cablevision’s debt is rated in the junk category of B2 by Moody’s and B+ by S&P.“While we are surprised with this turn of events, it is seemingly yet another Dolan blunder,” said Matthew Wilcox, analyst at KDP Advisors.Cablevision shares closed down 3.5 per cent to $23.15 in New York on Monday.

Each share of Telewest stock will be converted into 0.2875 shares of new Telewest stock and one share of Telewest redeemable stock, which will convert to $16.25 in cash at the time of the merger.The terms mean Telewest’s shareholders will receive the same value for their shares as under the previous NTL takeover plan.Investors may welcome the arrival of an executive with a strong operational reputation, however, to oversee the complex integration of the two proposed deals and to counter the cable companies’ poor reputation for customer service.Mr Burch has spent 17 years with Comcast, five of them in charge of all operations in its Atlantic division, where he oversaw Comcast’s integration of AT&T Broadband.Mr Duffy’s new role will largely be focused on external affairs for NTL in the UK. He will take charge of mergers and acquisitions, strategy, regulatory and content mattersOne analyst said that bringing in Burch, a 26-year cable industry veteran who helped to integrate AT&T Broadband after it was purchased by Comcast, would help NTL with the difficult task of managing one and perhaps two transformative acquisitions.“The bolstered management team bodes well for the success of the combined company,” said UBS analyst Aryeh Bourkoff. “We do not expect this announcement to affect current Virgin Mobile negotiations or private equity interest in the company.”

835;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-12-14T20:09:05Z;John Gapper: Second act of the broadcasters;;"One immutable belief of the media industry is that television networks are in decline as viewers switch to cable channels, skip advertisements with digital video recorders and watch video iPods. But networks are not only refusing to go gently; they are even perking up a bit.Networks first hit trouble in the US, as cable channels ate into the viewing shares of ABC, CBS and NBC. The US also brought the world the TiVo hard disk recorder, which allows viewers to see shows when they want and skip through advertisements. Now cable companies such as Comcast are further weakening the schedulers’ grip with video-on-demand services.It should be a dubious time to launch a network broadcaster on the stock market, as Viacom is doing by splitting itself in two to make CBS independent again. Sumner Redstone, Viacom’s patriarch, hopes that “low growth” CBS will stop holding back the shares of “New Viacom” and its cable networks such as MTV.As it happens, CBS is in good shape compared with some other networks. Far from losing adult viewers, it has held its audience share over the past eight years. Leslie Moonves, the programming whiz who runs CBS, has engineered a string of hits led by CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Its success has partly come at the expense of NBC, which has been knocked off its peacock throne by CBS and ABC.But things are not as bad for networks in general as some of the gloomy prognostications of the past. Their viewing share has been sinking for a long time but has levelled out. The six networks still get a 47 per cent share of prime-time viewing – hardly death’s door. “People say there is a network television death march but we do not see that,” says Peter Winkler, a director of PwC.The DVR is also turning out better than expected. In theory, the DVR should loosen the loyalty of viewers to network shows because they no longer have to watch what happens to be showing at prime time. They can scan the obscurer reaches of cable schedules, or even take in Rocketboom, the cult video news blog that TiVo is now offering to download to subscribers’ hard disks.Once a couch potato, always a couch potato. In practice, the typical DVR-enabled US household watches more network shows, not fewer. That is partly because they watch more, full stop: being able to catch up with programmes at convenient times allows them to pack more in. And, instead of being more iconoclastic, they mostly record and play back popular television shows.The most-recorded programmes on TiVo are made by networks and a study in 49 local television markets by Nielsen Media Research found that programmes such as CSI, Lost and Desperate Housewives are watched more in homes with DVRs than in those without. Networks should gain when Nielsen starts to include DVR figures in ratings in January.The question is not whether viewers still want to see network shows – they do. It is whether they will carry on watching advertisements with them. Broadcasters are not subscription channels such as Home Box Office: they show programmes free on their networks and rely on advertisements for money. CBS gets 70 per cent of its revenues from advertising.Here, things get murkier. The DVR allows people to fast-forward through advertisements and many do: two-thirds of viewers in a CBS study said that they skipped all commercials and another 26 per cent said they skipped most. Although some say they can remember the commercials they fast-forwarded through, that has added to the uncertainty over the future of the 30-second ad.Advertisers and their agencies, which are irritated about having to pay more to reach fewer viewers, are switching at least some of their dollars to other channels, such as the internet. The balance of power between seller and buyer is shifting: after several years of sharp increases, rates for network advertising rose only modestly this year.Networks are responding by trying to find new outlets for programmes and taking a share of the revenues. This is not entirely new: they already syndicate programmes to cable after they have been shown on their main channels. Now they are allowing shows to be downloaded on to iPods for $1.99 an episode, or watched as video-on-demand for 50c an episode with ads and $1 without.“Everyone says that technology is a threat but we are not sure that is true,” says Fred Reynolds, chief financial officer of CBS. It has clearly shown the value of the biggest shows. The networks are trying to act like Hollywood studios, which make billions from blockbuster films that are first shown in cinemas, then sold to cable and satellite channels and distributed on DVDs.Hollywood has always charged for tickets while networks broadcast free. That makes it tougher to insist now that, as Mr Reynolds puts it, “free is a four-letter word”. CBS knows this well: Larry Tisch, its former owner, tried to insist that cable channels pay to carry the CBS network in the 1980s but lost the battle. Now Mr Moonves says he wants to take this fight to cable companies again.Whether he will actually pull CBS from cable systems that refuse to pay remains to be seen. But his pugnacity shows confidence in the value of his product. Curiously, the rise of DVRs, iPods and video-on-demand could end up doing the old hands a favour. Given a free choice, viewers still want to watch what they always did. That has to be worth something."
836;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;US cable companies to offer ‘family-friendly’ options;;The top cable companies in the US have agreed to offer customers a “family-friendly” pay-TV offering as early as the first quarter of next year, but signalled that any attempt by the government to impose new legislation on the industry to combat concerns about indecency would face a tough legal challenge.Time Warner, Comcast and other cable operators agreed to create a family tier - a package of channels aimed strictly at a so-called family audience - following an intense campaign in Congress and by Kevin Martin, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to compel the industry to adopt tougher self-regulatory guidelines.Kyle McSlarrow, chief executive of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, said in a hearing before Congress on Monday that many cable groups intended to offer a family tier, but that the decision was rife with complications because of existing contractual agreements between cable operators and content providers.Mr McSlarrow said the decision by some cable companies to offer a family tier would lead to some “very serious negotiations” between cable operators and programmers, and hinted that the move by operators to take on such a difficult task should lead Congress to take proposed legislative fixes “off the table”.The cable industry’s decision to capitulate to the demands of the FCC and Congress in spite of those contractual difficulties underscores how vulnerable the industry is to Washington lawmakers and regulators.Mr Martin’s recent call for cable operators to adopt self-regulatory measures to help parents cope with programming that he said too often pushed the “bounds of decency” has coincided with his ongoing regulatory review of a separate but crucial deal for the industry’s two largest players: the joint takeover of Adelphia by Time Warner and Comcast.People close to the cable industry have denied speculation that Mr Martin has implied behind closed doors that approval of the merger would hinge on whether cable groups acted on his concerns on indecency. But they acknowledge that they are aware of the Adelphia issue as they move forward on plans to create family-tier programming.Mr Martin last week did not rule out imposing a condition on the Adelphia merger that would force Comcast and Time Warner to adopt a family-friendly tier. The FCC chairman said after a commission meeting on Friday that his investigation of the deal, which has surpassed the FCC’s standard 180-day review period, was not far along enough to consider possible conditions.Blair Levin, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus in Washington, said he believed the cable move would “at least indirectly” help Comcast and Time Warner in connection to the Adelphia deal.Both Mr McSlarrow and Jack Valenti, a veteran of the entertainment industry, on Monday peppered their remarks before Congress with frequent references to the constitutional right to free speech, alluding to what would likely be a fierce legal showdown before the Supreme Court if regulators or lawmakers moved ahead with plans to impose new laws on the cable industry.Additional reporting by Aline van Duyn
837;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-12-06T21:23:55Z;Lex: Time Warner;;Recent history is not on Carl Icahn’s side. Media conglomerates pursuing break-ups – the strategy he is pushing for Time Warner – have hardly soared in value. Share in Viacom and Clear Channel are each up only about 3 per cent since revealing their plans for a split in March and April.In addition, the activist investor’s estimate that Time Warner is worth $26-$28 a share broken up, against Tuesday’s $18.5, looks optimistic. Suggesting, for example, that Time Warner Cable is worth 9-times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation is aggressive. Comcast, the obvious publicly-traded peer, is worth about 7-times. However, Mr Icahn can argue that, without the prospect of structural change, Time Warner and Viacom would have performed even worse. The US media sector is down 8 per cent since Viacom’s March announcement. Also, that Time Warner management has failed to make a strong enough case for the benefits of keeping cable, publishing, content and AOL under one roof.Mr Icahn, despite an uncompelling strategy and a tiny equity stake, has received a hearing because of broad agreement that there is value to unlock in Time Warner. With Lazard advising, he has the chance to put forward a coherent plan and credible slate of alternative directors. That puts pressure on Dick Parsons to come up with a deal that really enhances the value of AOL – the biggest swing factor for Time Warner. If not, Mr Icahn could find an increasingly receptive audience.
838;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-11-27T20:57:11Z;Video on demand nears ‘magic number’;;The figures for “on-demand” media consumption are headline-grabbing.Apple Computer sold 1m downloads within 20 days of launching its service. On-demand viewing on Comcast Corps cable systems has exceeded 1bn this year. At Time Warner Cable, the average household now watches 30 such programmes a month.After many false starts, on-demand viewing – where programmes are selected from a menu and watched at any time rather than when scheduled – is entering the mainstream.“Video on demand is starting to approach the magic number of once per day per household,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “This shows that on-demand viewing is becoming central to the way families consume media, and means that these families would find it hard to switch to services that do not offer it.”In recent weeks, the push to make the most popular television and film content available at the push of a button has gained momentum. ABC, CBS and NBC – the top US television networks – are experimenting with it. New deals are being announced nearly daily.For the companies competing to provide entertainment and communications this means more pressure to provide a bundle of services. “The rapid growth in on-demand viewing will accelerate the battle of the bundles,” said Peter Winkler, director of entertainment and media practice at PwC, the consulting firm. “Companies will need to create the most conducive environment for on-demand consumption.”At the moment, cable operators offer video, internet and digital telephony through the same “pipe”, meaning each extra service has a low extra cost and the potential for high margins. A deal has also been struck between cable operators and Sprint Nextel, a mobile operator, to offer this service and to develop products that will integrate service on cable TV with mobile phones.Satellite operators such as DirecTV and BSkyB, controlled by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, offer video with some on-demand services via set-top boxes. Their customers can get telephony through deals with telecoms groups.However, as Verizon and SBC Communications, which already offer telephony and internet access, start to offer rival television services, such cross-marketing deals will become less attractive.“There is no good solution out there for satellite,” said Mr Moffett. “The problem with offering bundles that are not delivered over the same platform – such as broadband wireless for satellite or wireless for cable – is that the costs are high and the returns therefore less compelling.”
839;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-11-07T23:45:19Z;CBS and NBC offer shows ‘on demand’;;"Two US broadcasters, CBS and NBC Universal, have signed deals with cable and satellite operators to make top-rated television shows available for “on demand” viewing within hours of being aired.The shows, which include CBS’s CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and Survivor and NBC Universal’s Law & Order and The Office, will be available for 99 cents.Television viewers increasingly expect to watch programmes when they want to rather than when they are scheduled for broadcast.“You can’t stop technology,” said David Zaslav, president of NBC Universal Cable. “People are viewing content differently and this is going to happen.”NBC Universal and DirecTV, the biggest satellite broadcaster, have agreed to make top NBC programmes available through a new digital video recorder, DirecTV Plus, which is being made available at retailers this month. For 99 cents, viewers will be able to watch top shows without commercials.In the deal with CBS and Comcast Corp, the biggest cable operator, popular television shows can, from January, be viewed after they are aired for 99 cents, but commercials will be included. The service will be available to more than 8m digital subscribers.Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said “CBS has taken a giant step forward in experimenting with prime-time video on demand”.Some content makers have been resisting demands to make programmes available on demand for free.The deals announced yesterday provide an economic framework for such distribution and are likely to be followed by similar announcements.Last month, Walt Disney and its ABC television division announced they would offer episodes of hit shows such as Desperate Housewives to view on Apple’s video iPod for $1.99 per
episode.Time Warner Cable plans to launch this year a “Start Over” feature, which will allow viewers to restart television shows that are already in progress. A deal with NBC Universal included the rights to
offer this feature on its
top shows.Mr Zaslav said it remained to be seen what viewers would be prepared to pay for and that, initially, these developments were still experimental."
840;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;The roaming revolution will be televised;;Last week, the heads of four big US cable companies, among them Comcast and Warner Cable, as well as the head of one of the country’s biggest mobile phone operators, Sprint-Nextel, hosted a press lunch in a posh hotel in New York’s Upper East Side.The five CEOs announced a joint venture to develop a series of “converged” services that would allow people to watch clips from their favourite cable television programmes on a mobile device. And some audience members were invited to indulge in a “live” demonstration on their own mobiles.Swarup Acharya might have reacted to this glimpse of the future with a yawn. Based in Murray Hill, east of New York City, the Indian-born computer scientist is working on a project that already makes it possible to access television programmes from all kinds of mobile devices. In the famous Bell Labs of New Jersey, which today belong to Lucent, the telecommunications equipment company, visitors can experience an impressive hands-on introduction to a new style of broadcasting.Mr Acharya’s mission, however, goes beyond displaying television on a mobile phone in real time. His idea is to overhaul the accessibility of pay-TV services. “Today a premium television service is not really linked to a person,” he says. “It is linked to a location. Once you are outside your living room, it doesn’t help you that you have subscribed to a premium television service because you simply can’t access it.”In his showroom this issue has already been solved. To show how a pay-TV service can be accessed from various locations, the research team has set up a makeshift wall between two ordinary television sets with a makeshift wall between them. One of the sets, Mr Acharya explains, resides in the home of a subscriber he calls Frank. The other is in the virtual home of Frank’s friend Paul.Mr Acharya switches on Frank’s set and finds a premium sports channel. He then switches on Paul’s set next door and tries to go to the same station. The electronic programme guide, however, indicates that this channel is not activated, since Paul is not a subscriber. “Now let’s assume that Frank is a huge sports fan and happens to be at Paul’s place when a big football game is on. In today’s world, he simply could not watch the game.”In tomorrow’s world, though, he could. The Bell Lab team has programmed a feature that allows subscribers to log in with their own username and password – just as the e-mail services offered by Yahoo or MSN allow one to check e-mail from any internet terminal. Mr Acharya’s colleague logs out Paul at his home television and enters the pay-TV services with Frank’s identification details. Suddenly, the sports channel that was blocked is activated.With such a system, say the researchers, it would be possible for subscribers to access their pay-TV service not only from a friend’s house but also from hotel rooms during business trips. The same applies to mobile devices, such as laptops or screen phones. The technical foundation for such an innovation is IP-TV, television signals transmitted according to the internet protocol.Mr Acharya admits that cable companies currently do not broadcast in such a way. Yet he points out that IP-TV is already offered in some countries, such as in Spain by Telefónica. More-over, he says, it will have a breakthrough in the US in 2006, when the two biggest telecoms operators in the country, Verizon and SBC, start using their beefed-up telecommunication lines to offer hundreds of television channels via IP-TV.Yet why should any of these operators, let alone the content creators and rights owners, allow such universal access? One danger, for example, is that customers simply hand out their passwords to friends, reducing the number of actual or potential subscribers to a premium television service.According to Mr Acharya the solution to the problem lies in “roaming”, a term from the mobile phone industry that describes the mechanism allowing customers to use their phones outside the operator’s base country for an extra fee. Pay-TV operators, Mr Acharya believes, could adopt a similar system, setting special access fees outside the allocated home to guard against losses in revenue.How far is the system from adoption? Barriers re-main high but a walk through the Bell Lab building suggests it should be taken seriously. It was here that the first sound projector, communications satellite and transistor were produced – devices that changed the world of sound and images forever.
841;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-11-07T17:16:25Z;Market Insight: Competition among US telecoms;;"When Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon chief executive, presented the third quarter results of the nation’s largest telecommunications group late last month, he added an apology to shareholders. “We [Verizon’s senior management] feel bad that the stock has drifted down as low as it did to its two or three year all time low . . . we are committed to get the stock back to levels that we think are commensurate with the underlying asset and values that reside there.”While Mr Seidenberg stopped short of promising a share buyback to boost Verizon’s flagging stock price – something Verizon’s peers, SBC Communications and BellSouth, are planning - he told shareholders, “to the extent there is free cash flow, a share buyback is a good idea.”That will be welcome news for Verizon’s shareholders who have seen the value of their investments fall in recent months to their lowest levels in nearly three years.Even the positive third quarter results unveiled over the past two weeks have done little to lift the gloom. Verizon Communications shares have fallen by 24 per cent in 2005 and underperformed the S&P 500 index by about 16 per cent since the start of the second quarter despite strong subscriber growth from its joint venture wireless business with Britain’s Vodafone. Shares in SBC Communications and BellSouth are also down, though less sharply.Verizon currently has a forward price earnings ratio of about 4.3 times next's year estimated operating earnings, compared with BellSouth's 4.9, SBC's 5 and an average of 9 for the S&P 500. In a recent note to shareholders Jason Armstrong, Goldman Sachs’ telecommunications analyst, argued that the “steep discounts” of the telecom companies’ shares to the market “balances the fundamental risk versus the expected growth.”Indeed some analysts believe the shares would have fallen further but for their high dividend payments; all three have dividend yields that place them in the top 25 of the S&P 500.Top among investor concerns are worries about growing competition for basic telephone services still the most profitable business for the regional carriers. Cable companies led by Comcast, Time Warner and Cox Communications have completed the rollout of their internet telephony services, which they believe will be their next big growth engine, and are now stepping up their marketing efforts for the services.Comcast alone has forecast that it will have 250,000 internet phone customers by year-end and expects to add another million in 2006.Meanwhile independent VoIP companies like Vonage Holdings, Packet8 and eBay’s recently acquired Skype business have moved into the main stream and are targeting consumers with low cost alternatives to traditional telephone packages. While their subscriber numbers remain relatively small, they are growing quickly. IDC, the market research firm, predicts the total number of US residential VoIP subscribers will grow from 3 million this year to 27 million by 2009.In a recent report dubbed ""Peer Comparison: Three US Investment-Grade Regional Bell Operating Companies,"" Standard & Poor’s Rating Service estimated that the three leading US telecoms groups have lost anywhere from 2.4 per cent to 9.5 per cent of their retail access lines on an annualised basis to competitors over the past few years.What is more, the losses appear to be accelerating. Goldman Sachs estimates that the three regional companies, together with Qwest International, lost 5.2 per cent of their residential and business lines in the third quarter, compared with 4 per cent in the year ago period.Verizon and SBC in particular are seeking to offset residential line losses by acquiring more business customers and investing heavily in what they hope will be growth businesses.That was a main motivation behind SBC's plan to buy AT&T and Verizon's proposed acquisition of MCI. Both deals were approved by federal regulators recently. But these acquisitions will dilute 2006 earnings at both SBC and Verizon.Similarly, plans by Verizon and SBC to roll out new fibre-optic based networks capable of delivering advanced services including TV and video involve heavy capital expenditure and will also reduce earnings, at least in the short run.Merrill Lynch estimates that Verizon will spend about $30bn over the next 15 years to build a fiber-optic network that extends all the way into homes and businesses.Meanwhile, SBC is committed to a less-expansive upgrade of its network so that it can offer video and TV services in competition with the cable companies.While the US telecommunications industry may have little alternative if it wants counter the moves by cable TV companies into the traditional voice communications market, investors are likely to remain cautious until they are convinced that the strategy is sound and the returns are real."
842;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-11-03T22:58:56Z;Comcast results fail to inspire;;"Shares in Comcast, the largest US cable operator, fell sharply on Thursday after the cable operator disappointed investors with a decline in video subscriber growth and higher than expected predictions for capital expenditure.The shares moved 5 per cent lower despite 10 per cent growth in revenue to $5.6bn in the third quarter versus the same period last year, boosted by strong growth in the number of digital cable and internet telephony customers as the switch to digital services accelerated.Analysts said Comcast shares had risen this week following stronger than anticipated revenue growth at its competitors, like Time Warner Cable. This resulted in higher expectations for Comcast, too.“With revenue growth for its competitors up 13.5 or 14.5 per cent, Comcast is lagging,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. Much of this was because Time Warner Cable had rolled out digital phone services before Comcast, and this was having a benefit in terms of overall customer spending. “Comcast was late to the voice party but they are catching up,” he said.Comcast said its voice over internet protocol (VoIP) service, which is available to about 12m customers, was on track to add a further 250,000-350,000 subscribers by the end of the year.Overall, Comcast lost 46,000 basic cable customers this quarter.Third-quarter net income rose less than 1 per cent to $222m, or 10 cents a share, the same as in the same period last year.Comcast raised its outlook for expected capital spending, noting that there had been stronger than expected demand for more expensive advanced set-top boxes including DVR (digital video recorders) and for high-
definition TV boxes.As a result, it said full-year 2005 capital expenditure was expected to total $3.5bn, compared with a previous target of $3.2bn-$3.3bn. Free cash flow would grow
30 per cent instead of 35-45 per cent. Higher spending on content initiatives resulted in lower guidance for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation growth."
843;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-11-03T21:43:33Z;Wall Street higher on robust retail data;;Strong monthly sales data from retailers and a sanguine assessment of the US economy by the Federal Reserve chairman pushed Wall Street broadly higher on Thursday.Retailers accounted for the majority of the top 25 best performers on the New York Stock Exchange. Clothing and shoe retailers saw tidy gains but general stores also advanced.Aeropostale, up 10.12 per cent at $22.19, led the charge. Guess was not far behind, up 12.9 per cent to $31.60.Other retailers propelled higher by the broad sector rally included DSW, up 8.6 per cent to $22.75, and Men’s Wearhouse, up 10.65 per cent advance to $28.77.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, fell 0.23 per cent to $47.69 after it reiterated its forecast for same-store sales. Rival Target, a rival, declined 0.3 per cent to $56.80, while Saks fell 0.6 per cent to $18.22.Stocks received a further boost from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who told Congress that the world’s largest economy was still sound, in spite of hurricanes and energy price increases.Against this background, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent, or 49.86 points, to 10,522.59 by the close, while the broader S&P 500 put on 0.4 per cent, or 5.18 points, to 1,219.94. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.74 per cent, or 15.91 points, to 2,160.22.Leading the gains on the Dow was Merck, up 3.8 per cent at $29.48 after a jury found the drugmaker not guilty in a trial related to the side effects of its Vioxx painkiller.Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker and also a Dow component, was up 1.25 per cent to $21.87.Boeing, up 1.2 per cent to $65.50, and McDonald’s, 3 per cent stronger at $33.23, were also among the main gainers on the Dow industrials.Among the companies announcing earnings yesterday, Sara Lee shares increased 2 per cent to $17.87 after the panties-to-pastries group topped analyst forecasts.On the downside, Montpelier Re Holdings shares plunged 13.64 per cent to $18.55 after the reinsurer posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.Comcast, the largest cable TV systems operator in the US, fell 5 per cent to $27.36 after it reported that third quarter profit growth was essentially flat.The news came even as revenue from digital cable and high-speed internet services was showing improvement.Guidant traded down 4.7 per cent to $57.57 after Banc of America slashed the medical device maker’s price target to reflect the uncertainty surrounding Johnson & Johnson’s $25.4bn bid for the company.
844;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-11-02T23:09:13Z;Cable TV groups in Sprint venture;;Four US cable companies, including industry leaders Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable, have entered the fast-growing wireless arena through a joint venture with Sprint Nextel.The deal, which will start in 2006 with the cross promotion of services to offer customers the so-called “quadruple play” of video, internet, phone and wireless access, involves a total initial investment of $200m.“The cross marketing benefits are potentially significant,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “The cable operators bring a combined 75m homes to whom they can market Sprint. Sprint brings 46m wireless subscribers.”The group will aim to develop mobile phone products to enable customers to effectively take their e-mail, voicemail and TV services with them.The establishment of this “third screen”, as the mobile phone is increasingly referred to, comes as communications and media companies race to offer their customers services available on their televisions and computers on mobile devices.Talks between Sprint and the cable companies, which operate in geographic markets with little overlap, have been going on since last year.Cable companies have also considered other options, such as acquisitions of wireless companies or acquiring spectrum to develop networks.Among the services envisaged in the venture, cable customers will be able to watch programmes recorded on their digital video recorders (DVRs) on the new mobile phones.In addition, they could programme their DVRs even when not at home.
845;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-10-31T23:39:40Z;Cumulus and team buy Susquehanna;;Cumulus Media, the second-largest US radio group in terms of stations, has partnered with private equity investors to buy the radio business of privately owned Susquehanna Pfaltzgraff for about $1.2bn.The purchase could place the newly formed group, which includes Bain Capital, Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, in a position to acquire further radio stations in the consolidating US market.Lew Dickey, chief executive of Cumulus, which is based in Atlanta, said yesterday “there is a great deal of benefit of scale in this business”. He said he would “look at all opportunities and evaluate all opportunities that come before us”.Declining radio advertising growth has prompted a re-examination of the radio business by many big players in the sector. Walt Disney, for example, is in the process of assessing bids for its ABC Radio group.The sale of ABC Radio could be crucial to determining who the large companies in the radio business will be. Clear Channel Communications is the world’s largest, but any radio group that buys ABC Radio would be a fiercer competitor.The announcement of the Susquehanna deal pushed Cumulus shares up 11 per cent on Monday, to $12.16.In addition to selling its radio assets, Susquehanna said on Monday it would sell its cable television business to Comcast Corp, the largest US cable operator, for $775m.
846;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-10-26T21:14:29Z;Time Warner board to discuss AOL future;;"Time Warner’s board of directors will hold crucial discussions about AOL’s future at a meeting on Thursday, focusing on whether to partner with Microsoft or Google, although a final decision is not expected immediately.People briefed on AOL’s talks with potential suitors said a number of companies, including Yahoo, had approached the internet division of Time Warner about a possible tie-up, but “serious discussions” continued only with Microsoft and Google at this stage.The Time Warner board, which was recently criticised for its record by Carl Icahn, the activist shareholder who is pressing the media company to increase share buy-backs and spin off its cable business, is not expected to make a decision on AOL’s future for a number of weeks.“There are very robust conversations going on with Microsoft and Google,” said a person familiar with the talks. “But any decision to pursue a deal with one or other is something that, at this stage, will not be decided for a few more weeks.”Comcast, the US cable company, could be part of a Google bid for a stake in AOL. Time Warner and AOL declined to comment on the talks.The interest in AOL marks a shift in sentiment towards the internet business, which has switched its focus to concentrate on building an advertising-driven portal to capture a share of the growing internet advertising
market.AOL, which merged with Time Warner at the height of the internet bubble five years ago, continues to generate most of its cash from its traditional internet dial-up access business but this area is declining and less valuable than the advertising business.Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, has recently stressed that he believes AOL is key to creating value at Time Warner and that unlocking this value is his top priority. Talks with Microsoft are believed to centre on forming a joint venture, whereas talks with Google are focused around selling a stake in AOL.Other items on the board’s agenda include whether or not to increase Time Warner’s planned $5bn share buy-back programme."
847;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-10-25T21:00:21Z;Dolans pull $7.9bn Cablevision offer;;The Dolans cemented their reputation for unpredictability on Tuesday by withdrawing a $7.9bn offer to take private Cablevision, their family-controlled cable operator.Charles Dolan, the company’s founder, and his son James, chief executive, said they had been “unable to reach agreement” with the directors negotiating on behalf of shareholders. Instead, the Dolans, who own 20 per cent of shares but control 71 per cent of votes, have suggested that Cablevision’s board pay a $3bn special dividend in cash to shareholders.Such a move, if supported by the board, could sharply increase the company’s debt levels and may push credit ratings to “junk” levels while giving the family a tax-free cash payment of up to $600m.Shares in Cablevision, whose subscribers are concentrated in the coveted New York area and which also owns the New York Knicks basketball team and the Madison Square Garden arena, fell 12.73 per cent in New York to $24.26.“It is not entirely a surprise that the deal fell apart,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “Valuations have fallen dramatically since the initial offer was made.”Since the offer to take Cablevision private was made in June, investors have shown concern about the potential for price wars as telecoms, cable, satellite and internet companies battle for customers. The valuation of Comcast, the biggest US cable company, has fallen by around 12 per cent since then, analysts said.Even if the board approves the $3bn payout, debt analysts said the sober tone of the corporate bond market in recent weeks might make it difficult for Cablevision to obtain the necessary debt financing.Over the past year Cablevision has seen boardroom coups, battled with Charles Dolan over the loss-making Voom satellite service, fought with New York City over plans for a new stadium and failed to buy more assets from Adelphia Communications.Charles Dolan, aged 79, ousted three directors and installed his own to keep Voom afloat. The company eventually shut down the service after Mr Dolan failed to come up with money to buy the assets. The dispute soured relations between Mr Dolan and his son James, 50, but they are believed to have improved, not least in light of James Dolan’s heart surgery last week.The withdrawal of the buy-out offer has renewed speculation that Cablevision might be for sale. Time Warner, the second-biggest US cable operator, has long been interested in acquiring Cablevision’s New York customers.Additional reporting by Richard Beales
848;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-10-24T17:35:04Z;US cable groups still wondering about wireless;;Comcast and Time Warner, the big US cable operators, have got into the habit at quarterly results presentations of telling investors about the importance of offering their video, internet and phone customers a fourth service – wireless access.Indeed, discussions between the cable companies and wireless operators about some kind of a partnership have been going on for more than a year.As the cable giants prepare for another round of results, starting with Comcast on Thursday and followed by Time Warner next week, the wireless question is likely to be raised again.But although talks continue between a consortium formed by Comcast, Time Warner and Cox Communications – a privately held cable group – and Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US wireless carrier, continue, it is still unclear whether a deal is imminent.“There has been ongoing speculation regarding the outcome of the pursuit of a wireless strategy by the cable consortium,” says Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.On Monday, Multichannel News, a specialist cable industry publication, said a deal was imminent between the cable groups and Sprint, in which Sprint wireless services would be resold by the cable groups.People familiar with the discussions say that, although talks are ongoing, a deal may not be announced any time soon. Indeed, the cable groups continue to talk to Sprint on an individual basis too.One of the issues is that it is not clear what the economic advantages would be of a deal in which the cable groups effectively lease space from Sprint and rebrand it as a Comcast or a Time Warner phone.“Bundles of communications services typically require a discount in order to appeal to consumers,” says Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.“Since there are few, if any, opportunities for cost savings associated with the joint provision of cable and wireless services, the economic basis for a discounted offer is tenuous at best.”While Comcast, Time Warner and Sprint declined to comment on the discussions, Sprint has the network capacity and motivation to provide wholesale or ‘own label’ services to the cable companies, either individually or as a consortium.Sprint already has partnerships with a number of mobile virtual network operators including Virgin Mobile USA, which has built a highly successful business targeting the youth market in the US using Sprint’s network.The offering of bundled services is, however, also about retaining customers.Technological advances are making it easier for companies to offer a range of communications services. The biggest source of profits and growth for cable companies in recent years has been the provision of high-speed internet access, and they are hoping the provision of digital phone access will prove similarly profitable.At the same time, telecommunications companies such as Verizon and SBC Communications are heavily discounting their prices for internet access and are moving ahead with video services. These companies already have wireless affiliates, giving them a potential advantage once their video offerings are up and running.In addition, satellite tv providers such as DirecTV are looking at ways to offer internet and telephony services to their customers through wireless technologies.Mr Moffett says a reselling deal between Comcast, Time Warner and Cox and Sprint, which has already been running trials with Time Warner, would allow the companies to offer wireless services to those customers that wanted it.“It would give a wireless option at low incremental investment,” he says, adding that material benefits to the cable operators and Sprint will hinge on how distribution is approached.Investors are hoping that cable company executives will be giving more away when asked about wireless strategies in the coming days.
849;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Fast-forward puts TV advertising to the test;;New consumer technologies do not always end up being used in the way their developers originally expected – often with unexpected consequences for industry. Mobile phone companies, for example, did not predict the extent to which handsets would be used for text messaging.The uncertainties that govern consumer behaviour therefore make it hard to assess the likely impact of new technologies that promise dramatic revolutions in their respective industries. One such potential drama is being played out across ­television screens around the world.Peter Bazalgette, chief creative officer of Big Brother producer Endemol, has de-scribed personal video re-corders (PVRs) as “one of the most important economic issues facing [the broadcasting] industry now”.A PVR is a television set-top box with a hard disk that can be used to record and play back programmes far more flexibly and conveniently than via a videocassette recorder (VCR).Early PVRs from TiVo and Replay TV were standalone boxes but today most are integrated into the set-top box by satellite and cable operators such as Comcast, Echostar and DirectTV in the US – where penetration is about 10 per cent of all homes.In Britain, penetration is around 4 per cent, dominated by BSkyB’s Sky+ box. PVRs are also now gaining market share in France and Germany. In Japan, 15 per cent of homes have bought standalone PVRs, according to Dentsu, the Japanese advertising agency, but their usage is relatively low.Among most PVR homes, usage is much higher than for VCRs, with viewers watching more programmes they really like – live or in time-shifted playback mode – and fewer “least objectionable” programmes. From a consumer perspective and a pay-TV perspective, PVRs are great. But from the perspective of television advertisers and the channels they fund, they represent a huge potential threat because they make it easy for viewers to fast­forward through the commercials.There is wide disagreement about the extent of this threat. On one side, Andy Jones, joint managing director of Universal McCann, says: “Our research shows that in Sky+ homes 90 per cent of breaks are skipped in playback mode.” On the other side, some commercial broadcasters, such as BSkyB and CBS, say that PVRs have little, if any impact, on advertising effectiveness.It matters who is right. Television is largely a fixed-cost business. Even a small drop in advertising revenue could wipe out profits or force deep cuts in programming budgets, leading to a further loss of commercial audiences as viewers switch to channels funded by subscription or licence fees.Knock-on effects could include pressure on advertising regulations (such as the rules on product placement and sponsorship) and the public service obligations of broadcasters funded by advertising. The potential implications go beyond broadcasting, with PVRs part of a wider trend away from traditional media, funded and controlled by advertisers, towards new media, funded and controlled by consumers.Given its potential importance and the disagreement about its likely impact, the quality of research and ana-lysis of the PVR threat has been disappointing. There has been no shortage of comment and opinion, but few reliable facts.The problem is that advertising exposure is not “on or off” like a regular light switch. It is a question of degree, more like a dimmer switch. Audience behaviour and advertising exposure during commercial breaks are complex, whether during live or time-shifted viewing.Variations occur between different programmes, genres, channels, times of day, commercial breaks, timing within the break, brands and commercials, as well as the fact that PVR ownership somewhat increases total television viewing and perhaps the share of commercial channels. These are all researchable issues, given data and time. There is also the widely held but questionable assumption that when viewers fast-forward through commercial breaks, their advertising exposure falls to zero.We have long known that audiences are only partially attentive during commercial breaks. Twenty years ago, roughly 20 per cent of those viewing a programme were momentarily out of the room during the average break, 10 per cent were present but not viewing, 30 per cent viewing while also chatting, eating, or reading, and only 40 per cent viewing only.Recent research by Initiative, the media agency, suggests that the average percentage of programme viewers fully attentive to a commercial has now fallen to 27 per cent. This is the “base case” against which to compare viewers’ advertising exposure during PVR ­playback. It does not mean that advertising on live television is ineffective – we know it can still be highly effective. It does, however, mean that television, like all marketing communications, is increasingly having to find ways of capturing the attention of consumers with more and more competing activities, distractions and time pressures.To assess the likely impact of PVRs on advertising exposure and revenue in this new, time-pressured world, we need detailed, valid data comparing the same viewers’ behaviour during advertising breaks in time-shifted versus live viewing of commercial programmes. Survey data on what people say they do is neither detailed enough nor valid enough to address the issue. The only valid way to capture the required behaviour in a real-world context is video ethnography in PVR homes.Video ethnography in-volves recording second-by-second audience behaviour in front of the set over many days using a video camera and microphone, while monitoring exactly what was on the television.A London Business School study led by Mark Ritson three years ago used a version of this method to ex-plore the wide range of audience behaviour in commercial breaks during live viewing. These included watching the ads, flicking between channels, chatting (sometimes about an ad), reading, doing chores and briefly leaving the room.We, the authors, are currently conducting a video ethnography study in eight PVR homes. The aim is to throw light on the extent to which fast-forwarding through a commercial (at varying speeds and in different contexts) reduces viewers’ advertising exposure compared with their exposure during live viewing.What is already clear from an earlier pilot in two homes is that the implicit assumption that this reduction is 100 per cent is wrong: people give partial attention to commercials both when they fast-forward (especially at low speed) and during live viewing. Even at high speed, they recognise commercials they have seen before. They also pay more attention to commercials they like and about brands they consider relevant.The results are rich and complex, and this is still work in progress, but the reduction in advertising exposure per PVR home may be significantly less than most commentators have suggested.At the same time, Barb, the UK body that measures television audiences for the industry, is just starting to record PVR usage in Sky+ homes alongside its well established measurement of live viewing. Over the next few months, we should start to get hard, quantitative data on issues such as how much people in Sky+ homes watch time-shifted television, the impact on total viewing and on the viewing of particular programmes, genres, and channels, as well as how much people fast-forward at different speeds, perhaps linked to the timing of the break and of the commercial within the break.The quantitative Barb data and the qualitative video ethnography data will be complementary. They re-present different pieces of the jigsaw. Others include projections of future adoption and studies directly exploring advertising effectiveness in PVR homes.Some issues have already been explored in the US, where the market is further developed. We should, however, be cautious about applying to the UK results from the very different US context, with far more ­commercials and where, at least initially, the PVR was positioned as a high-tech product, in contrast to the easy-to-use service positioning of Sky+.As far as we know, no one in the US has used video ­ethnography to research detailed audience behaviour during commercial breaks in PVR homes. This represents a significant gap.Ten years after the digerati started saying that television and “push” advertising were dead, we are within a few months of a much clearer assessment of the real impact of this particular, much-hyped digital technology in Britain.FURTHER READING■ P.Barwise and A.Ehrenberg, Television and its Audience, Sage, 1988■ Initiative, TV Viewing Lab 2004 report: e-mail sue.moseley@uk.initiative.com■ M.Ritson, “It’s the ad break...”, FT, 4 February 2003■ The MET Report: www.london.edu/marketing/metPatrick Barwise is professor of management and marketing at London Business School and co-author, with Seán Meehan, of Simply Better (HBSP 2004).

850;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-10-17T19:25:19Z;Media groups signal second internet boom;;Earlier this summer, A few months ago Dick Parsons, chief executive of Time Warner, the world’s largest media company, called Brian Roberts, chief executive of cable operator Comcast, with a surprise offer: an invitation to take a stake in Time Warner’s AOL internet portal. The answer from Mr Roberts was politely but firmly He declined.That hardly seemed surprising. AOL, after all, has had long been associated with the worst excesses of the internet boom. , from regulatory scrapes with the US Justice Department to over-ambitious business plans. built on little more than bluster. On Wall Street, the merged company was best known for the record $87bn write-off $99bn loss that Mr Parsons was forced to take two years ago it made suffered in 2002 and for AOL’s continuing presence as an albatross around Time Warner’s neck.But in just a few months, times have changed. Mr Roberts reconsidered his refusal and his company are is now in talks to buy part of AOL. They He are is not alone. Microsoft, Google and Yahoo are also angling for a piece of the portal. All of a sudden, AOL has become one of the most sought after properties on the media landscape. That change is indicative of a broader shift in the media industry. After the bloodbath of the first dotcom boom in the late 1990s, in which global media companies ended up writing off lost billions of dollars in bad investments, a second internet boom is under way.Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, who has developed a reputation as a media visionary, has in recent months made the internet the his top priority for News Corp after shunning it for many years. and has already spent $1.5bn on acquisitions such as MySpace.com and IGN Entertainment, with more purchases likely soon. He says he wants to become a “dominant player on the web”, rivalling internet portals such as Yahoo, and has already spent $1.5bn on acquisitions such as MySpace.com, a fast-growing online community, and IGN Entertainment, a games and content site, with more purchases likely.Sumner Redstone at Viacom has bought one internet company, Neopets, a website for children offering virtual pets, and has tried to buy at least two that News Corp recently bought. MySpace and IGN Entertainment. Robert Iger’s first move as chief executive of Walt Disney was to announce a landmark deal with Apple to sell his company’s top-rated Desperate Housewives television show in a digital format. that can be watched on the new iPod video. The agreement marks a potential milestone in the migration of traditional media to digital distribution devices such as the iPod. It is a development that could further challenge the traditional model of broadcast television and allow consumers to view television, films and other content when and where they choose.And, of course, there is Time Warner, where Mr Parsons has placed an AOL revival at the centre of the company’s future and as the focal point in his fight against a group of revolting fractious shareholders. “Business models have emerged for the internet and people are understanding it is possible to make money,” Mr Parsons told the Financial Times. “I am still a believer in the underlying rationale behind the AOL and Time Warner merger, that the worlds of media and technology are converging.”The boom has been fuelled by two trends that, executives say, mark a crucial difference from the last internet bubble. make it different from the last one. First, there has been a dramatic increase in broadband internet connections around the world, making it easier to watch and download video content on the web. Second is the emergence of internet advertising. Last year, online advertising – search, branded and classified ads – generated revenues of $9.6bn in the US. Over the next five years, Merrill Lynch expects this to grow at more than 20 per cent per a year, four to five times faster than the overall advertising market. By 2009, internet advertising is expected to be worth $25bn in the US.Yet the second internet boom comes at a precarious difficult time for the world’s media giants. Following failed investments five years ago, many of them have shunned the internet until recently. Share prices of US media companies which preside over the world’s biggest media market, worth $500bn per year, have performed dismally amid concerns about the growth prospects of saturated markets and as investors worry that the internet will grab their customers’ attention and money. Indeed, “In the US, “new” media stocks in the US – such as Yahoo and Google have outperformed traditional media stocks by 370 per cent in the past four years, according to Merrill Lynch. analysis. Although digital distribution might open up another market in which media groups can sell their content, the ease and speed with which digital content can be copied raises concerns about piracy and whether that piracy will erode media company profits.All these factors have concentrated the minds of Media companies , who say they want to learn from the mistakes the music industry’s mistake made by of for years ignoring for years customers’ demands for digitally available music. “Fighting piracy is a combination of factors, such as legislation and enforcement, but probably the most important aspect is having appropriate business models which make content available at appropriate prices,” says Peter Chernin, president and chief operating officer at News Corp, told the FT.The second internet boom comes at a precarious time for the world’s media giants. Share prices of US media companies, which preside over the world’s biggest media market, worth $500bn per year, have performed dismally in recent years amid concerns about the growth prospects of saturated markets and as investors worry that the internet will grab their customers’ attention and money. Although digital distribution might open up another market in which media groups can sell their content, the ease and speed with which digital content can be copied raises concerns about piracy and whether that will erode media company profits. A number of strategies to boost their lagging share prices, such as buying back stock or international expansion, have not had a significant effect.Indeed, “new” media stocks in the US – such as Yahoo and Google – have outperformed traditional media stocks by 370 per cent in the last four years, according to Merrill Lynch analysis. This reflects two trends that have changed the internet landscape since the boom of the 1990s – the growth in fast broadband internet access, which results in very fast connections and the boom in internet advertising, which is growing much faster than other areas of advertising and drawing money away from other areas.Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, says investors believe that traditional media companies have “nothing to gain and everything to lose” as consumers make the transition to online media consumption. Reflecting this, gaining internet customers is becoming , increasingly, key to survival. increasingly important. “It is a very dangerous thing for a media company to ignore new delivery opportunities. You ignore these at your peril,” Peter says Mr Chernin. , chief operating officer at News Corp.Yet the attitude towards the internet is very different to from what it was during the first boom. “One of the differences from five years ago . . . is that we have become serious students of consumer behaviour in new media,” said says Steve Wadsworth, president of Walt Disney Internet Group. “We’ve got ten very good at understanding what products work and what products make sense.”The first step of for many media companies strategies has been to try to capture a slice of the growing market in internet advertising. Indeed, many of the changes at media groups are being driven by their advertising executives. Internet advertising was just a tiny offshoot for big advertisers a few years ago, whereas now big accounts have substantial budgets dedicated to it.“Ad agencies have had web components for the past few years....This trend has led to a need on the part of traditional media companies to build out web-only sales teams,” – to respond to the growing demand for web advertising solutions,” said says Larry Kramer, who developed the successful MarketWatch web business recently sold to Dow Jones and is now in charge of digital media at CBS. “Prior to that, many media companies were trying to use their traditional ad sales staffs to sell web advertising. This limited their ability to attract internet advertising, particularly from new advertisers who didn’t already buy TV or print in large quantities.”Global online advertising revenue is expected to rise nearly 40 per cent this year, to $13bn, from $9.6bn in 2004. This is more than five times the pace of growth in most traditional categories and it is drawing advertising dollars away from traditional media.“Media firms have long had the ability to sell ads, but have been short of places to put these ads where they can command top dollar on the internet,” said Ken Marlin. “This is what is driving acquisitions of internet sites by big media companies.”The unique attraction of internet advertising is its measurability. Advertisers can see exactly how many people click on the ads – in sharp contrast to television advertising, which is based on ratings information that is both an estimates and that are is often subjective. This measurability allows some websites to charge more than television. Tom Freston, co-chief operating officer of Viacom, says that advertising rates on the company’s MTV Overdrive broadband site are three to four times the cost-per-thousand viewers of the television equivalent.The Measurability works both ways, however, and some analysts believe the shift to online advertising will only be gradual. “Both the best thing and the worst thing about TV advertising, for instance, is that no one really knows how to measure its effectiveness,” said says Doug Shapiro, analyst at Bank of America.“The lack of measurability is driving much of the shift to the internet but it also creates substantial inertia that impedes dollars flowing away quickly.”Ms Reif Cohen also says it is too early to say that new media companies will be the big winners and that traditional media companies are destined for low growth. “The digital transition is just beginning. While not insignificant, the impact on traditional media business models has hardly been transformational. The core distribution model, for television at least, is unlikely to change significantly in the next decade.”With Although media groups agreed that agree that on the importance of the internet, will be key crucial to the their future, there are still very different their approaches differ. A crucial question is to what degree whether media companies should just simply offer content and effectively in effect be platform-agnostic – an approach favoured by NBC Universal, for example – or whether they should try to control their access to consumers.News Corp is pursuing the latter with its strategy to build a portal. “We are somewhat nervous about having middlemen between us and our customers. We are interested in reaching as many people as possible with our content and interacting with them,” said says Mr Chernin. , who says his priority now is to integrate the many internet properties acquired, particularly in terms of technology and in terms of advertising sales.Mr Murdoch has said he wants to offer search, instant messaging, e-mail and voice services. AOL is already offering much of this and wants to strengthen search, for instance, and this which could be a key an important part of a deal with either Microsoft or Google.However, many of these services could become commodities in the future. Increased competition could even make search, for example, is currently the biggest money-spinner on the web due to search-linked advertising, into less of a differentiating factor. “Applications – telephony, broadband access and even video itself – will dramatically drop in price, in some cases becoming free, as competition to provide them increases and as technology advances continue, particularly in WiFi,” says Leo Hindery, managing partner of InterMedia Partners. “In the process, power will shift back to the content companies and also to the portals.”Not everyone is pursuing the portal strategy. A decade ago, Disney began to invest hundreds of millions of dollars on its ill-fated Go.com portal. The company has now taken a more modest approach, spreading its bets on a variety of emerging businesses, from interactive television to and branded mobile phones to more traditional advertising-supported websites and e-commerce.The unifying factor for all these business is that they are being built around Disney’s content. “Our view of the world is that we’re extremely well positioned to drive value on new media platforms because we have incredibly well-known brands that mean something to people,” Mr Wadsworth says.said.Mr Parsons believes traditional media companies will soon have their day in terms of gaining value on the internet. “The internet goes in waves – first money was made from providing connections, now it is made from search, and my guess is that in three to six years’ time it will be content,” he says.Ms Reif Cohen agrees that, although internet advertising is currently where the money is, to be made, content might yet be valuable too. “It is easy to overlook the opportunity for paid content, but the explosion in the DVD sell-through market has made the power of content ­evident.”Despite In spite of the high degree of internet focus in the media giants’ boardrooms, investors do not ascribe much value to their efforts. Valuations for Google and Yahoo remain way above those for Time Warner, News Corp, Viacom and Walt Disney, despite the fact that revenues at media groups are much higher.This partly reflects the fact that internet revenues, though growing, are only a small slice of the pie. Time Warner , for example, plans to highlight the growth of its ad-driven AOL portal service by splitting out its revenues and profits. , thus giving investors a better way to value it and ascribe growth. News Corp and CBS have set up separate internet divisions that will aggregate these revenues for all the different divisions.It is also because there is no obvious way to value of knowing exactly how valuable the internet yet. will be and what consumers and advertisers will be prepared to pay for. For example, investors and analysts are not yet sure whether distributing films, news and television shows via the internet will generate as much as through current distribution channels. The looming threat of digital piracy could erode the ability of media companies to charge for content.Merrill Lynch has projected that, in five years, ’ time, assuming strong annual growth of 40 per cent in internet revenues and margins of 60 per cent, digital business would account for 8-9 per cent of ebitda for Disney, News Corp and Viacom and 21 per cent for Time Warner. Assuming slow growth of 20 per cent and 40 per cent margins, it would only be 3 per cent for Disney, News Corp and Viacom and 6 per cent for Time Warner.“The internet will move the needle in three to five years from now,” says Mr Chernin. “But it is incumbent upon us to find appropriate business models.”All eyes will be on AOL. The value that Mr Parsons is able to extract for the sale of a stake in his internet business, if any, will be a n important litmus test of how valuable important internet online presence and content are is to media groups.Yahoo advances into traditional territoryAccording to Terry Semel, technological change in the media industry used to be smooth, a periodic transition that did not alter the skills needed to succeed in the business: creating great content and assembling a mass audience, writes Richard Waters.The internet, though, is different. Search, e-mail, blogging and other interactive technologies are changing the relationship between a media company and its audience, and put a premium on command of technology.“To be a media business, technology is in the core – it’s what you must excel at,” the Yahoo chairman and chief executive said earlier this month at the Web 2.0 conference in San Francisco. “I don’t think you can be one without the other: you have to be great at both.”Under Mr Semel, Yahoo has gone further than any other internet company to define what a new media company should look like. It is, he admits, a work in progress: but with its global audience growing by about 25 per cent a year and revenues increasing by 50 per cent, it is a model that has turned heads. That is particularly the case now that Yahoo has started to produce video and written news and entertainment that in some ways rivals that of the big traditional media groups.Mr Semel is in no doubt about what it took to bring 379m unique users to Yahoo’s “network” during the second quarter of this year. “Everywhere you go in Yahoo, whether it’s autos or sport, it’s all content,” he said. Delivering more and better content is central to his goal of persuading users to return more often and stay longer. Yahoo generates revenues of only 78 cents per user each month, a figure it hopes to increase by building loyalty.Yahoo has long used unique content to attract users, even if the internet company produced little of that itself. User-generated material, from personal ads to discussions in chat rooms, has always been core to the 10-year-old portal, along with material aggregated from around the internet. Expanding the reach of its user-generated content, Yahoo recently bought Flickr, a photo-sharing site, and last week acquired Upcoming.org, a social events calendar relying on contributions from users.The internet company is now producing more of its own content.In the past month it has launched a series of online columns from financial commentators and begun a one-man news site, called Kevin Sites in the Hot Zone, that combines video news, photos and blogging to report from trouble spots around the world.In another incursion into old media territory, the portal has tried out distributing shows originally made for television, including taking over a music show, called Pepsi Smash, that was dropped from the air after failing to attract a big enough audience.Ventures such as these add to a giant experiment in the potential of the interactive medium, according to Mr Semel. “I don’t want to wait 10 years while others experiment with what is the way,” he said.
851;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-10-14T11:44:50Z;The week in technology: The video iPod;;Apple’s latest product announcement was preceded by the usual amount of excitement - at last, the long-rumoured video iPod was to be launched. Apple and Walt Disney plan to sell episodes of Desperate Housewives and other television shows over an iPod device capable of playing video, the companies announced on Wednesday at an unveiling of the video iPod in Silicon Valley.At last count Google News was listing an incredible 1,355 items on the topic, a number no doubt sickening for the likes of rivals Sony and Microsoft.Fears over piracy and copyright control meant the move was seen as something of a risk for Robert Iger, who has been in the chief’s seat at Disney for barely three weeks.There were also fears for Apple – namely, that taking on video may be ‘one thing too many’ for the company. Some analysts pointed out that Microsoft had tried and failed to light up the mobile video market, some pointed to the popularity of Sony’s video-capable PSP, but others thought Apple’s ‘fascination’ value would be enough to help kickstart demand.In all the excitement it was easy to forget that due to copyright wrangling, consumers outside of the US won’t be able to download the TV programmes for some time.In more iPod-related news, Apple is pushing for a much bigger percentage of sales from iPod accessories, according to Engadget. “Who was calling who greedy now?” asked Techdirt, reminding readers of Apple chief executive Steve Jobs’ recent accusation that record companies of greed for wanting more royalties for songs sold on iTunes.Google and Comcast eye AOL stakeGoogle and Comcast, the biggest cable operator, are teaming up to bid for a stake in AOL- a move that pits them against the might of Microsoft, which was already in talks with Time Warner about buying a piece of its ailing internet service provider.Collaboration between Google, Comcast and Time Warner could create a headache for the likes of Microsoft and Yahoo - who, incidentally, just announced their instant messaging networks would become interoperable.The motive behind the collaboration depends on who you read - the AP says that, for Google, it’s a combination of portal content and the advertising partnership which accounts for about 10 per cent of Google’s revenues. The Networking Pipeline blog, meanwhile, says it’s about AOL’s instant messenging software, AIM. Google’s new Talk software is very clean, “but it has one serious problem – no one appears to use it,” says Preston Gralla.Either way, we’re bound to hear a lot about synergies in the weeks to come.And in the meantime, avid Google-watchers can amuse themselves with the SF Weekly’s ‘Is Google Good?’ survey.Samsung pleads guilty to price-fixingSamsung, the Korean electronics company, pleaded guilty to price-fixing for its computer chips- the third company to do so under investigation from the US Justice Department.Intel launches dual-core XeonIntel began shipping its first dual-core Xeon processors and only a few months after arch-rival AMD. Intel however said its processors were twice as fast.
852;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-10-13T21:00:35Z;Time Warner chief rebuffs Icahn’s plan;;Dick Parsons, Time Warner chairman and chief executive, on Thursday rebuffed a call by Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist shareholder, for a demerger of the US media group's cable business, saying such a move would do little to lift its share price.Speaking in Hong Kong in his first public appearance since Mr Icahn who with three hedge funds owns a 2.8 per cent stake wrote to shareholders attacking the company's strategy, Mr Parsons said he agreed with the billionaire about the share price being undervalued.But he said a complete sell-off of the cable business, rather than the listing of a minority stake as planned, would not push up the share price.“If you cut an apple in half, you get half an apple,” he said. “[If the business were demerged] I would bet that in three or four years from now people would be struggling to get [the two businesses] back together.”However, Mr Parsons hinted that Time Warner, whose companies include CNN, Warner Bros and Time magazine, could increase the size of a share buy-back from the planned $5bn. Mr Icahn has urged the company to return $20bn to shareholders.Mr Parsons said reports of Google and cable group Comcast considering a joint bid for a stake in AOL, Time Warner's web portal, were market rumours. But he said the company was talking to Microsoft, believed to be another potential buyer of a stake in AOL, about areas of mutual interest.Mr Parsons said India was a better market for foreign media groups than China because of its more stable rule of law and lower levels of censorship.The comments echo recent remarks by Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, and highlight growing dissatisfaction among overseas media groups at the slow pace at which China's domestic markets are opening.He said China was “a very tough market for a media and entertainment company …because of some fundamental things, [such as] rule of law. It's hard to make long-term investments, long-term deals if you don't exactly know what the playing field is going to look like,” he said. By contrast, he said India had a stronger rule of law and was working hard to build the infrastructure needed to distribute media content.

Import prices already had risen 1.2 per cent in August and are now 10 per cent higher than a year ago.This added to jitters ahead of Friday’s release of September consumer inflation data. “This gives us concern that the overall CPI [consumer price index] is going to see a bigger pop,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.However, the previously bearish Mr Pado argued that Wall Street was now approaching an “extremely oversold” level with much of the bad news now discounted, and it could be in for a technical bounce, potentially followed by a seasonal November rally.With oil prices falling, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered to close just 0.32 of a point lower at 10,216.59, with the S&P 500 off 0.84 of a point, or 0.1 per cent, at 1,176.84.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 9.75 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,047.22, aided by Apple Computer jumping 9.1 per cent to $53.74, reversing two days of selling.McDonald’s, the fast food chain, rose 1.2 per cent to $32.05. It said sales at outlets open for at least a year were 3.9 per cent higher in September than in the same month last year.Johnson & Johnson, another Dow component, rose 3.6 per cent to $64.02 amid reports that it had filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Amgen, accusing the latter of illegally bundling products to force cancer clinics to use Amgen’s Aranesp drug rather than J&J’s treatment. Amgen reversed earlier weakness to close 1.4 per cent firmer at $75.82.Nabi Biopharmaceuticals rose 4 per cent to $11.81 on good results from a consistency study for its staphylococcus vaccine.But trading in scandal-hit derivatives broker Refco was halted after it plunged a further 27.2 per cent to $7.90, and shares in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell 2.7 per cent to $310.40 as the CME placed restrictions on Refco’s broker dealer.Google, the search engine, fell 1.2 per cent to $297.44 and cable company Comcast lost 2.6 per cent at $27.20 on reports that the pair were in discussions to buy a stake in Time Warner’s America Online business for $5bn. Time Warner firmed 0.6 per cent to $17.59 on the news.Houston oil company Bois d’Arc Energy rose 5.2 per cent to $14.95 after reporting that three of the four wells it had drilled recently in the Gulf of Mexico have been successful.Central Coast Bancorp leapt 25.1 per cent to $24.30 as Rabobank, the Dutch financial services group, said it was buying its California-based peer for $371m in cash, or $25 a share.Bell Microproducts plummeted 24.9 per cent to $7.36 as it forecast third quarter earnings of 7-9 cents a share, well below market forecasts of 16 cents.
854;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-10-13T19:12:25Z;Lex: AOL;;"Dick Parsons might yet wrong-foot his hedge fund opponents. Time Warner's chief executive has diverted attention from their campaign to demerge cable and force a huge buyback by claiming rightly that AOL is the big swing factor in the group's valuation. Now he hopes to retain momentum with a deal.AOL is challenged. Cash flows come largely from the dying dial-up business. The portal, meanwhile, has struggled to maximise advertising from its heavy traffic. A turnround would take time and might fail. Hence attempts to accelerate the process, and put a value on AOL, by bringing in partners.Agreeing on a manageable shareholder structure could prove tricky. But every big internet company must be interested given the scale of AOL's portal. Microsoft arguably needs a deal most. It would be a strong technology partner but, like AOL, has lagged in monetising online traffic. Google is stronger on both counts. Like Microsoft's MSN, it would also benefit from better access to media content. Comcast is another contender. The cable operator would help drive broadband users to the AOL portal.That leaves the troublesome dial-up business. It could be sold. Alternatively Time Warner could milk it. A portal deal with Comcast might even facilitate an agreement to migrate AOL narrowband customers to Comcast broadband. Time Warner did a disastrous deal with AOL in 2000. Mr Parsons finally has a chance to turn the tables playing internet suitors off against each other to drive a hard bargain of his own.- Click here to add your comments

855;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Comcast and Google in talks on AOL stake;;Google, the internet search company, and Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, have teamed up for negotiations to take a joint minority stake in Time Warner’s AOL internet portal unit.The approach by Google and Comcast pits them against Microsoft, which for several weeks has been in talks with Time Warner over a similar deal, and indicates that Time Warner is serious about selling a stake in AOL.People familiar with the discussions said discussions talks between Google, Comcast and Time Warner only started last week and were at an early stage. It was also not yet clear whether any deal would be focused on wider distribution of search and other communications or whether it would also offer Google access to AOL and Time Warner content.Traditional media, telecoms and internet companies are increasingly vying for consumers’ attention as more media and communications move online and digital distribution increases.A partnership between Google, Comcast and Time Warner would increase competition for Microsoft and Yahoo, which this week linked up their instant messaging services, as well as telecoms groups such as Verizon and SBC.Google has been considering an AOL stake for some time but only recently approached Comcast about mounting a joint bid due to the cable operator’s wide distribution, people familiar with the matter said.The discussions in effect mean Time Warner has launched a fully fledged auction for the AOL stake. That could spark interest from other groups such as Yahoo.Mr Parsons took over three years ago to clean up the mess resulting from the takeover of the Time Warner media group by AOL, then mainly an internet dial-up business. The merger resulted in write-offs of over $87bn and Time Warner has only just resolved many legal and other issues resulting from the merger.Media companies in general, and Time Warner in particular, are trying to find ways to generate more value from their internet strategies and properties. Investors are valuing media company shares at much lower levels than those of internet companies such as Google and Yahoo because of concerns that growing use of the internet will result in lost revenues and growth.Mr Parsons is increasingly stressing that AOL is, in fact, two businesses.

857;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-10-12T23:51:00Z;Lex: AOL;;Dick Parsons might yet wrong-foot his hedge-fund opponents. Time Warner’s chief executive has diverted attention from their campaign to demerge cable and force a huge buyback by claiming, rightly, that AOL is the big swing factor in the group’s valuation. Now he hopes to retain momentum with a deal.AOL is challenged. Cash flows come largely from the dying dial-up business. The portal, meanwhile, has struggled to maximise advertising from its heavy traffic. A turnround would take time and might fail. Hence attempts to accelerate the process, and put a value on AOL, by bringing in partners.Agreeing on a manageable shareholder structure could prove tricky. But every big internet company must be interested, given the scale of AOL’s portal. Microsoft arguably needs a deal most. It would be a strong technology partner but, like AOL, has lagged in monetising online traffic. Google is stronger on both counts. Like Microsoft’s MSN, it would also benefit from better access to media content. Comcast is another contender. The cable operator would help drive broadband users to the AOL portal and could take advantage of content opportunities.That leaves the troublesome dial-up business. It could be sold. Alternatively Time Warner could milk it. A portal deal with Comcast might even facilitate an agreement to migrate AOL narrowband customers to Comcast broadband.Time Warner did a disastrous deal with AOL in 2000. Mr Parsons finally has a chance to turn the tables - playing internet suitors off against each other to drive a hard bargain of his own.
858;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-09-22T04:00:27Z;Vonage weighs up possible sale;;Vonage, the private internet telephony start-up, is being encouraged to consider a sale while it presses ahead with plans for an initial public offering.UBS and Deutsche Bank, the investment banks chosen by Vonage to underwrite its stock market listing, have been suggesting that the company pursue a “parallel process”, according to people familiar with the matter.This would involve seeking out, or responding to, expressions of interest in the company from potential buyers while at the same time moving forward with plans to raise up to $600m in an IPO.Last week Skype, which also offers Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, technology, agreed to a takeover by Ebay, the online auction site, for $2.6bn - a price widely viewed as high.That deal has lead to suggestions that Vonage could also fetch a generous valuation in a sale. Analysts have estimated that Vonage, based in New Jersey, is worth between $1bn and $1.5bn.It was unclear on Wednesday night how open Jeffrey Citron, Vonage’s chief executive, was to selling the company, which is 2½ years old and recently signed up its millionth paying customer. Mr Citron could not be reached for comment.Vonage might be attractive to a host of companies in the telecommunications, media and technology industries. According to Wall Street bankers, cable groups such as Time Warner and Comcast, as well as traditional telephone carriers such as Verizon might consider acquiring it.The pressure on Vonage and other independent VoIP companies such as Packet8 to consider trade sales comes amid a spate of announcements and deals in the fast-evolving broadband internet telephony market. Yahoo, Google and Microsoft have all made VoIP service announcements in the past few months.This week, America Online and Earthlink have announced plans to offer VoIP services. Qwest Communications, the fourth largest US regional telecommunications group, and Microsoft announced plans to start marketing a VoIP service targeting small companies on Monday.Established US cable companies have begun to aggressively market their own broadband telephony, raising the profile of VoIP and effectively endorsing the technology that underlies it.Early VoIP services were faulted for their often poor quality and unreliability but rapid technological advances and other changes have transformed VoIP into a service ready for the mainstream.Vonage has pioneered so-called second-generation VoIP services, which allow users to make calls over the internet using a standard telephone plugged into a broadband adapter.This success, coupled with the Skype sale, has attracted the attention of established communications companies, many of which have been holding back on VoIP services because of concerns about cannibalising their traditional circuit-switched voice revenues.UBS and Deutsche declined to comment.
859;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-09-21T19:53:12Z;Observer - US;;"Dick Parsons is not one to bear grudges. Despite inheriting a
company trapped in a “thick fog” where a wrong move could have “upset the entire apple cart”, he still thinks Jerry Levin had good advice
to offer.Although the Time Warner chief says he has been strictly forbidden by his advisers to even mention Levin – whose decision to sell Time Warner to AOL is often regarded as the worst corporate move ever – Parsons did it anyway yesterday. Levin, who now manages a spiritual retreat in California, was a very smart guy when it came to the cable business, Parsons said, adding that he still adhered to his vision.“Content may be king but distribution is the power to the throne,” Levin used to say. (It was
his riposte to Sumner Redstone’s “content is king”, the ruling principle at Viacom).Jerry’s maxim may be behind Parsons’ rejection of the strategy espoused by Carl Icahn, the would-be activist Time Warner shareholder, who is agitating for the company to spin off its cable business.But as he adheres to old advice from Jerry, he is watching out for
two other men he refers to by their first names.“If Rupert captured all of satellite, and Brian captured all of cable, I would not be a happy man – even though they are both my friends,”
he said. He was referring, of course, to Rupert Murdoch of News Corp and Brian Roberts of Comcast.Jerry must be proud to know that someone remembers him for something besides the AOL deal.Buy-outs may be booming, but the world is still a very dangerous place – at least in the eyes of private equity dealmakers.The point was driven home yesterday by William Cohen,
Bill Clinton’s defence secretary, who was the keynote speaker at the annual Private Equity Analyst Conference, the industry’s most important event.Amid his discussion of terrorism, global security, trade and disaster response – including Katrina – Cohen tried to test the mood of the audience with a few questions.Did they feel that the world had turned out more like the triumph of democratic capitalism described by Francis Fukuyama, or Samuel Huntington’s clash of civilisations?No hands went up for Fukuyama, while a few were raised for Huntington.And was the audience for or against the introduction of national identity cards in the US? Bring them on was the response.Cohen himself would not take a position on whether he was as pessimistic as his friends in private equity.There were good and bad arguments for ID cards, he said, before noting that both Fukuyama and Huntington had been proved correct since the collapse of the Berlin Wall.Cohen’s warm-up act was Wilbur Ross, the renowned turnround artist, who was more blunt with his opinions.Ross, who has captured Wall Street’s attention once again by declaring his interest in sinking billions into the troubled US auto parts business, took a few swipes at politicians for failing to protect America’s industrial heartland.“Instead of doing all that China- bashing, Congress ought to try to do something to create a level playing field for US manufacturers,” he said.Changing the tax code and the healthcare system, two big burdens on US corporate balance sheets, would be a good start.And for those curious about Ross’s next move, he revealed his latest “infatuation”: investing in Vietnam.Sometimes life imitates art. And sometimes people just wish it did.The latter will be the case this evening when the White House Project – a non-profit group devoted to seeing a woman elected president – hosts a screening of Commander in Chief, the new ABC drama starring Geena Davis as the first woman president.Marie Wilson, president of the project, takes encouragement from recent polls showing what she calls “increasing comfort with a female commander in chief”. Those attending the Washington screening, just a few blocks from the White House, will also hear thoughts from power-women such as Eleanor Clift, a Newsweek contributor, and Helen Thomas, the feisty columnist and presidential interrogator. Is Geena Davis ready
for that?Bill Ford was seeking to regain the high ground on environmental issues yesterday by announcing a sharp increase in Ford’s output of hybrid vehicles and a scheme to offset emissions in some plants with investment in pro-environment projects.Henry Ford’s great-grandson gained a reputation early in his career as one of the US’s most environmentally aware business leaders. “When I joined Ford Motor Company, I struggled to reconcile my environmental ethic with working for an industrial company,” he once said. In 1999, he pulled the carmaker out of a now-defunct industry coalition that sought to block action against global warming. But Ford has blotted his copybook with activists in recent years. His company backed away from a promise to improve the fuel efficiency of gas-guzzling SUVs. It also scrapped plans to build electric cars after discovering they were likely to be unreliable, and thus do its image more harm than good.And Wednesday’s announcements are unlikely to mean any less support for Ford’s SUV behemoths. Bill Ford has contended that if his company didn’t make vehicles such as the Excursion, someone else would."
860;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-09-20T15:42:06Z;Cable channel puts viewers in the picture;;When the management team behind Current TV was dreaming up a name for their cable television channel, “Open Source TV” was a strong contender. The channel, launched on August 1, seeks content submissions from its target audience of 18- to 34-year-olds, thus drawing on the basic principles behind open source technologies: customised content and consumer participation.“We see Current TV as a unique application of open source principles to the creation of television content,” says Joel Hyatt, Current’s chief executive.Current reaches 20m households in the US via cable companies DirecTV, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast. About one-quarter of content is viewer-created, with the rest generated in-house or solicited from industry professionals.Viewers with no broadcasting experience can upload self-produced video segments of up to five minutes in length to “Current Studio,” part of Current’s website dedicated to viewer-created content.Pieces are broadcast online repeatedly, like an iPod Shuffle play list. Fellow viewers are then invited to watch and vote for segments they would like to see televised. The higher a story is ranked, the more times it is aired online. The best segments are selected for TV broadcast. Recent pieces included a feature about greyhound racing in London and coverage of Hurricane Katrina.Fees for televised segments range from $250 to $1,000 based on the number of pieces aired. n addition to uploading and viewing content, users can also learn video production techniques, exchange ideas and post comments online.“I love the idea that I can walk out the door with my camera, shoot a story, submit it to Current and see it aired within a week,” says contributor Yasmin Vossoughian. Current has broadcast her story about teenage sexuality in Iran and has commissioned another segment.Despite initial positive reviews in the media, Current still faces challenges. Some contributors, for example, have criticised a policy that forces filmmakers to grant the network exclusive rights to their material for three months from the upload date.With other grassroots media organisations, such as Ourmedia.org and Nowpublic.com, transmitting user-created content on the web, some think Current’s approach – seeking content online and showing it on TV – is obsolete.But with broadband penetration standing at just 30 to 40 per cent in the US, Mr Hyatt sees the internet as a production rather than distribution medium.The business model is also an issue. Current generates revenue from cable licensing fees and advertising, but according to Susan Mernit, a partner at the US digital media consultancy 5ive, the network will need to more than double its subscriber base to break even.Still, Ms Mernit is positive about “open source” broadcasting, because of increased interest in blogging, the popularity of Reality TV, and the growing affordability of video cameras and editing software.
861;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Chief set to retire from Pace Micro;;John Dyson on Tuesday announced plans to retire as chief executive of Pace Micro Technology, sending shares in the UK television set-top box manufacturer down more than 12 per cent.The fall in the share price was compounded by a warning from Pace that delays in product development might mean bigger losses in the first half of the financial year than previously expected.Pace won two big contracts in the US earlier this year, with Comcast, the world’s largest cable operator, and DirecTV, the largest satellite TV provider in the US. The two contracts are expected to boost revenues significantly once shipments begin.However, Pace has repeatedly warned that the development timetable is challenging and delays could occur. The company had been hoping to get the first products to Comcast and DirecTV before Christmas.Mr Dyson said the delays were still “manageable” and had not had an impacton expectations for the financial year. The company is expecting to make up the first-half losses in the second half of the year as products begin to ship in volume.Mr Dyson, 57, said that despite the challenges, it was a good time for him to hand over the CEO role to a successor.“There is never a brilliant time to leave, but the company has now got very good potential to be successful over the next four or five years, whereas the last three years have been very tough.”He added: “Its not a bad thing for Pace to get a younger person in as CEO of the set-top box operations, which is a jolly tough business.Mr Dyson, who has been with the company nearly eight years, three of them as CEO, will continue in his present role until a replacement is found. He will then become part-time executive chairman of new ventures for the company.
862;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

864;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Comcast to expand sports programming;;Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, is expanding its sports programming and has bought the rights to air National Hockey League (NHL) games on its Outdoor Life channel.The rights had previously belonged to ESPN, the Disney-owned sports channel, which decided not to exercise its right to match the Comcast bid. Although terms were not officially released, the rights are believed to have been bought for just over $200m over a three-year period.The deal is Comcast's first purchase of national rights of one of the US's big team sports. Its interest in hockey, a game that is returning in September after a labour dispute forced the cancellation of the 2004-05 season, has led to speculation that Comcast wants to re-invent its Outdoor Life channel to compete head-on with ESPN.On Thursday, Steve Burke, chief operating officer at the cable group, said Comcast had been expanding its sports presence for over a decade. Comcast own the Golf Channel, as well as a number of regional sports channels. “There is room for lots of different voices,” he said.He said recently that it would be impossible to create a sports cable channel to challenge ESPN “even if we wanted to”.However, there is a growing realisation that the male sports fan is attractive from an advertising standpoint, both on television and on the internet. ESPN, for example, says 95 per cent of its ESPN.com users are male, with a median age of 30 and median annual income of $77,000.Gavin Harvey, president of Outdoor Life, said the network had been working on becoming more attractive for “men into competition of all types”. Recent other events include the Tour de France and the Boston Marathon. “At NHL the level of competition is as good as it gets,” he said.As well as airing games on the cable channels, Comcast will use NHL games on its other platforms, such as high-definition television, its websites by offering streamed content and its growing video-on-demand platform.
865;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-08-11T18:24:49Z;Famed ‘raider’ rouses Time Warner;;Carl Icahn has managed to achieve in a few days what had eluded Dick Parsons in the previous six months: a rise in Time Warner's share price. Mr Icahn, the famed corporate raider, is building up his tiny stake in the world's biggest media company and talking to other investors to agitate for change.Reports of his move gave Time Warner's share price a rare fillip this week, in spite of the obstacles to gaining a significant foothold in a company with an $85bn market capitalisation when Mr Icahn's reported stake is worth one tenth of a per cent of that.Mr Parsons, Time Warner's chairman and chief executive, is credited with having steadied a ship which nearly sank following the ill-fated merger of AOL and Time Warner at the height of the internet bubble.Whether he will have to take notice of anything Mr Icahn has to say remains to be seen. Unless the corporate raider can prove he has the backing of a significant pool of investors, any calls for spin-offs, sales or share buybacks will carry no more weight than the wishes of other investors.However, the fact that hedge funds and activists have their sights on Time Warner is a potent symbol of the pressures facing media companies. “We sense significant shareholder frustration regarding the lacklustre performance of Time Warner shares, a frustration that holds for much of the sector,” said Jessica Reif Cohen, analyst at Merrill Lynch, in a note to investors this week.The revival in the shares of fast-growing internet companies has put the spotlight on the slow growth of traditional media companies. “To a large extent, what this reflects is the transition of many of the major media companies into slower growth businesses, where a great deal more management focus is going to be required to improve their performance,” said Michael Wolf, managing director of the media practice at McKinsey.The media industry spanning television, film, publishing and music is worth more than $500bn per year in the US alone but is expected by PwC to produce annual growth of about five per cent over the next five years. At the same time, there are concerns that the increased use of high-speed internet connections will encourage illegal downloading of video content, eating away at business models, much as it has in the music industry.Even without external agitators, many media companies have begun to tackle the torpor in their shares. Most have started or are planning share buybacks. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has been asked by investors to borrow more and give more money to shareholders. Companies such as Viacom and IAC are spinning off businesses or planning to do so. The idea behind such moves is to focus businesses into those with and without high growth potential, assigning them different levels of debt so they can quickly respond to the demands of rapid technological change. Some groups, such as News Corp and NBC Universal, owned by General Electric, have shown no intention of splitting up but are instead doubling efforts to generate more digital and internet income.So far, few assets have been sold. And yet, private equity investors have billions of dollars to invest in assets offering predictable cashflows and the opportunity to shake out excess costs. “In 12 to 18 months time, some big parts of the US media business will be owned by private equity investors,” said one mergers and acquisitions adviser.“Already, calls have been made, making offers for nearly every business around. A year ago, they would have had the phone slammed down on them. Now, the offers are being noted.” There are precedents, such as the purchase of the MGM film library by cable operator Comcast and private equity investors, and the private equity buy-out of Warner Music from Time Warner, but pressure on larger companies to return value to shareholders is likely to lead to many more.As Sumner Redstone, chairman and chief executive of Viacom, put it last week: “You don't have to be a visionary to see that the media industry has changed dramatically over the last few years.”In response to rapid technological change, which is altering the way people access media, he argues that big media companies need to shrink. Unfortunately for Mr Redstone and his fellow media moguls, it is easier to diagnose the illness than to prescribe a cure. But Mr Icahn and other investors will be increasingly vocal in suggesting the remedies.
866;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-08-09T20:14:43Z;EchoStar makes premium profit;;EchoStar, the second largest US satellite operator, on Tuesday offered further evidence that American subscribers to multi-channel television are willing to pay a premium for the services they want.The group, run by Charles Ergen, reported slower growth in new subscribers during the second quarter but made more money from existing customers.The results paint a similar picture to those released by satellite rival DirecTV last week and indicate “the satellite and cable sectors have been in the grip of fears that price competition would eventually erode profitability”, according to Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.“Yet, quarter after quarter, we see results that suggest that is not the case and that pricing continues to increase solidly.”DirecTV last week posted its first profit in two years as customers paid more each month for added features. Subscriber additions dropped 45 per cent at DirecTV as the company cut off customers who could not pay.For satellite companies, slower growth in new subscribers also contributes to higher profits because it reduces the expense of acquiring new subscribers.On Tuesday Cablevision, the cable and entertainment company that the founding Dolan family wants to take private, turned last year's second-quarter loss into a $222m profit, boosted by a gain from reorganising its sports business and sales of telephone and internet services.Results last week from the biggest cable operators, Comcast and Time Warner, also showed robust demand and pricing in video, high-speed internet access and digital telephony services despite aggressive price competition in the high-speed internet access market from telecommunications companies.Satellite, cable and telecoms groups are increasingly battling for the same customers as they start to offer overlapping services. One incentive is to offer bundled services in an effort to maintain loyalty.Satellite and cable groups are improving the quality and range of their programming, a service the telecoms groups plan to offer in the coming years.“Cablevision reported perhaps the strongest results among [cable operators], demonstrating the continued success of the bundle,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.Nevertheless, shares across the sector have failed to pick up because of continued investor fears that a price war will, at some point, affect returns.For EchoStar, average revenue per user was $58.46, up five per cent from 2004. EchoStar's 225,000 net subscriber additions were 33 per cent lower than a year ago. Its net income in the second quarter was $855.5m, including a $593m tax benefit, up from $85.3m a year earlier.
867;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-08-03T17:22:18Z;VoIP set to drive earnings at cable networks;;Second-quarter results from US cable TV network operators highlight a surge in internet telephony, which looks set to become a big source of new revenue for cable operators and a larger than expected threat to traditional phone companies.Although Time Warner's second-quarter results on Wednesday were overshadowed by a $3bn charge related to the media group's 2001 purchase of America Online, it was the 242,000 new internet telephony subscribers Time Warner that caught analysts' attention.“VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) adds were very impressive, well above our estimate of 180,000 and 60 per cent over the first quarter rate of additions in the seasonally weakest quarter,” said Douglas Shapiro of Bank of America Securities.Other analysts said the Time Warner figures suggested Comcast, the largest US cable operator, may have been overly cautious in estimating it would add 250,000 broadband VoIP subscribers in the fourth quarter and 1m next year.“Even in the context of Comcast's ‘slow start' roll-out of VoIP, relative to Time Warner's results, Comcast's 2005 and 2006 guidance still looks conservative,” said Craig Moffett of Sanford Berstein. He believes Comcast could garner up to 1.69m VoIP customers next year.Both Comcast and Time Warner have lagged behind Cablevision Systems in deploying internet telephony, but say they are ready to begin marketing the service aggressively.Indeed, figures from both Cablevision and Time Warner suggest that VoIP could help provide the next spur to cable broadband internet access uptake.This could be bad news both for independent VoIP providers not allied with a strong cable franchise, and incumbent local telephone operators that have not put much marketing muscle behind their VoIP offerings.Verizon, the biggest US telecoms group, reported a larger than expected decline in local access lines in the second quarter, saying it lost 518,000 consumer telephone lines, in part because of increasing competition from cable companies.
868;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-08-02T20:25:36Z;Wall Street posts gains as oil eases;;Wall Street moved higher on Tuesday as oil prices eased from Monday’s highs and traders digested a string of corporate news, including US July sales from the big three carmakers.By market close, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent higher at 1,244.08 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 10,683.74. The Nasdaq Composite gained over 1.0 per cent, closing at 2,218.15 and touching levels it has not seen in almost four years.Despite the days gains, some analysts warn not to get too excited through what is normally a quiet month of trading.“We hate to rain on anyone’s parade, but according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac, August and September have been the two worst performing months [in the year] over the past 54 years,” said David Rosenberg, senior US economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.Equities were helped by a government report showing that personal spending jumped 0.8 per cent in June, following no change in May.The Commerce Department said income rose 0.5 per cent after a 0.2 per cent increase the previous month.The auto sector was active as three US manufacturers released figures showing an improvement in sales following generous discount schemes over the past few months. “People are looking at the inventories numbers, which are coming down and giving these companies a little more flexibility and control going forward,” said Chip Dixon, US equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in New York.Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler, were mixed at the close. The latter led the way with a rise of 2.8 per cent to $50.75. Ford was up 0.3 per cent to $10.88 while GM lost 0.9 per cent falling to $36.53.Tuesday also saw the end of the CNOOC saga, as the Chinese oil company dropped its $18.5bn offer for Unocal, thereby ending its takeover battle with Chevron, which was up 1.9 per cent at $59.56. Unocal was up 0.3 per cent at $64.53.Falling sharply was Tyco International, which dropped 9.6 per cent to $27.86. The diversified group reported quarterly earnings just above analysts’ expectations, but lowered its outlook for the full year, with rising steel prices set to erode profits at its industrial businesses.US cable heavyweight Comcast said profits soared 62 per cent despite decreasing cable and internet subscriber figures. The stock was up 1.3 per cent to $31.00.The market will also be waiting for other media companies, including Time Warner and Viacom, to report earnings later in the week. The media sector, whose stocks have recently been under pressure, rose 0.8 per cent during the session.Adobe Systems disappointed investors after the software company gave a third-quarter revenue outlook below analyst’s expectations. Its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $28.62Transocean, the world’s largest offshore oil and natural-gas driller, gained 3.0 per cent to $59.65 after its second-quarter profits beat expectations.
869;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-08-02T18:34:31Z;Digital video lifts Comcast profit;;Strong demand for digital video products - including video-on-demand, high-definition TV services and digital video recorders - boosted second-quarter profits at Comcast by 64 per cent.The leading US cable TV network operator added 284,000 net new digital video subscribers in the seasonally weak second quarter, well ahead of Wall Street estimates, and ended the quarter with 21.4m basic video subscribers.The increase was driven by customers adding digital video recorders which allow them to “time shift” programming and high-definition TV services suitable for viewing on large flat-screen TVs.Comcast also announced it was ready to push ahead with an aggressive deployment of its broadband internet telephony service and was “on track” to sign up 250,000 customers by the year-end and 1m in 2006.“We believe Comcast Digital Voice will be the next engine for growth and are ramping up the roll-out of this service in markets like Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Boston, Hartford, Chicago and Portland,” said Brian Roberts, chief executive. “We are on track to extend our offering to 15m homes in 20 markets by year-end and expect to offer our fully featured digital voice service across our 41m homes by the end of 2006.”In a conference call with analysts, Mr Roberts said Comcast was examining the options for offering wireless phone services, perhaps by becoming a mobile virtual network operator re-selling wireless service. However, he emphasised that Comcast did not believe it had suffered by not being in the wireless business so far.Net profit rose from $262m, or 12 cents a share, to $430m, or 19 cents. Revenue rose 10.5 per cent to $5.6bn. Cable profit margins rose from 39.7 to 40.8 per cent, with operating cashflow growing by 13.2 per cent.John Alchin, chief financial officer, said he expected margins to remain above 40 per cent.The profit increase came in spite of a slowdown in high-speed internet subscriber growth reflecting the growing competition and discount pricing adopted by the leading telecoms groups for their broadband DSL services.Comcast added a net 297,000 new high-speed subscribers in the quarter, down from 327,000 a year earlier. In spite of the slowdown, Comcast said it planned to continue to compete on quality of service and speed rather than price, and that it saw internet telephony as the next “after-burner” for high-speed data.
870;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-07-29T04:05:13Z;GE set to decide on DreamWorks;;General Electric's board of directors is expected to meet as early as on Friday to decide whether its NBC Universal entertainment division will begin exclusive negotiations to buy DreamWorks SKG, the live-action entertainment company.The deal, which would not include the publicly-traded DreamWorks Animation that was spun off last year, could be valued at as much as $1bn, according to people familiar with the discussions. Both Universal and DreamWorks declined to comment.The talks signal an end to DreamWorks' ambitions of becoming a major Hollywood player little more than a decade after its celebrated founding by director Steven Spielberg, former Walt Disney executive, Jeffrey Katzenberg and music mogul David Geffen.Although the studio created some hits, such as Gladiator and American Beauty, it lacked the deep pockets of rival studios such as Time Warner's Warner Brothers, or News Corp's 20th Century Fox, to cushion the uncertainty of the film business.“When you're too small, you can live and die by any one film,” one media investor said. He cited Shrek 2, which has performed below expectations in the DVD market, triggering a sharp fall in shares of DreamWorks Animation.Another stand-alone film group, MGM, was sold last year for $5bn to a consortium including Sony, Comcast, and a group of private equity investors, who were primarily interested in the steady and predictable revenues generated by its library of 4,000 films.DreamWorks' library is much smaller - about 60 titles - but still a sought-after asset in Hollywood. An acquisition would also allow Universal to take over DreamWorks' role as distributor of DreamWorks Animation films, such as the forthcoming Shrek 3.Further, it could help to cement Universal's relationship with Mr Spielberg, who began his directorial career there 30 years ago. The negotiations have heated up at a time of turmoil for DreamWorks. The publicly-traded animation company was forced to issue a profits warning following the Shrek 2 disappointment, and was also informed by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was examining trading in the company's shares around that event.Universal is considered a top contender for DreamWorks, long rumoured to be for sale, because of the companies' close relationship. DreamWorks' offices are based on the Universal lot, and Universal handles its DVD and international theatrical distribution.However, some bankers on Thursday speculated that other bidders could step forward. One might be a cable operator, which could use the film library as a way to beef up its video-on-demand offerings and lure new subscribers.
871;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;The appeal of a voice from home;;Programme makers from around the world are hitting the jackpot in the US. Owners of television content across Latin America, Asia and Eeastern Europe are finding a fast-growing market for non-English language content in the US.appetite for their fare from American cable and satellite television companies are scrambling to meet demand from “The reason is the strong growth in “international” communities in the US – – mainly recent immigrants groups from these regions who continue to speak their native own language. and are keen for reminders of home. An increasingly popular way of getting this is from multi-channel television, and in the In the last past year, the number of television channels targeted at distinct specific groups has soared.“The growth is a reflection of demographic trends,” says id David Jensen, vice-president of international programming at Comcast Corp, the biggest cable company in the US, which now offers 90 ethnic, non-English speaking channels.“These sectors are growing much faster than others in all parts of the media, but especially television.” He addeds that most of this television was content made in other countries and retransmitted or broadcast simultaneously in the US.The biggest and fastest-growing group audience is the US Hispanic population, which currently stands at is more than 40m strong. and whichis . Oneestimates, from the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, projects that the Hispanic population will grow by 19 per cent over the next five years. to comprise 16 percent of the US population in 2009. There is also strong growth in Asian communities. DirecTV, the satellite operator controlled by Rupert Murdoch’s News CorpCorporation, said in a recent presentation that the number of Asian-Americans would rise from grow from14m last year to over more than 22m by 2025.But television companies are also interested in Asian Americans’ the fact thatAs well as growing in number, rising purchasing power. , which is expected into increase. across these communities. Already, Asian groupsthey are wealthier and better educated than average Americans, making them an attractive target market for to subscription ­television and for advertisers.Reflecting this, DirecTV last week announced a deal with ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, the largest Philipino Filipino entertainment and broadcast company, to take over their 80,000 US subscribers and offer a six-channel package to the PhilipinoFilipino-American market. The deal, which had been worked on for over a year, follows recently expanded content in Hindi, Tamil, ­Telugu, Gujarati, Bengali, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Vietnamese.“International programming is an important part of our overall strategy,” saidys Chase Carey, president and chief executive officer of DirecTV. “It is an increasingly competitive marketplace and it is about getting sharper about identifying opportunities. This means the programming has to be very targeted.”There are There are certain differences between the international and the more traditional viewers. For one, theyThe former tend to be younger. For the Hispanic community, viewers, for example, DirecTV estimates they have an average age of 26.6 years, DirecTV estimates, versus compared with and average of 39 for non-Hispanics. In addition, the households are larger, with four people versus 2.5 compared with 2.5 for non-Hispanic. DirecTV says this means their programming is “multi-generational”.Satellite and cable suppliers are competing keenlykeenlyfighting for international viewers. Satellite providers argue that their ability to sell subscriptions across the entire US, argue that their ability to do this gives them the edge. Cable companies retort that their on-demand programming will prove decisive., which serve specific geographic areas, only offer what is needed by the communities in those areas.However, the competition between cable and satellite providers for customers is much like it is overall. Comcast, for example, is aiming to offer more and more services which are technically difficult for satellite to provide, such as extensive on-demand programming. This has also been extended to their international programming.One issue potentially troubling question for the competing all television companies the future is how long these ethnic minority groups will want to continue receiving information and entertainment in the language of their original countries.Already, immigrant communities who have been in the US for longer are not as interested in programmes from “back home”. For example, In one survey, 94 per cent of Vietnamese said they preferred programming in their own language, versus compared with just over 50 per cent of ­Japanese speakers, a far greater proportion of whom were born in the US. Of those two communities, currently over 90 per cent of Vietnamese in the US are not born there, whereas only 45 per cent of the Japanese-American market is foreign-born.“Once communities are further removed from their original countries, it does not have the same appeal,” saidys Mr Carey.
872;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-07-14T22:03:41Z;Texas lawmakers;;Lawmakers in Texas will consider a bill that would enable SBC Communications and Verizon Communications, the two largest US telecommunications groups, to push ahead with plans to launch consumer video services over new fibre optic networks without the need to seek approval from individual municipal authorities.Rick Perry, Texas governor, on Wednesday authorised the state legislature to consider telecommunications issues in a special session. The session was originally convened to consider school financing issues.SBC and Verizon have been pushing state legislators and members of Congress to eliminate regulations that would force them to get permission from local governments before they can offer cable-TV service.Both companies, which are spending billions of dollars to roll out new fibre optic networks capable of delivering advanced voice, video and data services, have warned that such requirements could delay their entry into the $76.1bn pay-TV market where they will compete against cable-TV providers including Comcast and Time Warner.
873;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-07-11T23:20:36Z;Comcast weighs cellular options;;Comcast has ruled out for the time being buying a mobile telephone operator, saying that although it had considered an acquisition, such a move did not make financial sense.“We don't want to own wireless per se, but we want to make our products available through wireless devices,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast's chairman and chief executive.Steve Burke, president and chief operating officer at Comcast, said he had been considering how best to do this. “There are three ways of getting there: buy a cellular company, do a deal with a cellular company, or start your own network.The most likely option was forming a partnership with a cellular operator. “I don't think we will buy a cellular company. Relative valuations are too high, and I am sceptical that it could make financial sense,” Mr Burke said. Building a network would also be too expensive. “All the signs are that we are gravitating to the middle option,” he said.The comments will damp speculation about Comcast being a potential buyer of T-Mobile USA, owned by Deutsche Telekom.Comcast's shares have fallen because investors are concerned that it might make a bid for T-Mobile USA, according to analysts. The cable operator made an unsuccessful $58bn hostile bid for the Walt Disney company last year, a move that has led to perceptions that Comcast is on the look-out for deals.Comcast is part of a consortium of cable operators holding talks with wireless operators, including Sprint.One reason cable companies are joining forces is that they do not tend to offer cable services in overlapping parts of the US.It could be attractive for a wireless operator to strike a deal with the big cable companies as that would provide access to customers across the US.Among the options Comcast is exploring are cross-marketing partnerships combined with leasing network capacity from a wireless operator and selling Comcast-branded phones and services.In addition to the consortium discussions, Comcast and other cable companies are also holding individual talks. “We just need to figure out the next step,” said Mr Burke.Time Warner, the second-biggest cable operator, has already started trials with Sprint but Comcast has not yet taken that step.Cable companies are increasingly competing with telecommunications groups such as Verizon and SBC for the same customers to sell them video, high-speed internet and telephony services.Adding wireless services to the bundle of products on offer might offer an extra incentive to customers to sign up to a so-called “quadruple play” of products.
874;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-07-11T20:56:44Z;Subscribers switch on to cable and satellite;;The first quarter of 2005 has seen a rapid expansion of the subscriber base for multi-channel television, according to the latest results from satellite and cable companies.In recent years, the growth of satellite operators has often been at the expense of cable subscriber numbers. However, in the most recent quarter, cable subscribers have only fallen by about 21,000 but satellite subscribers have risen by 830,000.According to Sanford Bernstein research, this suggests an annualised subscriber expansion rate of 3.6 per cent the most rapid growth in the past five years.“This is a surprising or even shocking result given the maturity of the market,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.More than 80 per cent of US households subscribe to some form of multi-channel television. The number of household formations is growing at a pace of about 370,000 per quarter. “Faster housing starts and continued brisk home sales bolster the case for faster growth in the first quarter,” Mr Moffett said. He said improved technology to detect or deter illegal usage of satellite or cable services was increasing subscriber numbers.On Thursday, Echostar Communications, the second-biggest satellite operator, announced 325,000 net new subscribers in the first quarter. This followed an announcement this week by DirecTV the biggest satellite company, controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp of 505,000 new customers in its first quarter.Charlie Ergen, chairman and chief executive of EchoStar, said it was particularly important to attract new customers with solid credit histories. “It is easy to get customers if they don't have social security numbers and don't have credit we could get 1m a month. But you have to be very disciplined,” he said, adding that competition was increasing from telephone companies. Cable companies, increasingly offering customers data and telephony services with video subscription, are reporting lower numbers of cancelled subscriptions, considered to be central to increasing profitability.Comcast, the biggest cable operator, was the only one to report a sizeable loss in subscribers, with 26,000 net losses. Analysts said that could partly reflect the fact that Comcast was rolling out its telephony services later than rivals such as Time Warner.Mr Moffett said the rapid subscriber growth raised the question whether the businesses were becoming more cyclical. “This will become clearer if interest rates spike up,” he said.
875;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-07-11T17:59:45Z;Winds of change sweep through a cable giant;;In a flat, carefully enunciated tone, Brian Roberts spoke into the top of the remote control. “Find actor George Clooney,” he said. “Scan movies,” was the next command. It was hard not to be impressed: after each instruction, the enormous flat screen on the wall in the executive conference room switched channels. Mr Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast Corp, the biggest cable operator in the US, was visibly pleased – his first effort at showing off this particular piece of technical wizardry had worked just as it was supposed to.The demonstration of the gadget – a voice-search remote control which is still in development – is a neat symbol of the sweeping changes that have taken place at Comcast. Go back a few years and Comcast was just one of a handful of large cable operators. Then, in 2002, it bought AT&T’s cable business for $72bn and immediately became the biggest cable company in the land, with its subscriber base at 21.5m. This will grow by just under 2m subscribers if, as expected, Comcast’s joint purchase with Time Warner of the bankrupt cable operator, Adelphia, is approved.“We have been focused on re-engineering the company since the (AT&T) transaction closed. Comcast was a fast follower for 30 years and now we are the industry leaders,” says Mr Roberts, the son of Ralph Roberts, who founded Comcast in 1963 with 1,200 subscribers.The post-AT&T strategy was set out in stone in February of last year. That month is remembered for other reasons – at that time Comcast grabbed the headlines with a $58bn hostile takeover attempt of the Walt Disney Company. The bid was eventually withdrawn after discussions with the Disney board never took off and after Comcast’s shares took a beating.Many investors jumped to the conclusion that the move into Disney’s content businesses of films and television was a sign that Mr Roberts was worried about the growth and profitability prospects for cable. The Comcast “pipe” provides video subscriptions to 21.5m homes and high-speed internet access to 7.8m. The company has this year started rolling out digital telephony and it will be available to all the homes it passes by the end of next year.This memory still, over a year later, touches a raw nerve with Mr Roberts. “To buy AT&T we had to dig deep and be persistent. We bet the ranch on our belief in cable. We had to do some hard things, like sell QVC, and we had to execute perfectly. We did all this because we really believed in cable. So of all the reactions, that was the hardest one to understand,” he said.The Disney move was, according to Mr Roberts and his right-hand man, Steve Burke, the former Disney executive who is Comcast’s chief operating officer, a logical step in the cable company’s strategy of developing the best possible products for its customers in every business it was in.In the same month the Disney bid was launched, Mr Roberts and Mr Burke and 300 top Comcast executives met in Arizona to map out the strategy of differentiating products. This was the culmination of years of planning. Indeed, the AT&T purchase was justified on the basis of the operational improvement that Comcast expected to make. But the raison d’être, as Mr Roberts calls it, was the fact that Comcast would become the biggest operator.In the 1990s, amid frenzied consolidation in the telecoms sector, Mr Roberts says he realised scale would be increasingly important for cable too. Until then, cable operators, who tend not to operate in the same towns and cities and thus do not compete directly, had often adopted the best of each other’s innovations rather then attempt to lead the industry themselves. “A lightbulb went on in my head when Verizon was created. I saw what was happening in the phone business and realised scale would start to be more important. While scale is not as critical for cable as it is in other industries, scale gives you the opportunity to control your own fate. AT&T gave us that kind of scale.”The backdrop was becoming more competitive due to the aggressive push for subscribers from satellite operators. Satellite rivals DirecTV – now controlled by Rupert Murdoch – and Echostar are still the main focus for Comcast, in spite of the ambitious plans of telecommunications companies – called Bells – to also offer video to their clients.“The Bells are not likely to have video until 2006 or 2007 – DirecTV and Echostar have 20m subscribers and can reach 100 per cent of the US,” said says Mr Burke. “They are our immediate focus. For years, satellite had a better product – they had a better guide, they had DVRs (digital video recorders) before we did . . . Now, we have a better product.”The building blocks to this better product offering in the video business have been many. First, Comcast has been much more aggressive in getting content and also in providing more “on demand” video, a two-way service available to cable subscribers which that cannot technically be replicated by satellite services. If Comcast had bought Disney, it was planning to make large amounts of its programming available on demand.However, Mr Roberts said says a deal with Disney was never considered essential. “We chased AT&T but did not chase Disney. We really felt there were many, many paths to content and we have proved that,” he saidsays, pointing to deals done since then such as the purchase with Sony of the MGM library, sports programming deals such as with NFL, new kidschildren’s programmes with PBS and a recent deal to offer hundreds of free movies per month with Starz/Encore.Second, it created a joint venture with television TV Guide – announced in February of last year – to develop and enhance the guide subscribers use to navigate the channels and other offerings.“Creating Guideworks was a critical piece of the puzzle. We now have greater control over our customers’ television experience and that’s critical to competing with satellite,” says Mr Roberts.Third, it struck a deal with Motorola to sharply lower the cost of set-top boxes to below $75, a move which that will allow Comcast to increase its digital subscriber base and hence increase the use of its on-demand services.Its high-speed internet access, which is a high-margin business that is currently the growth engine for profits and which Mr Burke has said could reach 15m subscribers, has with it a portal which that is completed, developed and controlled by Comcast.Comcast has been criticised for embracing digital telephony too slowly. It will make it available to all its subscribers by the end of next year whereas Time Warner, the second biggest cable operator, has already done so. This will, however, be a growth driver in the future.In spite of all this, the cable sector has failed to excite Wall Street. There is a fear that the price cuts telecoms companies are offering to their phone customers to sign up to internet and video products too will erode margins over time. Comcast says its better, differentiated product will allow it to keep charging premium prices.Some cable operators are responding by taking their companies private. Last year, Cox did so. Recently, Charles Dolan, the founder of Cablevision, made a proposal to take that company private too. But dueowing to its size – Comcast’s its market capitalisation is nearly $70bn – this is not an option for Comcast.“There is a tremendous split between some public investors’ views on cable and where private equity and cable family money is going,” says Mr Roberts. “Given the scale of Comcast, we can’t take the company private. So, at times like this, all you can do is keep your head down and operate the company as successfully as you can.”HOW COMCAST CAST A SPELL OVER VIEWERS• In the 1990s, the group learned from consolidation in the telecoms industry that scale would be paramount in cable too. Hence the $72bn acquisition of AT&T’s cable business in 2002.• As telecoms groups start to offer internet and video products to phone customers, Comcast believes its differentiated product will allow it keep charging premium prices.• The immediate battle has been with satellite operators, forcing Comcast to improve its product.• Comcast has been more aggressive in getting content and providing “on demand” video, which technically cannot be replicated by satellite services.• A joint venture has been created with TV Guide to develop the guide subscribers use to navigate the channels to give it greater control over the viewing experience.• It has worked with hardware manufacturers to lower the price of set-top boxes.• It has developed a portal for its high-speed internet access service.
876;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-07-06T17:23:29Z;Sprint signs ‘Disney Mobile’ deal;;"Sprint, the third largest US mobile phone network operator, signed a deal with Walt Disney, that will enable the US media and entertainment group to offer a Disney-branded mobile phone service over Sprint's nationwide network.The new service dubbed 'Disney Mobile,' will target families and children and is expected to launch next year. Under the terms of the deal, Disney said it would be responsible for product development, distribution, marketing and billing.The agreement consolidates Sprint's position as the leading provider of network capacity and services to a group of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) attracted by the fast growing US mobile telecommunications market where mobile penetration is relative low 60 per cent. Most of these new pre-paid or 'pay-as-you-go' services target specific market niches such as the youth market, sports enthusiasts or others.It also highlights the success of a strategy set out by Gary Forsee, Sprint's chief executive, to make better use of the US mobile carrier's network capacity and become the ""partner of choice"" for US consumer brands and other companies seeking to set up MVNOs.Sprint's ability to provide network services to these companies will be further enhanced by its pending acquisition of Nextel Communications expanding its network capacity considerably.Like other companies, Disney has been encouraged by the success of Virgin Mobile USA, a joint venture between Sprint and Britain's Virgin group, which has grown quickly to become the biggest MVNO in the US. Virgin Mobile USA has signed up over 3m customers over the past two-and-a-half years mainly by focusing on the youth market.In addition to Virgin Mobile USA, Sprint has also announced an MVNO agreement with ESPN, the Disney cable TV sports channel, which plans to launch a mobile phone service targeting sports fans.Sprint also has partnerships with cable network operators including Comcast and Time Warner cable, the two largest cable operators in the US.Steve Wadsworth, president of the Disney's Internet group Disney said on Wednesday that he expects the venture to be in investment mode for the next several years, but hopes it will bring solid financial returns in the long run.""We will be in investment mode for the next several years, but expect that over the long run this initiative will generate solid financial returns for the company,"" said Mr Wadsworth."

Overall, it supports about 37m subscribers worldwide.The company, which had revenues of about $233m in fiscal 2004 and has about 700 employees, mostly based in Sacramento, California and Charlotte, North Carolina, expects to record a net after-tax gain of about $100m from the sale.Meanwhile, St Louis-based Amdocs said it expected the transaction to be neutral to earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related items, in the fourth quarter of this year and to add to earnings, excluding acquisition costs, in 2006.""The broadband media industry - which is undergoing tremendous change and dealing with increased complexity as it continues to converge with the telecommunications industry - represents a considerable opportunity for Amdocs,"" said Dov Baharav, chief executive officer of Amdocs Management.He said DST Innovis' capabilities would complement Amdocs' existing strength in telecommunications and enable Amdocs to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the broadband industry.As a result he claimed, Amdocs would be in a unique position to help broadband media and satellite companies move towards integrated customer management systems - a competitive imperative for companies across the entire communications service provider spectrum."
878;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-06-20T22:44:17Z;Adelphia founder jailed for 15 years for fraud;;John Rigas, 80, founder of Adelphia Communications, was on Monday sentenced to 15 years in prison for looting the cable television company and lying to investors. His son Timothy, former chief financial officer, received 20 years.The sentences were stiff by historical standards for white-collar crime, and are an ominous sign for other former executives awaiting sentencing.These include Bernie Ebbers, former WorldCom chief, who is to be sentenced next month for directing an $11bn accounting fraud, and Dennis Kozlowski, former head of Tyco, convicted of looting the conglomerate.Robert Mintz, a former prosecutor who practises at McCarter English, said of John Rigas’ punishment: “It’s a very severe sentence that will likely amount to a life sentence for the defendant. The judge is sending a message in the strongest possible terms that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated.”The Rigases will have to serve at least 85 per cent of the term. Addressing the elder Rigas on Monday, Judge Leonard Sand said he would have imposed a harsher sentence if not for the denfendant's age.Mr Rigas told the court: “If I did anything wrong, I apologise.”The father and son were convicted in July of using Adelphia as their “personal ATM”, tapping it for $50m in improper cash advances and to buy $1.6bn in securities.The crimes contributed to the collapse three years ago of Adelphia. Most of its assets were acquired this year by Time Warner and Comcast for $17.6bn.The Rigas' case coincided with tougher guidelines passed by Congress that ask judges when sentencing to consider the number of victims harmed by a financial crime and the dollar-value of their loss.Although the Supreme Court ruled that sentencing must be left to the judge's discretion, the defence bar says the guidelines contributed to stiffer punishments.Prosecutors cited the guidelines to argue last month that the Rigases each deserved 215-years in prison.Earlier this year, Andrew Fastow, the former chief financial officer of Enron, was sentenced to 10 years in prison under a plea deal in which he agreed to co-operate with prosecutors.
879;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Decision to go private ends infighting;;The Dolan family has provided plenty of fodder for the gossip pages of New York's newspapers in recent months.Charles “Chuck” Dolan, head of the family and founder of the cable and media company, has had a public spat about the future of the company with his son James.On top of that, the Dolans have exchanged plenty of insults with Michael Bloomberg, New York's mayor, over the city's plans to build a stadium close to their Madison Square Garden arena.Despite the entertainment value provided, the public disagreements have resulted in confusion among investors about the strategy of Cablevision, which has built up a solid subscriber base of cable subscribers in the New York area.“Cablevision trades at a discount to intrinsic value, stemming partly from the Dolans,” says Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.The Dolans' decision to go private is the culmination of months of internal fighting. It started when Cablevision's board, supported by James Dolan, voted to push Charles Dolan to close down the loss-making Voom high-definition satellite service.In January, Charles Dolan told Voom staff this decision was because of the “post-Enron regulatory climate, which places great emphasis on the potential legal liability of directors who sit on the boards of corporations with new enterprises such as [Voom]”.Mr Dolan, who has been credited with starting up HBO, believed strongly that high-definition would be a big market in the future.In the months that followed, Mr Dolan made extensive use of his controlling stake in Cablevision. His family owns 24 per cent of the company's equity, but 76 per cent of the votes. He moved to retake control of the board, by replacing four board members and adding a new board position for his son-in-law.One of the board members was John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media and a cable pioneer who had known Charles Dolan for many years.Mr Malone quit his position recently, citing potential conflict of interest.However, one of the pieces of advice he no doubt gave was that a private company would find it easier to raise debt, a theme Mr Malone often discusses.Despite his efforts, Charles Dolan had to agree to close Voom.He then really made a splash when he made a last-minute bid for Adelphia, the bankrupt cable operator later acquired by Time Warner and Comcast for $17.6bn. “We just had no idea what was going on at Cablevision,” said one investor.People working with the Dolan family said that all the efforts have been about maximising shareholder value. As Cablevision enters its next chapter, its shareholders will be hoping this is really what drives the clan.Gary Lutin, who advises shareholders on corporate governance issues, said Cablevision was a high-profile example of a situation that minority shareholders often face when companies go private whether the committee appointed by the controlling shareholder to determine whether the offer is fair is independent enough to judge that.
880;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-06-08T22:21:01Z;Malone leaves Cablevision;;John Malone resigned as director of Cablevision, the media company run by Charles “Chuck” Dolan, citing concerns of a possible conflict of interest between his position there and his job as chairman of Liberty Media.Mr Malone made the decision on Monday, Cablevision said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. The filing pointed out that both Cablevision and Liberty Media own programming assets.Mr Malone joined Cablevision's board in March after Mr Dolan got rid of a number of directors who opposed his plans for the Voom satellite service. Mr Malone has said he did it as a favour to Mr Dolan, an old friend of his.The two cable veterans worked together when Cablevision recently made an unexpected bid for Adelphia, the bankrupt cable operator, although Cablevision did not manage to outbid a joint offer from Comcast and Time Warner.Despite changing the board, Mr Dolan has not been able to secure a future for the Voom high-definition television service, which is now scheduled for closure. Earlier this week, Cablevision said it will cost $100m to $130m to shut it down.Analysts said Cablevision was likely to try and sell its programming assets, although the company has not commented on its plans. Any potential sale of the channels, which include a number of film channels as well as WE: Women's Entertainment, would be an obvious conflict for Mr Malone, whose Liberty Media owns the Starz Encore movie channels.
881;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-06-01T20:04:34Z;Broadband providers battle for consumer dollar;;Competition for US broadband customers heated up on Wednesday after SBC Communications made an aggressive price move,cutting its basic internet connection charge by 25 per cent to $14.95 per month.The move by the Texas-based telecommunications group could put pressure on telecoms and cable rivals to follow its lead and also lower their prices for broadband connection, or digital subscriber lines (DSL), analysts said.Most other telecoms companies charge between $25 and $30 a month for basic internet access and cable operators charge between $30 and $50 a month.The price cut is the latest twist in the fight for market share of the expanding broadband market.US telecoms groups want their telephone customers to subscribe to internet services in an effort to make them more loyal.This comes as cable operators, particularly Comcast and Time Warner, move into the telephony market with their voice over internet protocol (VoIP) offerings.“Given that SBC was already the low-price player in the market, their motivations in cutting further are hard to discern,” says Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “Some may interpret this move as an indication of greater than expected pressure from Time Warner's VoIP roll-out in Texas.”SBC's offer lower than any other similar offers by leading US broadband providers will be available for one year to subscribers who sign up online for the SBC Yahoo DSL Express service.Richard Lindner, SBC's chief financial officer, said in an interview on Wednesday the move was part of SBC's drive to gain new broadband users. “We do not want to get into a deteriorating price war with cable companies but want to capture new broadband customers,” he said.According to industry figures, more than half the nearly 80m internet subscribers in the US still rely on dial-up connections.SBC is already the biggest provider of DSL broadband access in the US, with about 5.6m customers, making it the main rival for cable operators.The cable groups were faster to market with broadband service, accounting for 60 per cent of broadband connections.SBC views DSL as astrategic service and has been trying to convert as many of its traditional dial-up internet subscribers to broadband customers as possible. Telephone customers who also subscribe to DSL are less likely to move to other providers - SBC said on Wednesday the churn of such customers had fallen from 3-3.5 per cent to close to 2 per cent.While SBC's move will be welcomed by consumers, it drew criticism from rivals, including Ivan Seidenberg, chief executive of Verizon Communications, the biggest US telecoms company.Mr Seidenberg, speaking at a conference in New York on Wednesday, warned that SBC's move may end up hurting its business. “I am concerned that you are playing with fire when you go that low,” he said, adding that it may encourage SBC's existing higher-paying DSL subscribers to switch to the cheaper $15-a-month rate.Verizon, based in New York, has 3.9m DSL customers and expects DSL revenue to rise 50 per cent over the next four or five years.Cable companies have indicated they would consider cutting broadband prices in certain regions if this was required by market conditions.Comcast, the biggest cable operator in the US, has so far not seen the need for this.“It is hard to overstate how wonderful this [internet] business has been,” Steve Burke, president and chief operating officer of Comcast, recently told investors. One factor he said allowed Comcast to charge more than the telecoms companies was the fact that it had its own internet portal, Comcast.net.“SBC and Verizon outsource their portal, and we believe this is a mistake. The portal is the foundation upon which to build new services,” he said.Analysts said it was unclear how price-sensitive broadband subscribers were. “After adjusting for availability, broadband share has not responded much to price cuts in the past,” said Mr Moffett, although he added that a larger gap might change this.At the moment, cable companies Time Warner and Comcast are offering digital telephony services about $25 per month cheaper than those offered by telecoms groups.Telecoms companies are reluctant to cut their phone prices because this would eat into their profits.The fight for customers will take on a third dimension this year when telecoms companies begin to roll out video services to rival those offered by cable and satellite companies.This week, these efforts received a set-back, however, after Texas legislators failed to pass a bill that would simplify the broadcast approvals process for Verizon and SBC.
882;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-05-28T00:05:31Z;Comcast contract lifts Pace Micro share price;;Shares in Pace Micro Technology rose more than 67 per cent on Friday, after the television set-top box company signed a new supply agreement with Comcast, the world’s largest cable TV operator.The deal is the first sign that Pace Micro is making significant inroads into the US market, following years of investment in the region.The shares, which had lost about 40 per cent of their value since last December, rose 24p to 60p, close to their year high.The agreement guarantees that Comcast will buy between $375m (£205.9) and $550m worth of set-top boxes from Comcast over the next three years. The boxes will mainly be personal video recorders, which allow viewers to record and pause live television.Revenues are expected to start coming in at the end of 2005, and should significantly boost Pace Micro’s second-half results to the end of May 2006.The two companies have also agreed to joint development of products, indicating that is was the “start of a long-term relationship”, said David Brocksom, finance director.Pace has been making large investments in its US business over the last six years, but up to now had made little impact in a market dominated by Motorola and Scientific Atlanta.Pace had an agreement with Comcast, but revenues have been minimal. Last year, North America accounted for £22.3m out of the company’s £239.9m revenues, and most of this came from a deal with Time Warner rather than Comcast.Some observers had suggested that Comcast was just using Pace as a negotiating tool to bring down the price of its contracts with Scientific Atlanta and Motorola, and that no significant deal would ever be signed.“We have spent many years investing in the US cable market, and there has been a lot of criticism that we were wasting money. This is the start of pay-back time,” said Mr Brocksom.“The fact that the world’s biggest pay-TV operator in the world’s biggest pay-TV market is committing to Pace is a big endorsement of the technology,” said Sue Cox, an analyst at ABN Amro.“It gives them a lot of credibility.”

Both Next and Marks & Spencer also forecast there would be little upturn in the sector before November.However, mining stocks, which have largely underperformed the market in the last three months, moved back into favour. “It;s been an encouraging week for the sector,” said Stephen Pope, head of equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was confirming forecasts for Chinese growth, which the market had been worried about,” he said.The 3.1 per cent gain in the FTSE Mining sector was enough to help the FTSE 100 finish the week 0.3 per cent higher while the FTSE 250 was 2.5 per cent stronger.Yesterday, London’s main equity market came off two-month highs after a brief attempt to push beyond the 5,000 barrier ran out of steam. The FTSE 100 closed down 8.6 points, 0.2 per cent, lower at 4,986.3 although the FTSE 250 gained 13.0 points, 0.1 per cent, to 7,105.4.

Credit Suisse First Boston poured cold water on takeover talk and urged clients to sell in the short-term. It said Whitbread’s valuation was particularly high and “significantly above our sum-of-the-parts estimate.”The fallout from Barclays’s warning continued, with the bank down 1.1 per cent 522p. But bid speculation boosted Egg, up 4.4 per cent to 102p.Pace Micro Technology, the set-top box maker, jumped 66.7 per cent to 60p as it announced a wide-ranging agreement with Comcast, the US’s largest cable TV provider. As part of the deal, Comcast will buy a variety of Pace set top boxes for a total of between approximately $375m and $550m over three years.Amvescap was 0.7 per cent higher at 326 ½p as it emerged that the fund manager had bought 640,000 shares in telecoms equipment maker Marconi on behalf of clients, taking its shareholding to 27.1 per cent.

884;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-05-24T17:27:15Z;Adelphia to shut unit with no buyer;;Adelphia Communications, the fifth-largest US cable operator, plans to close its long-distance telephone operations after failing to find a buyer for the unit.The cable operator, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection for the past three years, agreed last month to sell most of its assets to Time Warner and Comcast for $17.6bn.That deal, subject to approval by the New York bankruptcy court, excluded the long-distance telephone operations that provide services to about 110,000 subscribers in 27 states and had revenues of $8.6m last year.Like other long-distance telephone operators, the Adelphia unit has been struggling against increased competition from the four regional telephone operating companies, wireless phone substitution and the recent rapid growth of internet telephony services.In court papers filed on Tuesday, Adelphia said it would cost less to close the business than to try to revive it. “Having been unable to interest any parties in submitting a bid for this business, the company has determined that the best course of action is to wind down and terminate,” Adelphia said.If the move is approved next month by Judge Robert Gerber, who is overseeing Adelphia's reorganisation plan, customers will receive at least 30 days' notice before service is terminated, Adelphia said in the papers.Last month the company agreed to pay $715m to create a government-run restitution fund for investors who lost billions when the company collapsed in 2002. That agreement, approved last week, settles a US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit and means Adelphia will escape criminal prosecution.Last year, John Rigas, Adelphia's founder, and his son Timothy, Adelphia's former chief financial officer, were convicted of fraud and conspiracy.
885;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-05-04T18:37:29Z;AOL ad rise offsets fall in subscriptions;;AOL lost more subscribers than expected in the first quarter of the year but much of this decline was offset by an increase in online advertising revenues, results from its parent, Time Warner, showed on Wednesday.The group which includes the Time Warner Cable business, the Warner Bros film studios, cable networks including HBO and CNN and the Time Inc publishing division announced slightly better than expected results, with profits steady at $963m in the first quarter. Revenues were up 3 per cent at $10.5bn.AOL, which acquired Time Warner at the height of the internet bubble, resulting in severe losses for Time Warner shareholders, has been the one division with the least obvious strategic fit with the rest of the company.This year is particularly important for the internet business as its transition from a subscriber business to a free, advertising-driven internet portal, begins in earnest. In the first quarter, AOL lost 549,000 subscribers to 21.7m, compared with many analyst estimates of a fall of about 300,000. Advertising revenue, however, rose 20 per cent to $311m relative to the first quarter of last year when results are adjusted for the acquisition of Advertising.com. “AOL comparisons get easier through the year and the free portal launch should have a nice second-half impact on ad revenue,” said Doug Mitchelson, analyst at Deutsche Bank.Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive, expressed confidence that Time Warner would meet its target for high single-digit growth in its adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortisation this year, with the cable business particularly important.Last month Time Warner won a joint $17.6bn bid with Comcast for bankrupt cable operator Adelphia. Cable companies are expecting strong growth as more video customers sign up for other services in bundled offerings. Time Warner reported a 19 per cent increase in data revenues to $79m. Its digital phone product was also growing, with 15,000 new phone customers signing up every week, up from 10,000 at the end of last year.As a result, average monthly revenue per basic cable subscriber rose 10 per cent to about $80.On filmed entertainment where the group was facing a tough comparison due to the big success of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King a year earlier revenues were flat at $3bn, beating Time Warner's own budget for the division.Time Warner shares rose nearly 3 per cent by midday in New York to $17.17.
886;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-28T17:28:48Z;Back-up for the future: the data storage race;;"Peter Stone is not leaving anything to chance. As a freelance photographer who has gone digital, Mr Stone knows he cannot afford to lose any of the bits and bytes that make up the more than 10,000 images stored on his computer.That is why the Los Angeles-based photographer has programmed his desktop to back up his system folders and photos every night to one of two external hard drives.He is even more meticulous about his 4,500-track digital music collection. It is replicated on two computers, an external hard drive and his iPod digital music player.Mr Stone might appear over-protective, but he points out that he has never lost a file, song or photograph to a disc failure or system crash.Hardware makers and service providers have spotted that Mr Stone and a growing number of consumers like him will be increasingly interested in paying to store their digital content - so long as they can be assured that it will be kept safe.Increasingly large quantities of digital data will need to be stored, organised and backed up so that consumers feel sure that music and photos can survive a systems crash, disk corruption or other damage such as fire.Companies are studying consumer behaviour, testing hardware and exploring business models to ensure they provide the storage and back-up capabilities customers will need.""It's a whole new opportunity to extend the digital home. It's an opportunity for everybody to sell a lot of different services and products that will be useful for a lot of people,"" says Stephen Baker, analyst at NPD Group, the market research company.Consumers are likely to have two options: either to build home storage systems that act as repositories and back-up systems for the household's entire digital library; and/or to send information to an online storage service. Both systems have advantages and disadvantages.It is already possible to store and back up data on hard drives from Seagate and Maxtor that hold up to 400 gigabytes - enough for 400 hours of standard television programming or 6,500 hours of digital music or 400,000 photos. The next generation of home storage devices, such as Buffalo Technology's TeraStation, can hold 1 terabyte - 1,000 gigabytes - of data, which will be necessary when high-definition video content goes mainstream.Industry insiders suggest the long-term aim is to develop wireless home networks that enable all devices - mobile phones, music players, digital cameras, computers and storage servers - to ""talk"" to each other, possibly without human intervention.In such a scenario, a consumer such as Mr Stone might come home with his digital camera and music player after a day of shooting pictures and downloading music. The house's network would sense the devices and automatically copy their content to the home system.Mr Stone might programme the computer automatically to start displaying new photos on the big screen monitor mounted on the wall. Meanwhile, every new piece of data would be backed up instantly.Charlie Giancarlo, chief technology officer at Cisco Systems, the network equipment maker, believes consumers will prefer to keep personal data close to them at home.""Most consumers will probably choose to do it at home. I don't think they want to trust a third party to contain their [personal pictures and] information,"" he says.Automated networks are still years away, and home networks remain far too complicated for the average consumer to build and operate. Also, storage capacity costs about $1 per gigabyte - the TeraStation costs about $1,000 - far more than most consumers seem willing to pay to store or back up their data.Managing so much digital information remains tricky. It is currently much easier for people to find specific data on the internet than it is to locate files on their computers. That challenge will get harder as consumers put more files on home networks comprising a greater number of devices.""The legitimate concern is that managing that amount of information is going to be pretty hard,"" says Mr Baker.Hence the potential offered by internet giants such as Yahoo, Google and Microsoft, or cable service providers such as Comcast, the largest US cable television operator. Consumers may prefer to upload their data to cyberspace - or ""the cloud"" - for safekeeping.Roger Kay, an analyst at IDC, the research group,notes that online services such as Google, Yahoo and Microsoft's MSN are robustly backed up with redundant power supplies and protective procedures that ensure that they always have multiple copies of their data.Another key advantage is that users would be able to get at their internet-stored music, e-mail or photos from practically any computer in the world - the ""roamability"" factor.Richard Dougherty, analyst with research company Envisioneering Group, says cable service operators such as Comcast are working out how they can exploit this opportunity. They already offer content, provide broadband connections to homes and have established billing relations with customers.""Cable operators dream of managing and maintaining all this information for a monthly fee, but the business models have not yet been determined,"" he says.Comcast is conducting a lot of customer research in this area but says it is still too early to determine what kinds of storage and back-up services consumers want.And there would be other issues to resolve. For example, it is not yet clear that consumers will be willing to trust services to safeguard their photos and other digital personal items, says Charlie Herrin, Comcast's vice-president for business development.Proponents of the online model note that millions of people depend on Microsoft, Yahoo and Google to store huge volumes of e-mail messages. Consumers also store vast quantities of photos on online services such as Kodak's Ofoto, the independent Shutterfly and MSN's Spaces.But companies exploring this new market are still unsure how much they will be able to charge to store customers' data. Google has pushed the boundaries by offering huge volumes of free e-mail storage to attract users to its services. That has forced others to respond, driving down the value of storage. However, offering 1 gigabyte for e-mails is very different from providing the space to back up a computer or store huge libraries of music or videos. A range of price tiers based on capacity and value-added services is likely.Overall, some savvy consumers will prefer to build sophisticated home networks, while others will opt for a service deal. Some may choose both options just to make sure. That would make them even more protective than Mr Stone."
887;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast profits from surge in demand;;Comcast, the US's biggest cable operator, benefited in the first quarter of 2005 from surging demand for new digital services and as a result profits rose almost fivefold.The cable group's net profits climbed from $65m, or 3 cents a share, to $313m, or 14 cents.Revenues rose by 9.2 per cent to $5.36bn as Comcast, like other US cable operators, focused on sales of new digital services such as internet telephony, video on demand (VOD), high-definition TV programming and digital video recorders (DVRs) to bolster its defences against telephone and satellite TV companies.Reflecting its confidence in the outlook, Comcast raised its full-year operating cashflow growth guidance and authorised the repurchase of another $2bn of its own shares.“We are off to a great start this year,” said Brian Roberts, chief executive. “Our customers are embracing a whole new way to watch television.” In particular he highlighted the growth of Comcast's On Demand VOD service.During March, he said, Comcast's digital TV customers viewed more than 100m VOD programmes three times the number in the same month last year and a 40 per cent rise in usage from the 2004 fourth quarter. Pay-per-view revenues increased more than 18 per cent, driven by movie and event purchases through the On Demand service.Video revenue increased by $178m to $3.4bn, driven by higher monthly revenue per subscriber and an increase in digital cable subscriptions.Overall, Comcast added 200,000 new digital customers in the quarter and now has more than 8.8m digital subscribers, representing 41.1 per cent of the total.Demand for hard-disk-based DVRs also grew sharply. Comcast added about 428,000 new DVR customers during the quarter along with 414,000 net new high-speed internet subscribers, ending the period with 7.4m broadband customers.“New services continue to drive our growth and we believe we are striking the right balance between focus on growth and focus on free cashflow and profitability,” said Mr Roberts.However the number of basic cable subscribers a key number for investors continued to decline. Comcast lost 29,000 during the first quarter and said more basic video subscriber losses were expected in the second. Last week Comcast agreed a joint bid with Time Warner to buy Adelphia Communications, and is expected to add 1.8m new cable subscribers as a result.Looking ahead, Comcast raised its full-year operating cashflow growth from 12 to 14-15 per cent. At the same time the company said full-year capital expenditure was expected to rise by $200m-$300m to $3.2bn-$3.3bn reflecting the strong demand for advanced set-top boxes.

889;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Adelphia to pay $715m to settle fraud charges;;Adelphia, the US cable television company, on Monday reached a settlement with regulators and prosecutors under which it will pay $715m to resolve allegations of massive accounting fraud.The family of John Rigas, Adelphia's founder, will relinquish assets worth $1.5bn to Adelphia as part of the settlement, including interests in certain cable properties.Adephia will in turn pay $715m into a compensation fund for investors who suffered losses in the alleged accounting fraud.The settlement, which will help speed Adelphia's sale to Time Warner and Comcast, follows investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.“Today is a day of restitution for the victims of corporate corruption,” said Alberto Gonzales, attorney general.Adelphia avoids prosecution under an agreement with the US attorney's office for the southern district of New York.The SEC alleged that Adelphia, at the direction of the Rigas family, fraudulently excluded billions of dollars of liabilities from its accounts by hiding them in off balance sheet entities.It also alleged that Adelphia inflated its earnings to meet Wall Street expectations, and concealed the Rigas family's use of corporate funds for purchases of stock and luxury properties.Mark Schonfeld, director of the SEC north east regional office, said the settlement resolved “one of the most complicated and egregious financial frauds committed at a public company”.The settlement places a bar John Rigas and his three sons serving as directors of a public company.Adelphia filed for bankruptcy in June 2002. The planned joint $17.6bn aquisition of Adelphia by Time Warner and Comcast will consolidate their positions as the two leading US cable network operators.The deal was announced last week following a lengthy and complex sale process and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 following reviews by regulators.Under the deal's terms, Adelphia's creditors will receive $12.7bn in cash and 16 per cent of the equity in Time Warner Cable, which will be spun off as a separate entity.
890;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-21T22:12:31Z;Deal assures dominance of cable;;By this time next year, Comcast and Time Warner hope to be throwing a huge party to celebrate the completion of their joint acquisition of bankrupt rival Adelphia for $17.6bn. When they do, assuming no regulatory obstacles or last-minute rival bids, their dominance of the US cable sector will be secured.As well as enhancing their own profitability by adding new subscribers, the deal as planned will allow them to swap subscribers in certain areas. This will remove competition, as they will not be fighting for the same people, and give them further clout to sell more services to their customers.?A lot of our focus is on trying to figure out new products to put through our network,? said Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer of Comcast. ?That's our number one focus.?Already, the cable business has transformed from one selling multi-channel video to the provision of high-speed internet access and, increasingly, telephony.This pits cable operators against telecommunications groups such as Verizon and SBC, making scale increasingly important.The acquisition ofAdelphia by the two cable groups could put further pressure on smaller participants in the sector, such as Charter, which has 6m subscribers and Cablevision, with 3m.?This deal leaves the cable industry more concentrated and players like Cablevision looking increasingly sub-scale,? says Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.As part of the deal, Time Warner will spin off its cable business, creating a new currency for it to use in future consolidation.Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive officer, said Time Warner would have three ways to make acquisitions: cash, Time Warner stock and Time Warner Cable stock.?There may well be operators out there who decide to exit the business who would prefer cable stock,? he said.In terms of future consolidation, however, the growing overlap between cable and telecoms companies means deals could be done across these different sectors.?Cable consolidation cannot be seen in isolation,? said Ted Schaefer, partner at PwC. ?New deals will change the positioning of players, and there could then be deals that take place between content and distribution companies, cable networks and cable operators, and telecom operators acquiring satellite or cable assets.?Mr Parsons said that, although he was very optimistic about growth prospects for cable, the spinning off of Time Warner Cable would allow Time Warner to be more flexible in the future about whether it wanted to ?dial up or down? in this sector.There are already precedents for this. Comcast, which unlike Time Warner is mainly a distribution company, made a $60bn hostile offer to buy Walt Disney last year. The bid failed, but it raised the possibility of large transactions across different sectors.In the meantime, Time Warner in particular has a lot of detailed work to do before it can think about celebrating.Glenn Britt, who will be the chairman and chief executive officer of the new Time Warner Cable, said sorting out Los Angeles, where Time Warner has to integrate its systems with those of Comcast and Adelphia, would be one of the big challenges of the acquisition.?It will take some time,? he said, adding that as well as integrating all the systems, the group would face tough competition from satellite competitors there.
891;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-21T20:45:27Z;Dow records biggest jump in two years;;US stocks surged yesterday as positive earnings reports lifted shares a day after two of the leading US indices hit fresh year-lows.The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 2.1 per cent to 10,218.60, its best single-day performance in more than two years. The S&P 500 rose 2 per cent to 1,159.95, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5 per cent to 1,962.41.A steep drop in jobless claims, falling oil prices, and an upbeat manufacturing report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve also gave Wall Street a boost.Gains strengthened throughout the day in spite of a warning from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chief, that rising deficits could cause the US economy to stagnate.In spite of the day’s gains, US indices were still down substantially from monthly highs.Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services, said that, with bulls and bears locked in an increasingly volatile tug-of-war over investor sentiment, the market’s short-term fortunes may hinge on whether the indices can break through critical upward resistance points today. “If they fail here and this rally doesn’t succeed, it’s going to become more apparent that the bears are correct.”Motorolasurprised analysts with a 13.6 per cent increase in quarterly earnings. The mobile handset maker also raised its second-quarter guidance. Shares in the company rose 6.7 per cent to $15.93Transport finished higher after UPS, the express shipping company, reported higher first-quarter profits and forecast stronger growth this year. UPS shares rose 4.9 per cent to $70.56Yum Brands, owner of the KFC and Taco Bell fast-food chains, fell 4.3 per cent in spite of higher earnings amid concerns about food safety in China. McDonald’s fell 0.3 per cent to $29.85.Elsewhere, Anheuser-Busch, the brewer, jumped 6.5 per cent to $48.04 amid reports that Warren Buffett, the billionaire fund manager, had bought an undisclosed stake in the company.Archipelago Holdings, the electronic trading group, surged 60 per cent to $29.96 a day after it agreed to merge with the New York Stock Exchange to form a new for-profit company.Mergers and acquisitions were in focus as Time Warner and Comcast, the cable groups, agreed to buy Adelphia, a bankrupt rival, for $17.6bn. Time Warner shares rose 3.5 per cent to $17.53. Comcast shares rose 2.4 per cent to $32.25.Google, the world’s biggest search engine company, rose 3.1 per cent to $204.22 ahead of its quarterly results, revealed after the close.Qualcomm, the chipmaker, rose 4.5 per cent to $34.71 after an analyst upgrade. Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, rose 3.1 per cent to $23.36.Delta Air Lines rose 5.8 per cent in spite of a $1.1bn quarterly loss. Continental Airlinesrose 3.2 per cent.
892;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Time Warner buys Adelphia for $17.6bn;;Time Warner on Thursday made its first significant acquisition since its ill-fated merger with AOL in 2001, agreeing to buy bankrupt cable operator Adelphia for $17.6bn in a joint bid with Comcast.The deal, which follows a lengthy and complex sale process and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 following regulatory reviews, will reaffirm the dominance of Comcast and Time Warner in the cable business.Dick Parsons, chief executive of Time Warner, said the deal “moves us ahead as a company strategically, operationally and financially”. He believes cable companies, which sell customers high-speed data and telephony services in addition to multi-channel video, have strong growth prospects.A bankruptcy court judge gave the deal the go-ahead late on Wednesday. Adelphia's creditors will receive $12.7bn in cash and 16 per cent of the equity in Time Warner Cable, which will be spun off as a separate entity.Comcast, the biggest cable operator in the US with about 21.5m subscribers, is expected to gain 1.8m more subscribers from the deal. Time Warner, the second-biggest operator, with 11m subscribers, will gain just over 3m customers, putting it on a par with satellite rival DirecTV.An important part of the transaction for Time Warner is that it gives it dominance of the Los Angeles region. On top of its current leading position in New York, this will give it near-equal clout with Comcast in terms of negotiating deals with content providers and other partners.Mr Parsons said the Time Warner board would now start considering how to return “billions and billions of dollars” of value to shareholders. Time Warner will finance the bulk of the Adelphia acquisition, paying $9.2bn in cash. Comcast will put in its 21 per cent stake in Time Warner Cable, which regulators have said it needs to unwind, and $1.5bn in cash, similar to the amount it is estimated to have saved in tax payments by unwinding its stake in this way.The deal includes a 2.5 per cent break-up fee. This would add around $480m of extra costs if another bidder appears. Cablevision's last-minute offer of $17.1bn was rejected. The sale follows nearly three years of turmoil at Adelphia. Investors lost billions of dollars when the company collapsed in 2002 amid claims its founding Rigas family siphoned millions of dollars of company funds for personal use and misrepresented financial conditions.
893;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-20T17:54:48Z;Malone warns of online threat;;John Malone, the veteran cable entrepreneur, on Wednesday became the latest media mogul to predict a dramatic industry upheaval as online consumption transforms the market.Last week, Rupert Murdoch, the News Corp chairman, warned that media groups had to reinvent themselves to meet to demands from an “iPod generation” able to bypass traditional suppliers by consuming news and entertainment from the internet.Mr Malone, chairman and chief executive of Liberty Media, went a step further on Wednesday by predicting that online search engines such as Google or Yahoo would pose a significant challenge to TV broadcasters by launching video search devices.“You are going to have complete random access to content and consumers will only pay for what they consume,” said Mr Malone, whose Liberty Media company has emerged as one of the shareholders in News Corp, second only to the Murdoch family in voting power. “In the search world perhaps Google is the king.” Mr Malone, who made no reference to his News Corp intentions, said Mr Murdoch had tried to control the content search business in the past through outlets such as TV Guide, the dominant US listings magazine, and the Gemstar electronic programme guide.“Rupert Murdoch is a smart man and he has always wanted to own that piece of the food chain,” said Mr Malone. But he claimed that Google's market value $21.9bn showed that Wall Street believed search engines could become “king of the heap”.Speaking in Japan, where Liberty recently floated a minority stake in cable operator Jupiter Telecommunications, Mr Malone added: “Paid search is where the money is going to go. It's about one technology getting in front of the others and stealing the flow.”The Liberty chairman whose company holds large stakes in Time Warner, Sprint and InterActiveCorp warned that cable groups and other pay-TV providers would have to respond with more sophisticated services.Potential strategies include voice-over-internet (VoIP) services, already being pioneered by groups including Time Warner and Comcast. Mr Malone whose Liberty group controls QVC, Starz Encore and has a 50 per cent stake in Discovery urged cable companies to embrace technology such as personal video recorders allowing TV viewers to create their own programme schedules.Such initiatives could also include partnerships between cable groups and mobile phone operators to distribute content to wireless customers. “It's highly likely you will see announcements or transactions, though whether that could involve mergers I'm not so sure,” said Mr Malone.He hinted that Liberty, as a leading shareholder in telecoms company Sprint, might welcome a deal with cable group Comcast.Echoing Mr Murdoch's comments last week about online and wireless consumption, he added: “People want one bill and they want portability and to see video across all platforms. Consolidation of technology will lead to convergence of those businesses.”His comments reinforce the view among media executives that the industry is moving from a traditional “push” system, where broadcasters distribute content and set schedules, to a market where consumers “pull” their preferred content to a variety of devices.Mr Malone said the trend was already adversely affecting companies dependent on advertising.
894;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-19T22:09:32Z;Joint Adelphia bid wins creditors' backing;;Adelphia's creditors, who have the final say in the sale of the bankrupt cable operator, on Tuesday said they were backing Time Warner and Comcast Corporation's joint bid for the company ?at this juncture?.In court documents made public ahead of Wednesday's bankruptcy court hearing to consider the Time Warner/Comcast offer, debtors said it was the ?most likely to maximize the value of distributable proceeds?.The statement was filed on April 8, after creditors knew about a last-minute rival offer for Adelphia from Cablevision, the cable operator controlled by the Dolan family.Time Warner and Comcast, the biggest US cable operators, are believed to have offered a bid consisting of $12.5bn in cash plus equity taking the total value to between $17.6bn and $18bn.Cablevision, which made a $16.5bn cash offer on April 5, appears to have increased this to $17.1bn late last week. It is believed to be a mix of cash and shares, although the breakdown was not clear.Despite this indication that Charles ?Chuck? Dolan, Cablevision's maverick founder, is serious about bidding for Adelphia, which collapsed following an accounting fraud scandal, the Cablevision offer appears not to have derailed the Time Warner/Comcast bid timetable.?[Cablevision] is way behind,? said one person involved in the discussions.At a hearing scheduled for 2pm in New York on Wednesday, Judge Robert Gerber will decide whether to give the Time Warner/Comcast deal the go-ahead.A ruling could take until Thursday, people close to the proceedings said.In the documents filed on Tuesday, it was confirmed that Adelphia has been authorised to agree to a break-up fee of 2.5 per cent of the purchase price. This could add a further cost of around $450m to any rival bid.The sale of Adelphia could be a trigger for the reshaping of the cable industry. It would confirm the dominance of Comcast.Any Adelphia transaction is unlikely to be completed until next year, however.
895;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-19T01:00:22Z;Adelphia to seek approval for sale;;"Adelphia Communications, the bankrupt cable operator, will on Wednesday seek bankruptcy court approval for its sale to Time Warner and Comcast for up to $18bn.If the offer gets the go-ahead from the court, which seems likely following positive indications at a preliminary hearing earlier this month, a deal could be announced this week.Adelphia will next have to seek the approval of its bondholders. If that is granted, a lengthy regulatory review would follow, with Time Warner and Comcast potentially taking over Adelphia next year. A rival, 11th hour bid from cable operator Cablevision for $16.5bn in cash three weeks ago does not appear to have been improved or fleshed out. This gives Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, and Time Warner, the second-biggest, a clear run at Adelphia, although the bankruptcy process would still allow a higher bid from another party to be considered.The two cable giants presented an offer at a private meeting with the bankruptcy judge nearly two weeks ago. They have bid $17.6bn to $18bn with $12.5bn to be paid in cash. If it gets the go-ahead, it would be Time Warner's first important acquisition since its ill-fated merger with AOL five years ago. It would also be important as it would resolve uncertainty about how much cash would be available for share buybacks or increasing dividends.Dick Parsons, Time Warner chief executive, has long espoused the advantages of scale in the cable business, which has strong growth potential because of the provision of internet and telephony services, as well as multichannel video.The acquisition of Adelphia would make Time Warner the biggest cable group in the US after Comcast. Comcast has 21.5m subscribers, Time Warner 10.9m and Adelphia 5.3m. Comcast is expected to gain 2m extra subscribers; the rest going to Time Warner.As well as cash, Adelphia's creditors are expected to be offered shares in a company created by combining Time Warner's cable business and Adelphia. Comcast is expected to contribute about $2bn in cash and to swap its 21 per cent stake in Time Warner's cable business for Adelphia subscribers.Part of the new company might be spun off, bankers said. Adelphia collapsed in an accounting fraud three years ago in one of the biggest corporate scandals in the US. The complexity of its assets and the process of clearing up the accounting irregularities have made its sale extremely lengthy."
896;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-13T16:39:53Z;Massive job cuts likely at MGM;;MGM, one of the most venerable Hollywood film studios, is expected to offer early redundancy to the majority of its staff following the company's acquisition by a consortium including Sony Corporation of America, Comcast and a group of private equity firms.MGM has already laid off nearly 200 of its roughly 1,400 employees, according to people familiar with the matter, since the $5bn deal formally closed last Friday.The company is expected to retain a skeleton staff of roughly 200 workers while another 300 could be rehired by Sony, these people said.The MGM deal was based on the company's library of 4,000 films and 10,000 television episodes. Sony and its private equity partners will oversee licensing of those properties. A modest slate of new MGM productions mostly remakes of library properties, or new instalments of franchises such as James Bond will be co-financed and distributed by Sony.The massive job cuts were part of the financial rationale behind the deal, in which the Sony-led consortium beat out Time Warner.MGM's production of new films had declined following its acquisition by investor Kirk Kerkorian in 1996. He recruited Alex Yemenidjian and Chris McGurk and the two executives decided to make the library the centrepiece of the business. Both resigned last week.Daniel Taylor, MGM's chief financial officer, has been promoted to president to oversee the new private company's assets.
897;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Users make the switch to ?digital' lines;;Users of Cox Communications' telephone services could be forgiven for not knowing just how cutting-edge they are. The third-biggest cable company in the US deliberately avoids any mention of voice over internet protocol (VoIP) when marketing its new phone services. As far as its customers are concerned, the phone is just like their old one, only cheaper.The strategy appears to be working. Cox's ?digital phone? also the marketing tactic preferred by other cable companies is selling more rapidly than expected.The privately owned cable company has 1.3m telephone customers, although not all of these use its VoIP technology. But growth was 32 per cent year-on-year at the end of 2004, much of it due to its marketing of digital phones.Cox has been in the phone business for some years, providing traditional telephony using circuit-switch technology. But, like all the other cable operators in the US, it expects tremendous growth from its voip phone products.There are two main reasons cable companies are piling into the telephony market.First, the profits available are considerable. Already, Comcast, Time Warner, Cox and Cablevision, to name just the biggest operators in the market, have spent billions upgrading their cable networks.The removal of analogue television stations and circuit-switch telephone services, replacing them with digital communications instead, frees up tremendous amounts of space. The cost of piling on more services is, therefore, low and margins are high.For example, according to Greg Bicket, vice-president and general manager of Cox Communications New England, the capital expenditure for hooking customers up with voip telephones is $267 per subscriber, versus $527 per customer of its circuit-switch phone.Second, the cable companies hope that they will be able to retain more customers if they sell them bundles of services. Currently, they are all entering the ?triple play? of video, data and voice. The evidence so far is that bundling reduces the ?churn rate? the rate at which customers cancel subscriptions.?The fieldwork involved in churn is one of the most expensive aspects of running a cable company,? says Mr Bicket. In Cox's case, he says customers just subscribing to video had a churn rate of 3 per cent, and this fell to 2.3 per cent for users of video and high-speed internet and to 1.4 per cent for users of video, internet and phone.Despite the strong initial gains, there are expectations that it might get tougher to keep margins high. The telephone companies, which are losing customers to cable rivals as well as to providers of mobile phones, are beginning to fight back.As well as offering phone and internet services, most telecoms operators are building fibre-optic networks to offer video too, although this is expected to be several years away. In the meantime, many are already partnering with satellite companies such as DirecTV.?Competition is everywhere for us,? says Elaina Mango, executive director of retail markets at Verizon Communications. ?Our strategy has been to offer customers choices we have a lot more choice in our bundles, whereas cable companies tend to offer one-size-fits-all bundles.?One of the big test areas of consumer behaviour will be New York. Cablevision, which has 5m subscribers in the area, is already providing a package of video, data and phone, in an effort to lure as many subscribers as possible before Verizon starts to offer a similar triple-play of products.Ms Mango says customers were tending to come back to Verizon once the promotion offers ran out at cable companies. However, with the product only just beginning to be marketed, it is possible that cable companies will keep prices low beyond the initial offer period. Cablevision, for example, recently cut its prices in order to prevent customers from moving again.Soon, however, even triple-play may not be enough. Customers might want ?quadruple-play? with mobile phone thrown in. Already, Sprint is involved in a test with Time Warner in Kansas, where the cable group sells and bills for Sprint-branded mobile phones.The issue is at the top of cable companies' agendas: the big cable companies have formed a consortium through which they are negotiating with a number of mobile telephone groups, including Sprint, about possibly setting up a partnership that covers the entire US.?A lot of discussions on this subject are taking place,? says Glenn Britt, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner Cable.In the meantime, customers keen on a good deal are getting more and more chances to shop around. What really matters in the future, however, is what service they value the most.?If people value TV more than telephones, the cable companies will have an advantage over telecoms companies,? says Viktor Shvets, analyst at Deutsche Bank.
898;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-11T17:18:45Z;Cable groups see VoIP services take off;;The rate at which telephone users in the US are switching from traditional operators to services provided by cable companies is higher than previously envisaged, the latest company indications show.Cablevision, the New York-based cable company that has been offering discounts to its television subscribers who also choose to buy its internet and phone services, announced at a conference last week that it had 350,000 phone subscribers as of mid-March, more than expected. ?This implies the company continues to add [phone customers] at a healthy rate of 1,000 additions per day,? said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.Telephone services using voice over internet protocol, or VoIP, technology are source of growth for cable companies.The rate at which cable companies are obtaining new customers could affect the profitability of traditional telephone providers, with regional telecoms companies such as Verizon Communications and SBC Communications already losing customers to mobile phone providers.Comcast, the biggest cable operator in the US, is this year aggressively rolling out voice services to its 21.5m subscribers. It is the last big cable company to do so, with Time Warner, Cox and Cablevision already offering the services.Time Warner Cable said that at the end of 2004 it had 220,000 VoIP customers, adding 10,000 per week.At Cox, a privately held cable company, year-on-year growth in its telephone business was 32 per centat the end of last year.Neither company has given an official update but indications are of continued strong growth.According to Greg Bicket, vice-president and region manager at Cox, most of the new customers at Cox were ?almost exclusively coming from incumbent telecoms operators?.Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said Cablevision had passed 6.1 per cent penetration of homes. Time Warner Cable had achieved more than 10 per cent in the first 18 months of offering services. Cox said in some markets penetration was close to 40 per cent.Mr Moffett expects 1.7m cable VoIP subscribers in the US by the end of this year, or 3.6 per cent of homes that have access to cable, rising to 17 per cent or 15m subscribers by 2010.
899;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-08T20:52:28Z;Wall St snaps weekly losing streak despite sell-off;;Wall Street managed a rally for the week despite a broad sell-off on Friday as profit-taking cut in half the gains achieved by stocks in the previous four sessions on the back of a sharp decline in oil prices.Yesterday the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off 0.8 per cent at 10,461.34 , while the S&P 500 index eased 0.8 per cent to 1,181.20 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down almost 1 percent at 1,999.35.For the week, the Dow had advanced 0.5 per cent, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both gained 0.7 per cent.Stocks thus snapped a four-week losing streak that saw all the main indices test lows touched in January, sparking concerns that could bring about accelerated technical selling.Arthur Cashin, managing director at UBS, noted that all three main US indices rallied in near lostep last week, which raises the probability that wholesale programme buying of the indices was the main reason for the advance.However, this week’s gains come with a caveat – low trading volume that dents the credibility of the rally and raises doubts about its staying power.An external catalyst for the rally in stocks was a decline in crude oil prices over the previous five sessions after they touched an all-time nominal high of more than $58 on Monday.Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, further spurred the stock rally and oil decline by expressing his belief that markets would manage to calm the current levels in oil prices.Stocks traders were thus able to focus on the onset of the first-quarter earnings season this week, and relinquish at least for a while their fears that high oil prices would weigh on consumption and lift inflation.Retailers offered a mixed picture of consumption last month in their sales data and earnings reports. Bed, Bath & Beyond reported above-estimate earnings and its shares added 11.1 per cent on Thursday. For the week, they gained 9.4 per cent. Pier One Imports stock fell 7.7 per cent this week on disappointing earnings. On a similar note, Starbucks shares fell 5.1 per cent over the five-session stretch.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, saw its shares lose 0.9 per cent for the week as it guided investors to the lower end of its forecast earnings range. Target, a rival, was up 1.3 per cent for the week after it told analysts it would either meet or beat expectations.Energy stocks attracted attention as Unocal accepted a takeover bid from ChevronTexaco on Monday. The news pulled its stock 7.4 per cent lower on disappointment that no counterbid emerged. ChevronTexaco gave up 3.9 per cent in the same session and its shares were 4.4 per cent lower for the week by late morning on Friday while Unocal lost 8.6 per cent in the same period.Other merger news came from the media sector, where Time Warner and Comcast were reported to have reached an agreement on buying Adelphia Communications, a bankrupt cable television operator. Time Warner was up 3 per cent for the week while Comcast edged off 1 per cent.In earnings news, Alcoa kicked off the earnings season and its shares added 5 per cent on Thursday in spite of its lower profits reported a day earlier. They finished the week 4.4 per cent up.Meanwhile, on Tuesday Pfizer announced plans to cut costs by $4bn in the next three years, sending its shares 3.7 per cent higher. Two days later, the news that Pfizer would stop selling its Bextra painkiller due to regulators’ safety concerns sent its shares sharply lower but they recovered amid broad buying of Dow stocks. Pfizer gained 1.7 per cent for the week. Its rival Merck , which has faced similar problems, added 3.2 per cent.Dell Computer was one of the week’s focal points, up 0.4 per cent for the period as investors took stock of its annual analyst update on Thursday. Software stocks, however, raised concerns about demand in the sector, with Siebel Systems warning of below-estimate earnings in the first quarter, sending its shares 9.6 per cent lower on Wednesday. On Friday morning, Ariba was down 7.5 per cent after it warned of lower revenues while Borland Software saw its shares decline 11.1 per cent after it reduced its earnings estimates a day earlier.In the latest episode of the battle for MCI, the company on Wednesday rebuffed the latest takeover bid from Qwest Communications in favour of one from Verizon Communications.

900;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-07T18:43:55Z;Content control is the key;;"In every media and communications company, and in the boardrooms of every big advertiser, debate is raging about how consumers are and will be watching the movies, music videos and games they pay so much for.Consumers are using a growing array of methods to access content from televisions, home computers and laptops to hand-held wireless devices, mobile phones and portable music players. At the same time, technological developments, and particularly the development of digital content and delivery, means consumers can buy content from a growing list of providers.Among all the uncertainty about the direction consumer tastes will take, and which companies will win and lose, one apparent certainty sticks out: companies providing content will benefit. Being able to resell or repackage versions of popular film, television series and other content should vastly increase the amount of money made.?The world is a collection of screens and we feel we should get our product on to every one of those screens,? said Jeff Bewkes, chairman of entertainment and network at Time Warner, at a conference in San Francisco this week.Within big media companies, however, there are concerns that they may not profit if they do not quickly adopt the right strategy. There are two issues: the first is to continue to attract advertisers to content and the second is to profit from the use of new technology.In terms of advertising, there is a growing focus by agencies and advertisers on capturing people's attention in ways other than through traditional television. The growing use of digital video recorders, which allow viewers to fast forward ads and watch programmes when they want to, has already shifted a lot of money away from television ads.Andrew Robertson, chief executive of BBDO, one of the world's biggest advertising agencies, predicts mobile telephones and other wireless devices will ?soon? become the most important medium for advertisers. Bob Iger, president and chief operating officer of Walt Disney, says his business will be no less affected. ?Wireless technology will have the most impact on our profitability.?But even on television, there are strategies to continue to attract viewers', and therefore advertisers', attention, according to Peter Chernin, president and chief operating officer at News Corporation, which owns Fox television networks and cable channels, as well as satellite broadcaster DirecTV. ?Live sports, live news and live events will be increasingly important,? he says.And for mobiles, companies are adapting their content, particularly focusing on shorter episodes and bursts of video. ?Wireless is the fast food of content, so it is no good applying the standards of a six-course meal,? says Mr Chernin.In addition, one of the biggest areas of future growth is expected to be the use of video content on the internet, either accessed on wireless devices or on computers. One reason Google and Yahoo are not providing access to vast archives of popular sport, news and movie clips is because of the complex issue of copyright. The right to reuse content could, in theory, be one of the most valuable assets content companies have. ?Content is king but convenience drives adoption,? says Bob Clasen, president of sales and marketing at Starz Encore Group, a movie programmer. Starz is working with cable companies such as Comcast to drive the use of video-on-demand technology. The ability to view content at a time of the users' choosing has been available for some time but ?it requires evangelism and effort to change behaviour?, he adds.Within media companies, there are discussions on how to position for the internet video market. Many companies declined the opportunity to take stakes in Google and Yahoo, never anticipating the extent to which search-related advertising would take off. They do not want to make the same mistake twice.According to a senior executive at one of the biggest media companies, there are three possibilities. Content companies could license their video archives; they could develop video search portals based around their own content; or they could push to dominate the field and aggregate content from competitors."
901;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-06T18:51:39Z;Cablevision's Adelphia bid shocks market;;Shares in Cablevision fell on Wednesday amid confusion about the cable operator's strategy following its unexpected $16.5bn cash offer for bankrupt rival Adelphia.The bid that Charles ?Chuck? Dolan, Cablevision's founder and chairman, made on Wednesday with the financial backing of JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch appears to suggest the company wants to expand in the cable industry. Previously, the expectation had been that Mr Dolan, who is in the process of trying to buy the loss-making Voom satellite business from Cablevision, could sell his cable assets.The unexpected move by Cablevision, one of a series of surprises sprung by the family-owned cable firm, could put pressure on Time Warner and Comcast to raise their bid for Adelphia. The joint bid is believed to be for about $17.5bn, but is a combination of cash and shares.?Cablevision's hope is that its bid could be viewed more favourably by Adelphia's creditors given the larger cash component,? said Vijay Jayant, analyst at Lehman Brothers. He added Cablevision shares might fall ?as some believed that Cablevision was a seller not a buyer?.None of the companies involved would comment on Wednesday. However, executives within Time Warner and Comcast indicated they had made no change to their bid and the bid process was progressing. ?The real question we do not know the answer to is how serious the Cablevision bid is,? said one executive.Adelphia went bust last year after its owners, members of the Rigas family, were convicted of fraud. The company's creditors are trying to sell the cable group. As well as a bid from Comcast and Time Warner, a group of private equity buyers are believed to have placed a bid.The sale process was due to be completed in the next week or so, but the Cablevision bid might push the timetable back.Analysts said the financing of a bid for Adelphia would push up Cablevision's leverage considerably. Provision in its bonds would only allow leverage to rise to a certain level, meaning Cablevision might have to sell assets to finance it. Its Rainbow programming group, for example, could be sold for $3.5bn, say analysts.?This bid and the Voom commitment create uncertainty regarding eventual direction and potential asset sale,? said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.One driving factor behind the apparent change in Mr Dolan's strategy may be the presence of John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media and veteran deal-maker, on Cablevision's board. Mr Malone has long advocated the use of debt to finance aggressive bids.
902;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-05T23:27:27Z;Cablevision makes $16.5bn bid for Adelphia assets;;The fight for Adelphia Communications, the bankrupt cable operator, intensified on Tuesday when it was revealed that Cablevision Systems, the New York-based cable group, had entered the field with a $16.5bn all-cash offer.Cablevision's offer instantly put it into contention with Time Warner and Comcast, two rival cable groups, which are believed to have jointly bid about $17bn for Adelphia, the fifth-largest US cable operator.Although the Cablevision deal was slightly smaller in absolute terms, its supporters believed it would be more attractive because it was all-cash whereas Time Warner and Comcast were offering a mix of cash and stock.There was also the possibility on Tuesday that the Cablevision bid could be raised further if it were to join with two private equity firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Providence Equity Partners, who have also contemplated an offer for Adelphia.The buyout groups were in discussions last night with Cablevision about making a joint bid, according to people familiar with the matter.Both Cablevision and the buyout firms declined to comment on the matter yesterday. Adelphia and Time Warner also declined to comment.The Cablevision offer would be backed by financing from JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch. JP Morgan declined to comment, while Merrill could not be reached.Time Warner and Comcast had been considered the front-runners for Adelphia because of their ability to cut costs while increasing advertising concentration in overlapping markets such as Los Angeles, Cleveland, Buffalo, Pennsylvania and Florida.Cablevision's interest in Adelphia has baffled some Wall Street analysts because a deal would not bring similar benefits since its 3m subscribers are concentrated in New York.It would also represent a significant investment at a time when members of the Dolan family, Cablevision's controlling shareholders, are at loggerheads over the company's satellite business, Voom.Cablevision has made plans to jettison Voom, although its founder and chairman, Charles Dolan, is currently tring to raise money to purchase the assets.
903;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-04-04T17:36:23Z;There’s gold in them there film archives;;"At a recent investor conference, Jon Feltheimer, chief executive of Lions Gate Entertainment, put a trivia question to his audience: how many copies of the 1987 coming-of-age film Dirty Dancing did the independent film studio sell each month to video retailers?There was collective head-scratching in the room. Then a few guesses rang out - 5,000, maybe 10,000 copies. Wrong. The correct answer was 110,000.The trivia contest was not intended to highlight the enduring popularity of Dirty Dancing star Patrick Swayze in tight-fitting trousers - although it surely did. Rather, it was a reminder of the gold to be mined in Hollywood film libraries.Long after films have left theatres, studios continue to milk them for profits through DVD sales and rentals and television rights. Although the library business lacks the glamour of green-lighting a new blockbuster or Academy Award hopeful, it represents a stable source of cash flow in an otherwise volatile business.As an independent studio with less capital to spare, Lions Gate appreciates that more than most. Rather than banking on windfall profits from the latest big-budget blockbuster, it has thrived by making the library the centrepiece of its business. The 8,500 titles it has collected in recent years generate about $200m in revenue.That covers its annual overheads and funds the development of new productions to replenish and supplement the library. By contrast, other Hollywood studios tend to treat their libraries as mere gravy on top of their new release business.""The reason that a lot of independent studio companies have failed over the years is that they haven't had steady cash flow,"" says Steve Beeks, Lions Gate's president. ""We turn on our lights on January 1st, and we already know our bills are paid for the entire year. Everything else is profit.""Lions Gate is not the only company in Hollywood to recognise the value of film libraries. The $5bn deal that a consortium including Sony and Comcast struck last year to take control of MGM was largely motivated by the studio's 4,000 title library, which includes the James Bond and Rocky films.Control over those assets should give momentum to Sony's efforts to try to establish its Blu-ray disc as the technological standard for the next generation of DVDs. It will also provide a wealth of old characters that Sony can update in new releases without having to pay astronomical acquisition rights. Meanwhile, Comcast hopes to use the MGM library to strengthen its video-on-demand offerings, its main weapon against competing satellite television providers.MGM refurbished its library when former owner Kirk Kerkorian installed Alex Yemenidjian and Chris McGurk as chairman and vice-chairman in 1999 to reverse the studio's sagging performance. ""Our strategy as a content company was dramatically to improve the value of the library, which we knew was as an asset we could leverage,"" Mr McGurk explains. ""We decided we were going to be a library company first, and a new content company second.""Since then, they have more than doubled cash flow from the library, helping to lessen a heavy debt load.In some ways, the wind was at their backs. The proliferation of cable television channels has multiplied the demand for programming to fill airtime. The introduction of DVDs has also been a boon to film libraries.Consumers spent a record $21.2bn renting and buying DVDs in 2004, according to DEG, the Digital Entertainment Group. DVD sales alone grew 33 per cent over the previous year. Many analysts are predicting another boom when the next generation of DVDs comes online, perhaps next year.Evergreen titles such as Rocky and the Bond franchise tend to sell themselves. There is also a predictable spike in sales across the franchise whenever a new instalment arrives in theatres. The true skill in library management is being able to tap into the thousands of lesser titles.When Mr Yemenidjian and Mr McGurk took over at MGM one of their first moves was to create a task force to study all areas where library properties generated revenues. They then developed a proprietary information technology system to manage the library. It plots the catalogue of films against 1,500 television and retail customers around the world. The goal was to determine whether MGM was maximising the value of each title or - in some cases - wearing them out.""Most - if not all - studios view their library as a by-product,"" Mr Yemenidjian explains, whereas MGM views it as a core business.Lions Gate, meanwhile, has divided its library into genres, such as action, horror and drama, assigning each its own brand manager. Those managers are forever searching for new ways to package films together or re-release them. For the week leading up to Hallowe'en, for example, the company rolled out a different promotion built around its horror films for each day of the week.A hot new DVD release can also be a boon because the studios can use it as a calling card for retailers to promote other titles. ""When you walk into the store with Austin Powers, it gives you an opportunity to take along several other properties, too,"" one studio executive explains.Lions Gate has even found ways to capitalise on other studios' hits. When Miramax's Kill Bill went on to video, for example, Lions Gate approached stores with a re-released version of the director Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough film, Reservoir Dogs. It sold 150,000 units in a month.""We try to be opportunistic,"" Mr Beeks says. ""It is not about the top 250 or 300 titles. It is about grinding value from thousands of others.""As such tactics indicate, relationships with retailers have become crucial to the library business just as they have to vendors of other consumer products. Wal-Mart, after all, is the world's largest seller of DVDs.MGM has relied on its IT system to move closer to retailers. Although the company refuses to discuss the specifics of its black box, the market intelligence gleaned from its tracking system helps it to predict which product will fare well in specific locations and at specific times of the year. That has given MGM the confidence to ship products to retailers and forego payment until they are purchased by consumers, according to people familiar with the company. The practice is popular with retailers because it lowers their inventory cost and makes it more attractive to stock the studio's products.Lions Gate, meanwhile, assigns marketing executives to monitor specific retailers, and routinely develops special promotions specific to each chain. Knowing, for example, that K-Mart was interested in attracting more upmarket, female shoppers, the company created an in-store promotion for ""tear-jerker"" films produced by Hallmark.By contrast, offerings for Wal-Mart tend to be more price-focused. ""We spend a lot of time visiting the various retailers, talking to them and finding out what makes them tick,"" Mr Beeks said. Judging by the sales figures, more often than not, it is Dirty Dancing."
904;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-03-31T17:23:37Z;Brussels gives nod for Sony to absorb MGM;;The European Commission on Thursday cleared the $4.8bn takeover of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the last of the big independent Hollywood studios, by a consortium led by Sony.The decision, which had been widely expected, removes the last regulatory obstacle to a deal that will add Hollywood's biggest film catalogue to Sony's media and entertainment empire. MGM owns the rights to some 4,000 movies including the James Bond, Rocky and Pink Panther series.Sony's partners in the transaction are Comcast, the cable television operator, and US equity partners Providence Equity, Texas Pacific Group and DLJ Merchant Banking.The European Union's top regulator said it had examined the takeover's potential impact in detail, but had found no signs it would harm competition. ?The transaction would neither create nor strengthen a dominant position or otherwise impede effective competition,? the Commission said. The deal, which has been cleared by US authorities, will create the biggest film library in the world with some 8,000 movies. That catalogue is expected to add clout to Sony's position in the battle over the next DVD format, in which the Japanese group supports a technology called Blu-ray against the rival HD-DVD format.In addition, Sony has said it will co-finance and produce new films with MGM and distribute MGM's existing film and television content through Sony Pictures' global distribution channels.Sony will also distribute MGM's and its own content through Comcast's network.
905;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Rivals raise stakes in race for Adelphia;;Time Warner and Comcast could face stiffer competition in their efforts to acquire Adelphia if Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Providence Equity Partners, two buy-out groups also bidding for the bankrupt US cable operator, are successful in expanding their consortium.KKR and Providence are in talks with Cablevision Systems about joining their bid for Adelphia whose assets could be worth more than $17bn, according to people familiar with the matter.Time Warner and Comcast have been widely considered frontrunners to buy Adelphia, with an agreement possible in coming weeks.But Cablevision's discussions with KKR and Providence show that the two private equity groups have not given up. A partnership would allow them to offer more for Adelphia than the lower bid on the table.One person involved in the talks said executive-level discussions had taken place between the buy-out groups and Charles Dolan, Cablevision's controlling shareholder and chairman, and his son James Dolan, the chief executive. Cablevision had also been provided access to Adelphia's sensitive financial information.Analysts said the benefits of combining Adelphia and Cablevision's cable assets were not clear. One factor behind the Time Warner and Comcast bid is the ability to cut costs and reduce competition by combining cable systems in key markets. ?A Cablevision/Adelphia combination would deliver none of these synergies,? said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.?The generic synergies associated with programming cost leverage and hardware purchases are significantly more ephemeral,? he said, adding that a Cable-vision/Adelphia with 8m subscribers would still be much smaller and have less clout than Comcast with 21.5m and Time Warner with 10.9m.
906;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-03-21T19:03:01Z;Time Warner settles with SEC;;Time Warner on Monday finalised a $300m settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to accounting abuses at its AOL division, opening the way for the media company to again tap the capital markets.The ability to raise funds in the capital markets could be important if Time Warner's bid to buy Adelphia, the bankrupt operator, is successful. A decision by Adelphia on whether to accept the joint bid submitted by Time Warner and Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, or one from a number of private equity buyers is expected in early April. Time Warner and Comcast are believed to be offering about $17bn in a mixture of cash and shares.The SEC settlement removes the last cloud hanging over Time Warner following its ill-fated takeover by internet company AOL at the height of the dotcom bubble. The settlement had been expected since December, when Time Warner announced a $210m agreement with the Justice Department that would spare it prosecution for the accounting and advertising frauds at AOL.The investigations centred on abuses in AOL's advertising and accounting beginning in 2000, when the internet bubble burst, and shortly after AOL took over Time Warner. Specifically, regulators found that the company committed fraud by inflating its advertising revenue through a series of round-trip deals with other dotcom companies.In its joint bid for Adelphia, Time Warner is believed to be the lead bidder, with Comcast likely to play a supporting role in terms of financing it.Time Warner had already restated its financial results by approximately $500m for the fourth quarter of 2000 through 2002. It has appointed an independent examiner to review its accounts, which is expected to be completed within 180 days.The SEC concluded that AOL failed to consolidate the financial results of its European subsidiary from 2000-2002, allowing it to improve its reported earnings. It noted that AOL improperly recorded as advertising revenue a $400m payment from Bertelsmann, the German media company, related to the sale of its interest in AOL Europe.Three Time Warner employees, including Wayne Pace, chief financial officer, were cited by the SEC for their roles in accounting for a transaction with Bertelsmann. The three neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, and will remain with the company.

But it was a case of too little, too late for US stocks, following a mid-week slide that left the leading indices firmly in the red for a second straight week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose marginally to 10,628.42. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 1,189.22, and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.4 per cent to 2,007.79.For the week, the Dow finished 1.3 per cent lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7 per cent to hit a new low for the year.More than 2.3bn shares changed hands - the businest day of trading so far this year- as four types of futures and options contracts expired on the same day - a phenomenon known as ‘quadruple witching’. Volume also rose ahead of long-anticipated adjustments to the relative weight of companies on the S&P 500 by Standard & Poors.Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak, said that most investors had greeted the planned changes as a non-event. “People have known for weeks that [Standard and Poors] were going to do it,” he said.Wal-Mart and Microsoft, two of the companies most affected by the changes, fell 1.7 per cent and 0.9 per cent on Friday, respectively.Most of the attention on Friday turned to a report showing that consumer confidence fell slightly between February and March.That added to jitters about the rising price of crude oil, which broke through the $57 a barrel mark for the first time, only to settle at $56.30.Yet, in spite of the clouded macroeconomic picture, it was corporate news that led to some of the biggest gains and losses this week.General Motors fell sharply after it warned on profits on Wednesday. The announcement led several debt-rating agencies to add the automaker to their watch-lists for potential downgrades and sent shares down more than 13 per cent. They ended the week down 16.7 per cent at $28.61. Ford, GM’s chief rival, fell 8.1 per cent to $11.39.AIG, the biggest US insurer, ended the week down 7.6 per cent at $59.76 after its chief executive stepped down amid a regulatory probe. The setback prompted Fitch, the credit agency, to strip the insurer of its AAA credit rating.Mergers and acquisitions buzz continued as Qwest made a widely anticipated counterbid for MCI, the telecommunications group being stalked by Verizon. Investors were nonplussed. MCI’s shares fell 2.7 per cent for the week to $23.44. Qwest was unchanged for the week at $3.85, and Verizon fell 2.6 per cent to $35.15.Elsewhere, Viacom, the parent company of the MTV and CBS television networks, rose 7.5 per cent after its chief executive said the company was considering splitting up into at least two separate businesses.Genentech was among the week’s biggest gainers after news that its Avastatin cancer drug helped patients live longer in trials. Shares in the company rose 19.1 per cent for the week.TiVo, the maker of digital television recorders, soared almost 53 per cent to $5.78 over the five-day session after it revealed a contract to provide recording services to Comcast, the biggest US cable operator.Research in Motion, the maker of Blackberry personal communication devices, jumped 37.1 per cent for the week after it settled a long-running patent dispute.Among software makers, Oracle slipped 3.6 per cent for the week after it topped a bid by the German group SAP for control of Retek, a US software rival. Retek shares jumped 9.8 per cent.PanAmSat, the satellite group, fell 3.6 per cent on its first day of trading after its initial public offering. Shares later recovered to end the week down 1.9 per cent at $17.35. PanAmSat is the first of several satellite groups to go public after being acquired by private equity firms last year.Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, rose 0.6 per cent for the week after it reported record first-quarter earnings.Bear Stearns, a rival, slipped 1.3 per cent to $103.33 in spite of record earnings, while Morgan Stanley slipped 1.3 per cent to $57.75.Many analysts had assumed that banks would be hit by rising interest rates in the quarter, but strong equity and bonds markets helped boost performance.

In total, the operating contract is valued at around £1.2bn to Serco over the 35 years.Rab Capital fell 2.4 per cent to 71.25p on profit taking after the hedge fnd manager announced strong full-year results with a 65 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to £17.5m, helped by a 72 per cent increase in assets under management to £1.75bn. Rab said its performance in the first two months of 2005 had significantly exceeded the same period last year and and assets under management had grown strongly since the year-end.KBC Peel Hunt upgraded itsforecast for 2005 pre-tax profits from £21.1m to £28m and said although the shares were not cheap, further fund performance and continuing inflows could take the shares higher.Having run up strongly in anticipation of good news on Thursday, Circle Oil dipped 1.1 per cent to 45p after it was awarded exploration rights in Southwest Oman.
909;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;TiVo shares rocket after Comcast deal signed;;Shares in TiVo soared by 75 per cent on Tuesday after the pioneering digital video recorder company signed a multi-year deal with Comcast, the biggest US cable operator with 21.5m subscribers.Under the deal, TiVo will develop a version of its service, used to find and record television programmes, to be integrated on Comcast's DVR programmes. As well as its navigation system, the deal will develop advertising capabilities for DVRs, which allow viewers to skip through traditional ads.?The opportunity here is for most of the Comcast subscriber base to have TiVo offered to them,? said Tom Rogers, vice-chairman of TiVo. ?Not only will we be receiving fees that come from that kind of roll-out, what is important are the advertising opportunities this creates for the company.?At the close in New York, TiVo shares were up nearly 75 per cent to $6.70. The company's shares had fallen sharply this year amid concerns about TiVo's growth prospects following the decision by DirecTV, the largest satellite operator and its biggest customer, to market its own DVRs.The financial terms of the TiVo/Comcast deal were not revealed, but the assumption is that Comcast will pay TiVo slightly less than DirecTV did. According to analysts at Tradition Asiel Securities, TiVo made about $1.30 per month in revenues per subscriber from DirecTV.Comcast is also believed to be planning to charge its DVR customers, who already pay $10 per month for DVRs, an extra $2-$4 per month for the TiVo service, but the cable operator would not comment on its charging plans. TiVo will be offered to Comcast subscribers from mid-to-late 2006.In a filing, TiVo said the deal was initially for seven years, and that Comcast could renew annually for up to eight years thereafter.Mr Rogers said the advertising technology developed with Comcast could be used by the cable group for all its DVR customers.Capturing advertising revenue in a television viewing environment increasingly dominated by DVRs is a key issue for the media industry. DVRs save shows to a hard drive, allowing viewers to pause live TV, skip ads and record dozens of hours of programming.People familiar with the transaction said DirecTV would be taken by surprise by the Comcast deal.It is the first time TiVo capabilities will be available to cable customers.
910;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-03-09T18:54:12Z;Chances rise of cable sale to fund Voom;;Cablevision's shares rose on Wednesday on growing expectations that the company's cable assets will be sold by its founder, Charles Dolan, to finance the loss-making Voom satellite service.Mr Dolan, known as Chuck, last week replaced board members who had sided with his son James in opposing plans for the Voom business. James Dolan wants to shut the operation down, while Mr Dolan and another son, Thomas, the company's chief information officer, want to keep it going.Mr Dolan is regarded by cable industry executives as ?a seller? of the cable network. James Dolan, who has a particular interest in the company's sports businesses, is believed to want to wait until the cable assets are potentially more valuable.Time Warner and Comcast are seen as potential buyers of Cablevision, with the New York subscriber base one of the most prized in the US. Private equity investors, who are also eyeing Cox Communications assets and this week bought a stake in a smaller cable operator, might also be interested. ?Chuck Dolan is still dead serious about Voom and has a new board that will let him acquire it,? said Richard Greenfield, analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. ?Assuming he acquires Voom privately, he will need to sell Cablevision to fund Voom.?Cablevision's new board on Tuesday agreed to operate the Voom satellite-TV service until the end of March, giving Mr Dolan until then to find a way of buying the business.The move follows Mr Dolan's ousting of directors who vetoed his Voom plans and who had decided to shut down Voom. Mr Dolan sees great potential in the high-definition television it specialises in. Some shareholders have filed suits following these moves, as Mr Dolan's seizing of board control raises corporate governance questions. The board announced it would ?work co-operatively to finalise the separation? from Cablevision of the Voom business.The new board includes cable industry veteran and dealmaker John Malone, and other media transaction experts. Cablevision in December cancelled plans to spin off Voom and agreed to sell its main satellite to EchoStar Communications for $200m. The status of this transaction does not appear to have changed, although Mr Dolan may be having discussions with EchoStar about Voom's future.?It is likely the Voom service is only feasible with continued access to the Rainbow I satellite (sold to EchoStar),? said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. ?The range of solutions includes buying the satellite back from EchoStar, leasing capacity from EchoStar once it has bought the satellite, or a joint venture between the companies.?Neither Cablevision nor EchoStar were available for comment. At midday in New York on Wednesday, Cablevision shares were up nearly 3 per cent at $29.46.

Potential buyers of its cable business include Time Warner and Comcast.Cablevision shares fell nearly 5 per cent on Thursday, to $28.75. The company owns a number of assets, including about 3m cable subscribers in the New York area, and cable stations in the New York region, run under its Rainbow Media group. Last month, Cablevision unwound a joint venture with News Corp and it now has full ownership of the Madison Square Garden sports venue.One of the new board members is John Malone, who runs Liberty Media. Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS, said it was important to watch the implications of this appointment ?in light of Mr Malone's recently acquired voting stake in News Corp, with a potential interest in the Rainbow cable network assets?.Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday announced an informal investigation into Cablevision share trading.It has requested information related to disclosures the company made on December 21, 2004 and January 20, 2005 about the suspension of a planned spin-off of Rainbow Media Enterprises and the agreement to sell part of its satellite assets to EchoStar Communications.
912;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-03-02T20:35:39Z;Film and TV may stream out of the industry’s control;;"For years, the financial health of the world's leading media companies was defined by one mantra: ""Content is king."" That belief last year prompted Comcast, the largest cable television company in the US, to consider a $60bn hostile bid for Walt Disney. Further back, the same belief was behind Vivendi's debt-fuelled expansion into Hollywood as well as many of Rupert Murdoch's television investments.Technology is now threatening to change that balance of power, and new digital systems are handing more influence to distributors. The struggle has already wounded the music industry, which is losing an estimated $2.4bn a year in lost sales to online piracy on top of $4.5bn in losses to illegal CD copying. The new generation of distributors, from Apple's iTunes business to Napster's subscription business, are growing quickly: by contrast traditional content providers, the music labels, have suffered years of sales decline.Now it is the turn of the video entertainment industry - studios, broadcast networks, satellite and cable distributors and programme makers - to embrace new distribution models or face the consequences.Digital or personal video recorders give pay-TV subscribers a database of programming to watch at the time of their choice, rather than according to the broadcaster's schedule. Future systems could allow viewers to store films or shows on a hard drive, transforming the television set into a hybrid PC console. Old analogue television transmissions are being replaced by multi-channel digital services, some of them new high-definition (HD) services.On top of that, internet and software companies are threatening both content and distribution groups with a further shake-up. High-speed internet access or broadband ""pipes"" will allow films or television programmes to be sent quickly and reliably via the internet. Television sets with the storage capacity of personal computers may in time become the main household viewing device.At this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, told media executives: ""Satellite is toast,"" according one delegate. ""Bill's point was that personal video recorders and pay-per-view were all last-gasp steps,"" recalls another executive at the conference session. ""The future is about streaming video over the internet, wirelessly or over fibre lines to the home.""Andy Duncan, chief executive of Britain's Channel 4, sums up the shift: ""We are moving from a push system, where the broadcaster [or studios] decided what you could watch and when, to a pull system where viewers choose what to view, how, and where and when.""The transition has big implications for broadcasters and studios, previously largely the masters of their own schedules or box office releases, and for distributors - mainly cable and satellite TV groups. Traditional rental outlets such as Blockbuster also face a challenge to their business model, which may be rendered irrelevant by easily obtainable video downloads from the internet.Industry executives are debating these challenges fiercely - next week the Financial Times is hosting a London conference on the future of digital media - but with little or no agreement on which technology will triumph. In theory, providers of content should benefit from higher demand for their products as outlets and services multiply. But the distributors, among them powerful companies such as Comcast or British Sky Broadcasting of the UK, are less willing to pay a premium for content when they are shouldering the investment burden for developing new systems and ways to market.The worst case scenario may be that, once a production or show is available on the internet, both content providers and distributors will lose control of its availability and the revenue stream that goes with it. The Motion Picture Association of America has already warned of damaging losses and launched prosecutions against online pirates.In response, studios, programme- makers and existing distributors hope to give consumers compelling systems that will protect legitimate viewing - either at the box office or through DVD sales or pay-per-view models.But these efforts have been marked by a lack of unity, internal competition and differing motives.For companies such as EchoStar or Time Warner Cable, new technology holds out the prospect of reducing ""churn"" - the rate at which existing customers drop their subscriptions. The two groups are experimenting with new digital storage systems, including personal video recorders that can skip advertisements, in the belief that these are compelling marketing tools for winning subscribers.However, traditional broadcast networks care more about advertising than they do about subscription revenues. Devices that allow consumers to skip advertising may encourage advertisers to abandon the networks, depriving them of an important source of revenue. ""As PVRs put advertising revenue under increasing pressure, the [big advertising] conglomerates are likely to look for alternative advertising vehicles, turning their attention to product placement in movies, TV shows and video games,"" according to analysts at Oppenheimer, an investment boutique in New York.Given the intense competition for subscribers, distributors also want to cut costs. That poses another threat to the content companies. Comcast, which spends $4bn a year on programmes, does not want to increase that bill in spite of planning to provide thousands of hours of on-demand shows to its subscribers. It wants to be able to use content it has bought in different ways - so-called repurposing. ""We are asking programmers to provide us with some repurposing rights at no additional charge,"" says Steve Burke, Comcast's chief operating officer.The content companies, meanwhile, are more interested in having customers buy their products - DVDs - for good. In recent years film studios have come to rely on DVDs as the bedrock of their revenues. Today, sales from DVDs are more than twice as large as box office receipts, helping to finance new productions and underpinning studio profits. The chief executive of one Hollywood studio says: ""We like selling movies better than renting them or pay-per-view; it's better margins. We're not interested in cutting prices, we want our fair share.""Trying to maintain customer interest and create a new source of income, consumer electronics groups and studios are developing superior, high- definition DVDs. The hope is that customers will replace their old video libraries in the same way they abandoned video cassettes. That should spur demand for new high-definition equipment (see below). New encryption systems also make high-definition discs far harder to copy, reducing the threat of piracy. Already, most of the more expensive television sets on the market are HD-enabled. Cable channels such as ESPN and Discovery are already broadcasting in high definition.But development of DVD technology is hampered by the fact that two rival groups have emerged to promote the format. Battle will be joined later this year when both camps launch their products.On the one hand, Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics group, is supporting so-called Blu-Ray technology that allows for the recording and playing of high-definition content. It is backed by JVC, Panasonic, Samsung, computer groups Dell and Hewlett-Packard, and film studios such as Walt Disney and Sony's Columbia Tristar group. However a rival group, led by Toshiba and NEC and supported by Paramount, NBC Universal, Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema, claims that its format - known simply as HD-DVD - will be cheaper and easier to manufacture. d4 Analysts warn that a long ""format war"" between Blu-Ray and HD-DVD could do serious damage. Van Baker of Gartner, the US research group, says: ""I really don't think we are going to see significant penetration of high-definition DVD players as long as the format wars are going on. The studios are keeping their options open because they won't distribute in both formats.""One advantage for Blu-Ray may be that its greater storage capacity allows more interactive gaming possibilities that will appeal to video game developers such as Electronic Arts. Mr Baker adds: ""If EA, Activision and Take Two are all lined up behind one format or another, it's unlikely that Microsoft would disagree and if hardware makers go with Blu-Ray, it will be hard for HD-DVD to win broad acceptance.""At the moment there is a timing advantage for the high-definition technologies and the media groups behind them. Broadband penetration remains far from universal. It takes far longer to download a film, particularly in a high definition format, than it does a song. While there are 800m music files or tracks available illegally on the internet, the film piracy problem remains much smaller.Yet some media and technology executives, Mr Gates among them, believe that storing video on bits of plastic - even in high definition - is not the way of the future. They argue that ""early adopting"" consumers are already downloading movies, and that this will certainly become a long-term challenge to DVDs and other physical media.Cable companies are eyeing this market by offering ""video-on-demand"" services. At Comcast, Mr Burke says video-on-demand allows content providers to sell the proposition of shows that do contain advertising - unlike PVRs. He argues that higher usage of video-on-demand will increase the popularity of a show and allow programmers to negotiate higher fees in the future.""Programmers will realise people will start to . . . watch programmes when they want them,"" he adds.So far content providers are not supporting any one technology to the exclusion of others. Rather than be tied to one format they want to exploit them all. NBC Universal, for example, has no distribution infrastructure of its own but hopes to make an additional $400m in the next three years by selling material to new platforms such as mobile phones.NBC's reluctance to advocate any single distribution model as the industry winner reflects the continued fragmentation of media consumption. Rather than cannibalise each other, there will probably be room for high-definition DVDs, video-on-demand, personal video recorders and downloading. But very few media companies are sufficiently vertically integrated to exploit them all.Even News Corp, the most broadly based group, admits it is lagging behind when it comes to making use of the internet. Mr Murdoch, its chairman, recently summoned his top executives from studios, pay-TV, newspapers and broadcast networks to explore new ways to harness the web. Those executives have seen the potential of the pull-system among consumers who want to chose their own programming.It is not just the US market that is developing. In Britain existing pay-TV operators are being challenged by small rivals such as HomeChoice, the on-demand service owned by Video Networks. Roger Lynch, Video Networks' chief executive, says: ""People are coming to us because they can personalise their television - there are 80 channels we offer of video-on-demand and you can create your own playlist.""In Japan, J-Com, the country's leading cable group, is also offering pay-per-view for categories such as pornography channels and a monthly subscription model for video-on-demand, mainly used for films and children's programming. The company, due to come to the market this year in an initial public offering, is also promoting high-definition channels for those consumers willing to pay the premium.Anything that increases overall entertainment sales should be a cause for celebration for the video industry. For the immediate future, DVDs are likely to be the biggest driver of revenues, while video-on-demand may lend itself to niche programming. High- definition services may also take time to roll out.Jeff Bewkes, chairman of the entertainment and networks group at Time Warner, is one of the few executives able to take a bet on all the options. Time Warner is exposed to high-definition services and video-on-demand through its cable division; it has America Online in the internet market; and the Warner Bros studio benefiting from the DVD market.But Mr Bewkes knows that it may not be his or any other company that can give the final verdict on which technologies will win. ""The consumer decides how they want to watch,"" he says. ""And we will follow what the consumer wants.""Hardware for the wired worldFor content owners, the advent of online video downloading is a daunting development. But the companies that make the hardware needed to enjoy such content at home see it as an important opportunity to build new markets.Existing televisions and DVD recorders are not equipped to handle online video downloads. If and when such services become a commercial reality, consumers will have to buy new equipment.Some manufacturers are taking tentative steps to prepare. Toshiba, for example, has developed a DVD recorder that can be used with digital TV sets to download and store online video. Last December the group joined Tokyo Electric Power, the world’s largest private utility, and its telecommunications affiliate, PoweredCom, to launch a trial video downloading service. The system works by downloading video content through existing TV sets and recording it directly to disc using Toshiba’s new DVD recorder.Matsushita, the consumer electronics group, has taken a different approach. Although the company does not yet have a TV equipped to download online video, it has incorporated a feature in its digital TVs that allows users to access websites using its free T-navi Portal Service. Other manufacturers, including JVC, Hitachi and Pioneer, also offer this feature on some of their TVs.There are no commercial video downloading services available on T-navi yet but Matsushita says that, when such services become available, it would be relatively easy to develop a TV capable of downloading video by incorporating a central processing unit.Sony, meanwhile, expects home servers using the Cell semiconductor it is developing with Toshiba and IBM to play an important role in downloading video content. Such servers would be hooked up to a range of terminals, including the TV, enabling users to download not only videos but also games and other material in different parts of the home.Aside from these early moves, electronics manufacturers are not rushing to develop products capable of video downloading since such services are not expected to become widespread for several years. In the meantime, they expect high-definition TV to spur demand for the next generation of DVD players. The superior quality of HDTV compared with video content downloaded using current technology means the two are not expected to compete in the short to medium term.“There is a big difference between downloading a two-minute song and a movie. It is unlikely that people are going to be willing to accept the significant deterioration in quality that results from downloading video,” says a Sony official.Next-generation recording formats such as Blu-Ray and HD-DVD will add more of the extras that have proved popular with consumers of DVDs, and will also differentiate packaged media from video-on-demand services, the official notes."
913;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Cablevision to close Voom HDTV service;;Cablevision Systems Corp will close down its Voom high-definition television service after it failed to agree a sale to Charles Dolan, Cablevision's founder.In a statement released late on Monday, the company said discussions had ended without reaching agreement of the business, assets and liabilities not included in Cablevision's agreement to sell its Voom satellite business to EchoStar in January.?As a result, Cablevision will close down the Voom business,? it said.Shares of Cablevision have risen sharply in recent weeks, rising 4 per cent on Monday alone, on speculation that Mr Dolan might be willing to sell its cable assets to finance his purchase of the Voom service.Cablevision is concentrated in the New York area, and its subscriber would be highly prized by cable companies Time Warner and Comcast.Voom is estimated to have lost about $300m in 2004, not including $100m in capital expenditure.
914;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
915;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Billionaires scoop up shares in cable groups;;When Warren Buffett and George Soros, the billionaire fund managers, reveal big investments in the same sector on the same day, Wall Street takes notice.Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group last week doubled its stake in Comcast, the biggest US cable provider, bringing its holding to 10m shares worth about $328m. The same day, Mr Soros bought $50m in shares in Comcast’s chief rival, Time Warner.The investments come at a time of rapid technological convergence in the telecommunications sector, with new technologies such as broadband and internet telephony pitting cable companies and telecoms groups in a pitchedbattle for each other’s business.Cable groups such as Time Warner and Comcast have moved aggressively to capture market share in the long-distance telephone market. Meanwhile, telecoms groups such as SBC Communications have picked up the gauntlet, investing billions in an effort to offer television and video content alongside high-speed internet and long-distance services.And although some observers may be tempted to view Mr Buffett’s and Mr Soros’s investments as a ringing endorsement of the cable companies’ prospects, bearish voices warn that the struggle over America’s phone lines and television sets is far from over.Shares in cable and telecoms groups have met with mixed fortunes during the past year. The S&P 500’s Broadcasting and Cable Television index fell more than 25 per cent during the first nine months of 2004, while telecoms stocks rose slightly over the period. Although both sectors benefited from the rally that lifted the US stock market in late October and early November, Cable ended the year about 14 per cent lower than it started, while the S&P 500 telecommunications index posted a modest gain.Since the new year, things have changed. Shares in cable groups remained steady as the market came down off its peak in January. But telecoms shares have fallen sharply in spite of a wave of merger and acquisition activity across the sector.Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, says that investor caution over telecoms is justified. “It’s impossible not to scratch your head about a business strategy where you are a late entrant into a mature market and you are starting at a cost disadvantage,” he says.One problem is that telecoms groups must pay to carry television content, some of which is already owned by their cable competitors, such as Time Warner.Cable groups, on the other hand, are moving into a market where margins are higher and where voice-over-internet technology offers them a price advantage.Still, the cable companies are far from in the clear. They remain a favourite sector of bearish hedge funds who feel the group still faces the risk of “disintermediation”, or removal of the middle man. Cable companies’ advantage has long been beingthe “pipe” that delivers content into the home, But with content being increasingly delivered over the internet but as internet delivery increases, the need for the “pipe” lessens.While a content-rich cable provider such as Time Warner may adapt in this environment, Comcast and others with less-abundant content may suffer.
916;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-02-14T22:01:56Z;AOL seeks cable partners to lift sales;;America Online, the internet subsidiary of Time Warner, is in talks with several leading cable groups, including Comcast, about partnerships aimed at boosting subscriber and audience numbers.AOL, which is rolling out its first such alliance with sister company Time Warner Cable, hopes similar deals will secure more broadband customers.The initiative follows AOL's decision to move away from a subscription-only narrowband model to a mixture of broadband, advertising-led and free-access portal system.US regulations do not oblige incumbent telecommunications companies to offer lines or access infrastructure to internet service providers at wholesale prices forcing companies such as AOL to seek partnerships with cable operators to sell bundled services.Jon Miller, chief executive, said AOL was in talks with several possible partners including Comcast, the largest US cable operator. ?We have a number of ongoing discussions with Comcast,? he added. ?There's a lot of goodwill to see if something can be done.?The cable operators selling such bundled internet services benefit by gaining access to the existing subscribers of companies such as AOL. Time Warner Cable will be AOL's partner in areas it operates, but that only covers 15 per cent of the US. In the other 85 per cent, AOL is seeking other deals.AOL's advertising revenues topped $1bn in 2004 but this is a part of its business in which Time Warner expects strong growth.Expectations for 2005 are fairly modest, with the company predicting advertising revenue growth in line with the online industry. Don Logan, chairman of Time Warner's media and communications group, said the 2005 expectations reflect the changes still going on at AOL.?The plans are finished and nailed down,? Mr Logan said. ?Advertising will start really ramping up but we are not yet sure how long it will take.?Whether or not Time Warner can revamp AOL has been a question hanging over the media company's share price. AOL acquired Time Warner at the height of the internet bubble and the merged company has been struggling to justify the move ever since.AOL and Time Warner Cable, the second-largest US cable operator with just under 11m subscribers, outlined a plan to join forces in January.
917;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-02-13T19:49:33Z;Video clips help lonely hearts;;Those looking for love, or just a bit of fun, no longer need to worry whether the person they find on a website looks like their accompanying photograph. Lonely hearts in the US can now switch on their televisions and check out video clips of potential partners.This “dating on demand” service, introduced as a “fun” addition to video-on-demand content by Comcast in Philadelphia six months ago, has proved so popular during trials that the biggest US cable operator is today, Valentine's Day, rolling this service out to all its 22m subscribers.“With dating on demand, viewers can see the real person: how they speak, learn what they're interested in and what they're looking for in a date,” said Page Thompson, general manager of Comcast's on-demand service.It is the latest example of seemingly insatiable demand for match-making services. The market for online dating has grown to about $550m per year in North America, with about $300m spent by consumers on these services in the rest of the world. However, 75 per cent of growth in the next three years is expected to be outside North America.So far, most of the dating is done after looking at photos and reading profiles of potential candidates. Match.com, the world's leading online dating service which is owned by IAC/ InterActiveCorp, had considered adding video to its dating services but decided not to after trials last year.Comcast does not make any money out of its dating service. The content is free for subscribers of its video-on-demand services and is part of the company's drive to improve its content to differentiate it from that offered by rivals.
918;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-02-10T21:13:51Z;Cable companies win regulatory victory;;Cable companies on Thursday celebrated a significant regulatory victory after the lead US media watchdog ruled that groups like Comcast and Time Warner would not be forced to carry more than one digital programme from any single broadcaster.The Federal Communications Commission decision represents a blow to commercial broadcasters, which will in effect be forced to negotiate with the cable companies to have their secondary channels aired rather than being guaranteed the right to have the channels broadcast.However, the FCC's decision does not signify the end of the dispute between broadcasters and cable operators.Edward Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, on Thursday vowed to take the matter to an appeals court and to Congress, cautioning that ?in Washington, there are no final victories and no final defeats?.The dispute is centred around advances in digital technology that enable the broadcasters to split what once was one channel, and divide it into as many as six.Such technology could allow a local Denver broadcaster to develop a handful of new channels that could compete with cable-owned channels like CNN.But the FCC's decision gives cable operators the right to refuse the broadcasters' non-primary channels, thereby curtailing potential competitors.Critics on Thursday said the FCC's decision represented a death knell for the future of broadcasters because it stripped away incentives to develop quality programming.Michael Powell, FCC chairman, defended his decision, saying it would have been ?wholly improper? for the FCC to expand so-called ?must-carry? rights without a clearer directive from Congress. He added broadcasters remained at liberty to commercially negotiate for carriage.?Broadcasters provide a valuable service to the American people …but it simply is not the case, in our judgment, that an expansion of carriage rights is necessary for their survival,? he said.Broadcasters may still, however, have leverage in Congress to tip the scales in their favour.David Kaut, a regulatory analyst at Legg Mason, said broadcasters could demand more multi-carry rights as a condition for selecting a definite date for the switch from analogue to digital services.
919;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-02-04T17:36:08Z;On Wall Street: Buyback danger;;Buyers of America's corporate debt have had an easy ride over the past few years.After taking on too much debt in the late 1990s, companies have spent the early years of this century getting rid of it. As a result, corporate credit quality has improved, bond prices have risen and debt holders no longer have to lie awake at night worrying if their investments are going to implode suddenly in an unexpected debt default.Still, this seemingly benign climate belies hidden dangers: the risk that companies, having pacified bondholders, start switching their attention to shareholders.Increasingly, this is what American companies are doing. Last month Viacom's chief executive, Sumner Redstone, jolted analysts when he told a conference the company was considering accepting a lower debt rating and increasing its leverage. Mr Sumner is worried about the relatively low price of Viacom's stock, which has traded below $40 for much of the past year after hitting more than $70 in August 2000, and he wants the company to raise money so that it can boost its share price, either by increasing its equity buybacks or making acquisitions.Analysts have taken Mr Sumner's comments seriously. Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings immediately put Viacom's A3 investment-grade debt rating on review for downgrade, while analysts at bond research firm Gimme Credit recommended investors swap out of Viacom debt into more “attractive” credits like Comcast, Cox or Time Warner. “Viacom has made it clear that it is not likely to be bondholder-friendly in the near future,” says Dave Novosel, a Gimme Credit analyst. Bond fund managers are becoming concerned that other companies are thinking along the same lines, particularly since the S&P 500 Index is down 2 per cent in the year to date.Equity buybacks are running at their highest levels since the late 1990s. Last year $269bn of buybacks were undertaken compared with $322bn in 1997, according to Dealogic. So far this year there have been $37bn worth of buybacks a fairly heady pace if annualised over the year.Some worry that the buybacks can be inappropriate, arguing that some companies do not have enough cash on their balance sheets to justify undertaking them and are doing it to “goose” their stock prices.Vincent Boberski, managing director of fixed income research at RBC Dain Rauscher, says banks and brokerages including Citigroup and American Express as well as utility companies are among the worst offenders for buybacks that are unwarranted.Others say it is hard to gauge in the short term whether a stock buyback is a good decision, and what matters is the expected rate of return. James Paulsen, chief strategist at Wells Capital Management, says there has been a cultural shift and it is more acceptable today for companies to return money to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and equity buybacks.In the late 1990s, when the investment culture focused on future growth opportunities, companies would be penalised for raising dividends, Mr Paulsen says. “It was an admission that there was no potential for growth.” Today, he adds, investment is often seen as a risky use of capital.But while equity investors may reap the rewards from buybacks, it is clear they are taking a toll on bondholders. There were 44 credit ratings downgrades related to shareholder payments last year, a record that was last equalled in 2000, according to Moody's. There have been six such downgrades in 2005.Meanwhile, the resurgence in M&A activity is hurting some debt investors. Investment-grade companies involved in M&A deals are more likely to have their ratings downgraded than upgraded, according to John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's. The retailer Sears is expected to lose its investment grade status when it completes its merger with Kmart in March. For the time being, companies can afford to accept a lower credit rating because financial markets are liquid and credit spreads are tight, making selling debt relatively cheap.They do, however, take the risk of running into difficulty if liquidity deteriorates and it becomes harder to raise money and make debt payments. Bondholders may then find they are once again in the unpleasant position of worrying about debt defaults.

James Paulsen, chief strategist at Wells Capital Management, says there has been a cultural shift and it is more acceptable today for companies to return money to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and equity buybacks.In the late 1990s, when the investment culture focused on future growth opportunities, companies would be penalised for raising dividends, Mr Paulsen says. “It was an admission that there was no potential for growth.” Today, he adds, investment is often seen as a risky use of capital.But while equity investors may reap the rewards from buybacks, it is clear they are taking a toll on bondholders. There were 44 credit ratings downgrades related to shareholder payments last year, a record that was last equalled in 2000, according to Moody's. There have been six such downgrades in 2005.Meanwhile, the resurgence in M&A activity is hurting some debt investors. Investment-grade companies involved in M&A deals are more likely to have their ratings downgraded than upgraded, according to John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's. The retailer Sears is expected to lose its investment grade status when it completes its merger with Kmart in March. For the time being, companies can afford to accept a lower credit rating because financial markets are liquid and credit spreads are tight, making selling debt relatively cheap.They do, however, take the risk of running into difficulty if liquidity deteriorates and it becomes harder to raise money and make debt payments. Bondholders may then find they are once again in the unpleasant position of worrying about debt defaults.jenny.wiggins@ft.com
921;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Time Warner, Comcast split bid;;Time Warner and Comcast's joint $17bn bid for bankrupt Adelphia's cable assets is expected to be financed mostly by Time Warner, say people involved in the bid process, with a 75:25 per cent split seen as likely.The bid, submitted on Monday, is believed to have offered Adelphia's creditors a combination of cash and shares in a new cable company following a reverse merger of Time Warner Cable into Adelphia. Neither Time Warner nor Comcast would comment on the terms of the bid.Comcast's cash contribution is expected to be less than $2bn, people familiar with the bid said.The 75:25 split reflects the 21 per cent of Time Warner Cable owned by Comcast, the largest US cable operator. This stake would be expected to be merged into a new company if the bid succeeds, a tax efficient way for Comcast to get rid of it.?We see Time Warner as the lead bidder and Comcast as a beneficiary of tax-free unwinding of the Time Warner Cable partnership,? said Niraj Gupta, analyst at Citigroup. He did not expect Comcast to pay more than $1bn to $2bn in cash for its share in Adelphia.The two cable companies are regarded as frontrunners to acquire the assets of the bankrupt US cable operator. In the auction, the two US media giants will face competition from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Providence Equity Partners, two US private equity groups, which also joined forces to bid for Adelphia. It is expected to take a number of weeks before it becomes clear which bid Adelphia will favour.
922;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-01-31T04:26:02Z;KKR and Providence to mount bid for Adelphia;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Providence Equity Partners, the US private equity groups, are planning to make a joint bid for all of Adelphia, the bankrupt cable company.The move, if successful, would represent the largest leveraged buy-out for 16 years. Adelphia, whose creditors say should be sold for at least $17.5bn, set a deadline of Monday for offers, either for the whole company or for each of seven clusters of assets.Time Warner and Comcast, the two US cable giants, are also expected to put forward a joint bid for the whole company - and are seen as the frontrunners to eventually clinch a deal.But the decision by KKR and Providence to press ahead with their own plans to bid for all of Adelphia could dash hopes at Time Warner and Comcast that they might face no competition in the auction.Because of the size and complexity of the offer, KKR and Providence did not make any firm decision whether to bid for the whole company until very recently, according to people familiar with the matter.Even on Sunday, the insiders cautioned, the situation surrounding the KKR/Providence bid was ?very fluid, more so than in normal auctions?. A successful acquisition by the two private equity groups would be the largest leveraged buy-out since KKR bought RJR Nabisco in 1989.The two companies worked together last year to become part owners of PanAmSat, the satellite operator that is already considering an initial public offering. JPMorgan Partners, the private equity arm of the US investment bank, was considering joining KKR and Providence in their bid for Adelphia, but ultimately decided not to participate.A host of other private equity groups and cable entrepreneurs are separately expected to place bids for parts of Adelphia?s assets, which stretch from Los Angeles to Pennsylvania and New York.Comcast is the largest US cable operator, with 22m subscribers. Time Warner wants to increase the size of its cable business. It is the second-largest cable operator, with 11m subscribers, but behind satellite operator DirecTV, which has 13.5m customers.The rivals have joined forces on the Adelphia bid as a tax-efficient way of unwinding Comcast?s 21 per cent stake in Time Warner Cable. Comcast which gained the stake while making acquisitions has to dispose of it for regulatory reasons by the end of 2007.KKR, Providence and JPMorgan Partners all declined to comment on Sunday night.
923;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-01-25T23:24:47Z;Rivals team up for Adelphia bid;;Comcast and Time Warner are planning to submit only a joint bid for all of Adelphia's cable assets after ruling out separate bids for other parts of the company's network.Bids for Adelphia the fifth-largest US cable company, which collapsed into bankruptcy in one of America's biggest corporate scandals are due next Monday. Creditors have set a minimum price tag of $17.5bn, making its sale potentially one of the biggest transactions to take place this quarter. People who are familiar with the auction indicated that Comcast and Time Warner concluded recently that it would not make sense for them to make separate bids for parts of Adelphia's assets, as this could undermine their chances of winning the whole company.?They are betting that the company would rather sell the whole thing,? said one person involved in the process.In putting forward a joint bid, Comcast and Time Warner are likely to face competition from private equity firms and cable entrepreneurs. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Providence Equity Partners and JPMorgan Partners have been exploring a bid for parts of the business, as well as a joint bid for all of Adelphia. However, the size of such an offer means it is not at all clear whether one will be made.The most likely scenario is that Comcast and Time Warner will be competing against a combination of separate bids for each of the seven ?clusters? of assets into which Adelphia was split last year. If they were outbid, the two cable giants would probably be offered a second chance to purchase some of the assets they are most interested in. ?If the difference is small, it is hard to imagine that they wouldn't get another bite at the apple,? said one person close to the situation.Comcast is the largest US cable operator, with 22m subscribers. Time Warner wants to increase the size of its cable business. It is the second-largest cable operator, with 11m subscribers, but behind satellite operator DirecTV, which has 13.5m customers.The rivals have joined forces on the Adelphia bid as a tax-efficient way of unwinding Comcast's 21 per cent stake in Time Warner Cable. Comcast, which gained the stake following acquisitions, has to dispose of it for regulatory reasons by the end of 2007. Adelphia's assets, which stretch from California to Pennsylvania and New York, are potentially attractive to many groups. Comcast, for example, could get its hands on the lucrative Los Angeles market, while Time Warner could consolidate its position on the East Coast.Adelphia declined to comment, as did representatives of each of the potential bidders.
924;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-01-18T18:59:37Z;New blow for Charter as chief executive quits;;Charter Communications on Tuesday announced the departure of Carl Vogel, its chief executive, in the latest resignation from the debt-burdened US cable operator.Charter's $18.5bn in debt has restricted its ability to upgrade cable systems and deploy new services to stem customer defections to rival TV operators including Rupert Murdoch's DirectTV.As a result, Charter, which has about 6.3m subscribers, has lost customers in 10 of its last 11 quarters, including 58,600 in the third quarter of 2004. Last year, it slipped to fourth among US cable operators, behind Comcast, Time Warner and Cox. Charter named Robert May, a non-executive director and chairman of HealthSouth, the US health company, as interim chief executive. Mr Vogel is standing down ?by mutual agreement?.Industry analysts blamed his departure on differences with Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft and Charter's chairman and majority shareholder, over reducing indebtedness.Richard Greenfield, of Fulcrum Global Partners in New York, warned of more resignations following Mr Vogel's abrupt departure. ?We believe other executive contracts stipulate that if Mr Vogel leaves the company, it facilitates their ability to leave as well.? The company made no comment on the terms of Mr Vogel's departure or likely compensation. The chief executive had a contract that was due to expire at the end of 2005.Shares in Charter yesterday fell more than 6 per cent to close at $1.92 on concerns at the executive changes. Last year, the shares declined about 48 per cent.The shake-up comes nine months after Charter admitted it had overstated its revenue and cashflow for 2000, 2001 and the first nine months of 2003 prompting a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Mr Vogel had been chief executive and president since October 2001. Mr May is expected to lead the company until a permanent successor is found.
925;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Uncertainty reigns over Adelphia;;The auction of Adelphia, the US's fifth-largest cable company, which collapsed into bankruptcy, is entering a crucial phase as its bankers wait to see if expressions of interest can be turned into hard cash.By the end of this month, bids for the assets will have to be submitted to Adelphia's bankers at UBS and Allen & Company, who are hoping to wrap up what would be one of the biggest deals of the year by the end of the first quarter.Nominally, the level of interest shown in the first stages of the auction has been strong. More than 50 potential bidders have signed confidentiality agreements allowing them to access Adelphia's financial information.Time Warner and Comcast are expected to table a joint offer, while private equity groups and cable entrepreneurs have also signed up.However, some on Wall Street are voicing doubts about how much of thiscuriosity will actually translate into bids that will value Adelphia at more than $17.5bn, the minimum price tag set by the cable group's creditors.People involved in theprocess, including media bankers and others working for potential bidders, are warning that there is no guarantee that the assets will end up being sold,either in parts, or asa whole.A number of analysts have also expressed scepticism recently.?If that [$17.5bn] reallyis a floor, it will be challenging to meet that,? says Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. ?The price looks too expensive for any private equity firms to pay andstill generate a return of20 per cent.?And he adds: ?For the operators Comcast and Time Warner it may also be difficult to persuadetheir shareholders they should pay such a premium, although the potential for synergies from operational improvements might still make a bid from thempossible.?If the bids come in below the threshold, Adelphia will remain a stand-alone company under a reorganisation plan drawn up by Lazard, the investment bank.To be sure, Adelphia's assets, which stretch from California to Pennsylvania and New York, are potentially attractive to many players. Comcast, for example, could get its hands on the lucrative Los Angeles market, while Time Warner could consolidate its position on the East Coast.But a growing number of industry sources are questioning whether the two media giants would be wasting their time chasing assets that are losing value.?Content and programming are becoming increasingly valuable as distribution outlets proliferate ina digital world with distribution, in turn, facing increased competition and the risk of being commoditised over time,? says Richard Greenfield, analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners in a research note.?Unless there is a critical market to acquire, we failto see the need or benefitsto expand in distribution,? he adds.Mr Greenfield goes as far as saying that Time Warner should ?walk away? from the auction, ?a view we believe is supported by many of [Time Warner's] shareholders?.The health of the auction not only depends on Time Warner and Comcast, however. Last year, Adelphia's bankers painstakingly divided the properties into seven separate geographical clusters a blueprint forthe company to be soldin parts.The move was aimed at stoking the interest of private equity groups such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Providence Equity Partners and a private equity unit of JPMorgan Chase, as well as small cable entrepreneurs.In recent weeks, these firms have been scurrying around trying to determine what portions of the business to bid for, or even to see if there was a way to purchase the whole company, in what would be the largest leveraged buy-out since the 1989 purchase by KKR of RJR Nabisco.But there, too, uncertainty reigns. One person familiar with the matter said two private equity groups that had been considering bids recently dropped out of the auction, ?after realising they could not get a bargain?.
926;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-01-11T20:41:59Z;Europe's well-trodden path to convergence;;"Comcast's announcement this week that it is to offer telephone services to its customers signals that the US sector is starting to catch up with European cable operators that have pursued a ""triple play"" strategy of combining voice, data and television services for several years.The packages provided by NTL and Telewest in the UK and UPC in the Netherlands may not use VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) telephony, but they have proved that there is a market for bundled services.If cable companies are making the early running in triple play - Telewest has 431,290 customers buying all three services from it - telecommunications carriers and internet service providers are beginning to make their presence felt across Europe.Wanadoo, France Telecom's pan-European ISP, illustrates the ambitions of carriers and service providers. Marc Overton, Wanadoo's managing director of strategy, products and services in the UK, says that the ISP even wants to move beyond triple play and offer a multitude of services through one ""unified user interface"".""What we are looking at is multi-play, to provide image, voice, mobile telephony, integrated communications, e-mail and messenger as well as the more standard services,"" he says.In France, Wanadoo offers a package of high-speed broadband, voice and pay television provided by Maligne TV, all piped through France Telecom's ADSL connection. In the UK, where Wanadoo has similar ambitions but where market penetration of pay-television offerings from satellite and cable operators is already high, it is looking to add VoIP telephony to its internet package as a ""first step on the ladder"".The European company most often used as an example of triple play's potential is Fastweb, the Italian broadband provider.By the end of September 2004 Fastweb had accumulated 161,350 broadband television subscribers - many lured by the prospect of live football - from a total customer base of 389,000. It also has very high average revenues per user [ARPU] of €903 per year, with television customers spending €345 per year on average.Fastweb's performance neatly illustrates the lure of triple play. Incumbent carriers are attracted by the revenues available in the Fastweb model but also terrified of the prospect of an interloper joining the market and taking away customers.""The number one reason for offering these services,"" says Lars Godell, principal telecoms analyst at Forrester Research, ""is to reduce customer churn and increase stickiness as adding more services makes it more difficult for people to switch.""While Mr Godell accepts that this strategy has worked for European cable operators - albeit at a crippling cost - he is not convinced it is a business model for all, in part because he is not sure that Europeans, who spend an average of $20 per month on television services to Americans' $60, are ready for pay television.""It all really goes to people's willingness to pay for content. In the US it is very different but it has taken the cable industry 30 years to get ARPU that high. In Europe, only in Italy and the UK is there evidence of a willingness to pay,"" he says.For that reason, Mr Godell believes that Fastweb is a misleading example, operating as it does in an environment where ""people are fanatical about television and entertainment"".He cites the example of cable as a warning to those considering investing huge resources in upgrading their networks to accommodate video services and urges telecoms companies to seek less capital-intensive routes to triple play such as that used by KPN, which has partnered a digital TV distributor to offer content through the airwaves.Martin Heath, consulting partner at KPMG, warns telecoms companies to stay close to their core expertise of building networks capable of carrying the traffic and then form alliances and partnerships with content providers.Although it is unclear exactly what model of triple play will emerge across the continent, the determination of carriers to build a new business model around it suggests it could be a dominant theme for the decade.Barry Ehrlich, analyst at Helvea, the Switzerland-based brokerage, believes it will be a success: ""My forecast is that television over DSL [broadband] will get about 15m subscribers globally by 2008 and in Europe about 4m to 4.5m. That's somewhere between 6 and 8 per cent of the market and that's a lot with a new technology."""
927;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-01-11T20:41:59Z;Cable groups make a ‘triple play’ for US households;;"When a company has spent $39bn on its cable network it needs to be taken seriously. Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, has done just that and is now ready to start throwing its weight around.Brian Roberts, chief executive, says the cable industry as a whole has invested $95bn of capital since 1996, making the $39bn spent by Comcast in that period really stand out. ""While others are talking about what they will do in the future, we have this behind us."" Mr Roberts says Comcast is ready for its role as a ""new products"" company.The latest new product is internet telephony - already provided by other cable networks but this week embraced as the next big thing by Comcast, which hopes to get 8m internet telephone customers within five years.Technological change is blurring the boundaries between US cable operators and their telecommunications rivals and promising a war as they prepare to move into each other's traditional businesses. Their common aim is to make the most of the huge investments they have made or plan in their network infrastructures to gain control of the digital ""pipes"" into living rooms and give subscribers a compelling ""triple-play"" package of services - voice, video and high speed data.On the one hand, cable companies such as Comcast are promoting voice telephony using their existing coaxial cables. Comcast's internet telephony plans follow those of other cable companies, including Time Warner and Cox Communications - the second and third largest US cable groups respectively - which have already begun to offer voice services to cable television and high-speed internet subscribers using VoIP (voice over internet protocol) technology.On the other hand, telecoms giantsled by Verizon, SBC Communications and BellSouth are gearing up to offer advanced video services over new fibre optic networks being rolled out at a cost of tens of billions of dollars.""We have to be able to compete with the cable companies. They are moving into our base and we have to move into theirs,"" says Ed Cholerton, in charge of consumer marketing at SBC, the US's second-largest telecoms carrier.Last week SBC wowed analysts and investors with a demonstration of its planned IPTV- internet protocol television - service at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.""The demonstration was very impressive and showed the range of services that SBC plans to offer through a single set-top box,"" says Jonathan Hurd, a senior analyst withAdventis, a Boston-based consulting firm.Consumer broadband VoIP technology enables cable and DSL (digital subscriber line) internet subscribers to make voice calls using an ordinary phone by plugging an electronic box called a terminal adapter into their internet connection (see below). For the customer, the big potential advantage is cost.Typically, cable operators and independent service providers such as Vonage, the US broadband internet telephony pioneer, offer VoIP subscribers unlimited local and long-distance calls for a fixed monthly fee that is usually substantially below what traditional telephone carriers charge for similar packages.Comcast's VoIP service will be priced at $40 per month, a modest discount to traditional ""circuit-switched"" telephony, and will offer comparable features including full access to emergency calls, supported by backup batteries, and directory inquiry information.Adding voice services to their traditional mix of video and high-speed data services is an attractive option for US cable operators because the marginal cost is low and the potential revenue large. Comcast says there is no significant extra cost in introducing internet telephone services.Another factor behind Comcast's decision is its confidence that the technologynow available can get around some earlier problems experienced by VoIP users, including poor voice quality and dropped calls. These improvements are making cable telephony far more acceptable to consumers. Time Warner has found that 85 per cent of its telephone customers are transferring their old phone number to their new internet service - suggesting confidence in the new service.That is bad news for traditional telecommunications providers, which have already seen their customer base eroded by competition from mobile phone services and, to a lesser extent, e-mail. Together, the Baby Bells - the four big regional telecommunications groups that emerged out of the breakup of AT&T in the early 1980s - have lost more than 16 per cent of their local telephone lines over the last four years.But the big telecoms companies have plans to fight back. Verizon and SBC have announced plans to build nationwide fibre-optic networks at a combined initial cost of more than $11bn. They are betting that replacing their ageing copper wire technology with high-speed fibre-optic lines will enable them to deliver their version of triple play services to tens of millions of American homes, beginning this year. These networks will allow them to supply hundreds of standard TV channels, high definition programming, voice services and super-high-speed internet connections over a single high-capacity fibre-optic line.While the strategy is expensive and risky, most industry analysts believe the traditional telecommunications operators have little choice but to go head to head with their cable rivals if they are to survive. ""Cable companies already have very high capacity pipes, video services and strong relationships with their subscribers,"" notes Mr Hurd.But he believes that phone companies have the potential to be more disruptive to the home entertainment industry by introducing interactive video services. ""They have the advantage, as new entrants, of being able to do more innovative things with video,"" he points out.Based on the SBC demonstration at the CES show last week, those innovations will include the ability to switch video streams instantly, swap camera angles and monitor multiple channels of high definition programming simultaneously.While digital cable offers some of these options, the telecoms companies say the higher capacity of fibre optic links and the built-in flexibility of infrastructure will enable them to outshine their cable rivals.For example, because the new services will be based on IP - the technology of the internet - it will also be much easier to integrate other features, such as pop-up messages alerting viewers that they have an incoming phone call.Also working in the favour of the telecoms companies is a regulatory ruling by the US Federal Communications Commission late last year. That ruling largely excused the Baby Bells from having to share access to their planned fibre-optic networks with their rivals on regulated terms and conditions.BothVerizon and SBC announced plans to accelerate the deployment of their networks following theruling.Verizon began test marketing its first residential fibre internet access service, dubbed FiOS, to customers in Keller, a small town 15 miles north of Fort Worth, Texas, last year and says it is pleased with the results. ""FiOS has been an extraordinary hit with our our earliest customers in Texas and elsewhere,"" said Bob Ingalls, in charge of Verizon's retail markets.While the number of homes connected to the new fibre networks is small, the figures are expected to rise rapidly. Verizon plans to spend $3bn to offer fibre optic-based services to 3m homes nationally by the end of this year, and to 10m homes by 2009.The technological solutions being considered by the telecoms companies differ. Verizon is using a technology called FTTP - fibre to the premises - which involves taking the glass fibre cable right to the doorstep. The strategy, while costly, will give the company substantial future cost savings because of fibre's projected lower maintenance costs compared with traditional copper cables.Meanwhile SBC, the dominant telecoms company in the south-west and the midwest, plans to spend between $4bn and $6bn rolling out a hybrid fibre-copper network that will enable SBC to begin offering video services as early as this year and should reach 18m households by the end of 2007. SBC's strategy reduces installation costs substantially and, according to the company, will still allow it to deliver multiple high definition video streams and make about 70 per cent of the cost savings attributed to fibre.BellSouth has also been investing in fibre networks but has yet to detail its video plans while Qwest, the smallest of the Baby Bells, is taking a more conservative approach and installing fibre cables only in greenfield developments, a strategy dictated in part by its relatively weak balance sheet.Sceptics argue that, despite the multi-billion dollar plans announced to date, the telecoms industry as a whole will have to spend much more on fibre deployment to compete with the cable industry. To build a nationwide fibre network comparable to the cable industry's, some analysts estimate the Baby Bells would need to spend at least $100bn, or roughly $1,000 per subscriber home.Figures like that unsettle Wall Street, so most carriers have adopted a phased rollout that minimises upfront costs. In the meantime they have begun to bundle satellite TV services with their traditional voice and data services.SBC has gone a step further, signing a partnership agreement with 2Wire, a company whose software will enable SBC to integrate satellite TV programming from Dish Networks, one of the two leading US satellite TV operators,with video recording capabilities, video-on-demand, digital photograph sharing and digital content management through a single set-top box. The technology will enable SBC to deliver most of the features of a fibre-based system in rural and other areas where fibre deployment may not make sense.On the face of it, satellite network operators such as Dish Networks and Rupert Murdoch's DirecTV might be expected to lose out as a result of the move towards interactive video services - which satellites cannot easily offer. However most analysts believe they could play a key role in supplying the digital content the telecoms companies will need for their video services.Both Verizon and SBC have recruited digital content experts from the cable industry to oversee their content acquisitions. Verizon has already signed a number of digital content deals including agreements with ESPN and HBO as well as CNN, Fox and MSNBC while SBC has recruited Dan York, a former HBO executive, to run its video-content strategy.Despite such heavyweight partners, success for the telecoms companies in their effort to deliver ""triple play"" services is far from assured. The cable network operators, with lines into almost 75m homes, are formidable opponents.Cynics point to earlier failed attempts by telecoms companies to enter the television business. For example, in the early 1990s Bell Atlantic tried to acquire TCI, the cable group that was later sold to AT&T and is now part of Comcast.Subsequent attempts by Bell Atlantic, Nynex and SBC to form a content acquisition company - and a similar move by Ameritech - all came to nothing.This time, however, the telecommunications companies insist they understand the importance of content acquisition and service bundling. More than that, they say the timing is right, and the technology ready, for a renewed assault on the cable giants.PLAYING FOR BIG MONEY• Comcast, the biggest US cable operator, has spent $39bn rebuilding its network and aims to win 8m customers for its telephone services within five years• Verizon, the telecoms company, plans to spend $3bn to build a fibre-optic network to reach 3m US homes by the end of the year• Rival telecoms group SBC plans to spend up to $6bn on a network upgrade and should begin offering video services this yearAN OPPORTUNITY NOW ALSO AVAILABLE TO TECHNOPHOBESSeveral years ago it became possible to slash a phone bill by signing up with an internet-based telephone service provider. The benefits from such services were particularly attractive to those who made frequent international phone calls. Many of these savings, however, were reaped only by technological wizards or people who enjoyed getting stuck into complicated procedures. For the average technophobe, internet telephony remained a daunting prospect.This is no longer the case and people transferring from traditional telephone lines to an internet-based one no longer notice any difference. That is part of the reason why there is such expectation of a dramatic change in the competitive landscape for US telephone companies. Comcast, the biggest cable company in the US with just over 20m subscribers, is the last of the big cable groups to enter the fray. Time Warner and Cox Communications already offer phone services.For cable subscribers who already receive cable television and high-speed internet access, deciding to add a telephone service could not be easier. At Time Warner, whose cable customers are signing up for digital telephone services at the rate of 10,000 per week, it is a matter of having an installer come over to plug in a new modem. Comcast will operate in the same way.Existing wiring in the home remains in place, even the most old-fashioned kind of telephone handset can still be used and dialling is done in the same way. Time Warner and Comcast say users do not hear any difference between the old and new services.The switch can take a few weeks but this reflects the time needed to transfer a telephone number from a traditional phone company to the cable provider. For people concerned about the consequences of any interruption to the power supply needed to make the cable system work, Comcast says there is a battery backup built into the modem."
928;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-01-10T16:45:32Z;Comcast move highlights fight for voice customers;;Comcast's plan to offer telephone services to its cable customers highlights the emerging battle between cable and telecommunications companies to provide ?triple-play? services and control the flow of digital content into the home.Monday's announcement by the largest US cable operator follows similar moves by rival operators including Time Warner and Cox Communications and signals the determination of the big cable groups not to be outflanked by three of the regional telecoms operators. Verizon, SBC Communications and BellSouth have all announced ambitious plans to launch video services over fibre-optic networks.Underscoring this, In-Stat, a telecoms consultancy, predicted on Monday that, as more cable providers turned to internet telephony using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology over the next few years, total worldwide cable telephony subscribers would pass the 14m mark by late 2005, and grow to more than 22m by year-end 2008.?The buzz surrounding VoIP telephony services has been constant during the past year, and virtually all leading North American cable operators are either investing resources to further explore VoIP's viability, or have actually deployed the service,? said Mike Paxton, In-Stat analyst.In a recent report, In-Stat found that more than 11m households and businesses worldwide used cable telephony services. ?The long-anticipated ?VoIP spike' in worldwide subscribers will actually be more of a steady rise, particularly during the 2005/2006 period,? the report said.But while there is much excitement surrounding cable-based VoIP services, In-Stat cautioned that the vast majority of cable telephony subscribers still relied on traditional circuit switched technology. Of the 11.8m worldwide cable telephony subscribers at the end of 2004, less than 500,000 were using VoIP technology.This suggests that subscribers are reluctant to rely on internet telephone services alone. If individuals cannot get access to emergency 911 services, for example, they may not want to part with their traditional telephone service.Comcast is planning to provide everything customers can get from their traditional telephone, and more. There are signs that improved technology is encouraging customers to switch. For example, Time Warner has found that 85 per cent of its new telephone customers are transferring their old phone number to the internet service.Over the past two years a handful of start-ups such as Vonage, Net2Phone and Packet8 have begun to offer broadband VoIP services to consumers. Their main attraction has been price, with subscribers typically paying $20-$30 a month for unlimited local and long-distance US calls, about half the price of standard phone services.However, cable operators are charging more. Both Comcast and Time Warner charge $39.95 per month for local and long-distance unlimited phone use. Comcast said it was undercutting telecoms companies by 10-15 per cent, a relatively modest amount that indicates it is not just price they are competing on.
929;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2005-01-10T15:36:29Z;Comcast targets phone networks;;The clash between US cable, telecommunications and satellite companies intensified on Monday as Comcast, the country's biggest cable operator, announced ambitious plans to offer internet-based telephone services to up to 15m homes by the end of the year.The move mirrors strategies adopted by other cable companies, such as Time Warner and Cox Communications, to provide telephone services to cable television and high-speed internet subscribers. “Comcast is poised to make a very big splash because of its scale,” said Craig Moffett, senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.Comcast, which has 21m subscribers and can be reached by 40m US households, will offer telephone services in areas now covered by all the big telephone companies.“Verizon, SBC Communications, BellSouth and Qwest will feel the effect of a large-scale, well-capitalised competitor in the telephone business,” said Mr Moffett. “Satellite companies DirectTV and EchoStar will also feel the effect of another multi-product competitor as video remains their only product.”Comcast will roll out the internet service to all customers by the middle of next year. It aims to offer a full substitute for traditional telephone lines including emergency services access and directory inquiry information.The high margins available make the business attractive to Comcast. Following a $39bn investment in rebuilding its network, Comcast said there was no significant extra cost of introducing internet telephone services. “The capital requirements are not very much at all,” said David Watson, executive vice-president. “It is expected to be a healthy business, with margins beating 40 per cent.”Subscribers to high-speed internet services have been Comcast's main growth drivers, but telephone services are now expected to take their place.“This is our most significant growth area for the next two to three years,” Mr Watson said. The company aims to have 8m phone subscribers within five years.Comcast will slightly undercut phone companies but these have ambitious plans of their own.Verizon, SBC and Bell South are all investing heavily innew fibre-optic networks, which will be used to launch videoservices.Monday's announcement was the first big initiative fromComcast since it failed in its bid to take over Walt Disney a year ago.
930;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-12-29T11:29:50Z;Observer - Cries of the moguls;;"The same media moguls bestride the world at the end of 2004 as at the beginning but their footing is less sure.The likes of Michael Eisner at Walt Disney, and even Rupert Murdoch of News Corp, have faced questions over who will succeed them, their attitude to shareholders and expansion plans.It is not that their businesses and other leading media groups including Time Warner, Viacom, Comcast and British Sky Broadcasting have been performing badly.What is worrying are the clouds on the horizon: new technology, intense price competition and uncertain advertising or subscription revenues.At News Corp, Murdoch is expected to use the first part of 2005 to resolve the shareholder issues with Liberty Media, the US media investment vehicle led by veteran financial engineer John Malone.To Murdoch's dismay, Malone has built up an 18 per cent voting stake in the company - second only to the first family itself - with a view to folding Liberty assets into a new channels venture with News Corp, among other options.News Corp has its own plan: $5.7bn (€4.2bn) in cash on hand with which to buy out Malone. As one insider puts it: ""Think three-dimensional chess played by equally matched players of comparable power and intelligence bound by mutual respect.""Sounds like a great concept for a six-part series with video game spin-off, anyhow.Eisner endgameOver on the west coast the talk is of succession planning at Disney. After 20 years in the turret, Eisner is to retire in September 2006. For some it is not before time: this year Disney faced an abortive $58bn bid from Comcast, the country's largest cable operator; a shareholder revolt that persuaded the board to split Eisner's roles of chairman and chief executive; and the distraction of a investor lawsuit over the 1996 pay-off to Michael Ovitz, its former president.Chief operating officer Bob Iger is waiting in the wings. But there could be a few more plot twists to come.Pirates - the sequelThe problem with having all these moguls is where to find the next one. Succession is also an issue at Viacom, where Sumner Redstone ousted Mel Karmazin as president this year, installing the double act of Les Moonves and Tom Freston, the father of MTV, as co-chief operating officers.Time Warner appears to be grooming low-key but well-respected Jeff Bewkes, its entertainment chief, for the top job although Dick Parsons is not about to stand down any time soon.Things could get a lot harder for this new generation: they must impose their business style on an industry facing huge technological challenges.For the movie-makers, broadband compression and digital piracy has become a big headache. The studios fear high-speed internet access will allow pirates to run riot downloading films, in the same way as it hit the music industry. Determined to avoid that fate, they have called in the lawyers and are working on improving encryption of new high-definition DVDs.So just as Observer gets used to one acronym (it means digital versatile disc, by the way) comes the HD DVD. Film and television types are preparing to shift to HD, hoping consumers will pay more for superior quality DVDs and higher subscription rates to new HD channels.Typically, however, things have been muddled by two competing industry standards from Toshiba and Sony-led groups. It could be VHS versus Betamax all over again.Looney iTunesHD DVDs could help the studios avoid some of the problems in the music industry, where piracy losses are estimated at $2.4bn a year. The big music groups hope 2005 will mark the nadir after four years of declining sales - down from a peak of almost $40bn a year in 2000 to $32bn today.EMI of Britain believes legitimate digital services, led by Apple's iTunes and Napster's subscription service, could mean 25 per cent of industry sales will come from new technology before long. Warner Music, sold by Time Warner to a financial consortium led by Edgar Bronfman for $2.6bn, is less optimistic. Even so, improved industry sales could persuade the company to float in 2005.In common with other companies, Warner is looking to new technology for new revenue - whether from internet downloads or third generation mobile phones. Ringtones alone are expected to generate annual sales of $3.5bn. No one is quite sure, however, who exactly will benefit from the 3G revolution: content providers, network operators or handset makers.And others have an eye on the exploding market, namely old-fashioned telecommunications companies, not least in Britain where BT is expected to unveil a big entertainment drive.Ad-ding upSuch competition will be easier to deal with if the media's old friends in the advertising business help out. According to analysts at UBS in New York, Zenith Optimedia and McCann, big media buyers, have raised their 2005 global advertising forecasts to 5 per cent and 6.1 per cent respectively.An advertising recovery will reassure TV networks but signs are less promising for national newspapers. Indeed, many purveyors of dead wood are seeing robust demand on the internet.Time Warner forecast recently that ad revenues at America Online could reach $1bn in 2005.Companies unable to withstand the competitive challenge may be swallowed up. That is likely to see 2005 end with companies including bankrupt cable group Adelphia Communications and pedigree film studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer in different hands.Still, that will resolve only the short-term futures of such businesses. We will have to wait a bit longer to see whether they have one long-term."
931;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-12-16T19:02:35Z;Time Warner looks forward to cleaned-up AOL;;For the past four years, discussion about Time Warner, the world's largest media company, has largely been a backward-looking exercise, with analysts and executives focusing on the after-effects of an ill-fated merger with America Online in 2000.That deal not only failed to deliver on management's lofty financial promises but it subsequently exposed Time Warner and its staid executives to the more aggressive accounting practices of their new internet brethren.But the announcement on Wednesday that Time Warner had agreed to pay $510m to settle criminal and civil investigations associated with AOL has put the company in a forward-looking mood again.The talk has turned from what Time Warner will do to clean up AOL to its acquisitions plans. The most relentless speculation has centered on Adelphia, the bankrupt cable group.Industry analysts widely expect Time Warner to join with Comcast to bid on its assets early next year.Richard Parsons, Time Warner's chief executive, provided little detail on a potential Adelphia bid when he addressed a group of investors over lunch at a UBS conference in New York last week.While noting that the company was interested in expanding its cable side, Mr Parsons insisted that any acquisitions would be undertaken with discipline.More memorable may have been the confidence he displayed about the company's future days before the settlements were announced.?Our focus has shifted from stabilising the company to repositioning it, to determining how to deploy our capacity,? Mr Parsons said, noting that Time Warner had generated $3bn in free cashflow in the first nine months of the year.Investors had greeted the prospect of the settlements with relief in recent months, pushing the share price from a 12-month low of $15.41 to more than $19 on Thursday.Perhaps the greatest impact from the agreements is that they will allow Time Warner to return to the debt and equity markets. The company had been constrained from tapping those markets while the investigation into AOL's accounting practices dragged on amid concern that it would have to restate its financial results.This was a particularhindrance when the company competed unsuccessfully with a consortium led by Sony this year for control of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The new financial flexibility should shift Time Warner's size as a source of professional fees from law firms to Wall Street bankers.Analysts expect Time Warner to use some of its estimated $4bn in free cashflow next year to repurchase some of its shares.Douglas Mitchelson and Brett Peven of Deutsche Bank estimated that the company could snap up as much as 40 per cent of its outstanding shares by2007. In the meantime, the settlements will almost certainly give Mr Parsons a freer hand as he seeks to re-fashion and expand AOL, long the source of so many Time Warner headaches.
932;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-12-15T20:36:37Z;Disney chiefs to discuss strategy for new media;;"Senior Walt Disney executives will meet on Friday to discuss the company's investment plans and expansion strategy in new media one of three growth areas targeted by the US entertainment group.Bob Iger, president and chief operating officer, is due to discuss an ambitious business plan for digital content, mobile telephony and the internet with Steve Wadsworth, who heads the company's online operations.The 2005 digital business strategy could pave the way for Disney's most aggressive new media investment since the launch of Go, its ill-fated narrowband portal, during the tech boom.?We could invest substantial amounts of money in this area following a turnround in that business, which at its nadir with Go lost a couple of hundred million dollars,? said Mr Iger. Expansion in new technology building on mobile and data service projects in Japan and Europe forms part of what Mr Iger terms Disney's ?triple-play? for strategic growth.Over the past year, such projects have been overshadowed by issues including an abortive hostile bid from Comcast, the largest US cable operator; a shareholder revolt that forced Michael Eisner to split the roles of chairman and chief executive; and, most recently, a shareholder lawsuit over the compensation package paid in the mid-1990s to Michael Ovitz, former president.Mr Iger, the sole internal candidate to succeed Mr Eisner as CEO following his retirement in September 2006, says the company can not afford to be distracted. He insists it should concentrate on growth areas after delivering record free cashflow of $2.9bn for the fiscal year ending September 30.Speaking ahead of last night's London premiere of Mary Poppins, the latest Disney classic to be re-packaged for the stage, Mr Iger said content creation, new technology and international expansion were the group's three imperatives.Mary Poppins, one of 17 theatrical productions from Disney, is seen as both a growth model for the content and international sides of the business. The show, the first to premiere outside the US, will transfer to New York after a year, possibly followed by other territories.Senior executives say Disney now makes more money out of stage shows than the whole group was making in 1984, when Mr Eisner took over as chief executive. Mr Iger also believes non-US operations will increase their contribution to operating profits from 35 to 50 per cent in the medium term.Tomorrow Disney will mark the latest phase of its international growth with the launch of the Disney channel in India. That will be followed next year by the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland. Both projects are aimed at tapping a potential audience of 600m people below the age of 14 in India and China.Mr Iger, however, sees even greater potential from new technology. Disney, he says, hopes to repeat its early success in Japan where it has 3.6m mobile subscribers paying $1 a month for Disney content. Its initial foray with DoCoMo has been followed by 18 partnerships with mobile operators in 22 countries in Europe including T-Mobile, Vodafone and Telef?nica. ?We used Japan as an education to see how we create content on these platforms,? said Mr Iger.He now plans to repeat that with new projects such as Disney Connection, the latest broadband business, its Toontown online games business and education services.The company is in advanced negotiations with India Games, the country's internet content distributor. Similar talks are under way in Latin America. Disney executives recently explained that strategy to the company's board and its 20 largest investors. Shareholders will also be told of the plans at next year's annual meeting.Mr Iger says the message is clear. ?Today we are more poised to take advantage of growth opportunities than five years ago. It's time to invest.?"
933;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-12-07T23:55:44Z;Liberty Media in talks with News Corp over stake;;NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Liberty Media Corp, the media investment group controlled by John Malone, is in talks to explore unwinding its position in News Corp, a Liberty executive said on Tuesday.“There have been some conversations,” Robert Bennett, CEO of Liberty told investors at the UBS Media conference in New York.He declined to elaborate. A News Corp. spokesman declined to comment.Liberty Media in November set the stage for a possible high-stakes battle to exert control on News Corp. by saying it planned to raise its voting stake in News Corp. to 17 percent from 9 percent.But Liberty has said it had no intentions of launching a takeover battle and has publicly extolled the Murdoch family’s management approach.Murdoch, whom confidantes and former associates say is fiercely protective of control of the company he built from a single newspaper, within days moved to enact a poison pill measure that makes a hostile takeover prohibitively costly.Since then, speculation has swept through Wall Street and the media world over what arrangements the two media titans are mulling.One possibility mulled by analysts involves a corporate tax loophole called a “cash-rich split-off,” wherein one company which owns a big stake in another company agrees to hand over the shares in exchange for cash and a small business.Such an arrangement, which one source said was among the scenarios Murdoch and Malone were discussing, would be preferable to selling the shares outright, which would incur heavy taxes, analysts said.Malone’s Liberty has executed such transactions in the past. In July it swapped its 10 percent stake in E! Entertainment Television, its ownership of the International Channel Networks and $545 million in cash in exchange for 4 percent of Liberty stock owned by Comcast Corp. .MORE DEALSSeparately Bennett confirmed that Liberty was considering buying wireless broadcast towers from mobile service provider Sprint Corp. . It owns an 8 percent stake in Sprint, according to its Web site.He said the towers were “potentially very attractive” assets in their own right. Liberty has said that Sprint shares were nonstrategic, and Bennett said the towers could play into Liberty’s efforts to get rid of nonstrategic assets in a tax efficient way.“It’s another way that we convert the portfolio over time from nonstrategic strategic investments into more active ownerships,” Bennett told investors.Sprint is in the process of trying to find a buyer for about 6,500 wireless towers. Bennett declined to talk specifically about Sprint’s sale process but said that he hopes for clarity in the next month or so.Sprint was not immediately available to comment.
934;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Hit seeks to regain US momentum;;"Hit Entertainment, the UK-based children's television and merchandising group behind Bob the Builder and Thomas the Tank Engine, is bracing itself for a restructuring.The overhaul is expected early next year when one of nine candidates interviewed by Peter Orton the company's chairman and founder becomes Hit's new chief executive.Mr Orton, in his first interview since ousting Rob Lawes as chief executive five weeks ago, says the new boss must rebuild profits, which have been undermined this year by a weak dollar, disrupted retail sales and the absence of Bob the Builder on US TV screens.That may be a tall order given Hit's latest full-year results, with pre-tax profits down from ?25.4m ($48.5m) to ?14.6m in the 12 months to July 31. The decline, coupled with Mr Lawes' removal and a downbeat trading outlook, sent the stock down almost 11 per cent. The share price has recovered somewhat but the company's valuation needs to more than double surpassing its ?800m peak five years ago to reach the chairman's goal.Explaining the changing of the guard, Mr Orton says: ?Rob Lawes was a very talented young guy who worked for the company for 14 years. But he was very interested in finance and the City when what we needed was an entrepreneurial spirit and a CEO able to motivate creative people and bring forward new brands, new products and explore new technology.?The company, which relies on the US for almost 60 per cent of its sales, expects that market will lead a reversal of fortunes. That effort will be powered by a new digital children's TV channel in the US, jointly launched and owned by Hit; Comcast, the country's largest cable operator; the Sesame Workshop Company and PBS.Bob the Builder, Hit's most valuable character, will be relaunched on the new service reaching 105m US households following the expiry of a broadcast deal with Viacom, the media group behind CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon. In addition to spurring home entertainment sales, the company has high hopes for products developed with RC2, the American toy manufacturer that is replacing Hasbro as Hit's merchandise partner.Mr Orton calculates American families spend an average $550m on merchandise linked to shows such as Thomas the Tank Engine. And he wants to exploit demand among the country's 16m ?pre-schoolers? for Bob, Barney and other characters.A brand re-launch is also being planned, likely to be followed by a drive into new territories such as China. Given that potential and the current share price, it should be no surprise that Hit is considered a bid candidate. Viacom or Comcast could be suitors. The company would also fit with Walt Disney. ?If the share price comes off, the analysts always start talking deals,? he says. ?We see ourselves as a strong independent company. There's a saying in this industry never let someone else put his hand on the dollar and I don't expect that to happen here.?"
935;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Happier days entertain Walt Disney;;"The board of Walt Disney is on Wednesday expected to consider a dividend increase following record full-year earnings and cash-flow growth.Directors of the entertainment and media group, meeting over two days in New York, are also likely to discuss further share buy-backs after strong profit contributions from its media networks, theme parks and consumer products business helped lift annualised free cashflow to $2.9bn.Debate over the size of the dividend increase and the next tranche of buy-backs is expected to dominate the agenda, even though public attention on Disney has been focused in recent weeks by events in Delaware. There, the machinations of Disney's board are being laid bare in a shareholder lawsuit, seeking repayment of a $140m severance package agreed almost 10 years ago for Michael Ovitz, Disney's short-lived president.Apart from the lawsuit, Disney's underlying performance has also been overshadowed this year by a shareholder revolt prompting Michael Eisner to split the roles of chairman and chief executive; an abortive hostile takeover bid by Comcast, the cable operator; and public dissent by former directors and pension funds.?Disney has continued to perform strongly. Wall Street has recognised that, ignored the noise and it is investing heavily in the company's future growth,? says one executive.In public, the company's directors have not commented on the case, preferring instead to focus on the latest results. After an 85 per cent rise in net income to $2.35bn on sales up 14 per cent at $30.8bn in the year to September 30, Tom Staggs, chief financial officer, promised to reward shareholders.?We'll be recommending . . . we resume a course of modest and sustainable dividend increases beginning this year.? He also hinted at further share buy-backs. Disney's optimism follows rebounds this year at ABC Television and theme parks, compensating partly for poorly performing live-action films. ABC, which has struggled to break even since it was acquired in 1996, has seen advertising revenues grow on the back of better ratings, sustained this autumn by hit shows such as Desperate Housewives.The theme park division has enjoyed higher attendance, hotel occupancy and spending in Florida reversing difficult conditions since the 9/11 attacks. Together, such growth offset lower studio contributions following flops this year including Home on the Range, The Alamo and King Arthur.This year, studios should bounce back following the recent release of blockbusters such as National Treasure and The Incredibles. In the US, both films have retained the top box office slots over the vital Thanksgiving holiday weekend. National Treasure is on track to earn $175m at the US box office, according to the company, while The Incredibles produced by Pixar and distributed by Disney has already surpassed $200m. Several brokers, however, have warned of a potentially difficult first quarter amid higher programme spending, the deferral of affiliate fees at ESPN and start-up costs for new Disney channels, particularly in India and potentially China. The theme parks business could also be held back by losses at Eurodisney, the partly owned French affiliate, and launch costs at Hong Kong Disneyland.The next 12 months is also likely to be dominated by speculation over the future of the Pixar relationship, due to expire in 2006; contract negotiations at Miramax, the arthouse film subsidiary; a verdict in the Ovitz case; and the naming of a successor to Mr Eisner, due to retire in September 2006.Analysts, however, appear unfazed. Among them, Jill Krutick at Citigroup, says: ?Disney's results highlight a renewed vigour by management to drive free cash, returns and improve its content pipeline. The company looks to be making good progress on each of these fronts.?"
936;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Shake-up plan values Adelphia at $17bn;;Adelphia's creditors have reached a preliminary agreement on a reorganisation plan that values the bankrupt US cable operator at $17bn, setting a key marker for the auction of the company's assets.In January, Adelphia, the fifth-largest US cable company, is expected to receive final bids for its assets, which it has divided into seven separate geographical clusters.Time Warner and Comcast, the US media groups, are expected to submit a joint bid, probably facing competition from a number of cable entrepreneurs and private equity groups.If the bids do not add up to more than $17bn, including debt the number set yesterday by Adelphia's creditors any deals to sell the company's parts will not count and a standalone plan will kick in.Under the standalone agreement, all of Adelphia's unsecured creditors would receive shares in the new company once it emerged from bankruptcy. Also, all lawsuits would be allowed to continue, including Adelphia's $3.2bn complaint against members of the founding Rigas family. In July, John Rigas, 79, and Timothy, his son, were convicted of fraud and conspiracy in the company's collapse.Adelphia filed its own reorganisation plan in February, but was forced to hire investment bankers, at UBS and Allen & Company, to pursue a sale of its assets after creditors insisted that the plan undervalued the company.Adelphia's previous plan also valued the company at $17bn. But since then the value of publicly traded cable companies has fallen on fears of growing competition, mainly from satellite providers.Adelphia on Tuesday said it was reviewing the creditors' plan and described the parallel sale process as ?robust?. ?Due to the high number of interested parties, and the time required for those parties to conduct due diligence, final offers are expected in January 2005,? it said.Adelphia's assets range across the US. Among the private equity groups expected to bid for parts of the business are Providence Equity Partners, Spectrum Equity Investors, and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, according to people familiar with the matter.
937;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-11-09T20:33:53Z;Cable operator sees digital demand;;Cablevision, the largest cable television operator in the New York area, on Tuesday offered evidence of robust demand for cable services, particularly high-speed internet access, telephone usage and digital TV.In its third-quarter results, Cablevision said its subscriber base for cable services remained steady relative to the same period last year. However, it has added significant numbers of users to its digital television, internet access and phone subscriber base and these users continue to increase their monthly spending.Last month, Comcast, the largest US cable operator, surprised analysts by reporting that it added nearly 550,000 high-speed internet subscribers in the three months to September 30. Comcast had spent about $30m more on marketing high-speed data than it had planned, but got an extra 100,000 customers that the company expects will generate about $50m of revenue per year.Similarly, Cablevision has invested in acquiring new subscribers, offering a $90-a-month package that undercuts similar deals from rivals such as Verizon. However, customers end up spending an average of $110 per month, the company reiterated on Tuesday.The appetite for high-end services is important for the cable sector following signs of customer defections to satellite providers for basic viewing packages.On Tuesday, EchoStar Communications, the second-largest US satellite television service, announced profits almost tripled as it added subscribers and raised some prices. Much of its subscriber growth is attributed to attracting more users of basic viewing packages and from providing high-end services to users in the suburbs and other areas where cable services have not yet been upgraded.EchoStar said it added 350,000 new subscribers during the recent quarter to end the period with 10.5m users. DirecTV, the company's larger rival, said last week that it had added 484,000 subscribers for a total of 12.1m.The satellite company said third-quarter profits rose to $102m from $35.1m a year earlier. EchoStar also announced it would pay a one-time dividend of $455m.As for Cablevision, it shrank its net loss to $63.2m in the third quarter, from $107m a year earlier.
938;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Comcast reaps subscribers from marketing push;;Increased marketing helped Comcast drive up subscriber numbers across most of its businesses in the third quarter but took its toll on the cable operator's earnings, according to results released on Wednesday.The largest US cable operator reported results at the lower end of analysts' expectations but surprised the market with the announcement that it added nearly 550,000 high-speed internet subscribers in the three months to September 30.“We spent about $30m more on high-speed data than we had planned during the quarter, and got 100,000 incremental customers out of it those [customers] will generate about $50m of revenue per year, so that's a pretty good trade-off,” said Steven Burke, chief operating officer.Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive, said the results showed the cable market was growing in spite of added competition for high-speed internet customers by telecommunications groups, including Verizon and SBC. “Our high-speed data sales and revenue per customer [numbers] suggest that the market is growing and there is not a downward pricing pressure that some had predicted,” he said.The group reported a 12 per cent increase in third-quarter revenues to $5.1bn. Excluding a one-time gain last year connected to the sale of Comcast's stake in QVC to Liberty Media, the group reported net income of $220m, or 10 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $153m in the same period last year. Including the one-time gain of $3.29bn from the QVC disposal, net income fell 93 per cent from $3.18bn reported in the third quarter of 2003.Profits were hurt by an increase in marketing costs during the traditionally strong third quarter and hurricane-related subscriber losses.The company offered investors little new detail on discussions with Time Warner about a possible joint bid for Adelphia, the bankrupt cable operator. Mr Roberts reiterated that the acquisition of Adelphia was not a strategic necessity and noted the “complicated relationship” the group had with its potential bid partner.Shares in Comcast closed up nearly 2 per cent at $29.47 on Wednesday.
939;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-10-20T17:20:43Z;Group behind Bob the Builder takes a hit;;Shares in Hit Entertainment fell almost 11 per cent on Wednesday after the UK group behind Bob the Builder sacked Rob Lawes, its chief executive, and warned of difficult trading conditions in the year ahead.The departure of Mr Lawes, chief executive for the past three years, and the profits warning overshadowed a breakthrough deal in the US, where Hit has teamed up with Comcast, the country's largest cable operator, and America's Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).Its shares fell 24p to 195p after Peter Orton, the founder who is returning as executive chairman, said the board had decided to remove Mr Lawes following a year in which trading was undermined by merchandising problems, lower US programming of Bob the Builder and mixed demand for home entertainment products.The company has not yet agreed a compensation package for the 37-year-old chief executive, who had a rolling contract with a six-month notice period. Industry analysts expressed surprise at hisdismissal. Richard Menzies-Gow, media analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, said Hit could become a takeover target following the upheaval.?It starts to look vulnerable,? he added. ?The downside risk for a bidder is low because the shares are cheap, they have no chief executive and have just secured a vital carriage deal with Comcast in the US.?Walt Disney and Viacom, the rival US entertainment groups, have been named as potential bidders.Mr Orton, however, insisted Hit was being re-positioned and that it needed a chief executive with more content experience. Hit has appointed Spencer Stuart, the executive search group, to find a new chief.The company yesterday said pre-tax profits were down from ?25.4m to ?14.6m ($26.5m) in the year to July 31, while sales fell 12.3 per cent to ?148.1m.
940;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

942;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-10-07T20:19:02Z;Charter issues profits warning;;Charter Communications, the cable TV operator chaired by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, on Thursday issued a profits warning amid subscriber losses and rising programming costs.Shares in the company fell 2.2 per cent to $2.65 after it said it expected to lose up to 60,000 cable subscribers in the third quarter, compared with a gain of about 11,000 subscribers in the same period of last year.Charter, which has divested cable systems boasting more than 250,000 subscribers, said like-for-like earnings would be virtually flat before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and would be down 3-5 per cent against the earnings reported in the third quarter of 2003.The company has been hit by intense competition among cable operators and aggressive marketing by satellite rivals such as DirecTV, controlled by News Corp, and EchoStar.In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Charter said: ?Revenue growth was primarily offset by increased programming, customer care and service-related expenditures, resulting in compression of the adjusted Ebitda margin.?Several US cable operators are labouring under heavy debt burdens, including Charter which has $18.4bn of borrowings, while Adelphia has put its up for sale after emerging from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Industry analysts warned that Charter had lost subscribers in seven of the past eight quarters. They also questioned whether Mr Allen would refinance the company or seek a merger with Adelphia.Adelphia has invited bid for its seven regional cable groups, valued at a total of $17bn-$20bn or $3,000-$4,000 per subscriber.The board of the cable company has reportedly responded coolly to the idea of a joint bid from Time Warner and Comcast for its cable assets. Time Warner and Comcast have confirmed they are in preliminary talks about a combined offer, but pointed out that the auction process had only just begun.

Mr Logan said.?We are not very happy at losing customers. We will be developing more introductory prices and more bundled services.?In contrast, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp, said satellite operators were gaining customers at the expense of cable operators. He predicted that DirecTV could add 2m new subscribers this year.Time Warner's response comes as the group is considering a bid for Adelphia, the rival cable systems group which last month launched an auction of its seven regional cable ?clusters? worth an estimated total of $17bn-$20bn.Speaking at a Goldman Sachs investor conference in New York, Mr Logan confirmed that Time Warner was preparing due diligence on Adelphia. But he warned that the potential break-up of Adelphia along regional lines could delay any eventual deal.He said: ?They have set up a very complicated process that will bring in a lot of buyers. They did it because they don't think there were many buyers for the entire system.?Time Warner is in preliminary talks with Comcast, the US cable operator, about a potential joint offer for Adelphia assets. The two companies, which have signed a joint confidentiality agreement with Adelphia, are considering a deal in which Comcast could reduce its stake in Time Warner Cable in exchange for some Adelphia assets.Comcast has already agreed to cut its stake in Time Warner Cable from 21 to 17 per cent in a separate $750m cash and subscriber transaction.Mr Logan said cable TV was one of the few businesses that could see double-digit sales and earnings growth in the next few years.Of other operations within his division, he said America Online was also demonstrating strong growth in spite of declining narrowband customer numbers. He responded coolly to suggestions that there would be no change of ownership at AOL as there were significant advantages in retaining the company."
944;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Media groups weigh up Adelphia bid;;Time Warner and Comcast are exploring a joint bid for Adelphia, the bankrupt cable company that put itself up for sale this year after some members of its founding family were convicted of fraud and conspiracy.The two media companies, which dominate the US cable industry, were expected to bid separately for portions of Adelphia but have instead agreed to submit a joint ?confidentiality agreement? to bankers running the auction. Time Warner said: ?We are working with Comcast to explore a potential transaction with Adelphia.?The two cable groups also said on Monday that Comcast was planning to unwind its 21 per cent stake in Time Warner's cable operations after agreeing to swap a 4 per cent holding in Time Warner Cable for outright control of a new subsidiary with 90,000 subscribers and $750m in cash.Comcast, which inherited its stake in Time Warner's cable division following its near-$50bn acquisition of AT&T's broadband business two years ago, may dispose of the rest of its holding during the next six months.Officials said the Adelphia talks were at an early stage and warned the two companies may fail to agree terms. They said Time Warner could exchange assets in Adelphia for Comcast's remaining stake in Time Warner Cable.Analysts have suggested that Adelphia could be worth as much as $20bn. However, fears of increasing competition from satellite companies have pushed down valuations of publicly traded cable groups, prompting some to insist Adelphia would be sold for less.Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS in New York, said the deal was a potential precursor to joint asset acquisitions by Comcast and Time Warner. ?We believe Comcast could be waiting for a potentially bigger transaction through which it would collaborate with Time Warner in the near future.?A joint bid by Comcast and Time Warner for Adelphia, whose founder John Rigas and son Timothy Rigas were in July convicted of fraud and conspiracy, will face competition from other suitors. A number of cable entrepreneurs and private equity firms are also planning to participate in the auction.Adelphia's investment bankers at UBS and Allen & Co, hoping to clinch a deal by the end of the year, recently divided the assets into seven geographical clusters to facilitate a break-up of the company. However, they did not rule out a sale of all of Adelphia.It is unclear how Time Warner and Comcast would split up Adelphia's assets after a successful joint bid. However, it is likely each would want to own assets where they already have a strong presence Comcast in Los Angeles and Time Warner in New York.
945;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Sony-led group agrees $4.8bn MGM deal;;An investor group led by Sony on Thursday night clinched a definitive agreement topurchase Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the last independent Hollywood studio, for $4.8bn.The development comes almost 10 days after the Japanese electronics group trumped Time Warner, the US media giant, to reach a preliminary agreement to buy MGM.In a statement, the sides outlined how the equity portion of the investment, worth $1.6bn, would be broken up.Sony and Comcast, who joined the bid at the 11th hour, will commit $300m, while private equity groups Providence Equity Partners, Texas Pacific Group and DLJ Merchant Banking Partners, a unit of Credit Suisse First Boston, will commit $525m, $300m, and $125m respectively.JP Morgan Chase has committed to lead a bank syndicate to provide up to $4.25bn in senior debt financing together with CSFB. ?We are delighted to be able to make this announcement today together with our partners,? said Sir Howard Stringer, chairman and chief executive of Sony Corporation of America.?We all look forward to preserving and enhancing the legendary franchise that is MGM, and to ensuring that its extraordinary content continues to be enjoyed by people around the world.?Time Warner had been favourite to clinch the deal but people close to the talks said MGM changed its mind after Sony's consortium raised its bid from $11.25per share and offered to pay a $150m non-refundable deposit as insurancein case the deal fell through.The group also benefited from the involvement of Comcast, the cable giant, which is expected to co-operate with Sony to launch cable channels and video-on-demand services based on the company's expanded film library.Comcast is also taking an option to join the consortium as an investor at a later stage, people close to the deal said.
946;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-09-22T19:42:13Z;Sony and Comcast plan new channels;;Sony is planning to launch at least three new television channels in the US following an agreement with Comcast, the US cable giant, to create a new channels joint venture.Executives involved in the plan said Animax, AXN and Sony Entertainment TV three channels already established in Asia and Latin America could be distributed by Comcast as part of the alliance.?There is an agreement to work together on channels and there are several international brands we could put into the US,? said one person close to the situation.Sony's TV distribution ambitions in the US, where it owns the Games Show Network, have previously been held back by launch costs.The Comcast alliance coincides with Sony's agreement to participate in a separate $4.8bn-$5bn acquisition of Metro Goldwyn Mayer, a Hollywood studio. Final terms of the MGM takeover, financed largely by private equity investors, are due to be agreed in the coming days.Comcast could also participate in the acquisition, investing up to $300m.One executive said the channels alliance would continue, even if the cable group decided not to join the consortium acquiring MGM.Comcast and Sony have also vowed to develop a video-on-demand joint venture, exploiting the 3,000 films and 35,000 TV episodes held in the Sony Pictures library. That library could also exploit MGM's 4,000 movies and 10,000 TV episodes.John Alchin, Comcast co-chief financial officer, told an investment conference this week that ?an enormous amount of study and preliminary work? had been completed on the joint venture.Mr Alchin declined to name the channels likely to be rolled out in the US.But Sony is keen to launch Animax derived from Japanese ?anime? cartoons for the US market along with its action shows and general entertainment channels.?The price of entry to the US market has been so large we have not been able to consider it until now,? said one insider. ?With Comcast we can jump start that strategy.?
947;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-09-21T23:01:10Z;Adelphia outlines cluster auction;;"Adelphia on Tuesday said potential buyers could bid on any or all of the seven clusters, which have been structured to operate as stand-alone companies.Adelphia's investment bankers at UBS and Allen & Co are hoping to wrap up the sale by the end of the year.The decision to divide Adelphia into clusters came after it became clear that the company was unlikely to be sold in one piece.Among the probable participants in the auction are Time Warner and Comcast, the two media giants, as well as a number of cable entrepreneurs who have teamed up with private equity groups to prepare bids.Bill Schleyer, chairman and chief executive of Adelphia, on Tuesday offered an upbeat assessment of the auction process, saying the company was ?pleased with the level of preliminary interest?.The clusters of assets suggested by Adelphia are: Northern New England/Eastern New York; Cleveland/Greater Ohio Valley; Florida/Southeast; California/Western; Virginia/Maryland/Colorado Springs/Kentucky; Pennsylvania; and Western New York & Connecticut.The outcome of the auction is only likely to be approved by the bankruptcy court if it yields a greater valuation of Adelphia than an internal reorganisation plan that fixed the company's price at about $18bn.However that number might not be the ultimate reference as valuations of publicly traded cable companies have suffered recently.Adelphia, which is restructuring under bankruptcy protection and could choose to emerge as an independent concern, expects final bids for the assets by the year's end.Subscribers in certain regions, including Southern California and Florida, are expected to generate more bidding interest than those in other areas.Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said Adelphia's California assets, grouped with those in the Western states, will be the auction's ?main prize,? while the Florida and Southeastern US cluster could generate interest from several bidders but fits best with Comcast's operations."
948;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-09-14T20:57:18Z;Lex: MGM/Sony;;Sony has cast its net over the coveted MGM film library. Like Sony's Spider-Man superhero, the deal has a retro feel to it, with a huge price tag, given MGM's stand-alone earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.But depressed earnings at MGM mainly reflect the cost of current film production. Although estimates vary, its film library should generate at least $400m in cash this year, translating into a more manageable multiple of about 12 or possibly less.That is still hardly a bargain for Sony and its private equity partners, as MGM has already done a reasonable job in running its library. But Sony's marketing and distribution muscle could mean further upside. And Sony's new films will provide an engine to pull through sales of golden oldies. If the new company can keep its cash flows healthy - if the reruns stay popular and the library gets refreshed - the private equity partners should see the effects of high gearing work their usual trick, as the debt gets paid down fairly quickly. There may be some extra benefits. When they want to cash in their stakes, for instance, Sony would be a natural buyer.In the meantime, these industry and finance bedfellows have to get along and this is the most intriguing bit of the deal. Essentially, Sony, which could not have afforded to do this deal alone, has rented an expensive balance sheet. And the private equity partners, have rented Sony's operational and industrial smarts. The agreements between the two sides must weigh a ton.How will the private equity partners, for instance, keep tabs on Sony's distribution and whether it is creating enough value for the MGM library? How will the synergies that Sony reaps from this deal be shared between investors? What terms will govern Sony's film remakes for the library? No wonder it took forever to get the deal together. Ironically, the clincher was surely not the most significant bit of the puzzle. But Comcast's role, licensing films for its video-on-demand offering, must have given the private equity firms that extra bit of comfort. It is is harder to gauge how important this deal is for Comcast. If it were able to get its hands on new films earlier than its usual alloted slot, that would be groundbreaking, but it is not clear if Sony is ready for such a move.Most striking of all is quite how Sony, with just $300m of equity, has managed to get hold of MGM's library from under the nose of Time Warner. After all, Time Warner must have had synergies aplenty of its own. Possibly it did not have the stomach for the restructuring that the MGM business would need, under the intense spotlight of public investors.For Sony, the deal is about more than MGM's library. It should be able to capitalise on MGM's content to establish the Blu-ray format as the next DVD standard, and perhaps to benefit its video gaming business. But while the deal structure should limit the immediate strains on Sony's balance sheet, imagining a quick pay-off requires a leap of faith. The involvement of its partners should act as a safety net. But it also risks entangling Sony in a sticky web of commitments.
949;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-09-14T18:32:01Z;Sony in the pink with library of 4,000 movies;;Sony's move to take control of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is the Japanese group's second sizeable transaction in the media industry in the past year. Yet despite doubling the size of the music and movie assets at its disposal, Sony has invested just $300m of new capital.That is the amount Sony is committing to the MGM transaction, announced late on Monday after six months of negotiations.The remainder of the $4.8bn price tag will come from a consortium of private equity groups and about $3.5bn in debt financing, courtesy of JP Morgan and Credit Suisse First Boston.The MGM deal mirrors Sony's decision last year to merge its recorded music businesses with Bertelsmann's BMG division. That deal, which has triggered huge cost savings by allowing the two groups to cut thousands of jobs, required no new capital investment by either side.The two deals mark the latest phase in the evolution of Sony's adventures in the entertainment business. The businesses were originally regarded as trophy assets that bore little relation to the rest of the group.But under the guidance of Sir Howard Stringer, chairman of Sony's US operations, control of movies and music has become a central part of Sony's attempts to sell entertainment hardware in a world where broadband connections are becoming ever more popular.Yet the quesion remains whether the convoluted ownership structures Sony has entered into will limit its ability to take full advantage of new opportunities.In music, Sony will have to find common ground with executives from Bertelsmann, whose other businesses books, magazines and European television bear little relation to the online digital market. In movies, meanwhile, Sony will have to meet the demands of private equity investors whose primary objective is to exit their investment with a healthy return. Although details of the MGM consortium are still being negotiated, Sony's private equity partners are likely to demand the right to sell their stakes in a few years' time.Nevertheless, the MGM deal gives Sony access to the legendary studio's film library of more than 4,000 titles. Combined with its own library, Sony will control a huge vault containing what some executives estimate is half of all the movies ever made in colour.The combination should deliver large cost savings and give Sony greater clout selling DVDs to retailers such as Wal-Mart. But it also puts the group in a strong position to explore new forms of distributing movies in the digital age.Indeed, in a separate agreement on Monday Sony and Comcast, a US cable giant, announced a joint venture to develop cable channels based on Sony's enlarged library of films and TV programmes. Comcast will also offer its 21m subscribers hundreds of titles from Sony's expanded library via video on demand.One executive close to the situation says: ?Doubling the size in distribution will give some incremental sales. But the real value is how you mine it for new technology rather than existing sales, such as games and on-demand TV platforms.?Executives also predict that an expanded library will enable the enlarged business to sell more products to TV stations around the world and produce new versions of existing film titles.Equally importantly, say Sony officials in Tokyo, the deal could also provide synergies with the company's other businesses, helping to boost its prospects in an emerging battle over the next-generation DVD recorder market.A consortium, which includes Sony and Matsushita as well as PC makers Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard, is developing the Blu-ray DVD format, which is in competition with the HD DVD format backed by Toshiba and its partners. Both technologies enable the storage of more data for higher quality recordings. The acquisition of the MGM library will provide Sony with more titles to release on the Blu-ray format and for use on its other devices.?In theory, those assets could be leveraged across the entire group,? says Gerald Cavanagh, a Sony spokesman.However, the deal received a lukewarm response from Tokyo investors yesterday, with Sony shares falling 1.5 per cent to Y3,890 despite a slight rise in the broader market.Despite Sony's limited financial exposure to the deal, Standard & Poor's put Sony on negative credit watch, saying the deal could raise the company's funding requirements. ?This could cause deterioration in Sony's balance sheet and hamper structural reform,? the ratings agency said.Sony has been under pressure to improve the performance of its core electronics division after the so-called ?Sony shock? of last year, in which it unveiled an unexpectedly large operating loss. S&P also said MGM had reported net losses for three consecutive years. ?Given these conditions, it is uncertain what contribution MGM can make to Sony's profits,? Standard & Poor's added.
950;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-09-10T11:13:06Z;Eisner aims to stay at Disney until 2006;;"Michael Eisner, Walt Disney's embattled chief executive, is to retire when his contract runs out in September 2006.The 62-year-old who has this year alone survived a shareholder revolt, ferocious personal attacks from former directors, and resisted a near-$60bn hostile bid from the Comcast cable group, announced his decision in a letter to the board, released on Friday.His decision could spark an internal succession struggle in a management hierarchy that he created and dominated for most of his tenure, and which, in recent years has been disrupted by a series of high-profile defections.It is also likely to reinvigorate a campaign by former directors, Roy Disney and Stanley Gold, who have been striving since last December to have Mr Eisner fired. Their efforts contributed to a shareholder revolt last March, when 45 per cent withheld their votes for his re-election to the board.Within hours, Mr Eisner was relieved of the title of company chairman.Although Mr Eisner has named Bob Iger, his second-in-command, as his personal ""preferred choice"" to take his place, the board is likely to survey a long list of potential successors - inside and outside the company - as it prepares for the transition.Paul Pressler, Disney's former theme parks chief who now running the Gap clothing chain, is one name that has cropped up in recent months, along with Mel Karmazin, former chief operating officer at Viacom, and Peter Chernin, chief operating officer of News Corp.Mr Eisner who gave no reason for his retirement decision in Friday's letter, told the Wall Street Journal that he had not been influenced either by the Comcast bid nor the dissidents' campaign. The timing was ""not motivated by current circumstances at all"".He pointed instead in his letter to the change in the company's momentum. Analysts say Disney will this year yield earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about $5.3bn after $3.9bn last year.However, the ABC broadcast television network continues to struggle as it has since its acquisition in 1996, and film production and animation are struggling. In recent weeks the weather has taken a hand, battering Florida, site of the group's flagship theme parks.The continued poor performance at ABC may tell against Mr Iger, who has been given primary responsibility for turning it round, and who this year ordered a wholesale shakeout of its management.Mr Eisner, the public face of the venerable company for almost two decades, said in his letter that the deal was vital to the group's growth and claimed the ABC arm, including the ESPN sports television franchise, was valued by Wall Street analysts at up to $53bn.Referring to his handsome remuneration - one of the most persistent sources of criticism, especially during the lean years from 1997 to 2003 - Mr Eisner acknowledged that ""along the way, I have been well rewarded for my efforts and the company's performance"".The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, a participant in this spring’s shareholder rebellion, on Friday said the resignation was “the right move for shareowners”, and called for Mr Eisner to leave the board.“It is not clear to us how a two-year lame duck CEO will benefit shareowners, and his continued presence on the board would prevent the company from the clean break that is needed to restore investor confidence,” the pension fund said."
951;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-08-27T19:39:31Z;Investors line up for Adelphia auction;;"A number of private equity groups are preparing to participate in the auction for Adelphia, the bankrupt US cable operator that is hoping to sell about $20bn worth of properties before the end of the year.Providence Equity Partners, Spectrum Equity Investors, and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, have each partnered with regional cable operators to consider entering the process, according to people familiar with the matter.Investment bankers at UBS and Allen & Co, hired by Adelphia to run the auction, are in the process of dividing the company's assets into four to seven separate geographical clusters for the sale. These, rather than the whole company, are more palatable sizes for buy-out groups to invest in.Financial data is expected to be sent out to potential buyers in the middle of next month.Also expected to participate in the auction are Time Warner and Comcast, the two media conglomerates. They are the only two possible bidders for the entire company, which is the US's fifth largest cable operator with subscribers from Los Angeles to Pennsylvania, but could also submit offers for the parts. Cox Communications is seen as unlikely to play a significant role after its parent company, Cox Enterprises, made a $7.9bn offer to buy out the 38 per cent of the company it doesn't already own earlier this month.In preparing to bid for clusters of Adelphia assets, Providence is working with Bresnan Communications, which has a significant presence in Western states such as Montana and Wyoming; Spectrum with Patriot Media, which is run by cable entrepreneur Steve Simmons; and Goldman with Cebridge Connections, the Missouri-based company run by Jerry Kent, the former chief executive of Charter Communications.Initial indications of interest for the assets are expected to come towards the end of October, and a deal could be struck by the end of the year. The outcome of the auction is only likely to be approved by the bankruptcy court if it yields a greater valuation of Adelphia than an internal reorganisation plan that fixed the company's price at about $18bn. However that number may not be the ultimate reference as valuations of publicly traded cable companies have fallen recently amid fears of competition from satellite operators.Last month, John Rigas, Adelphia's founder, was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy in the company's collapse. Adelphia is one of the most notorious examples of the wave of scandals to hit corporate America after the bursting of the dotcom bubble. It still lacks audited financial statements, which will have to be prepared ahead of any deal to sell Adelphia's assets."
952;CMCSA;Comcast Corp A;2004-08-06T15:54:11Z;Adelphia sets out timetable for its sale;;Adelphia Communications, the bankrupt US cable company, said on Friday it would invite bids the whole company or its parts as it set out a timetable for completing an auction by the end of the year.With more than 5m subscribers in some of the most attractive urban markets in the US, Adelphia said its financial advisers, UBS and Allen & Company, have already held informal discussions with potential bidders. The sale process is expected to begin in early September, with preliminary indications of interest probably due in October.”Media giants such as Time Warner and Comcast were expected to be the most active participants in the auction, although a number of private equity groups are likely to enter the bidding for parts of the company.John Rigas, Adelphia's founder, and his son Timothy were found guilty last month of securities fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy in connection with the company's collapse. Any deals would require approval from various creditors and, potentially, US regulators.“We have been working diligently to assemble the appropriate advisers, information and documents needed for a robust and fair sales process to maximise the value of Adelphia to the company's stakeholders,” said Bill Schleyer, chief executive.Adelphia hired investment bankers at UBS and Allen & Company, the boutique bank that specialises in media deals, last month. Their selection, to manage the sale of the company's assets for an expected $20bn, marked one of the most prized investment banking mandates of the year on Wall Street.Time Warner has indicated an interest in buying Adelphia, even as it pursues Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the independent Hollywood studio.Dick Parsons, Time Warner chairman and chief executive, hinted last week that his company might merge its cable division with Adelphia, rather than buy it outright. Such a move would probably leave Time Warner with a controlling stake in the larger business.James Robbins, chairman and chief executive of Cox Communications, has indicated he will not make an offer for all of Adelphia.
