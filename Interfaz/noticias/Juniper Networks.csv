0;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2018-09-06T19:39:28Z;US tech groups seek key product protections from China tariffs;Letter to US trade chief says duties would lift prices and could lead to job losses;"Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks have issued a last-ditch appeal to the Trump administration to protect key products from being included on a list of $200bn in new tariffs on Chinese imports, amid growing anxiety in corporate America over the escalating trade war with Beijing. The four US technology companies said in a joint letter to Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative, that tariffs on networking equipment would increase prices for consumers and delay investments — possibly leading to job losses for workers and reduced dividends for shareholders. “If USTR were to impose a 10-25 per cent additional duty on networking products and accessories, it would cause broad, disproportionate economic harm to US interests, including our companies and US workers, our customers, US consumers, and broader US economic and strategic priorities,” the letter, sent on Thursday, said. The warning came on the final day of a comment period called by the Trump administration to solicit views on the proposed new round of tariffs, which comes on top of $50bn in tariffs on Chinese imports which have already been put in place this year. At any point after Thursday’s deadline, USTR could press ahead with the new tariffs, which are expected to be met with retaliation from Beijing, sharply increasing trade tensions between the two giants of the global economy. The joint statement marks a departure from the approach taken by most large US companies, few of whose leaders have spoken out directly against the administration’s trade policy despite harbouring concerns about its impact on their businesses. Public statements of opposition from the likes of Lance Fritz, chief executive of Union Pacific, and Tom Linebarger, chief executive of Cummins, have been the exception, with many executives choosing to let their industry lobby groups or business advocacy groups such as the Business Roundtable and the US Chamber of Commerce make the argument. Josh Bolten, president and chief executive of the Business Roundtable, testified to the Senate committee on foreign relations in July that imposing Section 301 tariffs without serious negotiations “unnecessarily places US jobs, families and our economy in the crosshairs of a rapidly escalating trade confrontation”. But Cisco and its three partners in the letter felt the need to speak out individually about the dangers to their business posed by the tariffs, since the list takes aim at a wide range of components and finished products that are key to cloud computing data centres, which sit at the heart of today’s digital infrastructure.Imports subject to the planned levies include servers, routers and switches, which handle data processing and communication. They also include components such as motherboards and memory modules, which are imported by big hardware makers to include in products built in the US, as well as cloud computing companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, which assemble machines for their own data centres. The tariffs would hit companies involved in building internet infrastructure at a critical time. The big US cloud companies, led by Amazon, Microsoft and Google, are in the middle of a capital investment boom, as they race to create cloud platforms to support both soaring demand for their own services and business from other companies looking to outsource their IT. That has also helped hardware makers such as Cisco rebound to their strongest growth for a number of years. Thursday’s letter — signed by Jeffrey Campbell, vice-president for government affairs in the Americas for Cisco; Michael Young, senior vice-president for global government affairs and public policy at Dell; Maria Cino, vice-president for corporate affairs at HPE*; and Meredith McKenzie, vice-president and deputy general counsel at Juniper — contained some blunt warnings about their sector’s prospects in a trade war with China.They warned that as it became more expensive to operate data centres and switching stations, internet service providers would raise prices for internet and mobile service plans — and consumers would be “doubly taxed for their internet usage”. They also said the rollout of 5G technology would suffer a “detrimental impact” exactly at a time when the US technology sector is competing with China for primacy in that area. The companies also worried that “foreign competitors in third country markets” would gain market share if the tariffs were imposed, and their own reduced profitability could bring “hiring freezes, stagnant wages, and even job losses, as well as harm to investors such as reduced dividends and erosion of shareholder value”. On Thursday a survey from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants showed rising concern about the possible impact of tariffs in the US business community. The percentage of executives expressing confidence about the economic outlook for the next year dropped 10 points in the third quarter from the start of the year, to 69 per cent, and just 4 per cent said tougher US trade policies would benefit their businesses, while 49 per cent said they would suffer. Other industries have echoed the networking companies’ prediction that the cost of higher tariffs would be passed on to consumers, with businesses from Walmart to Whirlpool announcing price increases in recent months.*This article has been amended to clarify that the signatory is Hewlett Packard Enterprise"

But buying a company based in a town called Sunnyvale is not the way to make them cheerier.Nokia on Wednesday denied reports that it planned to cosy up to California-based Juniper Networks. Shares in Juniper, one of a long line of supposed “Cisco killers”, had earlier risen by up to 20 per cent. They were down 6.4 per cent in late trading on Thursday.The denial should be a relief for Nokia shareholders. True, there are strategic arguments for such a merger. Nokia has struggled with a drop in demand for its networks business, which still accounts for 88 per cent of revenue.The 2015 acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent helped it bulk up, but the division saw an alarming 9 per cent drop in sales in the most recent quarter.Juniper would have brought more scale and big customers, including Amazon Web Services. And Nokia could afford it. With €2.7bn of net cash plus a respectable €1bn in free cash flow to come this year and next, it might even have been able to pay for Juniper in cash.Still, the mooted price tag represented more than half the Finnish company’s €23.5bn market value.It would have been an over-heated enterprise value for Juniper of about 10 times 2017 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation; Nokia itself trades at only 6.5 times.There is no superior growth to justify such a gulf; Juniper’s sales should grow less than 1 per cent. Integrating two $16bn acquisitions in as many years would stretch Nokia’s management.The non-deal will be disappointing to Juniper’s shareholders, given that the company’s market value has not exceeded $16bn since 2011. Cisco, avaricious in acquisitions, might be tempted, though the antitrust issues look forbidding.As for Nokia, its best move in recent years was a sale not a purchase: offloading its handset business to Microsoft for $7.2bn. That the Juniper deal seemed plausible shows the company is still in a strategic quandary three years later.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox?

Juniper has long been seen as a potential target for a larger player in the telecoms and internet networks market. Its shares jumped 20 per cent last night after a CNBC report said that the Finnish company was preparing a $16bn offer for the Sunnyvale, California based business.Nokia did not comment overnight but issued a stiff denial this morning which it said was due to the specificity of the report.“Nokia is not currently in talks with, nor is it preparing an offer for, Juniper Networks related to an acquisition of that company,” it said.Nokia has been an active buyer and seller of assets for most of its history dating back to its roots as a forestry company and rubber boots maker. It has strengthened its position in the telecoms equipment market, its core business, by buying out rivals including Siemens and most recently Alcatal-Lucent."

4;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2015-07-28T22:55:30Z;Citrix restructures after pressure from Elliott;Headhunters appointed to find replacement for chief executive Mark Templeton;Citrix Systems put its GoToMeeting video conferencing division up for sale and announced the retirement of its longstanding chief executive, Mark Templeton, in the latest victory for an activist hedge fund in the tech sector.Elliott Management, which has a 7.1 per cent stake in Citrix and which has been agitating for a strategic overhaul, also edged out the chairman, Thomas Bogan, who will step back into a lead director role.Citrix, which sells a range of business software, including desktop virtualisation products that allow employees to access their work computers remotely, has been struggling with the transition to cloud-based business software.It appointed Bob Calderoni, who Elliott has worked with as a director at Juniper Networks, as executive chairman, hired headhunters to find a replacement for Mr Templeton and appointed Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners to advise on its strategy review.The company said it planned to simplify its business by selling non-core products and reconsidering its capital structure.Mr Templeton, who has run Citrix for 14 years, said he would be “passionately and intensively leading this change” until a successor is found.He said GoToMeeting was aimed at small businesses, rather than Citrix’s core large enterprise customers, who were more likely to use Microsoft’s Lync and Skype for Business, and was not “synergistic”. Citrix’s perspective had changed, he said, on “where we should be investing more and less”.Citrix also reported second-quarter results that showed revenue rose 2 per cent to $797m and net income increased to $103m from $53m in the second quarter of 2014.Reflecting the shift to a new generation of cloud services, Citrix said product and licence revenue decreased 12 per cent to $205m, while software-as-a-service revenue, which includes its fast-growing GoTo products, increased 11 per cent to $178m.Elliott wrote an open letter to Citrix in June demanding the company focus on its best products, saying it had missed a “profound opportunity” to capitalise on the shift to the cloud, because of a sprawling product set and bloated costs.Jesse Cohn, head of Elliott’s US activism arm, will join the Citrix board and the hedge fund will have a veto over one other new board member.“We first invested in Citrix because we saw a substantial value creation opportunity for the company and its shareholders,” Mr Cohn said on Tuesday. “We are confident that the initiatives announced will allow Citrix to build upon its position as an innovative industry leader.”Elliott’s success in forcing its way on to the Citrix board comes amid an aggressive push by activist hedge funds in the tech sector. A week ago, Jana Partners won board seats at Qualcomm, the smartphone chipmaker, and also persuaded that company to launch a strategy review.
5;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2015-04-23T17:02:49Z;Ericsson: staying grounded;The temptation to match Nokia’s move to buy IP infrastructure scale should be resisted;The slick features on your smartphone are useless without the infrastructure that shoots data through the air. Network equipment is the circulatory system of the digital economy. Yet its makers are struggling to grow: most global markets have already upgraded to the latest wireless technology, 4G. Sweden’s Ericsson recognises the problem and has begun shifting towards higher-margin internet protocol equipment.IP equipment lets network operators carry lots of data on both mobile and fixed-line networks. Ericsson has mostly grown its IP business organically. Nokia meanwhile has made a big bet on the area by offering to buy Alcatel-Lucent, not only a wireless equipment supplier but also one the three largest players in IP, with a fifth of the global router market. If the deal closes Nokia will leapfrog Ericsson in IP equipment.Ericsson’s top line has not risen since 2011. Operating margins have slipped 150 basis points to 9.3 per cent over that period. Thursday’s first-quarter results suggest that the trend is not changing. Weak operating margins — due to foreign exchange hedges — plus weaker gross margins, especially in its networks division, disappointed the market. The shares fell 10 per cent.Ericsson could respond to its lack of growth, and Nokia’s move, in one of two ways. It could take advantage of Nokia’s distractions and try to grab market share. Nokia will spend the rest of this year completing the Alcatel purchase and then, if it succeeds, integrating it. Or Ericsson could play tit-for-tat by doing a deal of its own. One obvious candidate is Juniper Networks, the US IP equipment specialist. Valued at $9bn, it trades on a price to forward earnings multiple of 15 times. That is cheaper than Ericsson and might ease the decision, as would Ericsson’s $5bn of net cash.The first option is better. Deals are hard enough to get right when done from a stable position. Thursday’s results suggest that Ericsson is not there yet.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
6;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2015-02-05T17:56:31Z;Corporate raiders no longer outsiders in Silicon Valley;It is hard to overstate the psychological impact the rise of shareholder activism has had in the tech sector in a few short years;It’s been a busy couple of months for Jesse Cohn, head of shareholder activism at hedge fund Elliott Management.After nudging underperforming technology company Riverbed into accepting a $3.6bn buyout, he negotiated a truce with EMC, the storage group, and then laid siege to services company Informatica.With proxy season looming, Juniper Networks, which has been in Elliott’s warm embrace for more than a year, may soon be forced into making extra concessions.In Silicon Valley, the Wall Street raiders are no longer at the gates: they are on the inside, warming their feet by the fire and combing through the family jewels.It is hard to overstate the psychological impact that the rise of shareholder activism has had in the tech sector.With the high level of risk behind their technologies, need for constant reinvention and dependence on scarce engineering talent, tech companies used to think of themselves as immune from this kind of pressure. Why would outside investors risk rocking the boat?Now, a quarter of all activist situations are estimated to involve tech companies. It turns out that the tech exception was a myth. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case.The customers of IT companies seldom junk their old systems, leading to dependable revenue streams for suppliers. Along with strong balance sheets and attractive valuations, low-growth IT companies were an obvious target: all it took was a bit of arm-twisting to persuade them to cut back on their investment in a nebulous future and share more of the financial rewards from the current generation of technology with shareholders.One result of the barrage of activism is that much of the low-hanging fruit has been picked. One of the most prolific activists in tech, Mr Cohn developed a modus operandi that cut a swath through smaller public IT companies whose best years were behind them.Novell Systems (RIP, 2010), Blue Coat Systems (2011), BMC Software (2013) and Compuware (2014) were among those cajoled into accepting acquisitions or buyouts.The activists are being forced to turn to bigger companies where the battles are more complex and the outcomes convoluted. Break-ups of the kind being planned by Hewlett-Packard and eBay — both companies came under activist pressure — take a lot of time to pull off and have yet to produce much notable benefit for shareholders.EMC’s shares are barely up from their level when Elliott acquired its $1bn stake and started agitating for a spin-off of the company’s majority stake in VMware.Things have been working out better at Juniper, where the stock is up about 15 per cent since the hedge fund showed up. But the initial gains were double that and, overall, the investment has not done much better than the wider market. Returns such as these do not tend to shine in a bull market.It is still far too early to reach any conclusions about the final outcome of such investments. Also, activists hope to outperform in less buoyant markets: in theory, their downside risk is limited by both the low valuations of their targets and their ability to apply direct pressure to improve financial returns.There are other reasons for the activists to feel optimistic. While the aggressive tactics of a Carl Icahn still arouse a visceral response, their approach has become a less controversial part of the tech investment landscape.Interventions at Microsoft, where ValueAct helped steer a change in leadership, and Hewlett-Packard, where Relational Investors has worked behind the scenes over an extended period, have made activism a less dirty word.The other good news for the activists is that the number of potential targets is likely to increase, not shrink. The rise of cloud computing has intensified the pressure on old-line IT companies to carve out a new future and explain why their investment plans make sense.Since HP and eBay announced their splits, every IT conglomerate has been forced to justify its structure. Companies such as Cisco Systems (which has no obvious divisions to spin off) or IBM (which has already shed its less profitable businesses) may be less vulnerable, but the underperformance of their share prices over an extended period hardly make them immune to pressure.Agitators like Mr Cohn may still provoke fear and loathing in Silicon Valley executives suites. But for many, they are about to become an inescapable fact of life.richard.waters@ft.com
7;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2014-11-11T18:04:13Z;Juniper Networks falls after CEO resigns;S&P 500 remains flat as trading volumes slip;Juniper Networks, the maker of computer networking equipment, was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P 500, after the company’s chief executive resigned.Shaygan Kheradpir, who was brought over from Barclays and appointed chief executive in January, stepped down on Monday.Mr Kheradpir’s resignation came after a board review of his conduct tied to a “particular negotiation with a customer”, the company said in a statement, adding, that “the board and Kheradpir have different perspectives regarding these matters”.Rami Rahim is now at the helm of Juniper. He has been at the company for 17 years and previously served as executive vice-president and general manager of Juniper Development and Innovation.Stuart Jeffrey, an analyst at Nomura, said that previous management teams had promoted new product launches only to have “disappointing results” and that it could, in part, have been because the last two chief executives were from outside the industry.“This has resulted in an unfocused product strategy (at least until this year) as well as steep learning curves regarding Juniper, its product portfolio and target markets,” Mr Jeffrey said.He added: “We believe that the chances of Juniper generating revenue growth are materially improved by the appointment of Mr Rahim to the CEO role.”Analysts at Nomura raised their rating to buy, from neutral and boosted the target price to $25 from $19.50.Juniper shares fell 6 per cent to $20.23 and are down 9 per cent so far this year.Shares of DR Horton gained 2 per cent to $23.95, after the US homebuilder reported a 38 per cent rise in fourth-quarter orders.The company reported net income of $166.3m, or 45 cents a share, in the three months ended in September, up from $139.5m, or 40 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue climbed 33 per cent to $2.42bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of 48 cents a share, on sales of $2.41bn.The quarterly results included $21.3m of pre-tax inventory and land option charges to cost of sales.“The knock we have on DR Horton this quarter, is the same we’ve had for a few quarters now – too much in the way of inventory charges,” said Stephen East, an analyst at Evercore ISI.DR Horton has seen charges nearly triple, likely from pulling up land to sell its affordable line of express homes. However Mr East said he thinks the product is a “home run”.Shares of Zynga climbed 11 per cent to $2.75 after analysts at Jefferies upgraded the stock to buy from hold and maintained their $4.50 price target.“We upgrade to buy as Zynga’s fast-growing mobile business now looks large enough to move the needle, offsetting the headwinds around its legacy Facebook/web game business,” Brian Pitz, an analyst at Jefferies, said.Stocks were muted and trading volumes were down as US bond markets remained closed in observance of Veterans Day.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,039.68, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 17,614.90.

8;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2014-05-29T18:29:46Z;Cyber security fears drive Palo Alto;S&P 500 reaches fresh record;Shares of Palo Alto Networks, the cyber security software maker, surged after the company said fiscal third-quarter sales topped Wall Street expectations and it had settled an outstanding lawsuit with Juniper Networks.Palo Alto said the settlement, which will see both companies license patents at issue to one another, will cost it $175m. Both companies also agreed not to sue each other for eight years.Sales rose 49 per cent in the three months to April 30 from a year earlier to $151m.The company’s net loss in the period widened, however, to $139m, or $1.86 per share. The loss included a legal charges of $114m.Analysts with Citigroup raised their price target on Palo Alto to $76, citing both the absence of a potential Juniper-related royalty, as well as higher expected profits and operating margins.“Stock will probably immediately reflect the removal of the litigation risk,” Citi’s Walter Pritchard said. “This risk has been present since IPO and has made the stock un-investible for some.”Shares in Palo Alto ended the day 5.27 per cent higher at $73.17 while Juniper Networks closed up just under 1 per cent at $25.45.Apple shares rose 1.82 per cent to close at $635.38, its highest level in more than 18 months, after announcing a $3bn deal to buy Beats headphone and music business that will bring onboard Beats co-founder and music producer Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre.Twitter shares continued a three-day advance, initially rising as much as 4 per cent before settling back to close 0.68 per cent higher at $34, after analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald lifted their view of the social media company.The upgrade to “buy” from “hold” came a day after analysts at Nomura did the same, taking the proportion of investment banks who recommend the shares to nearly 30 per cent – the most since December.Cantor analyst Youssef Squali said the share price had much to do with unrealistic comparisons with Facebook, as well as the expiry of a lock-up period over shares at the start of May, echoing comments from a growing list of analysts.“We don’t believe Twitter has to mirror Facebook’s strategy or approach its size to be very successful and for its stock to generate meaningful returns over time,” he said.The analyst forecast that Twitter could double its user base over the next five years “while materially driving monetisation and increasing revenue/ebitda at [about] 50 per cent and [about] 80 per cent, respectively”.Mr Squali believed one comparison with Facebook was warranted, even if Twitter lagged behind its rival in size.“Given the advent of video, MoPub and better targeting, we believe Twitter’s monetisation should improve further, catching up to Facebook’s at $2 to $3 per monthly active user per quarter currently, driving much of the revenue.”Since the week’s start, Twitter shares have risen about 10 per cent.Shares in the struggling teen clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch jumped almost 6 per cent to close at $37.14 after sales fell less than expected in the latest quarter.Discounting and product overhauls narrowed the drop in revenues and led to smaller than expected losses for the group.Shares in Booz Allen Hamilton fell from a recent peak, down 6.39 per cent to $22.12, after the US consulting group announced the sale of 10m shares by an affiliate of the Carlyle Group.On completion of the offering, Carlyle will own about 45.8 per cent of Class A common stock of Booz Allen. The stock hit a high of $25.32 on May 13.Overall, US equity investors took heart from positive economic statistics to lift the S&P 500 index slightly to a fresh record high.The S&P 500 closed 0.54 per cent higher at 1,920.03 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.39 per cent to 16,698.74 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.54 per cent to end the day at 4,247.95.
9;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Lookout embarks on global expansion in war on cyber crime;;Lookout, the San Francisco-based mobile security company, is embarking on a global expansion as it plans to take on large cyber security incumbents in the battle to secure the smartphone.Armed with a brand new chief executive, Lookout is starting on the road to a public offering by targeting big companies in global financial centres who are worried about protecting employee devices from cyber criminals.The chief executive Jim Dolce, formerly of Akamai Technologies and Juniper Networks, joins the previously founder-led start-up at a crucial moment, as cyber crime moves up both the corporate and political agendas.One of the worst flaws in security software was revealed last week with the “Heartbleed” bug , which made two-thirds of the web vulnerable to hackers. Revelations about the activities of the US National Security Agency and the recent massive data breach at US retailer Target have added to fears surrounding cyber security.The market for mobile security products, such as Lookout’s apps, is expected to reach almost $3bn by the end of this year and $4bn by 2017, according to research group Canalys, as smartphone adoption soars.Investment has been flooding into cyber security start-ups, with early-stage funding for the sector rising almost 60 per cent last year.Lookout, founded in 2007, was one of the first companies to focus solely on mobile security, after its founders John Hering, Kevin Mahaffey and James Burgess started worrying about how hackers could attack bluetooth-connected devices.They made their names when they mounted a stunt at the Academy Awards, showing how they could access data from celebrities’ mobile phones – though stopped short of hacking them.Mr Hering, formerly chief executive and now chairman, is convinced that Lookout can challenge major security providers, best known for their antivirus software designed for PCs, such as Intel Security, formerly McAfee, and Symantec.More than half of Lookout’s 50m users are already based outside the US, but they are predominately consumers who have either downloaded the app or received it through their telecoms carrier. Users get the basic app for free or can pay a few dollars a month for a more comprehensive service. Companies will pay substantially more.Now, Lookout plans to open offices round the world in order to sell to enterprise. “This is a different strategy and requires more feet on the street than we currently have,” said Mr Dolce.Lookout began to expand into providing security to businesses last year when it raised $55m from investors, including German telecoms group Deutsche Telekom and Qualcomm, the chipmaker. It has raised $131.5m in total.“The incumbent security companies are not unlike BlackBerry missing the next generation of smartphone evolution,” said Mr Hering. “They are very tied to PC and have a hard time migrating to mobile.”Lookout aims to get “every major global organisation” using the service before launching an initial public offering, he said. “And then when the time is right for us to go public we’ll do so.”
11;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2014-02-26T10:46:07Z;Juniper Networks urges companies to be active on cyber defence;;Companies should “turn the tables” and actively defend themselves against cyber criminals or risk online attacks escalating into full-scale cyber war, warned the security leader of Juniper Networks.In a speech entitled “The next world war will be fought in Silicon Valley”, Nawaf Bitar told the world’s cyber security professionals the time had come for them to engage in what he called “active defence”.Juniper Networks is launching products designed to trick malicious hackers, sending them off on wild goose chases by changing maps of networks, storing fake information and providing wrong passwords.“Cyber attack unchecked could lead to real war,” he told the RSA cyber security conference in San Francisco. “If attackers shot down a passenger aircraft, we would go to war. What if they compromised air traffic control systems – would we not also go to war?”“It is time for all of us to turn the tables on attackers – or we can do nothing. We can continue to turn the other cheek and passively wait for the next world war to begin in Silicon Valley,” he said.Mr Bitar, senior vice-president of Juniper Networks security division, said the industry was under attack from “all manner of foes”, including criminal organisations, other companies, hostile governments and even friendly governments.The cyber security industry is being transformed as hackers get cleverer and a growing market for vulnerabilities, tool kits and data opens cyber crime up to people without advanced skills.Instead of simply protecting the perimeter of networks, companies are developing products based on the assumption that cyber criminals are already inside the network and should be stopped from accessing the most important parts – for example, customer data or intellectual property.Juniper has added “intrusion deception” to its security products, in much the same way as countries at war distribute fake plans and maps to confuse the enemy and waste their time.The software randomly generates fake files and responses to make it difficult for attackers to know what is real and what is not.“During world war two they created ghost armies with fake inflatable tanks to confuse the enemy – that’s exactly the way deception works,” he told the Financial Times.Juniper has already tested its deceptive techniques on a product to protect web apps, which is being used by Mozzart Bet, a large European betting company, and several financial services companies.Mr Bitar said he wanted to “change the economics” of the black market in cyber crime, which has spurred an increase in online attacks. “They expect to do something for an hour of time and get some useful information to sell, passwords, files, credit card numbers. If they’ve spent 16 hours of time and all they have is fake records, it changes the economics.”But he insists that the cyber security industry, sometimes called ‘white hats’ because they have hacking skills but use them for good, should maintain the “moral high ground” and not directly “hack back”.Kevin Mandia, chief operating officer of FireEye and founder of Mandiant, echoed Mr Bitar. “The actions of one company going on the offensive would affect thousands of other companies,” he said, adding that as hackers are already on the inside, they could easily exact revenge.
12;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2014-01-27T17:33:09Z;Elliott makes waves with activist broadsides;;Elliott Management, the US hedge fund, timed its recent attack on Juniper Networks carefully.Shaygan Kheradpir, the technology company’s new chief executive, had been in the job less than a fortnight when Elliott revealed it owned 6.2 per cent of Juniper’s shares and wanted changes in the way it was managed. Mr Kheradpir had barely had time to organise his new desk, let alone lay out his own vision for the business.The manoeuvre is typical of Elliott. The company, until recently little known outside the corporate finance world, is cutting a reputation as an aggressive and adroit activist investor, hungry to take on businesses across America and Europe.Elliott, founded by Paul Singer more than 35 years ago, has long been associated with the more traditional hedge fund practice of distressed debt investing.Until recently, the company was best known for engaging in a protracted fight with the Argentine government over its refusal to accept the terms of the country’s proposed debt restructuring.After winning a court order awarding it $1.6bn in Argentine assets, a subsidiary of Elliott arranged for the seizure of ARA Libertad, a $10m, 100m-long sailing ship that operates as a school vessel in the Argentine navy.However, the $23bn fund has been allocating more of its resources to corporate activist situations, in part because those kinds of distressed debt opportunities have ebbed. Defaults are at record lows and most companies are presently having little difficulty refinancing.At the same time, corporate activist investing has proved lucrative at a time of rising equity markets. According to eVestment, a data provider, corporate activism was the best-performing hedge fund strategy in 2013, as specialist funds returned 19.1 per cent for the year compared with 9.2 per cent for the hedge fund industry as a whole.Elliott’s particular brand of activism lacks the effrontery that has made celebrities of Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb. But in the scope of its activity, the hedge fund stands out from the pack.[Jesse Cohn] made a name for himself by not being afraid to challenge the status quo of these companies that a lot of outsiders view as being among the most sophisticated and intelligent businessesSince the start of 2014, Elliott has taken a stake in Wm Morrison, the struggling UK grocer, forced a higher price in McKesson’s acquisition of rival drug distributor Celesio, and prompted a reshuffle of the board of directors at business software group Compuware.A theme running through the hedge fund’s approach, say its executives, is “manual labour” – the idea that returns are to be generated by actively pushing for change, whether that be at a bond issuer that has fallen into difficulty, or a sovereign issuer that needs to be pressured to treat creditors better, or at a company with poor operational performance, an unhealthy balance sheet or weak management, or all three.Yet, to gain a better perspective of Elliott’s stature among activist investors, it pays to look to the technology sector.Led by Jesse Cohn, an energetic 33-year-old who grew up as a self-described computer programming geek, Elliott has rewritten the playbook for taking on America’s technology companies. Mr Cohn, who heads the hedge fund’s activism practice in the US, has turned the insularity of Silicon Valley – the very characteristic that many investors would regard as a barrier to engendering sweeping change – into a weapon in the launch of campaigns against 30 companies in eight years.It is a pre-eminence that was sparked by a chance moment in 2005.Elliott was weighing the merits of taking a small stake in Enterasys Networks, a little-known maker of internet routers. The then 25-year-old Mr Cohn’s interest in technology landed him the responsibility for the investment. Elliott pressured Enterasys’s management to sell the company to a private equity buyer, doubling its money in the process. Mr Cohn was readily given the task of finding more opportunities in the sector.One Silicon Valley banker, who did not want to be identified, says Mr Cohn has “made a name for himself by not being afraid to challenge the status quo of these companies that a lot of outsiders view as being among the most sophisticated and intelligent businesses”.The strategy has drawn criticism too.Elliott’s pursuit of Riverbed, a technology group that it is pushing to sell itself, has been questioned by some in Silicon Valley as being an underestimation of a respected board with a willingness to yield.Even its move on Juniper – which sent shares rallying 8.6 per cent and has since been backed by rival activist fund Jana– has been questioned as being merely an amplification of the changes the company was already enacting, such as cutting costs and increasing its dividend.Whether these, or other criticisms of Elliott’s approach will bring much in the way of comfort to Mr Kheradpir remains to be seen.
13;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2014-01-24T00:37:58Z;Jana backs pressure on Juniper for $3.5bn return;;Jana Partners, the activist investor, has echoed rival hedge fund Elliott Management in its bid to push Juniper Networks to return money to shareholders and cut costs.The move will add weight to Elliott’s bid to force change at the technology group, in which it announced a 6.2 per cent stake last week. As well as the capital return, Elliott has also criticised Juniper for hoarding more cash as a percentage of its market capitalisation than Apple.Jana, which has built up a slightly smaller stake in the company, has sent a letter to investors stating its support for similar initiatives to those laid out by Elliott, according to a person who has seen the letter.Jana could not be reached for comment.In a seven-page presentation lodged with regulators, Elliott set out what it called the company’s “severe and consistent” underperformance against tech industry peers, and claimed that “Juniper’s shareholders and the investment community at large are significantly frustrated”.The company had $4bn of cash on its balance sheet at the end of September and could afford to return $2.5bn in share buybacks and dividends this year, with a further $1bn in 2015, Elliott said.A spokesman for Juniper said: “The Board and management team have been comprehensively analysing the company’s priorities for some time, and we are finalising our review with a sense of urgency. We look forward to presenting the details of our integrated operating plan as we finalise them in the coming weeks. We intend to continue a constructive dialogue with our shareholders, as well as our customers, partners and employees.”
14;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2014-01-13T19:13:23Z;Elliott calls on Juniper Networks to return $3.5bn to investors;;An activist investor is demanding that Juniper Networks return an additional $3.5bn to shareholders, making it the latest technology company to attract criticism for building up a large cash pile.Elliott Associates, the hedge fund run by Paul Singer, revealed a 6.2 per cent stake in the company on Monday and attacked it for hoarding more cash as a percentage of its market capitalisation than Apple. Elliott said the cash amounted to 32 per cent of Juniper’s market capitalisation last week, compared to 27 per cent at Apple.By making its intervention now, less than two weeks after Juniper installed a new chief executive, Elliott is hoping it will be pushing on an open door. Kevin Johnson, a former Microsoft executive, left the company last year and has been replaced by Shaygan Kheradpir, a former Barclays executive.Juniper said the company “welcomes the opinions and insights of its shareholders and is always open to constructive input towards the goal of enhancing shareholder value”.In a 27-page presentation lodged with regulators, Elliott set out what it called the company’s “severe and consistent” underperformance against tech industry peers, and claimed that “Juniper’s shareholders and the investment community at large are significantly frustrated”.The company had $4bn of cash on its balance sheet at the end of September and could afford to return $2.5bn in share buybacks and dividends this year, with a further $1bn in 2015, Elliott said.To help fund the cash returns, the hedge fund also demanded a cost-cutting drive, including reductions to research and development spending that Mr Johnson put at the centre of his long-term strategy.Mr Kheradpir could also consider selling Juniper’s switches and security software businesses, Elliott said. Juniper’s third-quarter results in October showed decelerating revenue growth in switches and declines in security software, acting as a drag on better performance by its historic routers business.Elliott has become one of the most prolific and aggressive activist hedge funds at a time when increasing sums of money have been flowing into the strategy, giving funds more firepower to go after large companies.Last week, the Financial Times reported that Elliott was among the funds agitating for change at UK grocer Wm Morrison. The fund also recently agreed to select two board directors for business software group Compuware, where it has been fighting for control, and it made an outright bid of its own for Riverbed Technology.The revelation of Elliott’s interest in Juniper sent the company’s shares up more than 8 per cent on Monday.
15;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2013-11-14T18:56:34Z;Barclays to cut 1,700 UK banking jobs;;Barclays has told staff at its UK retail banking operation that 1,700 of them – roughly equivalent to one employee per branch – will lose their jobs.The cuts, which come on top of 350 job losses triggered by the closure of a Coventry call-centre last week, were prompted by customers’ increasing use of mobile and online services in preference to banking at its 1,500 branches, Barclays said.The bank added that it would try to achieve the cuts through a voluntary redundancy scheme.The announcement came a day after the bank revealed that Shaygan Kheradpir, its chief operations and technology officer had resigned. Mr Kheradpir, who is joining US technology company Juniper Networks as its new chief executive, had been responsible for overseeing Barclays’ vast cost-saving programme.Early this year, chief executive Antony Jenkins promised to cut £1.7bn of costs by 2015 as part of his broader overhaul of the bank. He later told a meeting of investors that cost-cutting was his priority and he was wrestling with the challenge of “how [to] eventually turn this bank into one that can operate with 100,000 staff instead of 140,000”.Barclays’ retrenchment from certain businesses round the world – particularly in continental Europe – has already cut headcount. But, contrary to expectations, Mr Jenkins has held back from making deep cuts to staff numbers at its investment banking operation.The retail banking job losses will affect a range of staff, from cashiers up to branch managers, according to the Unite union.
16;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2013-04-10T21:06:38Z;US stocks hit new record high;;US stock markets rallied, reaching record highs in spite of signs from the Federal Reserve that it might be ready to slow asset purchases in coming months.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.2 per cent to 1,587.73, surpassing both its previous closing and intraday high, reached in October 2007.Investment banking stocks led the rally, with Morgan Stanley shares up 2.2 per cent to $22.22 and Citigroup adding 2.7 per cent to $45.06, while Goldman Sachs rose 2 per cent to $149.46.The S&P 500 financials index, which has gained more than 23 per cent in the past 12 months, was up 1.1 per cent on Wednesday.The latest record came shortly after the Fed released the minutes from its most recent policy meeting several hours early following an accidental leak. The minutes showed several Fed members were ready to slow the rate of asset purchases due to signs of improvement in the labour market.However, the weakness of employment growth in March, if it proves to be the start of a weaker trend rather than a blip, would disrupt that timetable, according to Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.“Markets are extended at this point, but the rally has been led by defensive stocks, and any bad news, such as last Friday’s jobs data, will give investors incentives to take profits,” said Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.“We believe overall fundamentals are good and that the Fed will not slow the quantitative easing programme prematurely. Once the economy is truly improving and the stimulus is gradually withdrawn, markets will still be supported by positive growth,” he added.Broad-based gains were led by financial, technology and healthcare stocks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 per cent to 3,297.25, led by sharp gains in its biggest component, Apple.Shares in Apple rose 2 per cent to $435.69, but shares are still 18 per cent lower than they were at the start of the year. Microsoft shares added to their sharp gains from the previous session and were up 2.3 per cent to $30.28.Google and Yahoo also attracted buyers, rising 1.6 per cent to $790.18 and 1.5 per cent to $24.20, respectively.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies and is a price-weighted index, was 0.9 per cent higher at 14,802.24.Shares in Yum Brands, owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut fast-food restaurant chains, sold off in after-hours trading, falling 3 per cent to $64.74. The company revealed in a SEC filing that March same-store sales in China declined by an estimated 13 per cent due to avian flu scare.Juniper Networks shares rose 4.7 per cent to $18.84 after Belgacom, Belgium’s largest telecoms operator, selected the company’s T series core routers to increase its bandwidth capabilities, which will help cope with the explosion in online video traffic and the use of mobile devices to access the internet.Thermo Fisher Scientific rose 3.8 per cent to $81.34 after it made a binding offer of more than $65 a share for genetic testing equipment maker Life Technologies ahead of a deadline on Tuesday.Shares in Life Technologies closed 0.6 per cent higher at $66.60.Bucking the trend in healthcare stocks, Tenet Healthcare dropped 5.5 per cent to $41.14 after analysts at Deutsche Bank cut its rating to “hold”.Shares in First Solar gave up some of the dramatic gains from the previous session, when the stock rose 46 per cent after the largest thin-film solar-panel maker issued full-year guidance, forecasting $3.8bn to $4bn in revenues. The stock decreased 7.7 per cent to $36.32.Taylor Morrison climbed 4.7 per cent to $23.04 on its debut. The company priced its stock at the top end of the range at $22 and increased its offering by 20 per cent due to high demand.The company raised $628m, making it the largest IPO by a US homebuilder in two decades.
17;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2013-04-05T20:28:21Z;Wall St stocks hit by slowing jobs growth;;US stock indices recovered some of the early losses on Friday but recorded the steepest weekly declines this year after disappointing jobs data raised concerns that federal budget cuts are beginning to affect the economy.The US added just 88,000 jobs in March, far less than economists expected and the slight drop in the unemployment rate to 7.6 per cent was largely explained by the diminishing labour force.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,553.28 and recorded a 1 per cent drop on the week, the sharpest decline this year.Over the past week, materials and technology stocks were the worst performers, while investors sought solace in defensive stocks, such as healthcare and telecoms, which registered modest gains.“It is too early to say if the weak numbers are solely due to sequestration. It could be a payback for strong job growth in January and February,” said Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector research at Charles Schwab.“Markets had a very good run so far this year and we would view pullbacks, even deeper corrections, as buying opportunities, as we think markets will continue to rise in the longer term because our economy continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace,” he added.Technology stocks were among the worst hit, with the S&P 500 subsector index down 1 per cent and shedding 2.9 per cent over the week.F5 Networks was the worst performer, shedding 17.8 per cent on the week to $73.21, after a 19 per cent fall on Friday, after the maker of network equipment and seller of information technology cut its outlook for the first quarter, citing disappointing results from its North American business.The move prompted several analysts to cut their ratings on the stock. Piper Jaffray, Topeka Capital and Citi downgraded the stock as a result.The rating of rival Juniper Networks was lowered to “equal weight” by analysts at Barclays, and stock in the company fell 3.1 per cent to $17.55, adding to a 5.3 per cent weekly decline. Cisco Systems shares fell 2 per cent to $20.61 and were 1.4 per cent lower on the week.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 3,203.86 and was down 0.8 per cent on the week.Shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the Nasdaq, fell 0.9 per cent to $423.94 and lost 1.9 per cent over the week.Other large technology companies were also hit. Over the past week Oracle lost 0.9 per cent to $32.03 while Google shed 1.4 per cent to $783.05.Struggling PC maker Hewlett-Packard shed 7.8 per cent of its value trading at $21.97 this week, after losing 1.5 per cent on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks and is a price-weighted index, fell 0.3 per cent to 14,490.41 and lost 0.1 per cent over the week.Healthcare stocks were one of the best performing sectors this week, after the US government announced it would not cut a key Medicare payment rate but increase it instead. Insurers benefited, recording solid weekly gains.UnitedHealth Group gained 8.5 per cent to $62.10 over the week. Humana, even after falling 1.7 per cent on Friday, stood 13.2 per cent higher on the week.Shares in Aetna added 5.6 per cent to $53.99 over the week, although they lost 1.1 per cent on Friday.Even though energy stocks were largely shunned this week, natural gas producers rallied on Friday after data showed inventories decreased and were 1.8 per cent below five-year average levels, due to colder weather and less drilling.WPX Energy shares rallied 5.2 per cent to $15.87, recording a 0.8 per cent weekly gain. Cabot Oil and Gas rose 5.1 per cent to $66.53 and was 0.5 per cent higher on the week.Chesapeake Energy rose 2.2 per cent to $19.75, but still lost 3.2 per cent over the past five days.The rise in gold prices following the disappointing jobs figures boosted gold miners in early trade, however rally was short lived.Newmont Mining closed 0.6 per cent higher to $39.37, while Goldcorp shares added 0.7 per cent to $31.79.JC Penney shares rallied 2.4 per cent to $15.45 after analysts at Gilford Securities upgraded the stock to “neutral”.

Weekly jobless claims data on Thursday suggested March payrolls would expand by more than 200,000.“These data suggest improvement in underlying labour market conditions and corroborate the stronger payroll gains seen recently, plus 205,000 on average over the past four months,” economists at RBS Securities said.But investors also watched events in Cyprus, after the European Central Bank said emergency funding for the country’s banks would be suspended on Monday if no agreement was reached on a bailout plan. European shares headed lower, weighing on US equities.The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session down 0.6 per cent at 14,421.34, while the Nasdaq Composite led the benchmarks with a loss of nearly 1 per cent to 3,222.60 as technology shares took a hit.After markets closed, shares in Nike jumped 8 per cent to $57.92 in extended trading after reporting earnings per shares that were slightly higher than analysts’ estimates. The company said fiscal 2013 third-quarter saw revenues from continuing operations rise 9 per cent to $6.2bn, or 10 per cent excluding currency changes.Earlier in the session, Oracle fell 9.7 per cent to $32.31, after the software group reported fiscal third-quarter results late on Wednesday that missed forecasts. The company blamed execution issues and a slower ramp of new sales capacity.“We are always sceptical of Oracle having execution issues as we consider execution a core competency, with rigorous sales processes and multiple levels of deal inspection,” analysts at Macquarie said. “This time we believe it is more plausible given the many changes brought about by co-
president Mark Hurd.”Jabil Circuit reported a 9 per cent slide in fiscal second-quarter earnings, on the back of higher costs associated with its purchase of Nypro in February. Shares in the electronics maker, whose biggest customer is Apple, slid 4.5 per cent to $18.60 as it also downgraded its third-quarter outlook. Shares in Apple see-sawed throughout the session but closed 0.2 per cent higher to $452.90.Guidance from Guess saw its shares slide 7.1 per cent to $25.03. The clothing retailer reported better fourth-quarter earnings but revenues were lower, while the outlook for first-quarter earnings was cut.Shares in KB Home rose 2.6 per cent to $22.14. The homebuilder said its first-quarter net loss shrank to $12.46m, or 16 cents a share, better than a forecast loss of 22 cents a share. Net orders for new homes rose 40 per cent. Elsewhere in the sector, shares in DR Horton fell 2.1 per cent to $24.89; PulteGroup dipped 1.9 per cent to $20.99; while Lennar Corp slid 2.3 per cent to $42.40.A downgrade of Juniper Networks by FBR Capital to “underperform” put pressure on the network supplier, which declined 2.2 per cent to $18.87.In contrast, an upgrade for Dover Corp from Goldman Sachs, saw shares in the manufacturer of specialised products initially rise to as high as $73.67. But they later pared gains to end the session 1.3 per cent lower at $72.39.Oppenheimer raised Yahoo to “outperform” and the stock rose 3.5 per cent to $22.87.Other stocks on the move included Newmont Mining, the gold miner, which gained up 2.8 per cent to $41.51, while Red Hat fell 0.4 per cent to $50.99."

The CBOE Vix index, which measures implied volatility on the S&P 500 and is dubbed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, has risen more than 25 per cent in the past two days, however it is still below long-term average levels.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks and is a price-weighted index, closed a fraction higher at 14,455.82, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3 per cent to 3,229.09.“The situation in Cyprus has brought a lot of uncertainty to the markets, as now there are different possible outcomes after their parliament votes on the bailout package, but none of them are good,” said Channing Smith, an equity strategist at Capital Advisors.“If they go ahead with levying deposits, then potentially depositors in other countries will lose confidence in the system and could cause bank runs. Such turmoil is potentially very damaging to the rest of Europe, especially in the south,” he said.Earlier, housing starts figures were in line with expectations, but the upward trend indicates continued strength in the housing market. US homebuilders attracted buyers with the S&P 500 subgroup at one stage up nearly 2 per cent, before easing to a rise of 0.1 per cent. The index has increased almost fivefold since bottoming in 2008.PulteGroup shares rose 0.3 per cent to $20.82, while DR Horton rose 0.3 per cent to $24.31. KB Home shares rose 3 per cent to $21.03.In deal news Walgreens, the largest drugstore chain in the US, rallied after the company and its partner, Alliance Boots, agreed to buy a minority stake in Amerisource Bergen. Under the deal, Walgreens and Alliance Boots will distribute pharmaceutical products made by Amerisource Bergen for the next 10 years.Walgreens shares rose 5.4 per cent to $44.74 and have gained 20 per cent since the start of the year.Shares in Amerisource Bergen also rallied 3.6 per cent to $50.06 on the news.Cardinal Health shares suffered, dropping 8.2 per cent to $42.35 after the pharmaceutical company said its contract with Walgreens to distribute its products would not be renewed after expiring on August 1.Lululemon, the maker of athletic and yoga clothes, was hit after recalling one of its most popular items – black yoga pants – after discovering that they were see-through. The stock fell 2.8 per cent to $64.08 as analysts thought the recall would dent revenues in the first quarter.Electronic Arts shares fell 8.3 per cent to $17.15 after the second largest video game publisher by market value replaced chief executive officer John Riccitiello and warned that fourth-quarter profits could fall below expectations.Iron ore miners suffered after Goldman Sachs analysts cut the price forecast, citing seaborne expansion projects, increases in China’s domestic ore production and an escalation of steel recycling. The downgrade follows similar warnings from Deutsche Bank a few weeks before saying iron ore prices face headwinds because of slowing demand for steel in China as well as an abundance of scrap metal.Shares in Cliffs Natural Resources, miner and producer of iron ore, fell 6.6 per cent to $20.33. The company has lost nearly half its market value since the start of the year.Downgrades from investment banks hit some shares on the S&P 500 index.

20;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2013-01-30T08:37:57Z;CEE tech: Cisco snaps up Czech security group Cognitive;;"Nicholas Watson of bneJohn Chambers is true to his word. Just weeks after the Cisco Systems chief executive said he had written a blank cheque to beef up its security business, the US technology giant has acquired the Czech Republic’s little-known but highly promising Cognitive Security.The deal is further proof of central and eastern Europe’s growing clout in technology, in particular cyber security.Cisco announced on January 29 its intention to acquire Cognitive, a Prague-based company specialising in technology for network behaviour analysis, which allows businesses to identify, and protect themselves against, sophisticated attacks on their networks. The selling shareholders include the founders Martin Rehak (chief executive) and Michal Pechoucek, Credo Ventures, several angel investors, and board members/advisors including Richard Seewald, Vlado Jez and Karel Obluk. The size of the deal was not disclosed.The deal is an important first step for Chris Young, Cisco’s first executive for security appointed at a senior vice president level, who has been charged with overhauling the US firm’s security business over the next two to three years.Cisco is still the leader in the network security field, though it’s struggling as its legacy products lose ground to smaller innovative rivals such as Juniper Networks and Palo Alto Networks. Acquisitions in this space don’t come cheap, though, hence Cisco’s move down the food chain to foreign, early-stage innovators like Cognitive.The founders of Cognitive, which was a commercial spin-off from Prague’s venerable Czech Technical University (CTU) in 2009, told beyondbrics at the end of last year that their company was in the process of hunting for a second round of financing. The first round came from local venture capitalists Credo Ventures in April 2011, which invested a reputed €1m out of its Credo Stage I Fund that targets early-stage tech firms in the region, primarily from the Czech Republic and Slovakia.Cognitive’s technology first came to the attention of the US military, which was interested in its ability to monitor internet traffic for anomalies that could signal that a system was being hacked. “It’s like we are acting as the immune system of a network that finds strange or non-typical things in the body and these are highlighted,” Rehak said.At first only military or government institutions were interested in such technology because they were the only ones being hacked at such a level, explained Rehak, but industrial hacking has grown to a point where it has now become a problem at all levels. “This problem has become much more widespread and is now a standard issue for the networks of companies, both big and small,” he said.Until now, network security has primarily focused on securing the perimeters of networks, but “even if the door is locked, someone can get through the window and we can detect that,” said Rehak.This opens up lucrative new possibilities for a $10bn-15bn industry that has, to some degree, become commoditised. “Cognitive Security is in an interesting space, as the evolution of malware and malicious threats go well beyond the perimeter (handsets and PCs) and now deeper into the network where valuable IP and specific disruption of business functions is targeted by hackers,” Seewald, a member of the company’s board, told beyondbrics at the end of last year. “Cognitive offers security as a service platform which is scalable and protects against these advanced variations of malware for large corporates, governments and small business where I believe vulnerability will be the greatest in the coming years.”Related reading:

21;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2012-12-04T23:05:39Z;US tech companies hit downbeat tone;;A string of disappointing earnings guidance has left the technology sector among the worst-performing industry groups on the S&P 500 this quarter.The S&P 500 information technology index has lost 6.4 per cent since the final quarter started, compared with a 2.3 per cent decline for the broader benchmark over the same period.Having briefly ranked as the best-performing sector earlier this year, IT stocks have hit their current low mark as a result of slowing global growth, particularly in Europe and China, which has prompted downbeat earnings guidance from a number of high-profile companies.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said: “Concerns about economic activity not being as robust as many had anticipated from China and Europe have weighed on the sector.”The poor performance has been underpinned by weakness in Apple shares, the world’s largest company by market value and the heaviest-weighted US equity on the S&P 500. The iPhone and iPad maker in October published an outlook that fell well below market forecasts and its shares have declined 13.7 per cent in the quarter.Apple now faces its first year-on-year decline in earnings per share since the second quarter of 2003, according to Bloomberg data.Other household names to have issued negative guidance for the quarter include Ebay, Juniper Networks, Texas Instruments and Xerox. Of the 32 technology companies to provide guidance so far for this quarter, 29 have said earnings per share will fall below forecasts, according to FactSet.At present, that represents the highest level of pessimism for the sector’s quarterly earnings since the market research company began tracking the data six years ago.“Many technology stocks that investors focus on have really turned into large-cap mature companies,” said Oliver Pursche, portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services.“That’s a very different picture to what investors typically think about tech companies,” he added, citing large dividend payouts from Apple and Intel.One notable exception has been Cisco, the US network equipment maker and a harbinger of economic activity, which hailed a recovery in US demand and issued a surprisingly upbeat outlook in its latest results.The poor guidance comes ahead of what is usually a strong part of the year for many technology companies as holiday shopping moves into full swing, according to Colin Gillis, tech analyst at BGC Partners.“Management always has an incentive to be conservative when issuing guidance, but given the turmoil in Europe and slow growth in the US it’s worth paying attention to what they are saying,” he said.
22;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2012-01-27T21:39:58Z;Wall Street retreats from bull market;;"Fourth-quarter earnings season gathered momentum this week but macroeconomic news moved the market; the S&P 500 closed in bull market territory on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve forecast prolonged low interest rates, but the index retreated on Friday as US growth figures came in beneath expectations.The S&P 500 ended the week up just 0.1 per cent to 1,316.32. It had climbed as high as 1,333.47, a gain of more than 21 per cent from the close on October 3, as equity analysts said the Federal Reserve’s plan to keep interest rates low until the end of 2014 was bullish for equities.“The Fed intervention should turn savers into investors, bringing money back into the market,” said Douglas Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. “For the next three years at least, bank deposits will make no money, and even the most conservative savers can’t be happy with zero returns.”Utility and material stocks appeared to be the main beneficiaries of the Fed’s move, with both sectors gaining in a falling market. Analysts said material stocks offer a hedge against the inflationary effect of low interest rates – as commodity prices rise with inflation – while low interest rates would make it easier for utility companies to fund infrastructure investments.Apple, meanwhile, briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as its shares surged 6.4 per cent to $447.28 following blockbuster results on Tuesday. That helped the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite index to a handy 1.1 per cent gain over the week, closing at 2,816.55.It also triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.For example, Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $6.82, even though the company cuts its forecast for full-year earnings.But the news was less good for companies supplying other smartphone manufacturers. SanDisk shares tumbled 11 per cent to $46.70 over the week, as the semiconductor manufacturer said weak demand from mobile device manufacturers would hurt 2012 revenue, and announced it had put a new production facility on hold.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, fell 0.5 per cent to 12,660.46, lagging other indices, as poor fourth-quarter results weighed on several companies.Mobile phone network Verizon fell 4.5 per cent to $37.21 and rival AT&T was off 4.4 per cent to $29.16, as both reported unexpectedly large payments to their pension funds. Pension contributions also sapped margins at 3M, although shares in the technology supplier still climbed 2.1 per cent to $87.46 on strong earnings.Caterpillar was another bright spot in the Dow, climbing 5.3 per cent to $111.28 as the earth-moving company gave a bullish forecast for spending on construction in the US.But that was not enough to sustain a rally in homebuilders, which sold off on Thursday as December new home sales came in lower than expected. Lennar ended the week up just 1 per cent at $22.28, although the stock remains up 13.4 per cent for the year.With the quarterly earnings of 196 S&P 500 constituents reported, companies have beaten analysts’ forecasts at the lowest rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. Revenue growth is also set to outpace earnings growth, suggesting US corporate margins are being squeezed.The financial sector of the S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent over the week, although data from Lipper showed funds investing in US banks had attracted inflows for eight successive weeks, the longest such run since March 2000.Brokers Charles Schwab and E Trade Financial fell 9 per cent to $11.67 and 15.2 per cent to $8.19 respectively, as fourth-quarter earnings were hit by low trading volumes.Utah-based Zions Bancorp fell 10.4 per cent to $16.89, as mark-to-market losses on collateralised debt obligation securities hit earnings by $12.1m, or four cents a share. Brian Zabora at Stifel Nicolaus said Zions was the only regional bank he covers that still had exposure to CDOs, instruments which issue securities backed by the debt of low-rated companies.Netflix jumped 23.5 per cent to $123.79 over the week as the video-streaming and DVD delivery business said it had added 600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter to reach 24.4m paying customers.Shares are now trading at their highest levels since late October, when investors deserted the company after price hikes led to 1m subscriber defections.Analysts were impressed by the company’s update on international operations after a recent launch in the UK. “One can buy Netflix at less than 20 times [domestic earnings] and get a ‘free’ call option on its international segment,” Mark Mahaney told Citigroup clients as he reinstated his “buy” recommendation.Netflix is now up almost 80 per cent for the year, although part appears to be a result of short-sellers closing out positions as the share price has climbed – Netflix was the fifth most shorted stock in the S&P 500 as of January 13, according to the most recent data from Factset."
23;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2012-01-20T22:03:33Z;S&P 500 on cusp of bull market territory;;A week dominated by fourth-quarter results saw tech companies drive a rally that was belatedly joined by bank stocks and left the S&P 500 on the cusp of a bull market.Linear Technology sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks on Wednesday as the company said orders for circuit products had picked up in December and January, paving the way for a strong first quarter of 2012.Linear surged 10 per cent to $33.06 over the week while rivals Advanced Micro Devices, up 13.4 per cent to $6.42, and Jabil Circuit, which climbed 9.3 per cent to $23.00, benefited from the improved sentiment.“Historically, [Linear] has generally been right in guiding investors through the cycle bottoming process …usually seeing changes in demand before peers,” John Pitzer at Credit Suisse told clients.Wireless networking companies joined the rally on Wednesday. F5 Networks defied falling revenues from government clients to beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations.F5 climbed 12.6 per cent to $120.27, while rival Juniper Networks was up 9.2 per cent to $22.99, though some analysts were cautious about excessive valuations.“At over 24 times our full-year 2012-expected earnings per share, we believe more earnings momentum is needed to keep [F5] moving up,” said Rod Hall at JPMorgan.The tech rally accelerated at the end of the week as larger companies reported. Old tech appeared to dominate new as IBM, up 5.2 per cent to $188.52, and Microsoft, up 5.2 per cent to $29.71 outperformed Google, which slid 8.4 per cent on Friday alone to $585.99.On closer inspection, the contrasting share price performances were a result of very different factors.Google shares had climbed 2.3 per cent to the close on Thursday in anticipation of strong fourth- quarter results while Microsoft’s gains came in spite of a 6 per cent fall in sales at its core Windows business: analysts had simply been braced for worse.The tech rally left the Nasdaq Composite index up 2.8 per cent for the week to 2,786.7 while IBM and Microsoft helped the Dow climb 2.4 per cent to 12,720.48.The S&P 500 climbed 2 per cent over the week – now up 4.6 per cent for the year – and is on course for its best January in 15 years. The benchmark index has now climbed 19.7 per cent since its close on October 3, just short of the 20 per cent gain that would indicate a bull market.The CBOE Vix index of volatility in the S&P 500, commonly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, closed below 20 for the first time in almost six months on Thursday before falling to 18.4 on Friday, in a further indicator of bullish sentiment.But market participants warned against excessive optimism, noting high inflows into exchange-traded products that profit from a rise in volatility.“Risk assets have had a nice run of late but at least some investors are hedging their bets,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex.Bank earnings hugged the headlines over the week with investment banks the clear winners as Goldman Sachs climbed 9.9 per cent to $108.74 and Morgan Stanley climbed 10.6 per cent to $18.39 while there was one clear loser – Citigroup slumped 3.6 per cent over the week to $29.27.Investor enthusiasm for investment banking stocks was somewhat surprising, given the abysmal fourth-quarter trading volumes reported by most banks. Morgan Stanley was the one bank to buck the trend, however, while Goldman impressed investors by cutting deeply into costs by reducing staff and pay.“Expectations about pay in the industry have changed but clearly cutting headcount is not something that can be done every quarter,” said JJ Kinahan at TD Ameritrade. “Eventually, US banks need a kinder interest rate environment to generate sustainable earnings growth.”Bank of America climbed 7 per cent to $7.07 over the week, its highest close since October, as it reported a second successive quarter of profit, despite losses at its investment banking business.Credit card companies were the laggards of the financial sector with American Express virtually flat for the week while Capital One fell 5.9 per cent to $46.03 as the company spooked investors with higher than expected costs that pushed profit far below most analyst expectations.Goldman Sachs analysts said “further outperformance” by credit card companies was unlikely, despite several companies reporting an increase in outstanding loans and improving lending margins in the fourth quarter.“Spend volumes decelerated and expenses were elevated,” Goldman told clients.Overall, with 77 companies S&P 500 companies having reported by Friday afternoon, only 55 per cent have beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, one of the lowest rates in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“The market reacts positively to bad news [and] terrible earnings reports are ignored: [these are] signs of a bull market,” worried Mark Ivanhoff at Ivanhoff Capital.The rollercoaster ride continued for investors in Sears Holdings. The department store chain’s market capitalisation halved in the last two months of 2011 after the company announced store closures.But shares rose 46 per cent to $49 this week as an analyst suggested Edward Lampert, Sears’ chairman and a big shareholder, may take the troubled department store chain private, buying out other shareholders. Mr Lampert had increased his personal stake in the company last week.Marathon Petroleum climbed 12.5 per cent to $37.17 over the five day period as activist investor Jana Partners disclosed a 5.5 per cent stake in the refiner and promised to push for reforms to increase shareholder value.
24;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2012-01-19T22:09:43Z;Tech stocks shine as S&P 500 consolidates gains;BofA climbs on fourth-quarter profit;A strong day for tech stocks helped the S&P 500 consolidate gains to close above 1,300 for a second consecutive day, hitting a five-month high.F5 Networks rose 10.6 per cent to $120, after the computer network provider narrowly beat analyst expectations for fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a strong start to 2012, despite falling revenues from government clients.F5’s market cap has now increased fivefold since the start of 2009, leaving some analysts cautious about the potential for further gains. “At over 24 times our full year 2012 expected earnings per share, we believe more earnings momentum is needed to keep the stock moving up,” said Rod Hall at JPMorgan.F5’s result provided a fillip to other networking and software companies. Juniper Networks advanced 6.1 per cent $23.88, while Cisco Systems was one of the best performers in the Dow Jones index, putting on 1.3 per cent to $19.79 ahead of results.Semiconductor manufacturer NetApp was up 8.3 per cent to $37.51 on reports it could be a subject of takeover bids.Cloud business software developer Salesforce.com rallied 6.3 per cent to $114.51 as Canaccord Genuity analysts said the company’s recent weakness on new billings, could prove temporary, “and not necessarily indicative of [the] firm’s outlook”.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,788.33, but Google, the second most heavily weighted stock in the index, plunged 10 per cent to $581.35 in after-hours trading, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a large margin.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced just 0.4 per cent to 12,623.98. The S&P 500 finished 0.5 per cent higher at 1,314.50, a gain of 4.5 per cent for the year.The benchmark index is set for its best January since 1997, but analysts warned a disappointing start to the earnings season could weigh on the index. Of the 59 S&P 500 companies that had reported by Thursday afternoon, only 49 per cent had beat expectations, the lowest level in 10 years, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“Investors are now faced with losing the catalyst that strong earnings growth typically provides during reporting season,” said Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.Bank stocks continued to rally, as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America beat analyst expectations with fourth-quarter results, but materials, the other star sector of this year’s rally, sold off as profit fell at copper miner Freeport-McMoRan and Newmont Mining lowered its 2012 copper production forecast.BofA eked out a fourth-quarter profit on strong loan growth, although a lossmaking quarter for its investment banking unit weighed on performance, continuing the trend set by JPMorgan and Citigroup.Morgan Stanley declared a loss, but one that was much smaller than expected by analysts, as the investment bank bucked the trend to report an increase in trading revenue.BofA closed up 2.4 per cent to $6.96, after breaching $7 for the first time since the end of October in the morning session. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.4 per cent to $18.28. Other big bank stocks also rallied, except for Wells Fargo, which slipped 0.3 per cent to $30.15.Regional bank Huntington Bancshares fell 4 per cent to $5.79 as its average return on assets fell slightly despite a surge in lending, as the low interest rate environment appeared to take a toll.Freeport-McMoRan opened 2.5 per cent lower, before paring losses to end the day off just 0.2 per cent to $44.37. Fourth-quarter profit of $640m was less than half the figure for the same period in 2010. But many analysts had predicted worse results, after labour disputes hit production at its Indonesian mines in the fourth quarter. Newmont Mining fell 1.2 per cent to $59.60, after raising its forecast for gold output, but lowering guidance on copper extraction.Gas-focused energy exploration and production companies continued their torrid 2012, after natural gas futures, which have been plummeting for some time, hit a decade low.Cabot Oil & Gas fell 6.5 per cent to $63.09 and Range Resources fell 4.1 per cent to $54.06. Cabot is now off almost 17 per cent year to date.Ebay climbed 3.9 per cent to $31.51, as the company beat fourth-quarter estimates, thanks mainly to heavy usage of its PayPal electronic payments site. But some analysts focused on the less than stellar performance at Ebay’s core internet auction website business.“We continue to question the sustainability of the recent mid-teens core general merchandise volume growth rates heading to 2012,” said Brian Nowak at Nomura.Car parts manufacturer Johnson Controls slumped 8.4 per cent to $32.60 for the worst performance in the S&P 500 as the company lowered full-year earnings guidance, citing weakness in demand from Europe.But the aircraft part supplier Rockwell Collins climbed 5.5 per cent to $59.96 after the company said it was doubling production of parts for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner this quarter.First Solar slumped 10 per cent to $38.70, on reports the German government will cut subsidies for solar energy. The solar industry remains heavily dependent on support from eurozone governments for demand.Eastman Kodak, the company that invented the handheld camera, ended a prolonged share price slide by filing for bankruptcy. The shares were last trading at 36 cents.
25;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2012-01-10T22:12:55Z;Tiffany loses lustre amid sluggish sales;Luxury brands struggle in mature markets;Shares in Tiffany & Co fell 10.5 per cent to $59.94 as the luxury retailer it cut earnings guidance after reporting anaemic holiday same-store sales growth in the US and a decline in sales at its New York store.November and December sales in Tiffany’s Americas region, which includes Canada and Latin America, were up just 2 per cent compared with 2010, while sales at its flagship Fifth Avenue store falling 1 per cent, despite strong spending by tourists.Asia-Pacific same-store sales climbed 12 per cent but investors had been focused on developed markets since Tiffany forecast “weakness” in European and north-eastern US sales in December, an announcement which had also triggered a big share price fall.The sell-off suggests the rise of an emerging market middle class may not inoculate the likes of Tiffany, Coach and Ralph Lauren against developed market worries. “No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high-end consumer spending.”Coach fell 0.8 per cent to $62.33 while Ralph Lauren fell more than 3 per cent at the opening before recovering to close up 0.7 per cent to $147.32.Elsewhere, US markets were in bullish mood, with the S&P 500 climbing 0.9 per cent to 1,292.08, its highest level since the end of July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,462.47 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1 per cent to 2,702.5.“Everything is in place for a big rally,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. “If the market doesn’t break out now, I don’t think it’s going to at all this year.”Life Technologies rose 8.3 per cent to $46.17 after unveiling a DNA reader.But BorgWarner, which makes powertrains for engines, had the best performance in the S&P, climbing 12.3 per cent to $72.25 after forecasting record sales and earnings growth.Urban Outfitters, the clothing retailer, said Glen Senk, chief executive, had resigned on Monday. That sent its shares down as much as 11 per cent to $25.91 after hours.Elsewhere, the rally was broadly cyclical. Materials and industrial stocks were to the fore after Alcoa kicked off the quarterly earnings season on Monday. Alcoa reported a first loss from continuing operations in two years but was positive about demand in 2012. Its shares were up 0.2 per cent to $9.44.Alpha Natural Resources, which exports metallurgical coal to China, rose 2.8 per cent to $21.33. Cliffs Natural Resources climbed 4 per cent to $68.82.Bank investors continued to show signs of optimism, with Bank of America climbing 5.7 per cent to $6.63, while Citigroup climbed 3.2 per cent to $30 for its highest close in a month.“Absent new negatives equals a positive?” asked Goldman Sachs analysts, summing up the attitude of investors to large universal banks, which have emerged bruised but intact from big share price falls in 2011.Shares in Goldman climbed 3.8 per cent to $98.33 and Morgan Stanley was up 4.3 per cent to $16.89, although data showed trading levels in capital markets were down as much as 36 per cent compared with 2011 so far this year, which may bode ill for investment banks.Separately, Goldman Sachs warned against buying regional bank stocks, which have appreciated 20 per cent as a group since October lows, arguing price-earnings ratios were still high on a forty-year basis. Investors paid little heed, with Regions Financial up 3.8 per cent to $4.70 and Zions Bancorp up 1.6 per cent to $18.17.Shares in the New York Stock Exchangeclimbed 4.6 per cent to $27.79 on an Financial Times report that European regulators would block its merger with Deutsche Börse. The proposed tie up has weighed on NYSE shares, as Deutsche Börse’s price fell with European financials last year.A new year rally, which had seen shares in Juniper Networks appreciate as much as 10 per cent, came to an end as the wireless network provider said it would miss fourth-quarter earnings guidance. Shares fell 0.9 per cent to $21.50.Credit Suisse analysts said internet service providers would “continue to look to suppliers [such as Juniper] to deliver greater performance at lower cost,” as households consumed ever more bandwidth on unlimited packages, without corresponding revenue growth for ISPs. Shares in internet service provider WebMD fell 28.5 per cent to $26.25 as it pre-announced a fourth-quarter revenue miss and said its chief executive had resigned. Yahoo shares were little affected, up 0.3 per cent to $15.51.Most of the share price action appeared driven by WebMD’s decision to terminate “discussions with several potential acquirers of the company.” Speculation of a takeover by Yahoo had seen the company’s market capitalisation climb more than a third since October 6.
26;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2011-12-20T22:25:22Z;US data boost homebuilding stocks;;Homebuilders led a strong rally in US stocks as the S&P 500 enjoyed its best day so far in December.PulteGroup rose 10.4 per cent to $6.17, DR Horton was gaining 5.7 per cent to $12.43 and Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $19.68, as construction starts hit their highest level in a year in November.Home improvement retailers were boosted, with Masco rising 8.9 per cent to $9.82 and Home Depot adding 4.3 per cent to $41.93.Some analysts were cautious, however, noting that much of the rise was due to building works starting on apartment blocks, which hit a three-year high.“The report doesn’t signal any turn in fortunes for the lion’s share of the market – single family homes,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “Activity there rose by just 10,000 units to a 447,000 annualised pace and the highest in only five months.”Other analysts warned that Tuesday’s gains could be reversed by a change in sentiment, noting the high volatility of homebuilder stocks. All three large US homebuilders had fallen on Monday, in spite of a confidence survey rising to its highest level of the year.Broader markets bounced with the S&P 500 adding 3 per cent to 1,241.30 after its best day of the month. However, the benchmark US index remains in negative territory for December, traditionally one of its strongest months.The financial sector of the S&P 500 recovered ground after Monday’s sell-off. Bank of America climbed back above $5, a level that it had breached on Monday for the first time since 2009. BofA shares closed up 3.7 per cent to $5.17.Morgan Stanley climbed 4.5 per cent to $14.80 and Citigroup was up 4.6 per cent at $25.95.Jefferies surged 22.9 per cent to $14.50, its highest close since October, as the investment bank revealed quarterly earnings that were not as bad as expected.Profit fell to $63m, 23 per cent lower than last year, but many analysts had expected worse. The bank faced intense scrutiny of its exposure to eurozone sovereign bonds in November, but fees from investment advisory services rose year on year.“The results are better than expected but the share price reaction is overdone,” said Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga Securities.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.9 per cent to 12,103.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.2 per cent to 2,603.73.AT&T lagged behind the market, but was still up 1.3 per cent to $29.01, despite calling time on its attempt to acquire T Mobile USA.That was a fillip for its equipment suppliers. Juniper Networks climbed 8.9 per cent to $19.74 and F5 Networks was up 6.7 per cent to $109.39.“We believe this development is a short-term positive for equipment vendors,” said George Notter at Jefferies. “We believe that AT&T in recent months had significantly dialled back fourth-quarter spending in order to apply leverage in its fight with regulators.”Rival network Sprint Nextel also took cheer, closing up 9.3 per cent to $2.36.BlackBerry handset manufacturer Research In Motion suffered another day of heavy selling.Shares fell 2.9 per cent to $12.52, the latest losses apparently triggered by reports that as many as 5,000 of its PlayBook tablets had been stolen from a freight truck.CVS Caremark rose 8.9 per cent to $39.80. The pharmacy chain boosted its quarterly dividend to 16.25 cents a share from 12.5 cents a share.Eastman Chemical jumped 8.1 per cent to $38.70 after announcing it had broken ground on a new facility to produce acetate in China.Red Hat fell 8.9 per cent to $41.95 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. The open-source software company reported fiscal third-quarter billings that missed analysts’ estimates.Billings, a predictor of revenue, increased 23 per cent from a year earlier in the three months to the end of November.Cruise ship operator Carnival Corporation was one of the other five S&P 500 stocks to fall. Shares close down 0.2 per cent to $31.93 after Carnival lowered guidance for 2012 earnings.Zynga, the online social game developer, enjoyed its first day of gains since a $10bn IPO last week.Its shares were up 2.1 per cent to $9.24, still 76 cents below their debut price.In after-hours trading Oracle shares tumbled 10 per cent to $26.26, after the software reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. That knocked the S&P 500 futures by 5 points suggesting the benchmark index may open lower on Wednesday.
27;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2011-11-17T20:38:35Z;NetApp: watch the canaries;Selling information technology to big corporations has been a gold mine;"Selling information technology to big corporations has been a gold mine for IT enterprise providers in recent years. Companies handle an ever-increasing amount of data and new tools for managing it have emerged. Revenue and profit growth at the leading IT providers has been strong, even during the downturn. As with any mine, however, watch the canaries.With $6bn in annual sales, storage vendor NetApp is a big bird. Results reported this week may have the miners worried. Revenue was up by a fifth but below expectations; margins and guidance were light, too. The company said the issue was “an unexpectedly large slowdown” in nine of its largest US accounts. Customers are looking for low prices in a market where “there is a lot of capacity chasing deals”. NetApp’s shares fell by more than a 10th on Thursday.Of the IT companies that have reported recently, NetApp provided the biggest negative surprise. But there are a few other queasy-looking canaries: EMC, another leader in storage, said that it expected slightly less than seasonal revenue growth in the next quarter, a view echoed by CDW, the big technology reseller. A glance at recent quarterly reports from the IT leaders (IBM, Oracle, Cisco Systems, Juniper, Hewlett-Packard and Dell) shows that there is a reasonably consistent pattern of revenue and net income deceleration. But the slowdown is not severe and is perhaps to be expected as the rebound from the 2009 recession recedes into the past. Margins have only faded slightly.The core strengths of the IT vendors – geographically diversified corporate customers with strong balance sheets and products that provide demonstrable returns on investment – remain. But the industry is not isolated from the larger economy. If global growth sputters, the chirping will stop too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
28;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2011-09-16T21:40:30Z;Wall Street enjoys best week since July;;US stocks enjoyed their best week in 11, with the S&P 500 rising on all five trading days for the first time since late June. The benchmark index was up 5.2 per cent for the week at 1,216.01.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.7 per cent to 11,509.09 and the Nasdaq Composite index 6.1 per cent to 2,622.31.But amid the strong performance, a pair of previously high-flying tech shares were hit hard by falling expectations.Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, plunged after the company reported disappointing sales of its new tablet products, just 200,000 versus forecasts of more than half a million. RIM had been hoping that its PlayBook units could compete with Apple’s iPad. It also shipped 1m fewer Blackberries than forecast.RIM was down 19 per cent on Friday, and 19.7 per cent for the week, at $23.93. That is just above the shares’ trough of $21 in August, which was a five-year low.“With Android [phones] combined with increasing distribution of the legacy iPhone 3GS from Apple at aggressive price points globally, RIM continues to lose global smartphone market share,” said Michael Walkley, analyst at Canaccord Genuity.Meanwhile, Netflix, the DVD and movie-streaming subscription service, led decliners in the S&P 500 for the week, falling 24 per cent to $155.19. The company was one of the best performers in 2010, when its share price more than tripled. But it has been hit by subscriber losses after raising the price for customers who want to receive physical DVDs by post, as well as stream content online. It reported this week that it had lost 1m customers after the price change. On Friday, analysts at Jefferies lowered their price target to $190.Cyclical sectors were the top performers in the S&P 500. Consumer groups catering to discretionary spenders were up 6.9 per cent, and tech stocks rose 7.1 per cent. However, both sectors are still trading beneath their levels at the start of August, convincing some strategists that the rally is not based on a major shift in expectations.“There are only two sectors trading above their 50-day moving averages – consumer staples and utilities – and both of them are defensive in nature,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group. “Until we begin to see some cyclical sectors start breaking their recent downtrends, it will be hard for the bulls to get comfortable,” they added.The top performer in the index for the week was Textron, the aircraft manufacturer. The shares added 22.1 per cent to $18.63, as the company announced a swap of convertible debt for straight debt. Analysts said it was, in effect, a share buy-back, likely reducing outstanding shares by 12 per cent, according to Credit Suisse.The shares were also on the rise amid rumours that United Technologies, the defence and industrial conglomerate, was on the hunt for acquisitions. Its shares added 7 per cent on the week to $75.50, while Rockwell Collins, another potential bid target, jumped 17.3 per cent to $56.21McGraw-Hill added 16.7 per cent to $45.29 after announcing it would split into two companies following pressure from investors. The split will result in an education group and a financial group that includes Standard and Poor’s, the ratings agency.Juniper Networks fell 6.2 per cent on the week to $20.15 after its larger rival in computer networking equipment, Cisco, announced it was launching products directly aimed at stealing customers from Juniper. Cisco’s shares added 4.9 per cent this week to $16.62.Banking shares staged a recovery following an injection of liquidity for their European counterparts, when the European Central Bank announced a dollar-swap agreement with other central banks.The KBW bank index was up 6.8 per cent, although it is still down by 16 per cent since the beginning of August. Morgan Stanley added 7 per cent this week to $16.45, and Goldman Sachs rose 5.1 per cent to $107.49. But Bank of America cut its gains on the week almost in half on Friday, ending the five days up just 2.9 per cent to $7.23.BofA shares fell 1.4 per cent Friday after Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said the company was not getting good value, as it sells assets to shore up its capital base and assure investors it can withstand an economic slowdown.Analysts this week also notched down their estimates of the costs of litigation related to writing bad mortgage loans. Glenn Schorr of Nomura said, based on a detailed study of the mortgages in question, losses could be as much as $20bn, well below previous estimates of $40bn.
29;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2011-08-03T21:19:02Z;US equities turn positive;;US equities managed to steer clear of an eighth-straight decline, as a late-session rally in technology shares powered the end of the streak.The IT sector led all S&P 500 groups, adding 1.2 per cent. The move was primarily driven by sharp gains by MasterCard and Visa, the payment processing networks.Shares in MasterCard jumped 8.5 per cent to $323.90, after touching a record high of $325. Its arch-rival Visa added 4.7 per cent to $87.48.MasterCard reported earnings of $4.76 a share, well above estimates of $4.23 a share. It said payments on its debit card network surged as consumers used more cash and less credit to make purchases.Tech groups that cater to businesses also saw gains. Juniper Networks, which sells computer networking software, added 3.7 per cent to $23.59. F5 Networks rose 3.5 per cent to $93.35.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 0.9 per cent to 2,693.07, leading the big indices.Strong earnings have been greeted with scepticism by many traders because of reduced labour costs. A survey by Challenger & Gray on Wednesday showed a 59.4 per cent jump in lay-offs this July versus last year, while May showed only a 5.3 per cent rise.But that has actually given a lift to technology groups, the best-performing sector in the past month.The broader S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 1,260.34. It rebounded all the way from 1,238, its low on the day, and also a new low for the year. Its closing level is still below its 200-day moving average, but above the 1,250 level that bordered its overall uptrend since March 2009.Technical analysts said it remained to be seen whether these gains were a bear market correction or the resumption of a bull market trend.“We broke the lows of June, we broke lows of March. You don’t get moves like that without the occasional bear market correction,” said Walter Zimmerman, strategist at United-Icap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the poorest showing, adding just 0.3 per cent to 11,896.44. Selling of large-cap industrial groups suggested “long-term investors were betting on a slowdown”, said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet.The Dow’s steepest decliner was Caterpillar, the manufacturer of heavy equipment. It fell 0.9 per cent to $96.28. Chevron, the global exploration and production group, slipped 0.7 per cent to $102.76.Energy shares were the worst-performing sector, falling 0.6 per cent. Marathon Oil, a refinery group, paced fallers, dropping 5.1 per cent to $27.63.It was downgraded by analysts at Credit Suisse from “outperform” to “neutral”. They pointed to second-quarter earnings of 96 cents that missed forecasts of $1.02, and macro uncertainty. The price of crude oil fell sharply in the US and abroad, with WTI and Brent both seeing drops of 2 per cent on Wednesday.“We believe investors will probably wait for a record of execution … and that looks some way off in these markets,” Credit Suisse said in a note.Positive corporate news provided additional lift. Quanta Services, which provides construction services to power plants, jumped 10 per cent to $18.85 after it raised its full-year revenue forecast to as much as $4.6bn from $4.4bn, citing a strong pipeline of projects likely to be completed as regulatory gridlock ends.Insurance and risk management groups XL Group and Marsh & McLennan also jumped, both citing second-quarter profit boosts that topped analysts’ forecasts. XL shares rose 8.7 per cent to $21.77, while Marsh added 3.4 per cent to $29.45.Media group Time Warnerfell 1.3 per cent to $33.57 after it reported earnings of 60 cents per share. That topped estimates but advertising revenues grew by less than forecast, according to an analyst at Citigroup. “Revenues …were above our estimate,” said Citigroup, “but most of the beat came from films”.Comcast, the cable TV provider, added 0.2 per cent to $22.77. Its earnings similarly topped estimates, at 42 cents a share versus the 40 cents forecast.The maker of Sam Adams beer, Boston Beer, dropped 2.3 per cent to $86.65. It reported a big jump in profit in the second quarter, but lowered its full-year outlook, citing rising input costs. It said it would attempt to pass on price increases to consumers later this year.
30;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2011-07-28T17:18:36Z;European equities claw back losses;;In a volatile session, European equities tumbled in early trade before ending the session largely unchanged thanks to a modest rally for US stocks.Technology shares came under pressure following heavy overnight losses for the US Nasdaq index, caused by weak results from the likes of Juniper Networks.Juniper, which fell nearly 21 per cent, also hit European tech companies. Alcatel-Lucent, the French mobile technology group, also reported results on the weak side of expectations. Credit Suisse warned on the impact of weakness in the IP router market on European technology hardware companies.“Cautious guidance from Juniper could point to slowing growth in the IP router business globally,” said Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse. Alcatel-Lucent, which has about 9 per cent sales exposure to the IP router segment, fell 15.3 per cent to €2.86.Although Cap Gemini reported stronger than expected first-half results and maintained its full-year targets, concerns about the outlook for technology demand forced shares in the French IT services group down 9.2 per cent to €35.21.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended up 0.1 per cent at 1,089.24.The French aerospace industry remained unaffected by rumours of cooling demand in emerging markets.Aerospace group Safran led the Eurofirst, climbing 7 per cent to €30 as it boosted its profit forecast after a strong first half. The company, which shares control of the world’s largest jet engine venture, said operating profit rose with demand for plane parts that reduced fuel requirements.Shares in Safran’s domestic rival Thales also rose, up 6.2 per cent to €29.89.In contrast to the fortunes of its French rivals, Finmeccanica, Italy’s biggest defence company, hit a record low after underperforming first half profits and a cut in its revenue forecast. The shares fell 17.4 per cent to €5.76.Vallourec was another major faller, with its shares tumbling 16.9 per cent to €69.99 after the French producer of steel pipes reported an 11 per cent decline in second-quarter profit. Italian steel pipe group Tenaris lost 5.1 per cent to €15.51.Credit Suisse shed 1.6 per cent to SFr28.80 after the Swiss bank said it would cut about 2,000 jobs following a disappointing second-quarter profit, dogged by weak trading activity and the strong Swiss franc.Italian banks reversed their fortunes after Wednesday’s slump. UniCredit moved up 2.9 per cent to €1.26, and Intesa Sanpaolo rose 3.2 per cent to €1.62.
31;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Earnings cast gloom over European equities;;Debt concerns continued to plague European equity markets on Thursday, while investors also dealt with some disappointing earnings reports.The eurozone debt crisis continued to trouble markets, as Italy’s borrowing costs rose in the sale of nearly €8bn of debt, while Greek credit standing was cut to to “junk” by ratings agency Standard & Poor. Meanwhile, the debate in Congress over the US debt ceiling remained unresolved.Technology shares came under pressure following a 2.7 per cent fall for the tech-heavy US Nasdaq index overnight. Weak results from Juniper Networks caused the mobile technology company to fall nearly 21 per cent.Juniper’s results also hit European tech companies. Acatel-Lucent, the French mobile technology group, also reported results on the weak side of expectations.Credit Suisse warned on the impact of weakness in the IP router market on European technology hardware companies.“Cautious guidance from Juniper could point to slowing growth in the IP router business globally,” said Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse.Alcatel-Lucent, which has about 9 per cent sales exposure to the IP router segment, fell 8.6 per cent to €3.09.Although Cap Gemini reported stronger than expected first-half results and maintained its full-year targets, concerns about the outlook for technology demand forced shares in the French IT services group down 7.3 per cent to €35.96.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.8 per cent to 1,079.77.Finmeccanica, Italy’s biggest defence company, hit a record low with underperforming first half profits and a cut in its revenue forecast. The shares fell 14.2 per cent to €5.98 as the company slashed its expectations for the year, citing poor economic conditions and structural weaknesses in two of its units.“While Finmeccanica has been one of the poorest sector performers over the past three months, we believe the removal of profit guidance will be negative for sentiment until such time that management can convey a clear turnaround strategy,” said a Credit Suisse analyst.Vallourec was another major faller, shares tumbling 16.3 per cent to €70.44 after the French producer of steel pipes reported an 11 per cent decline in second-quarter profit. The fall was blamed on material costs, in particular the increased price of iron ore, which is hobbling steel product makers.Credit Suisse declined 2.4 per cent to SFr28.57. The Swiss bank said it would cut about 2,000 jobs after a disappointing second-quarter profit, which was dogged by weak trading activity and the strong Swiss franc.
32;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2011-07-27T20:54:23Z;Wall Street lower amid default fears;;US stocks fell on Wednesday, accelerating losses sustained this week as investors grew increasingly apprehensive about the absence of a deal from Washington over raising the debt ceiling and averting a US default.Global markets were in a “risk-off” mode, given the impasse in Washington, with Wall Street unable to gain impetus from good earnings results, led by Boeing and Dow Chemical.A proposal by the Republican party to raise the debt ceiling has been delayed until Thursday, as the plan faces a possible conservative mutiny.“It now seems clear that the market has the whole DC debt limit debate exactly wrong,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. “It’s not that the market will rally after Congress and the president reach an agreement. It’s that there won’t be an agreement until the stock market tanks.”The S&P 500 dropped 2 per cent to 1,304.89.Of the 10 main S&P industry groups, technology was the biggest loser with a drop of 2.95 per cent, followed by industrials, down 2.7 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.7 per cent to 2,764.79 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6 per cent at 12,302.55.In a sign that nervousness and uncertainty was growing, the Vix, an indicator of future volatility, rose 13 per cent and touched its highest level since March.However, Dunkin’ Brands, which listed on Nasdaq, jumped 47 per cent to $28.85 in its first of trading day. The company has raised $422.75m after pricing its initial public offering at $19 a share, higher than the range of $16 to $18 set by underwriters.Corning said its second-quarter profits dropped 17 per cent, as the speciality glass maker was hit by a higher tax rate, while its supply of liquid crystal display glass was disrupted by Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in March. Its shares fell 7.2 per cent to $16.04.Shares in Juniper Networks, a network equipment maker, plunged 21 per cent to $24.66 after the company reported disappointing results for the second quarter. Juniper also warned that the “outlook for the September quarter reflects some near-term market weakness”.But shares in Amazon were up 3.9 per cent at $222.52, after the online retailer reported higher revenues but lower profits late on Tuesday. The company still beat estimates.Boeing reported a 20 per cent rise in second-quarter profits and upgraded its outlook for 2011, lifting its earnings per share guidance to between $3.90 and $4.10.Shares in the aircraft maker rose 0.7 per cent to $70.63, after its net income rose to $941m, compared with $787m in the second quarter of 2010.Dow Chemical reported a 74 per cent rise in profits to 84 cents a share on sales of $16bn, which beat analysts’ estimates, and the company also announced the sale of its polypropylene unit. Its shares lost 2.4 per cent to $34.99.Ford, a day after reporting a 7.7 per cent drop in earnings from a year ago, was planning to sell a benchmark 10-year debt issue. The stock was down 4.4 per cent at $12.37.Shares in WellPoint dropped 6.6 per cent to $68.70, after the company reported better-than-expected results and warned of rising costs for its Medicare plans for seniors.The US debt debate “is weighing on markets but so is the weaker-than-expected durable goods report”, said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital. “We may be faced with a US downgrade but what we will definitely be faced with is weak economic growth.”Data on US second-quarter gross domestic product growth will be released on Friday.Durable goods orders for June fell 2.1 per cent, weaker than the expected rise of 0.3 per cent. Orders excluding transportation rose 0.1 per cent, and were also below estimates.“Manufacturing has lost momentum in recent months and it is hard to place all the blame on knock-on effects from Japanese supply chain disruptions,” said analysts at RDQ Economics.They added: “Motor vehicles have played a very significant part in the drop in durable goods orders over the past three months, as total durable goods orders have fallen at an annualised rate of 10.4 per cent since March, while orders of motor vehicles and parts have fallen at a more rapid pace of 23 per cent.”
33;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2011-07-27T18:55:46Z;Juniper shares tumble 20% on weak results;;Shares in Juniper Networks fell by more than 20 per cent in early trading after the US-based manufacturer of advanced networking equipment reported disappointing second-quarter results and warned of a weak “near-term” sales outlook.The sell-off was the biggest percentage drop on the New York Stock Exchange – down $6.40 at $24.77.It wiped out more than $3bn of Juniper’s market capitalisation and triggered a broad technology stock retreat with shares in other networking equipment companies particularly hard hit. Shares in Alcatel Lucent, Cisco, Ciena, JDS Uniphase and Brocade Communications were all marked down.Late on Tuesday the Sunnyvale, California-based company reported that its second-quarter profits fell by 11.4 per cent to $115.6m on one-time charges.Juniper, which counts leading telecoms groups including AT&T, Verizon Communications and Japan’s NTT DoCoMo among its customers, was also downbeat about the current quarter, citing three factors – customers delaying spending, US government agencies cutting budgets and the aftermath of March’s earthquake and tsunami in Japan.“While the long-term fundamentals driving demand for networking solutions are healthy, our outlook for the September quarter reflects some near-term market weakness due primarily to the timing of certain service provider deployments,” the company said. “Our overall pipeline is strong and we anticipate many of our recent design wins will begin translating to revenue late in 2011.”Nevertheless, the warning led some analysts to downgrade their estimates. Goldman Sachs removed the company from its conviction buy list and Piper Jaffray and Wedbush Securities cut their price targets because of growing uncertainty about IT spending and competition.Over time, network equipment makers are still widely expected to receive a boost from the rapid growth in mobile computing on smartphones and PC tablets because telecoms companies need to upgrade and expand their networks to cope with increased traffic.But, as George Notter, analyst with Jefferies & Co wrote in a note to investors: “The reallocation of carrier capital expenditure budgets toward wireless capital spending is having a more significant impact on the business than we had previously anticipated.”
34;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

36;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2011-05-05T22:12:23Z;Economic data weigh on Wall Street;;US equities continued to retreat from the multiyear highs reached last week, led lower by energy and material stocks as risk appetite was sapped by disappointing economic data and a mixed set of earnings reports.The big corporate news of the session was from General Motors, the largest of the Detroit carmakers, which reported a tripling in first-quarter earnings to $3.2bn.But this hefty growth in profits failed to impress investors as much of the improvement was due to one-time gains from the sale of stakes in former affiliates. The stock was down 3.1 per cent to $32.02 and the larger S&P auto index fell 0.4 per cent.In the wider markets, sentiment was weaker after weekly employment data showed that the number of jobless claims had unexpectedly surged to the highest level in eight months, raising concerns about the strength of the US labour market.This disappointing data followed weaker-than-expected ADP jobs data on Wednesday and bodes badly for the all-important official non-farm payroll data set to be released on Friday.These concerns left the S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,335.03, the fourth consecutive losing session on the index.The losses over the past week have been led by energy and material stocks as commodity prices have softened. This theme continued on Thursday as commodity prices plummeted.In the energy sector, Murphy Oil was down 6.4 per cent to $68.57 while ExxonMobil lost 2.6 per cent to $82.62. The S&P energy index fell 2.3 per cent, adding to the 5.1 per cent drop already this week.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, lost 2.5 per cent to $49.85 while Peabody Energy was down 3.6 per cent to $61.27. The S&P materials index was 1.3 per cent lower.Transport stocks were given a boost by the tumbling oil price, however, and the Dow transport index was up 1.1 per cent.But the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1 per cent to 12,583.11 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,814.72.The recent downturn follows a raft of technical highs achieved by large benchmark indices last week. In the final few days of April, the S&P rose to a 35-month high, the Nasdaq reached a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.“It is not clear yet if this is just a traditional correction following some technical highs, or it is the beginning of something more significant,” said Jonathan Lewis, chairman of the investment committee at Samson Capital Advisors.“Some unsettling questions have been raised of late by weak data on housing, manufacturing and gross domestic product growth,” he added.Late last month, government figures showed that US GDP growth slowed to 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2011 as rising oil prices weighed on consumer demand and government spending fell.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in JDS Uniphase bounced 6.9 per cent higher to $21.38 after the maker of optical communications reported a swing into a third-quarter profit, beating expectations with both its earnings and revenues.This helped the wider technology sector record some of the smallest losses on Wall Street. Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone maker, was up 3.8 per cent to $24.98 while Juniper Networks added 0.7 per cent to $37.54. The S&P technology index was down only 0.5 per cent.In other positive news, Whole Foods Market, the natural and organic grocer, reported a 33 per cent rise in second-quarter profit and lifted its full-year earnings forecast. Shares in the company were up 0.4 per cent to $59.95.Since the earnings season began, however, the number of companies that have beaten expectations with their results has been in decline.Two weeks after the start of the season in early April, 80 per cent of companies had beaten analysts’ expectations with their quarterly earnings results. At the end of April, the positive surprise rate was 76 per cent, but now the rate stands at 73 per cent with slightly more than 100 companies left to report.Elsewhere, Kindle International soared 57.7 per cent to $14.98 after privately held INC Research agreed to buy the clinical research company late on Wednesday for $232m.Shares in CVS Caremark added 1.9 per cent to $36.79 after the drugstore and pharmacy company reported earnings that beat analysts’ expectations, although profits were down and margins were slimmer.
37;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2011-05-02T20:33:13Z;CEOs’ mantra requires vigilance;Gap between thought, word and deed is often large;Effective immediately. The phrase – often attached to urgent appointments or dismissals of front-line staff – could be a mantra for chief executives. It is a two-word summary of what many business leaders believe is their purpose: to get things done now. It seems to say: “Not only did I identify the problem, but by the time you read this, I will have dealt with it and moved on to the next challenge.”Yet the gap between thought, word and deed in modern management of any company is often a large one. Bridging it successfully is an unending task, requiring constant attention.In the all-too-brief interlude of corporate self-examination that followed the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the scandals of the early 2000s, Larry Bossidy, hard-headed former chief executive of AlliedSignal and Honeywell, and academic and consultant Ram Charan found a sweet spot in management literature with two books, Execution and Confronting Reality, that took business leaders to task for neglecting the “how” of their jobs in favour of highfalutin discussion of strategy.Bossidy and Charan’s second book underlined the point that chief executives who fell prey to “the six habits of highly unrealistic leaders” (selective hearing, wishful thinking, emotional overinvestment and so on) would fail. Among leaders they praised for their ultra-realistic approach was Cisco Systems’ John Chambers for the way he had led the company out of the dotcom bust.Nine years on, Mr Chambers, who has been at the helm of the US technology equipment company since 1995, is suddenly having to confront reality again. In an internal memo last month, he defended the core strategy of supplying the kit that makes networks more competitive, but criticised the company for poor execution, sluggish decision-making and a loss of focus, discipline and accountability. He and his chief operating officer (appointed in February, “effective immediately”), have started a process of simplification and internal restructuring.Latterly, Cisco has expanded too fast in too many directions. For a company that specialises in supplying the plumbing of the internet – switchers and other hardware sold to business customers – the move into consumer products such as the Flip video camera was the equivalent of branching out into showerheads and shaving mirrors. Within days of his memo, Mr Chambers announced the business would be closed.But the management challenge for Cisco, which still holds a powerful position in its core business, also looks similar to that facing Nokia, where Stephen Elop, another chief executive who chose to voice his concerns in a memo, is trying to instil more accountability into a market leader that has lost focus. Like the Finnish mobile phone maker, Cisco faces competitors, such as Hewlett-Packard, Juniper Networks and Huawei of China, that are gnawing at its core business with products perceived as cheaper or more innovative. Like Nokia, Cisco has a series of cross-functional internal boards criticised for adding to the complexity of decision-making – though there is no sign as yet that Mr Chambers, their architect, wants to demolish them, as Mr Elop has.The difference is that while Mr Chambers continues to adhere to the strategy he has followed for a decade or more, Mr Elop – as a new chief executive – is pursuing a path that breaks with the past, by allying with Microsoft as software provider for Nokia’s smartphones.Bossidy and Charan were taken to task for implying in their first book that leadership was mainly about action not reflection, execution not strategy. It is a false distinction. In certain circumstances – including those now faced by Cisco – it is important to change how the company works, rather than what it does. In others – as at Nokia – executives need to address both areas simultaneously. But the consequence of neglecting either is the same.In his memo, Mr Chambers managed deftly to indulge in self-criticism (for missing the problem) and self-congratulation (for spotting it).

But if the leader says his strategy is sound and it is not, or champions better execution and then fails to improve it, the leader will take the fall. Effective immediately.andrew.hill@ft.com
38;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2011-02-04T21:48:47Z;Wall St shrugs off weak jobs data;;Wall Street edged higher led by tech stocks as investors shrugged off weak January employment data.The S&P technology index was up 1.1 per cent to 472.98 headed by JDS Uniphase after the company posted forecast-beating second-quarter earnings.The maker of communications equipment for telecom and cable companies was up 29.9 per cent to $22.75 after reporting revenues up 38 per cent and earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations.Related technology stocks were lifted by the news. F5 Networks, a cloud computing software maker, was up 4.6 per cent to $123.64 while Juniper Networks, the world’s second-biggest maker of data networking equipment gained 4.1 per cent to $40.06.But the key event concerning the markets was the January non-farm payroll figures, which showed that only 36,000 new jobs had been created last month. Economists had expected 136,000.Traders were left unsure which way to turn for much of the day, however, after the data also showed that the unemployment rate had fallen to its lowest level since April 2009. Unemployment was expected to rise slightly, but instead fell to 9 per cent from 9.4 per cent. This was partly caused by a fall in the size of the labour force, however. Many commentators were quick to point out that the headline 36,000 figure was not as bad as it seemed as the adverse weather conditions during the sampling week would have skewed the data.Ira Jersey, a US interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse, said: “The results were not as bad as they seemed. At best, the results were expected and at worse they were a little below consensus,” Mr Jersey said.Equities were in negative territory for much of the day, but rallied in late trade as investors finally concluded that the data was an aberration. “We discounted today’s headline employment figure because of the poor weather during the sampling week,” said Bob Baur chief global economist at Principal Global Investors.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,310.87, helping the index gain 1.9 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to close at 12,092.15, the first time the index has ended a week above 12,000 since June 13, 2008. The index was up 1.7 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent in the session to 2,769.30, a rise of 2.6 per cent over the past five days.Also preventing the markets from losing ground over the employment numbers on Friday was the fact that the whole week had seen promising economic data. The ADP employment survey on Wednesday estimated that 187,000 non-farm private jobs were added in January. Figures from the Labor Department on Thursday showed job increases last month, and other reports showed strong manufacturing and service sector growth in the US economy.In other earnings news Las Vegas Sands posted disappointing fourth-quarter results, sending shares in casino stocks lower. The global casino group saw profit and revenue jump in the quarter, helped by growth in its Macao and Singapore operations, but investors had hoped for greater revenues and so the shares tumbled 8.5 per cent to $46.03.This weighed on related stocks. Wynn Resorts, another US casino operator, was down 1.1 per cent to $118.06 while MGM Resorts was 2.2 per cent lower at $14.81.Elsewhere, Power One, which makes power converters, were down 21.2 per cent to $9.26 after giving a weak first-quarter revenue outlook. This came despite the company posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.Coinstar, the vending machine and DVD rental kiosk operator, was down 11.9 per cent to $38.96 after saying that its first-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street’s expectations.The week on Wall Street began with a rebound following the sharp 1.8 per cent losses seen at the end of the previous week.This was helped on Monday by near record quarterly profits from Exxon-Mobil and news on Tuesday that Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, reported a threefold rise in quarterly profits. ExxonMobil was up 3.2 per cent to $83.28 over the week while Pfizer added 5.9 per cent to $19.30.Strong economic data also lifted sentiment. Solid data on consumer spending, manufacturing and employment gave investors cause to be hopeful about the pace of the US recovery.After healthy gains on Monday and Tuesday, however, Wall Street stalled.The S&P kept just above the 1,300 mark while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was just above 12,000.
39;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2010-11-11T19:03:08Z;Technology stocks lead Wall Street losses;;A cautious outlook from Cisco sent the technology company’s shares tumbling and dragged down US stocks.Cisco dropped 16.2 per cent to $20.52, pulling down the S&P 500 information technology index by 1.8 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,213.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to close at 11,283.10 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.9 per cent lower at 2,555.52.The world’s largest maker of computer networking equipment forecast sales and profits lower than analysts had estimated.John Chambers, chief executive, said the company faced a “challenging economic environment” and that it had missed revenue expectations in the quarter because of an unexpected drop-off in spending by the public sector, especially in Europe.It predicted that revenue would grow by 3-5 per cent in the second quarter, much less than the consensus forecast for a 13 per cent increase.Analysts at JPMorgan, who lowered their price target for the stock to $24.50 but kept its “overweight”’ rating, said: “Government spending was a risk but we believe that Cisco guidance indicates that this large part of the global economy, particularly US state and European governments, may be deteriorating rapidly.“Guidance for full-year revenue growth of 9-12 per cent seems ambitious to us considering the speed and severity of this reduction – our new forecast is for 6.4 per cent revenue growth for the full fiscal year.”They added that as Cisco said it was gaining share in seven of its nine largest markets, this was probably an early sign of a wider problem and not Cisco-specific.Brad Thompson, fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors, which owns Cisco shares, said: “We’re taking a pretty close look at it.”“Technology is currently the most consensus trade among institutional investors,” he added. “Everybody is pretty much placing a bet in that space but Cisco is a bellwether with its tentacles in business and government.”Shares in Cisco’s rivals also suffered with Cavium Networks 4.4 per cent lower at $34.53.Mr Thompson said the drop in government spending would affect other parts of the technology supply chain, as well as the money flowing from government to healthcare and defence companies.Among the suppliers, Jabil Circuit gave up 4.6 per cent to $14.40, Altera fell 2.8 per cent to $32.90 and Xilnix was down 3.3 per cent to $26.50.Other technology stocks also slumped with Dell falling 3.9 per cent to $13.93 and Hewlett-Packard losing 2.4 per cent to $43.10.Elsewhere in earnings news, Disney reported late in the trading session. Shares slumped 2.9 per cent to $35.93 after it missed profit estimates in its fourth quarter.Income from pay-TV services for ESPN which last year was recorded in the fourth quarter, came in an earlier quarter this year. This outweighed strong advertising sales and receipts for films including Toy Story 3.Viacom gained 3.1 per cent to $44.59 after it beat analysts’ estimates with its fourth-quarter profit. The owner of MTV Networks and Comedy Central joined other cable operators in reporting results buoyed by higher advertising sales.The popularity of its hit show Jersey Shore helped viewing figures and advertising revenue rose 8 per cent. The company also said it planned to sell Harmonix, the Rock Band music video game developer.In retail, Kohl’s department store chain forecast profits and sales in its fourth quarter that were above some analysts’ expectations. The retailer reported quarterly profit in line with expectations and said it had gained market share. Its shares edged up 0.3 per cent to $52.41.Rival Macy’s reported strong earnings on Wednesday, which buoyed other department store stocks.In financials, Bank of America dropped 1.6 per cent to $12.37 after it said it would sell its right to buy extra shares in a $9.3bn rights issue by the China Construction Bank to the Singapore state investment agency.
40;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2010-11-11T00:58:02Z;Investor fears hit Cisco shares;;Cisco Systems’ share price dropped 14 per cent in spite of the technology company reporting better than expected first-quarter earnings as investors showed concern over the group’s direction.Its lacklustre quarterly results, alongside lower revenue projections, left investors concerned that it was taking hits to its core business while continuing to chase after uncertain new technologies.Cisco, the world’s largest producer of computer-networking equipment, predicted 3-5 per cent revenue growth for the second quarter, falling short of Wall Street’s expectations for 13 per cent.Company executives said that they missed their sales targets in the first quarter after a surprising drop-off in spending by public sector customers, especially European governments.They also said they had been caught unaware by a fall in sales of set-top television boxes to US cable companies as Motorola gained share and big customers moved to internet-based devices. North American set-top box orders fell more than 40 per cent from a year before and executives said the trend would continue.“We’ve got a couple of air pockets that we hit,” said chief executive John Chambers. “The big picture hasn’t changed.” But analysts pointed to revenue declines in areas such as security, where sales fell 2 per cent, as its competitors are booming.“This is a pretty significant reset when the rest of the industry isn’t seeing it,” said UBS analyst Nikos Theodosopoulos, suggesting that Cisco might need to change its processes “given the breadth of what the company is doing”.Even in areas where Cisco is gaining, such as wireless, competitors are gaining faster, analysts complained. While Cisco emphasises video and collaboration tools, the core networking business is facing established rivals such as Juniper Networks as well as new entrant Hewlett-Packard.Executives defended the overall strategy on the call and in later interviews, saying that they continued to gain share in major pieces of the market for networking gear, where Cisco has traditionally dominated.“We have the broadest portfolio,” Cisco chief financial officer Frank Calderoni told the Financial Times. “Being a broad player in the market, there are going to be some segments where smaller competitors may be making some advances against us.”Mr Chambers said on the call that he saw no reason to slow Cisco’s aggressive acquisition strategy or change its pursuit of new areas.Switch and router sales were up 25 and 13 per cent in the quarter, respectively.All told, Cisco turned in net income of $1.9bn, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of $10.8bn.Non-GAAP earnings of 42 cents a share beat the Wall Street average of 40 cents.
41;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2010-09-12T16:42:41Z;Nokia’s new chief commits to Finnish culture;;When Stephen Elop was unveiled on Friday as the new chief executive of Nokia, he assured the assembled Finnish media that he was prepared for the long dark nights and freezing temperatures of Helsinki in winter.“As you may know, I’m a Canadian citizen. You may also know that Canada and Finland share the Arctic Circle. That’s something that holds me in good stead.” It was a good-natured effort to forge a bond with the country soon to be his home.But it could not disguise the impression that, once Mr Elop takes charge next Monday, the world’s biggest mobile phone maker will be a little less Finnish.Investors had been pressing Nokia’s board to recruit an outsider to replace Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo and shake up the management that has struggled to keep the company competitive against a new generation of smartphones such as the Apple iPhone.Tommi Saukkoriipi, who runs a Nordic equity fund for Nordea Investment Management, said investors were looking for someone to break from the rigid “Nokia way” of doing things and give the company a “broader view”. They appear to have got their wish with the appointment of Mr Elop, head of Microsoft’s business unit and previously with Adobe Systems, Juniper Networks and Macromedia, all US technology groups.Yet, Mr Elop told the Financial Times in an interview there would be no big dilution of Nokia’s national identity. “The Finnish business culture and the approach they have is very effective,” he said, having seen it up close through the software alliance launched last year between Nokia and Microsoft.Jorma Ollila, Nokia chairman, said Mr Elop’s “cultural sensitivity” to Nokia’s “Finnish heritage” was among the reasons he was chosen. Mr Ollila, who as chief executive from 1992 to 2006 led Nokia’s transformation from a sprawling conglomerate into Europe’s top technology company, bridled at suggestions the company’s Finnishness was to blame for its recent woes.“That [criticism] ignores the 15 years of success which was achieved with this business culture. It’s a no-nonsense culture. It’s about getting things done. We may communicate a bit less but when we say something, we do it,” he said.The appointment of Nokia’s first non-Finnish chief executive would not alter the company’s “special relationship” with its home country, Mr Ollila insisted.Most Finns are proud of Nokia as a symbol of the country’s progress from its traditional dependence on forestry and paper into one of the world’s most advanced economies.Nokia’s rise was part of a broader Nordic success story, with Ericsson of Sweden also at the heart of early mobile industry innovation. Now, as the centre of gravity shifts towards Apple and Google in the US, Finland is counting the cost of Nokia’s decline.At its peak almost a decade ago, the company accounted for 4 per cent of Finnish gross domestic product and 21 per cent of corporation tax revenues. By last year, those figures had fallen to 1.6 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively.“Nokia is still the most important company in the Finnish economy but its role has been greatly reduced,” said Jyrki Ali-Yrkkö, of ETLA, a Finnish think-tank.With most manufacturing done overseas and 90 per cent of its stock under foreign ownership, it could be argued Nokia loosened its home ties long ago. Yet, it remains a crucial part of Finland’s economic ecosystem, employing 21,600 people locally and investing heavily in homegrown research and development.Martti Haikio, historian at the University of Helsinki and author of a book on Nokia, cautioned against writing off the company that has seen many ups and downs since its inception as a paper maker in 1871.Finns pride themselves on their resilience after twice fighting the Soviet Union in the second world war. Mr Haikio expected Nokia to show similar spirit in its battle with Apple and other challengers.“If there’s one word associated with Finland, it’s survival. So the idea that this company will just give up and surrender I find hard to believe,” he said.
42;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2010-08-12T20:43:13Z;Cisco warning dents Wall Street's technology sector;;US stocks fell after disappointing jobless figures and cautious company outlooks reinforced investor concern about the possibility of a double-dip recession.The S&P 500 closed down 0.5 per cent to 1,083.60 by midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6 per cent to close at 10,319.95 and the Nasdaq closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,190.27.Initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose by 2,000 to 484,000 last week, the highest level since mid-February. Economists had expected claims to fall to 465,000.The S&P 500 opened 0.9 per cent weaker after the jobless data but was off its lows by mid-morning.Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said that, from watching Vix, a measure of volatility, he believes the sell-off will not last long.“Vix did not jump yesterday [on Wednesday] as much as one would expect,” he said. “Generally when Vix jumps less than expected, it means the sell-off is not going to continue and, although we do have a continuation today, it’s well off the lows.”Companies from Cisco, the technology company, to Kohl’s, the retailer, re-ported positive earnings but forecasts were worse than expected.Cisco, the world’s largest maker of networking equipment, sank 10 per cent to $21.36 in spite of better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and a 79 per cent jump in net income.Investors were spooked after John Chambers, Cisco chief executive, borrowed words from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to warn of “unusual uncertainty” in the economy and forecast revenue for the current quarter of between $10.64bn and $10.83bn, below the average analyst estimate of $10.95bn.The company is seen as a barometer for the technology industry because it dominates the market for products that direct the flow of internet traffic.The S&P 500 information technology sector was down 1.7 per cent with Juniper Networks, the second-largest maker of computer networking equipment, falling 6.8 per cent to $25.78.Kohl’s, the department store chain operator, repor­ted earnings that beat ex­pec­tations but analysts were disappointed by a worse-than-expected outlook.Like Macy’s, which reported its earnings on Wednesday, it gained market share by adding exclusive lines. But it warned rising costs would put pressure on earnings in the third quarter, which the company forecast to come in between 57 and 63 cents a share, below analysts’ est­imates of 74 cents. Its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $46.50.Sara Lee, the food and household group, was also down 0.7 per cent to $14.37 after issuing a forecast that fell short of expectations. It said earnings for the year ending June 2011 would be between 88 cents and 95 cents a share compared with a consensus forecast of $1.02. Fourth-quarter earnings also missed expectations after wheat, meat and coffee prices rose, squeezing profit in its North American retail division.Estée Lauder also fell after forecasting earnings for 2011 below the average analyst estimate. The cosmetics company said profit would be between $2.80 and $3.05 a share, excluding some items, compared with the consensus forecast of $3.19. Shares dropped 2.6 per cent to $58.80 after it also missed expectations for its fourth quarter.Brinker International’s Chilis chain and the Wendy’s-Arby’s Group Arby’s chain suffered from declining sales in their restaurants. Brinker rose 5.1 per cent to $15.65 after it said margins would rise in 2011 but Wendy’s-Arby’s edged down 0.2 per cent to $4.40. Industrial stocks slid on fears about economic recovery. The S&P 500 Industrials was down 0.8 per cent with Caterpillar off 1.8 per cent to $67.50 and Textron falling 2.9 per cent to $18.43.Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, slid 3.6 per cent to $54.17 after India became the latest country to say it might ban the device if security issues were not addressed.American International Group fell 2 per cent to $37.10 after it was reported it had started negotiations with potential investors to sell stakes in AIA, its Asian life insurance business, before a planned initial public offering.
43;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2010-07-21T22:36:02Z;Corero and NXT take plunge with strategic changes;;One of the beauties and oddities of the small-cap market is that companies sometimes decide that what they need is a radical change of emphasis.Two making that decision last week were Corero, which makes software for education, banking and securities markets, and NXT, still best known for making flat speakers that were supposedly going to transform the audio world.The reasons behind the rethink are fairly clear. In share price terms, neither company is what they were.Corero shares have dropped from a high of more than 400p in January 2008 to 33p. NXT, buoyed by the dotcom boom, once saw its shares reach more than £13 but they now trade at nearer to 8p.Rather than throw in the towel and delist, as so many underperforming Aim stocks have done this year, both opted for a different tack. The question will be whether this approach can really work.Of the two, Corero decided upon the more radical change.In a series of moves, it sold off its recovering financial services division to Rivington Street Holdings for £2m and raised £6.5m via a placing and subscription. A boardroom shake-up will see a strong influence from Datatec, the IT equipment distributor and the largest technology company on Aim.Andrew Miller, formerly the operations director at Datatec subsidiary Logicalis, will take over as chief executive while Jens Montanana, the founder and chief executive of Datatec, will become a non-executive director and 32 per cent shareholder, post-placing.The plan is to build an internet-based network security business through acquisitions, which places it squarely in competition with large US groups such as Cisco, Juniper Networks and Checkpoint Technologies.Unlike other areas of IT, security is an area largely immune to a slowdown in spending as virus and hacking threats do not disappear.For Mr Miller, the company’s stock market quotation is crucial for his plans to wrap up deals quickly in a highly-fragmented market.The top three vendors represent 43 per cent of the market and the next 55 companies cover 35 per cent of it. The remaining 22 per cent is serviced by companies with revenues of less than $3m (£2m) a year.“We’re looking to acquire two, maybe three assets. We’re not talking about being serial acquirers but we’ve identified three good companies,” he said.Furthermore, despite Datatec’s name and status, it is regarded as a IT distributor and does not own its own intellectual property.NXT, on the other hand, has already been down this road and is again tweaking its business model. The original plan was to exploit its innovative flat panel speakers, which could turn many things – from a TV screen or a car dashboard to the front of a smartphone – into a loudspeaker.But car, phone and electronics goods manufacturers never fully accepted it and being used in mass-market devices has never been within its reach. Smartphones seemed an ideal market but it appears to have missed that boat too.Instead, NXT became synonymous with profit warnings and it subsequently moved on to haptic technology, in which users “feel” different kinds of surfaces and materials through a touchscreen.The technology is impressive, but in a “nice-that-they-can-do-that” rather than a “must-have” way. Potential customers have felt much the same and few manufacturers as yet have paid the significant up-front licence fees that commit them to further development.Last week, after yet another profit warning, NXT too said it would be changing strategy and management.Peter Thoms has moved up to vice-chairman and the new chief executive is James Lewis, the entrepreneur who founded the components-maker Oxford Semiconductor and sold it to PLX Technology for $16.4m.After a review, the company is being split into audio and display businesses.The focus now is on selling more components, after it purchased intellectual property for an ultra-efficient low-power amplifier chip in March.Examples abound, from Forbidden Technologies to Maxima Holdings, of technology companies unable to break out of the rut when the initial enthusiasm wanes and the business and shares have a few fallow years.The crucial difference that may stop Corero from following NXT will be in buying technology that is already in use and in a fast-growing market.Otherwise, like NXT it could be left with great technology and no market to show for it. And when that happens, it can be hard to escape.philip.stafford@ft.com
44;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2010-07-08T14:33:48Z;Wall Street gains on positive data;;US stocks held on to the previous day’s gains on Thursday as a positive jobs report and decent retail sales data helped ease worries about a potential double-dip recession.Jobless claims were 454,000 last week, modestly better than the 460,000 expected. However, continuing claims dropped to 4.41m from 4.63m last week, significantly better than the 4.6m consensus estimate.“We’re getting a lot of mixed signals at the moment,” said Andrew Neale, partner and portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Partners. “The data are still not looking great. Earnings estimates have been cut so I am not surprised if companies are beating the reduced forecasts.”Volumes were relatively low, suggesting a lack of broad investor conviction.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent to 1,070.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.2 per cent to 10,138.99 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.7 per cent to 2,175.40.Same-store sales for the past month from the big retail chains came in mixed on Thursday, helped by warm weather and promotions around the Memorial day holiday. June is traditionally a clearance month for retailers.Macy’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brandsall beat analysts’ average estimates.Macy’s rose 3 per cent to $18.44, Limited Brands rose 2.2 per cent to $24.21, JC Penney advanced 6.7 per cent to $23.24 and Abercrombie was up 7.8 per cent to $35.45. Nordstrom fell 0.2 per cent to $33.69.However, Costco, Target and Gap came in below expectations.Target dropped 0.8 per cent to $50.02 and Gap was down 7.6 per cent at $18.22. Costco still rose 2.6 per cent to $55.71.“June [figures] were lacklustre at best,” said Robert Samuels, senior retail analyst at Phoenix Equities. “Given that retail has significantly underperformed the market over the past month, we think a lot of the bad news is already in most of these names. However, we think a round of earnings cuts is in store for the back half and 2011 as spending remains choppy.”Wells Fargo was down 0.1 per cent to $26.64 as the fourth-largest US bank by assets said it would cut about 3,800 jobs and close its consumer finance business. The bank said it would take a related charge of $185m, including $137m in the second quarter.Citigroup was up 1.8 per cent to $3.97 after the bank was reported to have agreed to sell about $900m of its private equity portfolio to Lexington Partners as part of an ongoing plan announced last year to reduce its balance sheet.Walt Disney added 0.6 per cent to $33.34 as it said it planned to appeal against a judgment on Wednesday against the media company.A jury in a California court awarded damages of $270m to UK-based Celador Entertainment after a dispute over profits from Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?H&R Block was one of the session’s biggest fallers as the stock sank 8.2 per cent to $14.22. The leading tax preparer said Russell P. Smyth resigned as chief executive. Alan Bennett, a director, will take his role.The company recently reported a 2.3 per cent decline in earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, which usually accounts for most of its annual profit.Technology stocks were some of the session’s worst performers.Micron Technology, a maker of semiconductors, dropped 2.3 per cent to $8.69, Nvidia Corp, a visual computing technologies group, was down 3 per cent to $10.31 and Juniper Networks, a network infrastructure company, erased 0.2 per cent to $25.43.Apple retreated 0.2 per cent to $258.09 even as the computer device maker elaborated on its Asia expansion plans. It said its Shanghai store, which is opening this weekend, is one of “many” it plans in the country.“The Chinese consumer’s love of luxury goods is an enticing opportunity for Apple,” said Mike Abramsky, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Xcel Energy, an owner of utilities assets that operate in eight US states, gained 1.1 per cent to $21.60 as the company restated its earnings guidance for the full year of $1.55 to $1.65 per share.
45;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2010-03-29T18:56:45Z;Cisco’s takeover of Tandberg approved;;Cisco won regulatory clearance on Monday for its $3.4bn acquisition of Tandberg, the Norwegian video-conferencing company, after making a minor concession to regulators that were concerned at its growing power in the market.The completion of the deal, which was reached six months ago, is set to trigger a realignment in a corner of the technology world that has attracted the interest of some of the industry’s biggest players.Hewlett-Packard reached a deal of its own last week to sell gear from Polycom, Tandberg’s biggest rival, extending its growing rivalry with Cisco. HP had itself been seen as a potential acquirer of Polycom before the alliance was reached.In co-ordinated statements on Monday, the European Commission and the Department of Justice in the US said they had approved the Tandberg acquisition after Cisco made an undertaking to Brussels to open up part of its technology.The regulatory reviews had looked in particular at the market for “telepresence” technology, the high-definition video-conferencing system that is used to create life-sized images and is meant to give users the feeling of being almost in the same room. Cisco and Tandberg both have a presence in this market.Under its deal with Brussels, Cisco is to hand over part of its technology to a teleconferencing industry body to ensure that other companies are able to make products that interoperate with Cisco’s telepresence systems, the Commission said.Cisco had already moved this year to offer its Telepresence Interoperability Protocol royalty-free to others in the industry, but the agreement for it to hand over control of the technology is intended to make sure there are no remaining restrictions on its use.Cisco’s agreement to buy Tandberg six months ago helped to touch off a flurry of partnership deals with other technology companies by Polycom. Besides HP, its alliances this year have included deals with Juniper Networks and Avaya.Polycom’s future has also been in question in recent months, though it has yet to receive any hard takeover offer. Talks between Polycom and Apax, a private equity firm, were called off this month after several months of discussion. The FT reported last week that the US company has now received an expression of interest from Gores, a private equity firm based in Los Angeles, about a merger with Siemens Enterprise Communications, which is majority-owned by Gores.
46;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2008-12-04T21:30:50Z;AT&T cuts 12,000 jobs;;AT&T, the largest US telecoms group, plans to cut 12,000 jobs, or about 4 per cent of its workforce, and reduce capital spending next year in response to the economic slump, which has accelerated the loss of residential phone lines.AT&T is the latest US operator to announce cutbacks in its capital spending, although it said actual spending plans had yet to be finalised.The Dallas-based company is expected to release further details in late January but analysts expect AT&T to cut spending levels by about 12 per cent from 2008 levels to $17bn next year.The capital spending cuts, reflect an expectation that growth will slow in the mobile market, and have added to the gloom among telecoms equipment manufacturers.Nokia Siemens, the equipment joint venture, said on Thursday it expected telecoms network equipment spending to decline by about 4 per cent next year.Shares in makers of network equipment have continued to tumble. In early trading on Thursday Cisco Systems’ shares were down 2 per cent at $15.63, Juniper Networks was almost 5 per cent lower at $15.91, and ADC Telecom had dropped 3.5 per cent to $6.62.AT&T attributed the job cuts to “economic pressures, a changing business mix and a more streamlined organisational structure”.It would take a charge of about $600m in this year’s fourth quarter to cover severance payments, the company said.In April AT&T said it planned to cut 4,600 jobs, mostly in management. The company had previously announced a three-year plan to cut 10,000 jobs.While AT&T is cutting its overall workforce, it emphasised that it was adding jobs in areas such as wireless, video and broadband access.Verizon Communications and Sprint Nextel, the second and third largest US telecoms groups, have also cut jobs to trim expenses.The job cuts come as AT&T, in common with other traditional US carriers, struggles to manage the declining number of landlines as consumers switch to wireless or cheaper broadband telephony services offered by cable and internet companies.In AT&T’s third quarter results last month, wireline voice revenue had fallen more than 8 per cent from a year earlier.Its exclusive deal with Apple to sell the iPhone in the US has helped it win wireless customers but subsidies on the handset it provides to customers have hurt profit margins.Shares of AT&T have dropped about 30 per cent so far this year, as investors have questioned whether the company will be able to make up for the rapid decline in traditional wireline customers.There are also concerns that growth in the wireless unit will slow.AT&T’s shares closed down 91 cents at $28.17, a fall of 3.13 per cent on Thursday.

Still, gains were trimmed slightly by results from Burlington Northern Santa Fe. The railway company said second-quarter profit had fallen 19 per cent to $350m due to higher fuel costs and flooding in the Midwest, and the shares fell 0.7 per cent to $98.05.The housing market also offered a pleasant surprise, as sales of newly-constructed single-family homes fell only 0.6 per cent to a 530,000 annual pace – a smaller decline than expected.Homebuilders rose 2.2 per cent with a 4 per cent gain to $11.51 for Lennar helping to lead the way.Consumer-facing sectors rose as oil continued to pull back and a survey showed a surprise rebound in consumer confidence. Technology stocks were the strongest gainers, benefiting from some decent earnings news as well. Google added 3.4 per cent to $491.98, while Ebay gained 4.1 per cent to $25.40 and the sector advanced 1.6 per cent.Juniper Networks was the biggest winner in the sector after its second-quarter profits jumped 40 per cent and it lifted third-quarter forecasts. Juniper shares surged 17.7 per cent to $26.57.Energy also fared well thanks to Arch Coal which said second-quarter profit had tripled and the company raised its full-year forecast. Arch Coal rose 9.2 per cent to $55.64 while the sector added 1 per cent. Over the week, energy was the biggest loser, however, dipping 2.7 per cent as oil fell back. The benchmark S&P 500 pared early gains but was still ahead 0.4 per cent at 1,257.77 points at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent to 11,370.69 points and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent higher at 2,310.53 points.In recent days equity markets have been roiled by earnings news and other ructions in the financials. The sector jumped 6.6 per cent on Tuesday only to see fragile confidence crumble and suffer its biggest fall in eight years two days later.Those moves largely cancelled out each other, however, and the S&P 500 lost 0.2 per cent over the week. The index has now fallen for seven of the past eight weeks. The Dow dipped 1.1 per cent and the Nasdaq added 1.2 per cent over the week. Financials edged down 0.1 per cent.Linda Duessel, an equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Last week we rallied sharply as investors sold energy stocks to cover shorts in financials. So the question is, now what are we going to do? Trading could be sloppy as we search for new leadership.”Friday produced some more bad news from the financials. Early gains were wiped out after data showed rising foreclosures, and S&P said it might cut certain of the ratings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The pair fell 3.9 per cent to $11.55 and 6.1 per cent to $8.27, respectively. The financial sector as a whole lost 0.6 per cent.Although somewhat obscured by the travails of the financials, earnings season kicked into high gear this week. After 226 company reports, earnings for the S&P 500 are down 24.6 per cent on average. Excluding financials, though, earnings grew by 9.3 per cent.Industrial stocks were among the biggest gainers over the week, adding 1.4 per cent. The healthcare sector gained ground, climbing 1.3 per cent over the week thanks to some solid results from the likes of Coventry Health Care and Unitedhealth Group.The pair added 10.7 per cent to $33.46 and 14.7 per cent to $27.45 over the week, respectively.
49;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2008-07-25T01:11:39Z;Yahoo debacle casting shadow over strategy;;If Microsoft has a plan B for internet search, it will take some time to materialise and cost a great deal of cash.That was the impression left on Thursday by Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer, as he sought to convince an increasingly doubtful Wall Street that the Yahoo debacle would not put paid to Microsoft’s online aspirations.The uncertainties were intensified by the surprise departure late on Wednesday of an executive whose star had risen rapidly in recent years. Kevin Johnson, who had masterminded Microsoft’s Yahoo bid and also been responsible for its core Windows PC operating system business, was named chief executive officer of data networking company Juniper Networks.Mr Johnson’s sudden exit, and Microsoft’s decision to reverse course and break apart the Windows and online divisions it had united under his leadership three years ago, was seen as an immediate response to its troubled internet strategy.“His departure may indicate he is paying the price for not delivering Yahoo,” said Youssef Squali, an internet analyst at Jefferies & Co.It also appeared to reflect the mixed reception for the Windows Vista operating system, analysts said. While Windows revenues in the most recent quarter beat most expectations, bad publicity about early technical glitches in Vista have led to slower adoption of the software by big corporate users than Microsoft had hoped.A former head of Microsoft’s sales organisation, Mr Johnson had been seen as a natural head of the Windows business. One person close to Microsoft suggested that the size of the task, at the same time that he had to sort out Microsoft’s struggling online business, had proved too much for one executive.Some observers questioned whether Mr Johnson’s departure would now lead to a rethink in Microsoft’s online strategy. “The refocus should be back on its core business,” said Venkat Venkatraman, head of the information systems department at Boston University’s school of management.However, Mr Ballmer left no doubt that he was still pursuing an expansive long-term vision to make Microsoft one of two dominant internet companies, alongside Google. “Everything in the world that can be moved and delivered over IP networks will be,” he declared. Catching a large share of this internet market could eventually add 50 per cent or more to Microsoft’s stock market value, he said.The potential cost of those ambitions has weighed heavily on its stock since last week’s revelation that Microsoft’s operating costs over the next 12 months would be $500m higher than analysts had expected.But Mr Ballmer said the $1.2bn loss on Microsoft’s online business last year amounted to only 5 per cent of operating income and was a “relatively smart and efficient” investment given the long-term potential. He also sought to play down the significance of Microsoft’s failure to secure a Yahoo deal. “There was always going to be huge integration overhead in buying Yahoo or doing a search deal.”Yet he could do little to answer one of the most pressing questions raised by the Yahoo failure: how, even given its massive investment, could Microsoft start to make greater inroads into Google’s market.
50;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2008-07-24T20:30:58Z;Investing is still Microsoft’s primary vista;;Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive officer, on Thursday made his case to Wall Street for Microsoft to make big new investments in the internet business, in spite of signs of internal upheaval in the wake of his failed bid for Yahoo this year.Mr Ballmer’s comments, which included his starkest warning yet that Microsoft would remain in “investment mode” indefinitely, or at least until it made a bigger dent in search and online advertising, came the day after the unexpected departure of the executive who ran the company’s online services business.Kevin Johnson, who had also been responsible for Microsoft’s core Windows PC operating system business, was named chief executive officer of data networking company Juniper Networks.“His departure may indicate he is paying the price for not delivering Yahoo,” said Youssef Squali, an internet analyst at Jefferies & Co. Mr Johnson had masterminded Microsoft’s pursuit of Yahoo, which earlier this week finally managed to fend off the immediate pressure to do a deal when it reached a pact with activist investor Carl Icahn.Mr Johnson’s sudden exit, and Microsoft’s decision to reverse course and break apart the Windows and online businesses divisions it had united under his leadership three years ago, also reflected the mixed reception for the Windows Vista operating system, analysts said.While Windows revenues in the most recent quarter beat expectations, bad publicity about early technical glitches in Vista have led to slower adoption of the software by big corporate users. A former head of Microsoft’s sales organisation, Mr Johnson had been seen as a natural head of the Windows business. One person close to Microsoft suggested on Thursday that the size of the task had proved too much for one executive.Some observers questioned on Thursday whether Mr Johnson’s departure would lead to a rethink in Microsoft’s online strategy.“The refocus should be back on its core business,” said Venkat Venkatraman, head of the information systems department at Boston University’s school of management. But Mr Ballmer brushed aside suggestions that Microsoft would now scale back its ambition.“We’re going to have to ante up in a significant way even to be in this game,” he said at the company’s annual analyst meeting.The potential costs of Microsoft’s ambitions online have been one of the biggest questions facing the company, and have weighed heavily on its stock since last week’s revelation that Microsoft’s operating costs over the next 12 months would be $500m higher than analysts had expected.The online services division’s losses last year amounted to about 5 per cent of its operating income, yet the division could eventually substantially boost Microsoft’s stock market value, adding “40 or 50 or 60 per cent or even more”, Mr Ballmer said.Meanwhile, the Microsoft CEO sought to play down the significance of its failure to secure a Yahoo deal. “There was always going to be huge integration overhead in buying Yahoo or doing a search deal,” he said. Yet he did not rule out returning to a deal with Yahoo.“Does it mean no one will talk to anyone again? I suspect the answer to that question is also no. It’s a long time and a big world.”
51;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2008-07-24T06:32:37Z;Failed Yahoo bid prompts Microsoft shake-up;;Microsoft revealed its disarray in the aftermath of its failed bid for Yahoo on Wednesday, announcing a major reorganisation and the unexpected departure of the executive who oversaw its offer.The company said Kevin Johnson, a 16-year veteran and one of three divisional presidents under chief executive Steve Ballmer, was leaving the company and his Platform and Services division was being split in two.The new groups would be Windows/Windows Live and Online Services, with both reporting directly to Mr Ballmer.A person close to Microsoft said there had been some tension between the chief executive and Mr Johnson, his right-hand man, particularly over the timing of his leaving and its impact on the major changes being made to the management of the company.According to this person, Mr Johnson’s abrupt departure partly reflected Microsoft’s lack of progress in its online business – lying a poor third to Google and Yahoo – the failure of its bid for Yahoo and the debacle over the marketing of its Windows Vista operating system over the last year.Mr Johnson himself was said to have become frustrated at the situation. The person added that one reason for his departure had been his ambition to become chief executive of another company.He will be staying for a few weeks to help with the transition, but is understood to have accepted a senior position at Juniper Networks. The network equipment maker has yet to fill a vacant post of chief operating officer.Mr Ballmer officially paid tribute to Mr Johnson on Wednesday.“Kevin has built a supremely talented organisation and laid the foundation for the future success of Windows and our Online Services Business,” he said.The chief executive insisted that the Windows business was ”firing on all cylinders”.“We see tremendous opportunity in search and advertising, and we have a clear strategy for investing in success today and growth in the future,” he added.Mr Johnson said: “I have been so fortunate to have experienced 16 amazing years of building Microsoft’s business.”The executive had been head of the division since 2005. He launched Windows Vista and has been growing Microsoft’s software and services business, including completing more than 30 acquisitions.However, businesses have been slow to upgrade from Windows XP to Vista and Microsoft’s online business has been loss-making. The chance to gain market share and close the gap with Google was lost in May when Microsoft abandoned its bid for Yahoo.
52;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2008-05-02T20:55:21Z;Wall Street rises after jobs data;;US stock markets ended the week at their highest levels since the start of the year after the government said US employers cut fewer jobs than expected last month and the Federal Reserve stepped up efforts to unfreeze the credit markets.According to the US Department of Labor, 20,000 jobs were shed in April– the fourth consecutive month of losses – but that was far fewer than many feared and the unemployment rate moderated somewhat.That better-than-expected data, as well as stable numbers on growth and manufacturing activity released in the week, have reinforced impressions that, while the US economy is languishing, it is still clinging on to sluggish growth.News that US and European central banks plan to take further steps to pump liquidity into strained credit markets, also boosted stocks but as the day progressed, a rally in commodity prices pegged equities back.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,413.92 on the day, and 1.2 per cent ahead for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 13,057.80 yesterday while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,476.99.During an uneven week, the major indices hit their highest levels since early January with the S&P 500 breaking the 1,400 level and the Dow Jones settling above 13,000. In April, the S&P 500 added about 4.8 per cent – its best monthly showing since the end of 2003 and its first positive month since last October.The week began in downbeat fashion, with volumes low and stocks falling ahead of a rate decision from the Federal Reserve. Data showing that two pillars of the US economy – house prices and consumer confidence – continue to crumble, also weighed on confidence.Markets perked up only briefly on news that Mars, the privately owned confectioner, would purchase chewing gum heavyweight Wrigley for $23bn. Wrigley shares soared 21.7 per cent to $75.99 over the week.Energy and material stocks proved a drag on indices, however, after commodity prices slipped off recent highs at the start of the week and ExxonMobil posted disappointing results.Exxon fell 3.1 per cent to $89.61, Monsanto slipped 8.2 per cent to $115.22 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dipped 5.8 per cent to $110.23. The two sectors rallied yesterday but that late charge could not overcome earlier losses and they closed the week down 1.8 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively.Energy’s discomfort proved a boon for consumer discretionary stocks, however, and the sector added 2.5 per cent over the week.On Wednesday, the Fed cut interest rates and sentiment initially wobbled but turned positive the following day as financial and technology stocks raced ahead.Symantec and Juniper Networks were among the biggest gainers over the week, climbing 11.3 per cent to $19.45 and 7.8 per cent to $28.79, respectively.Sun Microsystems took some of the shine off the sector yesterday though, after it reported a surprise third-quarter net loss. Over the week, its shares tumbled 18.6 per cent to $12.64.Financials performed well, adding 2.4 per cent over the week, led by some of the institutions most badly damaged by the subprime crisis.Ambac, the bond insurer, surged 39.4 per cent to $5.38, Merrill Lynch added 6.2 per cent to $52.71 and CIT Group rose 19.8 per cent to $12.91.The S&P 500 has now rallied about 10 per cent from its March lows but experts remain divided about whether that trend will continue. Many are sceptical that US corporations can meet still optimistic earnings growth estimates for the full year and point out that misses could weigh on equity markets.Larry Smith, chairman and chief investment officer of Third Wave Global Investors, however, argued that macro-economic drivers, such as actions by the Fed, were turning the tide in a more positive direction.Indeed certain key measures of risk appetite have already picked up.“People’s mindsets are very much in the recessionary camp and as those mindsets improve the stock markets will improve with it,” he said.
53;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2008-02-27T21:46:46Z;Wall St stocks seesaw in volatile trading;;US stocks gyrated between positive and negative territory on Wednesday when traders weighed poor economic data and a plan to allow government-chartered mortgage lenders to buy more loans.The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said it would remove the cap on the value of mortgages they could buy, which could boost liquidity in the industry.The plan sparked a rally in financial stocks and homebuilders but fears about the health of the economy damped earlier enthusiasm.Quincy Krosby, chief in-vestment strategist at The Hartford, said: “Mortgages are at the heart of the credit problem. Anything you can do to staunch the deterioration in the housing market is going to be a positive for the markets and for the real economy.”But economic data re-leased earlier showed the housing market and economy worsened in January, and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the US was experiencing a broad-based slowdown.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to close at 12,694.28, while the S&P 500 index slipped 0.1 per cent to 1,380.02. The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.4 per cent to 2,353.78.Still, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pared early losses after the OFHEO news. Fannie, which re-ported a $3.6bn fourth-quarter loss before the opening bell, rose 1.1 per cent to $27.27. Smaller counterpart Freddie fell 0.5 per cent to $25.09. Analysts expect Freddie to show a fourth-quarter loss of about $2.54 a share when it reports on Thursday.Homebuilders were also supported by an upbeat note from Lehman Brothers, which initiated coverage of the industry with a “positive” recommendation.Megan Talbott McGrath, Lehman Brothers analyst, said she expected trends in the sector to improve by the latter half of this year.DR Horton rose 4.1 per cent to $17.10 while Toll Brothers, which earlier reported its biggest quarterly loss in 22 years, added 3.1 per cent to $23.83.Financial stocks held on to their gains: The S&P 500 financials sub-index firmed 0.8 per cent, while an index of investment banks rose 2.1 per cent.Fortunes in the technology, media and telecoms sector were mixed, however.Autodesk tumbled 15.6 per cent to $32.99 after the software maker reported a fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates.In contrast, forecast-beating earnings sent electronic components maker Maxwell Technologies 9.7 per cent higher to $10.29.Shares in Microsoft fell 0.4 per cent to $28.26 after European regulators imposed a $1.4bn fine on the company. Analysts said the fine – the largest by the European Union against a single company – represented just a fraction of the software maker’s monthly cash flow.Intel fell 0.4 per cent to $20.77 after JPMorgan cut its 2008 and 2009 profit estimates for the world’s largest chipmaker.Christopher Danely, an analyst at JPMorgan, said his research suggested Intel’s first quarter was trending below expectations because of weaker orders for microprocessors. DreamWorks Animation rose 5 per cent to $25.65. The maker of the Shrek movies reported a fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates on DVD sales from the third film about the ogre.Nortel fell 13.3 per cent to $9.93 after the largest telephone equipment maker in North America said it would cut 2,100 jobs after sales fell.Shares of Netflix jumped 11.8 per cent to $32.43 after the online video-rental service raised its first-quarter and full-year earnings guidance and forecasts for subscriber growth.Cisco Systems rose 3.7 per cent to $24.95 after Wells Fargo added the maker of computer-networking equipment to its “buy” list.Smaller rival Juniper Networks rose 6.5 per cent to $29.29.Apple and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, benefited from positive sentiment towards export-oriented stocks. The falling dollar makes US exports more attractive.Apple rose 3.2 per cent to $122.96, while RIM added 3.5 per cent to $111.50.Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, rose 1.3 per cent to $74.22. Aluminium producer Alcoa rose 1.4 per cent to $30.02. General Motors rose 1 per cent to $24.82.
54;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2008-01-11T00:50:40Z;Key Microsoft executive quits;;The recent upheaval among Microsoft’s senior ranks continued on Thursday with news that the software group has brought in an outsider to run its Office software division in place of one of its most established and seemingly entrenched executives.The latest shake-up will involve the departure of Jeff Raikes, a 26-year Microsoft veteran who, as head of its Microsoft Business Division, had been responsible for about half of its total revenues.Mr Raikes, 49, is to give up management responsibilities later this month, though he will remain a member of Microsoft’s senior management group until he retires in September, according to an e-mail to staff from Steve Ballmer, chief executive.He is to be replaced by Stephen Elop, 43, who made his name as head of software company Macromedia before selling that business to Adobe and moving on to become chief operating officer at Juniper Networks.The server software business that now reports to Mr Raikes will report instead to Mr Ballmer, a change designed to let Mr Elop focus his attention on the Office and business applications activities, Microsoft said.Mr Elop’s arrival makes him one of the most prominent among a wave of senior outsiders hired recently by a company that had previously drawn its senior management from inside the company.They include Kevin Turner, who joined as chief operating officer from Wal-Mart, as well as chief financial officer Chris Liddell and chief software architect Ray Ozzie.In his e-mail, Mr Ballmer said he had “very mixed emotions” about what he said was Mr Raikes’ decision to retire from the company and paid tribute to the executive’s work in building the Office business, as well as previously leading its global sales and marketing.Mr Raikes has been instrumental in starting to reshape the Office suite of “productivity tools” as a platform on which other software can be built, a strategy that is seen as vital to defending the business against the rise of internet-based software applications like those run by Google.He has also been behind some of its most important new products this year, including the latest version of Office and a new “unified communications” service, which has thrown Microsoft into direct competition with networking giant Cisco.Those products, and a series of acquisitions to boost its presence in new business software markets, had led to Mr Raikes being seen as one of the company’s most entrenched executives.His acquisitions over the past 12 months have included TellMe, a highly regarded voice-to-text software company, and earlier this week an agreement to buy the Norwegian business search company Fast.
55;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2007-09-18T23:55:41Z;Home workers create a new set of headaches;;"Sandra Smith is sleepy but coherent. Toshiba UK’s head of information technology had been up till 1am texting instructions to a Japanese colleague who could not access his e-mail from Tokyo: “It’s quite topical, really,” she yawns.Ms Smith’s experience represents one facet of the modern fashion for office workers to work anywhere anytime. For some, the out-of-office experience is the home. For others, it is anywhere they can find connections to link their laptop and phone to the corporate network.Is this progress?“It’s a great thing,” says Ms Smith. “But it doesn’t come without penalties or headaches – as I found out last night. Along with the ability to access the systems from anywhere comes the assumption that that means any time as well.”It is a view that resonates with Scott Petty, global head of services for Dimension Data, the South African consultancy: “The key home users our clients are targeting are knowledge workers and executive management. If you were being kind, you could say the aim was to give these workers a better work-life balance, but it’s probably to get them to work longer and harder,” he smiles.“The only reason you would want your employees to work from home is to benefit your business,” says Anton Grashion, security strategist at Juniper Networks, pointing to the potential advantages of staff retention in difficult areas and a lower carbon footprint for staff who are freed from commuting.But he warns that the corporate security umbrella may become strained: “A lot of it boils down to acceptable usage policy,” he says, arguing for clear guidelines on issues such as which software may be installed on a home machine and which devices may access corporate information.Despite the extra risks, however, flexible working is a phenomenon that shows no sign of waning.Mr Petty says: “It is creating an interesting challenge because the boundary of the corporate network is no longer the wall of corporate headquarters. Instead, it ends in the home.“Most of these people will be affluent. They will have wireless networks and want more applications than simply e-mail. A lot of CIOs are now talking about extending technical support into the home for these workers.”A global survey conducted this year by Dimension Data revealed that, while two-thirds of companies now support “flexible” working – which includes working outside the conventional office – only 43 per cent were prepared to offer IT support. Larger companies – those with 10,000 or more employees – were more likely to provide support, with mobile telephony, virtual private networks, and web e-mail the most common applications.The loss of the “corporate perimeter” however, throws up a slew of practical, legal and security questions.The principal issue is likely to be security and
the risk of loss of confidential data. Rory Alsop, a senior consultant with Ernst
& Young outlines the problem: “Many small companies accept the risks that employees connecting from home bring, generally because
of the perceived savings from not having to supply any of the hardware or
software.“Larger companies tend to take a more mature approach, documenting policies governing the use of home computers or networks. This does not guarantee they will be followed, however, nor whether employees understand the legal implications of breaching usage policies.”James Walker of Taiwanese broadband specialist ZyXEL says: “Where possible, the company should encourage the remote or home worker to have a company personal computer, so the company can control the licensing for the applications and make sure it has the latest anti-virus software and spyware. It can also remove or reduce the admininstrator rights, so the user cannot install software that could be compromising.“Next is the transfer of data between one location and, potentially, many others. Most businesses will not provide a traditional leased line because of the cost, so today they pay for the employee to have a broadband internet connection at home and use virtual private network technology.“The choice is IPSec (internet protocol security) an encryption technology that has to be installed on the PC, or the more recent SSL (secure sockets layer), incorporated in all modern browsers. For a permanent installation, I would go for the IPSec; for more mobile workers, SSL.” SSL creates a secure connection between the client and the server over which data flows in an encrypted form.Andy Burton, chief executive of Centennial Software, whose products are used to create automatically an inventory of company equipment attached to the internet and differentiate between lifestyle equipment and professional equipment, underlines the importance
of agreed policy guidelines but is downbeat about progress towards the ideal. “The reality is that most corporations want the benefit of the good will of their staff in giving the extra pound of flesh but they don’t provide the tools and the mechanisms to enable staff to work in a secure and trusted environment.”Rob Bamforth from the consultancy Quocirca raises parallel issues, arguing that business assets are as much at risk. “Who covers the theft of a corporate laptop from the home,” he asks. “Does having valuable office equipment at home increase the risk of burglary or does the fact that someone is there during the day create a deterrent?“And how does that affect insurance premiums, especially the relationship between personal and business insured risk.”For Nick Iles of the Work Foundation (formerly the Industrial Society), the wonder is that he has seen so little change over the past 20 years, with only one in five workers enjoying true flexible working.He blames a cultural attachment to measuring inputs, such as time, by having people in a particular place. “For roughly one in two jobs in the UK, more discretion could be applied and that isn’t happening.”He also identifies health and safety regulations and the individual’s need for security, the feeling of being part of a collective, the desire not to miss out.“You end up with this alignment with management practice that says being seen putting in the hours is still the main way in which you advance your career,” Mr Iles concludes."
56;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2007-08-29T00:59:57Z;Silicon Valley lawyer charged in options case;;The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges on Tuesday against a lawyer accused of improper options backdating at two different Silicon Valley companies.The charges provided further evidence that the SEC intends to take a hard line against corporate counsel who are alleged to have engaged in improper backdating of options grants.The SEC accused Lisa Berry, general counsel for KLA-Tencor, a semiconductor equipment company, and Juniper Networks, a networking equipment company, of “repeatedly backdating options and falsifying related paperwork” at the two companies.The SEC alleged that Ms Berry “devised the improper backdating scheme while serving as general counsel of [KLA-Tencor], then implemented similar practices after assuming the position of general counsel for [Juniper],” which she joined after leaving KLA in 1999.Ms Berry’s lawyer said the SEC’s case was “unfounded”.“Lisa had no responsibility for accounting at either company, had no idea that either company had violated options accounting, and did not personally benefit from misdated options grants at either company,” said Melinda Haag, an attorney with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in San Francisco.Among other penalties, the SEC said it was seeking to ban Ms Berry from serving as an officer of director of a public company.The civil charges against Ms Berry came weeks after Gregory Reyes, former chief executive of Brocade, a chipmaker, was convicted on criminal fraud charges stemming from backdating at his company.Ms Berry’s case marks the second time in two weeks that the SEC has moved forward with a civil backdating case without waiting to see if the justice department will file parallel criminal charges.Earlier this month, the SEC charged Michael Byrd, Brocade’s former chief financial officer, with fraud for his alleged role in backdating at the company. Mr Byrd’s attorney said that the jury in Mr Reyes’s criminal case had already accepted that Mr Byrd had no knowledge of illicit activities at the company.More than 200 companies have come under investigation for alleged options backdating, in which the grant dates of a stock options are manipulated to inflate their value. Only a handful of cases have resulted in civil or criminal charges.The SEC separately reached a settlement over backdating with Juniper on Tuesday. The company will not face a fine, and neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing in the matter.
57;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2007-07-30T22:04:43Z;‘Bot armies’ unravel web security net;;"About 11 years ago a friend of mine was pitching a television show to different networks. The premise was that he was going to play practical jokes against MTV. For instance, he called up the producers of the show behind MTV Beach House and told them his little brother was “afflicted” and had a wish of going to the MTV Beach House. “What’s wrong with him?” the producer asked. “He’s afflicted”. And so on. Plane tickets would be arranged, bands would be booked, etc. Hilarity would ensue. It wasn’t my favourite idea of his but he was pursuing it. So I decided to play a trick on my friend.MTV.com’s e-mail system had some unfortunate security issues. I logged into the back door there and sent my friend an e-mail from legal@mtv.com informing him he was in serious trouble and MTV was going to take every “litigious and federal” action at “our disposal”.My friend panicked and left repeated apologies at MTV’s legal office until I calmed him down and told him what I did. We’re not really friends any more but I wave hello when I see him across the street.Note to MTV: This was the only time I did this. I never showed anyone else how to do it. And, to your credit, you patched the hole a year later. I’m assuming there’s some sort of hacking statute of limitations on this sort of thing. But don’t mess with me.You would think after 11 years and billions of dollars that security would be better. It isn’t. It is worse than anyone realises. If you buy a computer at the store, take it out of the box and plug it into your cable modem without any sort of firewall, within 30 minutes your computer will be infected. Once it’s infected there is nothing you can do about it. What will it be infected with? One of those viruses that Norton Anti-Virus can take care of? No. That’s old school.New school are the minions of what are called “bot armies”. A “bot” is a piece of software that attaches itself to the lowest levels of your computer and simply does nothing. It’s like a sleeper cell. It can sit dormant for years. Every now and then it will wake up to do two things: head out to various internet chat rooms to see if the “bot master” has left instructions for it; and the other thing it will do is rewrite itself, so if any anti-virus software was created to try to find it, it will no longer find it. It morphs into something else. It’s a cancer that can’t be found or stopped.And about 50m computers worldwide, including computers in about half of the S&P 500, are infected with these bots right now. What do these bots do when they are given an assignment? Often they become spam gateways and quietly send out millions of spam e-mails without the owner of the computer realising. They are also used to launch denial-of- service attacks against companies or websites. Or they are used to keep track of all credit card numbers entered in on your computer and then the bot master gathers all the numbers and sells them to the identity theft black market. It’s no longer 12-year-old Russian kids writing these types of “malware”. Those 12-year-olds are now 19-year-olds who are being paid by various criminal organisations to build more sophisticated versions of these bots.I was visiting an anti-bot start-up comprised of PhD programmers. I asked them: “What happens when the guys making these bots get as smart as you guys?” They started laughing. “They are much smarter than us already.”Fortunately, from a stock market perspective, there might be ways to play it. Forget the security software companies. They might be useless. The hardware guys, Cisco and Juniper, are buying companies in the space and developing hardware to detect these intruders at the network level. They are probably good purchases here.The only real way to avoid getting infected is to never put anything on your computer. Always store things remotely. Only one company provides the services and software to allow this at an enterprise level: VMware, which is about to be spun out of EMC at probably a $10bn valuation, where it would be cheap in my opinion. VMware provides virtualisation software that makes you think everything is on your computer but all your files will instead be on hard drives in the corporate data centre, allowing companies much more thorough protection against bots, as well as saving on IT costs. I’m not the only one who thinks VMware is a home-run. Intel and Cisco both just invested in the company and Hewlett-Packard and IBM (competitors to EMC) are among VMware’s largest customers. This is an IPO worth buying.Is all hope lost? Will the internet go down and hard drives get wiped out around the world? Probably. But think back to what it was like pre-internet, take a deep breath and make sure you remember how to enjoy a good sunset.james@formulacapital.com"
58;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
59;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2007-07-20T21:18:10Z;Wall St down as financials suffer;;"Wall Street endured a volatile week as a march into record territory was abruptly terminated by disappointing earnings results from bellwether stocks.Late on Thursday, the S&P 500 set a record close of 1,553.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average settled above 14,000 points for the first time.The champagne corks had barely popped when Google and Microsoft delivered quarterly results that punctured the bullish mood.Further gloom was cast on Friday when Caterpillar, a leading Dow stock this year, said net profit fell 21 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2006. The stock fell 4.4 per cent to $83.20 on Friday, after hitting an earlier low of $789.26.Caterpillar weighed on the Dow, which closed 1.1 per cent lower at 13,850.67, a fall of 0.4 per cent this week.On Friday, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent to 2,687.60, a decline of 0.7 per cent this week. The Nasdaq is up 11.3 per cent for 2007.Google slid 5.2 per cent to $520.12 and Microsoft fell 1.1 per cent to $31.16 on Friday, after it had made a 52-week high of $31.84 on Thursday.The S&P closed 1.2 per cent lower at 1,534.08, and also declined 1.2 per cent for the week.Among the benchmark’s broad sectors, healthcare, telecoms and consumer stocks fell, but the worst performing group was financials, down 3.5 per cent.Sharp underperformance by financial stocks cast a shadow over the overall market throughout the week.The S&P investment bank and brokerage sub-index slumped 7.2 per cent this week and was at its lowest level since early April.Fresh worries about the hard-hit US subprime mortgage market remained a main talking point among investors this week.Ben Bernanke, US Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that losses from mortgages could total between $50bn and $100bn.That came after Bear Stearns said late on Tuesday that subprime mortgage-
related assets held by two of its hedge funds were virtually worthless. Bear fell 5.7 per cent to $134.72 this week and is down 17.2 per cent for the year.While the earnings results of several banks beat estimates this week, JP Morgan, Citigroup and Bank of America all increased their provision for bad loans in the future. “If [subprime mortgage] problems linger and are a gnawing source of uncertainty, that will be a worry for equity investors,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.“Markets hate uncertainty,” Mr Ruskin said, “[but] arguably the credit correction continues to be remarkably well absorbed by other markets.”However, the rising cost of issuing corporate bonds does not bode well for deal activity argue analysts.“Although the boom in private equity may not be over, it is certainly taking a rest,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.They noted that PowerShares Listed Private Equity Portfolio, an exchange-traded fund, that invests in publicly traded companies that act like private equity firms, has fallen sharply since peaking in early June at $29.33. The ETF fell 3.65 per cent to $26.69 this week.Another signal of equity risk appetite diminishing this week was the poor after-market performance of two initial public offerings.Shares in Orbitz traded lower at $14.50 on their debut on Friday. The online travel booker sold 34m shares at $15 a share, lower than the expected price range of $16-$18.A similar fate befell the listing of MF Global, a derivatives brokerage spun off by Man Group, the hedge-fund titan.MF Global listed at $30 a share, below an expected $36-$39 range, and never rose above $30 in trading once it debuted on Thursday. On Friday the stock was trading at $26.55.Among this week’s array of earnings, Juniper Networks lit up investor’s eyes when it swung to a second-quarter profit. Goldman Sachs also upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, and it rose 9.2 per cent to $30.40 this week.Sentiment for technology stocks was buffeted by a mix of disappointing earnings and guidance from Intel, down 5.5 per cent at $24.55, Yahoo, off 4.6 per cent at $25.35, and eBay, lower by 1.2 per cent at $33.53.By contrast, IBM’s quarterly results beat estimates and big blue set a five-year high of $116.88, up 5.7 per cent at $114.81 this week.Deal news lifted Plains Exploration, which is to buy Pogo, a rival oil and gas company, for $3.6bn in cash and stock. Pogo rallied 11.4 per cent to $57.95, while Plains fell 5.7 per cent to $48.55.IHOP, the restaurant chain operator, said it would buy Applebee’s for about $1.9bn, or $25.50 a share. Applebee’s rose 1.6 per cent to $24.77, while IHOP surged 14.6 per cent to $64.46 this week.Buy-backs were in focus after Rohm & Hass, a speciality chemicals and plastics company, was upgraded by brokers after it announced a $2bn share repurchase plan. The stock rose 6.8 per cent to $59.69."
60;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2007-07-19T21:24:52Z;S&P 500, Dow close at all-time high;;Wall Street rallied on Thursday as positive sentiment in the technology sector helped investors shrug off fresh worries about the hard-hit US subprime mortgage market.The bullish mood propelled the S&P 500 to a record close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average settled above 14,000 for the first time.Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, told US lawmakers that losses from the subprime mortgage market could range between $50bn and $100bn.Leading the major benchmarks was the Nasdaq Composite, with a gain of 0.8 per cent to 2,720.04. One boost for the tech sector was a 12.5 per cent surge to $30.06 in Juniper Networks shares after the networking equipment maker swung to a second-quarter profit. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, in the expectation that strong sales growth would boost operating margins.Cisco rose 1.7 per cent to $29.94 and had set a 52-week high of $30.So far this year, the Nasdaq’s gain of 12.6 per cent has outpaced the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the Nasdaq 100 has rallied 16.8 per cent. In a bull market, the more volatile technology stocks led the way as they enable investors to reap higher returns.“It’s no surprise that high beta stocks are doing well in this current rally,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “People who have missed some of the rally, and are forced to chase returns, can get back in the race by buying high beta names.”Another factor in favour of the tech sector is that international sales form a larger proportion of total sales, say analysts. A faster growing global economy in conjunction with a sharply weaker dollar is a fillip for the sector and multinational blue chip companies.But a sour note for techs was struck by Ebay, which fell 1.6 per cent to $33.50, after the online auctioneer posted a 50 per cent rise in quarterly profit, but left its outlook for 2007 unchanged. Investors had hoped for a rise in guidance and also focused on lower global listings.After the closing bell Google reported a 28 per cent rise in second quarter profits that missed estimates as higher costs eroded better-than-expected revenue growth. Google slumped more than 6 per cent in post-market trade.Also after the close, Microsoft met earnings estimates and raised guidance. Microsoft initially rallied in after-hours action, following a gain of 1.9 per cent to $31.51 in regular trade.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices reported a loss in the second quarter as a rise in sales for the chip maker was offset by lower microprocessor prices and costs associated with the $5.6bn purchase of ATI Technologies, a graphics chip maker. In after-hours trade, the stock rallied further after a rise of 2.1 per cent to $15.87 at the closing bell.The enthusiasm for tech stocks lifted the broad market into record territory. The S&P rose 0.45 per cent to 1,553.07 a new record high. Among the major sectors, utilities, technology and energy led gains, while health care and financials declined.Among the financials, Bank of America said quarterly earnings rose 5 per cent with an increase in the provision for credit losses. BofA has now set aside $1.81bn to cover these losses, up from $1.01bn in the second quarter of 2006. Shares in BofA fell 0.2 per cent to $49.27.PNC Financial, a mid-Atlantic regional bank, said quarterly earnings expanded 11 per cent and was also buying Sterling Financial for $565m, or $19 per share. The stock slipped 2.5 per cent to $71.37.Shares in MF Global fell on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. MF closed at $27.55, after the financial firm had listed at $30 a share – lower than the expected range of $36 to $39, traders said.The American Stock Exchange Broker-Dealer index fell 0.75 per cent.Another financial stock in the news was American Home Mortgage Investment. The stock plunged 20.8 per cent to $10.76 as subprime worries among investors intensified and the company did not comment on the sharp decline.Blue chips rallied, led by IBM, and the DJIA rose 0.6 per cent to close at 14,000.41.In earnings news, IBM reported a 12 per cent rise in second quarter profit, and raised earnings guidance for 2007. The stock gained 4.3 per cent to $115.86 and had set a new five-year high of $116.48.Another Dow stock, Honeywell, posted a 24 per cent rise in quarterly profits, beating estimates. The stock rose 0.7 per cent to $60.98 and also reached a seven-year high of $61.90 earlier in the day. The company raised guidance for 2007 and also authorised the buyback of an additional $3bn in stock.Shares in Foot Locker surged 8.6 per cent to $22.71, after the company said it would consider putting itself up for sale. The shoe retailer recently failed to buy rival Genesco.In other earnings, Motorola recorded a quarterly loss amid lower revenue from weak phone sales. Shares rose 1.2 per cent to $18.22.Union Pacific reported a 14 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The railroad slid 0.1 per cent to $125.74.Hershey reported a 96 per cent drop in profits for the past quarter, as the confectionary maker invested in transforming its production lines. Its shares fell 3 per cent to $48.45.Harley Davidson reported a 19 per cent rise in profit and reaffirmed guidance for 2007. But domestic sales of motorcycles fell and the stock slid 2.9 per cent to $59.37.Investors will focus on earnings from two DJIA stocks, Citigroup and Caterpillar on Friday. Citi fell 0.9 per cent to $51.14, while Cat rose 0.9 per cent to $86.42 on Thursday.In economic news on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed survey reported a drop to 9.2 in July from a reading of 18 in June. The six-month outlook index rose 30.4 in July from a reading of 16.7 in June.Economists at Bear Stearns said: “This is a stronger report than suggested by the headline sentiment index.”Later this afternoon the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting in June are released.Earlier in the day, leading indicators for June fell 0.3 per cent, more than a forecast decline of 0.1 per cent.“Housing continues to weigh, a theme that ties in with the concerns Bernanke stated yesterday [Wednesday],” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “However, despite the decline, the trend in the overall index appears to have stabilised after declining early 2006 to a cyclical low in early 2007.”Stocks closed lower on Wednesday, but did pare the worst of their earlier losses.

That pushed the benchmark’s gain so far this year to 9.5 per cent, matching 2006’s total rise.The Nasdaq 100 index is higher by 11.9 per cent in 2007 and leads the major US benchmarks.While the Nasdaq was at fresh highs for 2007 on Tuesday, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average remain below their record closes made in early June.Against the backdrop of higher interest rates in recent months, growth stocks have started to outperform value stocks and that has been a plus for technology shares, traders say.A number of technology stocks were in news on Tuesday ahead of the July 4 holiday. UBS upgraded Business Objects to “buy” from “neutral” and shares in the business software maker rose 2.2 per cent to $40.32.Marvell Technology was up 1.9 per cent at $18.42, on news that it makes the Wi-Fi chip that enables the iPhone to connect wirelessly to the internet.Apple rose 4.9 per cent to $127.17 and Goldman Sachs said the company had sold at least 700,000 iPhones.

SAP, the German software company, said a division that provides support for business software applications made “inappropriate” downloads from Oracle’s web site.On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 1,524.87. Among leading sectors, energy, technology and financials led gains. Utilities were lower as the yield on the 10-year bond rose back above 5 per cent.Consumer discretionary stocks were also lower after pending home sales fell 3.5 per cent in May, their lowest level since September 2001. Consumer staples stocks also languished as analysts expect lower retail sales in general.Dividends were in the news after Standard & Poor’s reported a 7.2 per cent decline in the number of companies increasing their payments to shareholders during the second quarter of 2007, versus the second quarter of 2006.“The decline in dividend increases is disturbing, especially in light of continued, moderate earnings growth and the abundance of corporate cash,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P. “We believe the present wave of corporate buy-backs is contributing to the slower pace of dividend growth in 2007.”In deal news on Tuesday, Kraft made a $7.2bn bid for the global biscuit business of France’s Danone. Kraft lost 2.5 per cent to $34.66.Shares in Wendy’s rose 2.7 per cent to $38.39.

64;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2007-02-02T21:35:23Z;Wall St boosted by strong data;;Sentiment on Wall Street was boosted further this week by data suggesting the economy was growing at a healthy rate and inflation had moderated.Analysts believe a firm economy should boost earnings prospects this year. As broad markets rallied over the week, harbingers of long-term strength – transport sector stocks and smaller companies – both entered record territory.The Dow Jones Transports Average rose 6.2 per cent, extending gains this year to over 9 per cent. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks topped 800 for the first time and was 2.7 per cent higher for the week at 809.7 by the close of trading. .“It’s been a big week for stocks,”said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. Referring to the January employment report, which showed steady growth in job creation yesterday, he said “the economy appears neither too cold or warm, in other words goldilocks.” The mixed performance of stocks yesterday reflected a “tired” Friday market, he said.At the close the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 1,448.39, a gain of 1.8 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial was 0.2 per cent lower at 12,653.49, a rally of 1.3 per cent for the week. The bluechip barometer set a new all-time high of 12,653.49 in early trade yesterday. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent at 2,475.88, a rise of 1.7 per cent for the week.Another factor considered positive for stocks is the strong pace of earnings growth, as highlighted in this week’s fourth-quarter results, compared with the low level of bond yields.“A 10 per cent earnings quarter in a sub 5 per cent world for bond yields still leaves stocks looking attractive,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Deal activity this week kicked off with Merrill Lynch’s $1.8bn purchase of First Republic Bank. The stock surged 40.5 per cent to $53.80, while Merrill rose 0.5 per cent to $95.01.In the newsprint industry, Abitibi-Consolidated and Bowater said they would merge, sending shares in Bowater up 24.6 per cent to $27.60, while Abitibi rose 19.3 per cent to $3.15.Equity Office Properties fell 0.3 per cent to $55.38 but is still up 14.9 per cent in 2007, as a battle for control of the company raged. A group led by Vornado Realty Trust raised its offer to $56 a share, above Blackstone’s increased bid of $54 that valued EOP at $38.3bn.“The all-cash Blackstone bid scheduled to close next week is superior to the Vornado bid, which could drag on for several months or not close at all,” analysts at CreditSights said. The EOP board said yesterday it supported the Blackstone bid, which shareholders will vote on next week.The bidding war kept real estate investment trusts in the spotlight, but analysts warned that yields on Reits compared poorly with 10-year Treasuries.Deal speculation boosted Bristol Myers Squibb this week, and its shares rose 9.3 per cent to $28.64.One deal that failed to take off was US Airways’ planned purchase of Delta, in bankruptcy protection. After opposition from Delta’s unsecured creditors, US Airways withdrew its $9.75bn offer. Its stock rose 11.2 per cent to $57.98 this week as it reported a return to profitability in the fourth quarter.Motorola shares rose 8 per cent to $19.85 as Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, sought to join its board.Boeing beat earnings estimates and boosted the Dow this week. It rose 5.4 per cent to $90.05, as profits for the fourth quarter doubled.3M pulled the Dow lower as its shares fell 6.1 per cent to $73.87. The diversified manufacturer beat earnings estimates but said slower global economic growth could hurt 2007 results.Dell fell 0.9 per cent to $23.52 this week in spite of a brief surge when the computer maker said Michael Dell, chairman, would return to his role as chief executive.Gilead Sciences rallied 12.7 per cent to $70.67 and its stock hit an all-time high of $71.92 after the biopharmaceutical company reported stronger than expected earnings.Amazon beat earnings forecasts but analysts were concerned about its margins. Shares fell 3.4 per cent to $37.39 yesterday, up 1.5 per cent for the week.Juniper Networks slid 4 per cent to $18.20 this week as it failed to provide detailed financial information for the third consecutive quarter.
65;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2007-02-02T08:08:00Z;Ericsson ahead 8% at SKr36bn;;Ericsson, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment company, on Friday reported a 8 per cent increase in operating profit last year to SKr35.8bn ($5.1bn, €4bn).Closely watched operating margins at the Swedish company dropped slightly from 21.8 per cent in 2005 to 20.1 per cent last year, but stabilised in the fourth quarter at 22.7 per cent, the same as the comparable period last year.“Our financial strength has enabled us to execute our strategy of organic growth and own development in combination with bolt-on acquisitions,” said Carl Henric Svanberg, chief executive.During 2006, Ericsson completed the integration of Marconi, the UK telecoms equipment maker acquired for $2bn in 2005, and announced that the company had reached its expected level of profitability.It also acquired Redback Networks, the US internet protocol firm, for $2.1bn.Ericsson said net sales rose 17 per cent to SKr177.8bn. Net income rose to SKr26.3bn from SKr24.3bn and earnings per share from SKr1.53 to SKr1.65.The company proposed a dividend of SKr0.5 a share compared to SKr.45 in 2005.The most significant strategic development last year was the acquisition of Redback, a maker of broadband network routers. The purchase accelerates Ericsson’s ability to provide internet protocol (IP) technology, which allows for the delivery of telephone calls, television and broadband services via the internet.These services are becoming increasingly popular as operators offer customers so-called “triple play” packages that involve access to telephone, TV and broadband services in one subscription.Existing traffic is delivered over four networks – wireless, wireline, data/IP and TV – but will converge into one all-IP network in future.According to Ericsson, traffic on fixed networks will be driven by internet usage and IP television and is expected to grow from a combined 25,000 petabytes today to over 250,000 in 2011. (One petabyte is equivalent to 1m gigabytes.)The market for broadband network routers is dominated by Cisco Systems of the US. Ericsson’s acquisition will allow Redback to compete more aggressively with Cisco as it gains access to the Swedish company’s global operations.Independent analysis indicates Redback has a share of around 6 per cent of the worldwide market for edge routers, far below Cisco with 51 per cent, and Alcatel-Lucent and Juniper Networks, which are both in the mid-teens.The total market for this type of equipment is around $4.1bn this year but forecast to grow to $5.8bn by 2009.The deal formed part of the ongoing consolidation of the network equipment industry following the merger of Alcatel and Lucent and the proposed merger of the equipment units of Finland’s Nokia and Siemens of Germany.
66;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2007-01-09T01:00:02Z;Juniper Networks names new COO;;Juniper Networks, the world’s second-biggest maker of data networking equipment, on Monday appointed the former chief executive of Macromedia, the software group, to the newly created role of chief operating officer.Stephen Elop, most recently head of sales and customer service at Adobe Systems, which bought Macromedia in 2005, will lead Juniper’s sales, service, marketing and IT teams when he steps into his new role.“With a COO of Stephen’s caliber, we will enhance our ability to focus and execute on a global scale,” said Scott Kriens, Juniper’s chief executive. “His energy, talent and alignment with our culture make Stephen an excellent fit for Juniper.”Mr Elop also expressed excitement. “I believe in Scott’s vision for the company’s future and am eager to contribute everything I can to achieving those goals, starting today,” he said.His appointment came weeks after Juniper said it would take a $900m charge resulting from options backdating. Juniper is among the biggest of more than 160 companies to have come under scrutiny for improperly dated stock options grants.During his seven years at Macromedia, Mr Elop served in a variety of functions, including chief operating officer and head of field operations, in addition to serving as CEO.Shares in Juniper, which is attempting to gain ground against Cisco Systems, the leader in the market for internet switches and routers, rose 1.5 per cent to $20.23 on Monday ahead of the announcement. The shares were unchanged in after-hours trading. They had risen from a low of $12.20 in August.

Best Buy gained 1.8 per cent to 49.21 after Credit Suisse raised its rating on the stock to “outperform”.At the close in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent, or 5.2 points, at 1,418.31 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent, or 11.8 points lower at 2,415.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent, or 42.6 points, at 12,421.25.In corporate news, Nike said after the close of the previous session that quarterly net profit rose nearly 8 per cent, beating Wall Street estimates. Nike shares were up 0.5 per cent at $100.29.The creditors’ committee at Delta Air Linesgave management of the firm an lukewarm vote of confidence, saying it supported the airline’s plan to emerge from bankruptcy as an independent carrier, but would continue to consider alternatives. Delta shares rose 5.7 per cent to $1.29. Rival US Airways Group has made a hostile $8.4bn bid for Delta.Juniper Networks, which makes routers used for internet and private computer networks, said it would incur a $900m charge for stock options granted between 1999 and 2003. In spite of this, its shares rose 0.8 per cent at $19.36.US regulators approved Invega, a longer-lasting version of Risperdal, Johnson & Johnson’s schizophrenia drug.

68;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Juniper hit with $900m backdating charge;;The cost of the options backdating scandal came into sharper focus on Wednesday after Juniper Networks, the world’s second-biggest maker of data networking equipment, said it expected to take a $900m charge to account for improperly dated options grants.The company’s expected restatement would be one of the biggest at a Silicon Valley company since news of the scandal broke in March. Broadcom, a semiconductor equipment maker, has said it expects to record costs of $1.5bn as a result of the scandal. The news came a day after UnitedHealth, a healthcare provider, said it expected to take a non-cash charge of up to $600m related to backdating – an apparently widespread and potentially fraudulent practice in which the value of an options grant is artificially inflated by changing the grant date to coincide with a low point in the value of a company’s shares.Juniper said on Wednesday that an internal probe into options grants found that the dates were chosen “with the benefit of hindsight…so as to give favourable prices” to grantees. It said its investigation had uncovered “serious concerns regarding certain former management” at the company.More than 160 companies are under investigation by US authorities or have launched their own internal probes into suspected options backdating. Several dozen companies have announced that they may be forced to restate their financial results. Dozens of top executives have been sacked, while former executives at two companies have been charged with securities fraud for their roles in alleged options abuse.Scott Kriens, Juniper’s chief executive, expressed regret over the scandal. “In prior years, we should have had better stock option granting processes, controls and oversight in place, and we did not,” he said. Juniper said on Wednesday that its board remained confident in Mr Kriens and his management team.Juniper’s shares fell 0.8 per cent to $19.05 in after-hours trading following the announcement. The shares had risen from $15.49 in May, when it revealed it was under investigation for suspected backdating.
69;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2006-12-20T10:59:49Z;Ericsson buys Redback for $2.1bn;;Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications equipment manufacturer, has offered to acquire Redback Networks, the US network equipment company, for $2.1bn in cash, its largest deal since acquiring Marconi of the UK for just over $2bn in 2005.Redback is a maker of broadband network routers and the proposed purchase accelerates Ericsson’s ability to provide internet protocol technology, which allows for the delivery of telephone calls, television and broadband services via the internet.These services are becoming increasingly popular as operators offer customers so-called triple play packages that involve access to telephone, TV and broadband services in one subscription.Carl Henric Svanberg, Ericsson’s chief executive, said in an interview that today’s proposed move was part of the “IP-fication of Ericsson”.Existing traffic is delivered over four networks – wireless, wireline, data/IP and TV – but will converge into one all-IP network in future.According to Ericsson, traffic on fixed networks will be driven by internet usage and internet protocol television and is expected to grow from a combined 25,000 petabytes today to over 250,000 in 2011.The market for broadband network routers is dominated by Cisco Systems of the US.

Redback’s shares has surged 51 per cent this year on hopes of further consolidation in the router sector.At the open in Stockholm Ericsson’s shares rose as much as SKr0.55, or 2 per cent, to SKr28.1.The acqusition is Ericsson’s largest since it acquired Marconi of the UK for just over $2bn in 2005.
70;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2006-11-22T15:43:46Z;Wall Street inches higher ahead of holiday;;Wall Street indices inched higher in New York on Tuesday, but several high profile stocks broke the market’s shackles in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday later this week.The imminent long weekend break is expected to cap the recent run in stocks, but some analysts believe the market has further room to rally in the coming weeks.“Given the popularity of the US large cap trade recommendation, it is useful to establish whether this is indeed a consensus, or crowded, trade,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.Looking at recent price moves and activity in the futures market, notably positioning by speculative investors, Mr Shairp concluded: “There is limited evidence that US stocks have become a crowded trade.”“US equities are still supported by improving liquidity and attractive valuations, compared to both bonds and their own history,” he said. “The US market looks a bit toppy in the short term, but is far from being a crowded trade.”For now, analysts said fallingvolatility could support a further rise in stocks.The Chicago Board of Trade’s Vix index fell below 10 on Monday and hit a low of 9.84 before closing at a 12½ year low of 9.89, below the closing low of 9.94 set in January 1994.Historically, such a low level for the Vix has reflected very strong appetite for risk-taking and has usually been followed by a sharp rise in volatility.Several companies hit record highs, led by Google. The internet search group’s shares climbed above $500 for the first time, hitting a peak of $510 before edging back to close 3 per cent higher at $509.65. Since reaching a low point of $367.23 on August 2, shares in the company have risen 38.9 per cent.Apple also closed at a record high of $88.60, up $2.13 or 2.2 per cent.Aircraft maker Boeing rose $1.98, or 2.2 per cent, to $91.10 after announcing an order from Korean Air for 25 aircraft worth $5.5bn.Boeing shares touched a high of $92.05, beating last week’s previous peak generated by reports it will win large orders in the region of $10bn.Shares in the NYSE Group also surged to a record high of $105.12, and closed 9.7 up on the day at $104.60. The company said its board would be split evenly between Europeans and Americans if it completes its proposed merger with Euronext.

71;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2006-11-10T21:30:54Z;Wall St edges higher helped by deals, earnings;;US stocks were caught in several cross-currents during the week as earnings, deals and likely repercussions from the mid-term Congressional elections were digested by investors.The main indices rose modestly, led by the Nasdaq Composite, which was helped by a surge in earnings from technology giant Cisco, up 12.5 per cent over the week at $26.74.With the Democrats claiming control of the House of Representatives for the first time since 1994 and narrowly gaining a majority in the Senate, equity investors focused on the likely winners and losers under a new Congress.“It’s uncertain just how much specific regulation or actions will be imposed by the Democrats,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “While investor concern is well founded, congressional gridlock will likely hold sweeping changes at bay.”Early indications were that losers could include companies in the pharmaceutical and defence sectors, while labour conditions at Wal-Mart, down 2.2 per cent at $46.47, and a rise in the minimum wage are also likely to attract the attention of lawmakers.The winners are expected to include alternative energy and stem cell research companies along with the Government housing agencies that made gains over the week. Fannie Mae, up 3.6 per cent at $60.38, and Freddie Mac, up 2.2 per cent at $69.48, capitalised on expectations of less onerous regulation.In contrast, investors sold down the healthcare sector and big defence companies this week. The New York Stock Exchange Healthcare index rose 1.7 per cent early in the week ahead of the elections but tumbled after the election results. The index was down 2.1 per cent for the week at 6,742.80.“There is some concern for healthcare, with the Democrats talking about Medicare and [with] an eye toward lowering prescription drug prices,” said Mr Ablin.Big pharmaceutical groups Merck and Pfizer fell 4.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent to $43.12 and $25.71 respectively during the week. Johnson & Johnson was off 2.2 per cent at $66.29.Among managed health care providers, Humana fell 8.4 per cent to $52, in spite of reiterating its 2006 and 2007 earnings targets earlier in the week. UnitedHealth was down 3.6 per cent at $46.11, and WellCare fell 5.2 per cent to $56.WellPoint and Aetna were lower by 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent at $72.89 and $40.24 respectively. Watson-Pharma slid 5.2 per cent to $24.84 after disappointing earnings and legal woes. Bausch & Lomb fell 6.6 per cent for the week to $49.50 after it lowered 2006 and 2007 forecasts following the recall of its ReNu contact lens solution.Defence shares pared some of their post-election losses but on Friday were still down on the week.

72;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2006-10-29T19:34:49Z;East Asia sees surge in R&D spending;;"East Asia is continuing to show spectacular growth in research and development expenditure, a comprehensive scoreboard of top R&D spenders reveals on Monday.Taiwanese and South Korean companies account for some of the most impressive growth: they increased their R&D investment by 30.5 per cent and nearly 12 per cent respectively last year, according to the scoreboard of the 1,250 biggest spenders on R&D published by the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK.Few of the 44 Taiwanese companies listed are well known in the rest of the world but their combined spending of $4.6bn over 2005/06 was 44.6 per cent higher than the average of the previous four years.Taiwanese R&D is distributed among a large number of electronics and computer companies, while in South Korea it is dominated by three fast-growing giants: Samsung and LG in electronics and Hyundai in cars. Samsung’s R&D spending has grown from $1.88bn to $5.44bn over the past four years, according to the scoreboard.R&D growth remains modest in Japan – a continuing legacy of the country’s long period of economic stagnation. Japanese companies raised spending by 4 per cent over 2005/06 and their investment was only 5.9 per cent above the average of the previous four years.In the rest of the world, the scoreboard reveals the transatlantic technology gap has widened in the past year, as US companies continue to increase R&D faster than their European rivals. Corporate R&D rose by 5.8 per cent in Europe over the past year compared with 8.2 per cent in the US.The findings will add fuel to the growing campaign in Europe for radical action to reverse the region’s long-term underperformance in industrial innovation.Mike Tubbs, who has led the R&D scoreboard analysis team for the past eight years, says there is now incontrovertible evidence that higher R&D spending tends to produce better long-term sales and profits growth.For example, technology companies that responded to the sector’s slump in sales between 2001 and 2003 by increasing R&D, such as Nokia, AMD and Juniper Networks, have done much better since then than companies that cut their R&D spending.Pharmaceuticals is the fastest-growing sector, the DTI analysis shows. When the scoreboard started in 1992, none of the top 20 R&D spenders were drugs companies; now six are.The telecommunications and chemicals industries, each of which had two top 20 companies 14 years ago, have lost them all.But the automotive sector retains the top spot, which it has held from the beginning. Pfizer, a US pharmaceuticals company, was widely predicted to take the lead in 2005/06, but Ford increased its R&D spending by 8 per cent to $8bn, in spite of its financial problems, and takes over from DaimlerChrysler as the number one on the scoreboard."

Companies that spend more on research and development tend to perform better than their competitors in sales and profits growth.When the UK Department of Trade and Industry started the project in1991, it was based on a widespread belief that British companies were suffering from under-investment in science and technology, though there was little hard evidence to support that view.But Mike Tubbs, who has led the DTI’s R&D Scoreboard analysis for the past eight years, says the link between R&D spending and growth is now incontrovertible, “though, of course, good R&D alone does not assure business success because there are other important factors involved in innovation”.A simple example of the benefits of R&D spending for share price is the performance of the scoreboard’s “R&D portfolio”, comprised of companies in the FTSE100 index that devote more than 4 per cent of their turnover to R&D. Since it started in August 1997, the portfolio has increased in value by 73 per cent, while the FTSE100 has risen by only 16 per cent (see graph below).A comparison of companies within sectors is more revealing. In technology hardware and software there is a very clear correlation between long-term R&D growth and sales growth, says Mr Tubbs. Technology companies that responded to the sector’s slump in sales between 2001 and 2003 by increasing R&D, such as Nokia, AMD and Juniper Networks, have done much better since then than the companies that cut R&D.Technology policy experts in Europe maintain that the region’s under-investment in corporate R&D in comparison with the US has contributed to an underperformance in innovation, which has led to slower economic growth.Measures to persuade European companies to spend more on R&D have so far concentrated on the “supply side” such as grants, subsidies and tax credits, says Luke Georghiou, director of Policy Research in Engineering, Science and Technology at Manchester Business School. But policymakers are now switching attention to the demand side. “All the evidence shows that firms are influenced more than anything by the market,” Prof Georghiou says. “If we can stimulate the demand for innovative goods and services, then firms are stimulated to increase their R&D. That is more effective than offering bigger government subsidies or tax credits.”The Aho Group, an independent expert group, has made an impact this year by proposing a demand-led strategy to stimulate European innovation. This would include making far better use of public procurement through R&D contracts.

Large companies which have admitted to having awarded backdated stock options to executives include home improvement retailer Home Depot, United Health Group, the health insurer, and Juniper Networks, the telecommunications equipment company.Shares in B&N were down 1 per cent at $34.93 in early trade in New York.

The company said it had not determined the amount of its restatement.Juniper, whose $7.4bn market capitalisation makes it among the largest companies to be caught up in the widening scandal over alleged improper backdating of stock options, said it would appeal any attempt to de-list its shares.“We anticipate we will have four to six months to file reports to avoid de-listing,” a spokeswoman said.Options granting practices at more than 80 companies have come under scrutiny by US authorities. Juniper was among the first companies to disclose that it was the subject of a formal Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into stock options grants.Some industry watchers say executives at hundreds of companies may eventually be implicated in an apparently widespread practice of inflating the value of a company’s stock options by changing their grant dates to coincide with low points in the value of their companies’ shares.Former executives at two technology companies – Brocade Communications Systems and Comverse Technology – have been charged with securities fraud for their roles in alleged improper backdating schemes.Shares in Juniper fell 3.8 per cent to $12.90 in after-hours trading.Apple Computer this week warned that it was likely to restate several years of financial results following an internal investigation into stock options grants.Mercury Interactive, the business software company, became a takeover target after options issues forced its shares off the Nasdaq.The company last month agreed to a $4.5bn takeover by Hewlett-Packard, the world’s second-biggest IT group.
80;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2006-07-30T18:37:04Z;How to hit outsized jackpots in private equity;;And it is not by doing multi-billion buy-outsIn private equity, buy-outs attract the big money and most of the big headlines, as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts demonstrated once again last week with its $33bn (£17.7bn) proposed mega deal for HCA, the US hospital operator.Yet it is venture capital that produces the real jackpots. For proof, look at the latest biannual report of the Yale Endowment. This reveals that the university’s initial $300,000 investment in Google generated an incredible $75m gain when the company went public in 2004. This was no flash in the pan.In the 1970s and 1980s, Yale invested in many of the start-ups that defined the technology industry, including Compaq Computer, Oracle, Genentech, Dell Computer and Amgen.In the 1990s, it backed Amazon.com, Yahoo, Cisco Systems, Red Hat and Juniper Networks. Quite a bag.Since the university started investing in private equity in 1973, the asset class has generated an average annual return of 31 per cent. Over the past 10 years, the average return has been a phenomenal 39.5 per cent.As the fund has long been overweight in private equity, this has made a significant contribution to the endowment’s outstanding average annual return over two decades of 16 per cent, which has raised the value more than tenfold to $15bn.The key to the endowment’s success in private equity has been the choice of managers, along with a carefully judged alignment of interests. In venture capital, it has invested with Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia and Sutter Hill. Its buy-out partners include Bain Capital (which is a partner with KKR and Merrill Lynch in the HCA deal), Berkshire Partners, Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Madison Dearborn Partners.What a shame that European universities have done nothing to compare with the likes of Yale, Harvard or Princeton, all of which have profited handsomely from a strong portfolio bias towards alternative assets such as private equity, real assets and absolute return investments.The sad fact is that Europe lacks the innovative capability in technology to provide potential investment jackpots. Indeed, Yale regards Europe as fruitful buy-out territory but looks to Asia for foreign venture capital opportunities.The architect of Yale’s stupendous performance over the past 20 years is David Swensen, the endowment’s chief investment officer. Unlike that other noted guru Warren Buffett, he attracts few headlines and writes investment books that contain much more wisdom than wit.Also unlike Warren Buffett, he has managed to maintain the outperformance momentum – though, in fairness to Mr Buffett, Yale does have the advantage of managing a much smaller pot of money.Sniping at MynersPaul Myners was forced from the chairmanship of Marks and Spencer by Kevin Lomax, the senior independent director, on the basis that his relationship with Stuart Rose, chief executive, was too close.Now people are raising eyebrows because Stuart Rose is on the nomination committee that last week appointed Mr Myners to the chairmanship of Land Securities.This looks to me a classic example of putting corporate governance form before substance. Paul Myners did an outstanding job at Marks and Spencer in fighting off a potential bid from Philip Green and appointing a chief executive who is putting the retailer back on track.He has the energy, credentials and integrity to do an equally good job at Britain’s largest property company.The notion that he lacked the independence and objectivity to run the M&S board is frankly bizarre, as is the idea that he might not bring these qualities to Land Securities.What surprises me is that other members of the M&S board were persuaded to shed their chairman by a man who had been criticised on governance grounds at software group Misys for combining the roles of chairman and chief executive.Limits of disclosureGiven the egregious nature of so many compensation packages in the US boardroom, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s new rules to force more disclosure of pay, perquisites and the timing of stock option grants looks overdue.Whether they will be enough is another matter.Under the US’s Soviet-style plurality voting system, shareholders cannot respond to inappropriate pay by ousting directors through voting against their re-election. Nor, in the absence of a meaningful vote, will it be possible to address the problem of big rewards for failure, which provide such a dangerous incentive for chief executive officers to bet the company.As Stephen Davis of the Global Proxy Watch newsletter points out, the SEC has missed an opportunity to extract disclosure about compensation consultants’ conflicts of interest. No doubt consultants will earn yet more fees for advising on the new rules.john.plender@ft.comwww.ft.com/plender
81;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2006-06-16T22:04:30Z;Home Depot ensnared in options scandal;;Home Depot has become the largest US company to acknowledge having awarded backdated stock options to executives, extending the scandal further beyond the technology sector where the controversial practice was most common.The home improvement retailer said it had discovered $10m of unrecorded expenses resulting from five cases of retroactively priced stock options.More than 40 US companies have been exposed for manipulating the exercise price of stock options to increase their value to executives.Home Depot is the best-known name to have become embroiled in the scandal, attracting fresh scrutiny to its corporate governance at a time when the company was already under fire over soaring executive pay.All five cases of backdating occurred before 2000, when Bob Nardelli, the current chief executive, took charge.The company did not disclose who had received the backdated options but said its billionaire founders, Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, were not involved.An official said the company had made the find in the course of a voluntary internal investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission was not involved.“Home Depot is committed to high standards of corporate governance and transparency in its reporting practices and, as such, conducted a review of its stock option grant practices and procedures since 1996,” the company said, in a statement.Other large companies caught up in the scandal include UnitedHealth Group, the health insurer, and Juniper Networks, the telecommunications equipment company.Backdating involves the use of a grant date for a share option that comes before the date when the decision was made to award the option.This allowed the option to be backdated to when the awarding company’s share price was lower, increasing the potential profit for executives when the option is exercised.Home Depot said that in three of the five cases, the company’s share price was higher on the award date than on the date when the exercise price was set.Backdating is not necessarily illegal but the practice has forced several companies to restate earnings and sparked probes by the SEC and the Justice Department because stock option expenses were not properly disclosed.Home Depot said its $10m of unrecorded expenses were not great enough to merit a restatement.But its involvement in backdating is an acute embarrassment for the company, coming weeks after it faced a shareholder rebellion over the nearly $250m of compensation awarded to Mr Nardelli over the past six years.Most cases of backdating occurred before the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which aimed to improve corporate governance in the US.Christopher Cox, chairman of the SEC, is considering adding fresh guidelines on stock option disclosure to a landmark executive compensation reform proposal he presented earlier this year.
82;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2006-06-13T22:43:44Z;Probe into US stock option claims grows;;The Department of Justice on Tuesday said it considered allegations that dozens of US companies might have improperly backdated stock options “very serious”, as another company said it was under investigation.More than 40 companies, mostly in the technology sector, are the subject of probes by the US attorneys or the Securities and Exchange Commission – or both – after it emerged that stock options were retroactively awarded to executives to dates that immediately preceded a rise in the company’s share price.Investigations are understood to be focused on whether the backdating of stock options was done without proper disclosure to shareholders, and whether or not they were properly “expensed” for tax purposes.“The department considers allegations of this nature to be very serious,” Eileen O’Connor, assistant attorney-general at the department’s tax division, told a Senate finance committee hearing.Ms O’Connor said criminal penalties applicable included 25 years in jail and a $250,000 fine for securities fraud.Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee’s chairman, said: “I’ve asked the justice department to let me know whether the tax laws on the books are adequate to rein in and prosecute stock option backdating. If the tax laws are inadequate, I want to beef them up.”On Tuesday RSA Security, a Massachusetts-based online security company, became the 20th company to be subject to a justice department probe. It said the US attorney for the southern district of New York had subpoenaed it, requesting records from 1996 to the present related to its granting of stock options. Shareholder anger that executives may have fraudulently enriched themselves has spilled over into lawsuits.Two large US public pension funds on Monday filed suit against McAfee, an internet security company, and Juniper Networks, another technology company. The lawsuits are a sign that broader questions are being asked about the state of executive compensation Stock options have long been viewed as effective tools with which to give executives incentives to perform. But any proof that executives used backdating fraudulently to enrich themselves would puncture that notion, corporate governance experts and lawyers say.Mr Grassley said: “It’s one thing for an executive to make big profits because he’s improved his company, but it’s a whole different thing to make big profits because he’s playing fast and loose with the dating of stock options.”
83;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2006-06-13T00:40:54Z;Funds sue amid probe into timing of options;;Shareholder anger over US executive compensation practices spilled into the open on Monday as two big US pension funds sued companies involved in an investigation into the timing of stock-option awards.Darren Robbins, a partner at Lerach Coughlin, said his San Diego law firm was also representing pension funds in Europe and Australia that were preparing similar action.“People are very upset about this. There have been at least five pension funds that have filed cases in the last 72 business hours in court houses from California to Boston,” he told the Financial Times.McAfee, a software security maker, was sued on Monday in federal court in the Northern District of California by the Heavy & General Laborers’ Pension and Annuity Funds, alleging “constructive fraud” through the backdating of stock options.Juniper Networks, a technology company, was hit with a similar complaint by the Employer-Teamsters Pension Health and Welfare Funds. Neither McAfee nor Juniper were immediately available for comment.Mr Robbins said his firm had been directed to take similar action by clients “in at least 34 different situations”.Four separate companies revealed on Monday that they were being investigated by regulators over their options grants. More than 40 companies have become ensnared in one of the widest criminal and regulatory investigations into white-collar compensation in recent years. The probe is emerging as a test of years of executive compensation practices and has started to draw the anger of unions.The AFL-CIO said last week that the stock option backdating scandal “shares many similarities to the after-hours trading of mutual funds, where favoured insiders received preferential terms that were hidden from public investors”.Four companies – Broadcom, Equinix, Applied Micro Circuits and Cyberonics – said they were the subject of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Monster Worldwide, the operator of an online recruitment site, said it had formed an independent committee of directors to conduct an internal review of all stock options grants made by the company.Investigations are focusing on the award of stock options to executives on dates that immediately preceded a sharp rise in the companies' share prices.Such a move would immediately have put the options “in the money”, requiring proper disclosure to shareholders. Some companies have been hit with class-action lawsuits from public pension funds alleging that no such disclosure was made and that shareholders were defrauded.The focus of investigations is in the years before 2002, when tough Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance rules limited the scope for backdating of options.New accounting rules requiring options expensing were introduced last year.
84;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2006-05-24T20:36:05Z;Stock options worries cast shadow over Silicon Valley;;"Few things, with the possible exceptions of chinos and corporate-logo polo shirts, are more emblematic of Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurial culture than stock options.So it should come as no surprise that mounting concerns about whether executives may have inappropriately enriched themselves by manipulating the timing of stock options grants have cast a shadow over the valley’s technology industry.Several companies whose stock options granting practices have come under official scrutiny from US authorities call Silicon Valley their home. Bay Area companies whose practices are being investigated include KLA-Tencor, a chipmaker; OpenWave, a software group; and Juniper Networks, a networking equipment maker.As the scope of of the scrutiny widens, it has begun to raise broader questions about the quality of corporate governance in the world’s premiere high-tech hotspot. “As a shareholder you would always worry about what else [management] are doing,” says Henry Hu, a professor at the University of Texas law school who studies legal questions surrounding options and other financial instruments.Prof Hu says the rapid growth of many companies in the valley, where the pace of technological change means that no-name companies can turn into multibillion-dollar giants in a few years, may have contributed to a lax governance culture.“When you are a company growing really fast, your systems may not grow up accordingly,” he says. “With a more mature company you have a generation or two of human capital devoted to making sure all the controls are there.”The problem of stock options back-dating began in March, after the Wall Street Journal published a report describing several cases of unusual timing of stock options grants. The pattern suggested that some companies may have retroactively granted options on dates that coincided with low points in the value of their shares. If such actions took place without being disclosed to shareholders, it would raise serious legal and governance concerns.Until recently, Silicon Valley had avoided the ethical scandals that plagued other industries in the wake of the dotcom bust.Although investors lost billions as companies with questionable business plans collapsed, the tech industry emerged from the ruckus with its ethical reputation mostly intact. In spite of huge losses, and contrary to the expectations of some, the internet bubble failed to produce the tech-sector equivalent of an Enron or WorldCom.Now, with evidence suggesting that some executives may have manipulated stock options procedures, academics and analysts say it is time for companies to pause and take stock of their internal controls. “This should cause some introspection,” says David Larcker, a professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business and an expert on corporate governance.Prof Larcker says the stock market’s reaction to the unfolding controversy is a sign of investor fear that companies may have more dirty laundry to air.“Some of these companies saw their stock price back off 10-15 per cent,” he says. “These guys didn’t abscond with 10-15 per cent of the value of the company. The market has to be looking at that and saying there could be broader governance issues and there could be executive turnover.”Although the award of stock options is a common practice, in Silicon Valley options take on a special significance.Because they only have value if a company’s shares rise above a certain strike price, options have long been viewed as a preferred way to reward both executives and employees who come to work in Silicon Valley’s risky start-ups. Prof Larcker says that entrepreneurial culture, along with the need to invest cash first in new technologies, may have led some companies to under-invest in governance controls.“Having great accounting is not going to help you make it,” he says. “You can easily run out of cash. It’s a very tough thing to hit it big. On the way these companies spend most of their time and money on technological innovation. If you don’t break the technology barrier, it’s over.”Even before the recent revelations about suspected options back-dating, there were signs that the stock options’ heyday in the valley was over.The coming of Sarbanes Oxley, along with new rules that went into effect this year requiring companies to take the expense of stock options into account in their company reports, means that boards of directors are no longer using options to the extent they did during the 1990s boom."
85;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2005-10-20T20:35:10Z;US stocks slide as inflation fears persist;;Wall Street fell sharply on Thursday as worries over rising inflation and interest rates once again hung over the market.A slide in oil and natural gas prices off the back of rising inventories caused a major sell-off in energy stocks, with the Amex oil index slumping 4.7 per cent.Conoco Phillips fell 6.2 per cent to $57.75, Amerada Hess lost 5.3 per cent $112.75, Chevron slid 4.4 per cent to $55.75 and Exxon Mobil gave up 3.3 per cent at $55.26.A wider-ranging sell-off was sparked by the release of the Philadelphia Fed index, which showed both the prices paid by manufacturers’ for materials and the prices received for finished goods rose at their fastest pace for 25 years this month.“We have continued to have Fed speakers talk about interest rates going higher and the prices paid component [of the Philly Fed] was awful, as bad as we have seen since 1980,” said Jim Awad, chairman of Awad Asset Management.“The last place people had profits was oil shares and we have now seen them pulling out. We are entering the capitulation stage.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 133.03 points, or 1.3 per cent, at 10,281.10, with the wider S&P 500 falling 17.95 points, or 1.5 per cent, at 1,177.81 and the Nasdaq Composite losing 23.13 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 2,068.11.In spite of falling oil prices, the Amex airline index also slumped 5.8 per cent. JetBlue fell 7.6 per cent to $18.05 as Standard & Poor’s cut its credit rating, citing an expected full-year-loss on the back of high energy prices.Denver-based Frontier Airlines dropped 28.6 per cent to $7.68 as rival Southwest Airlines said it would start a service from Denver in 2006.Elsewhere, earnings dominated. Drugs company Pfizer was among blue-chips to disappoint, reporting that third-quarter earnings fell 52 per cent due to acquisition-related charges. Its shares fell 8.6 per cent to $21.90.Online auction site eBay slid 6.8 per cent to $39.15 in spite of reporting a 40 per cent jump in third-quarter earnings. The market was disappointed by eBay’s fourth-quarter earnings forecast, which was dragged lower by acquisition costs.West Pharmaceutical Services was punished by the market for raising third-quarter earnings to 24 cents a share, compared with forecasts of 33 cents, as gross margins fell. The shares lost 14.5 per cent at $23.43.But Coca-Cola rose 0.7 per cent to $42.10 as it beat analyst expectations by posting third-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share. And network equipment maker Juniper Networks firmed 3.6 per cent to $22.79 as third-quarter earnings leapt 72 per cent on strong sales of routers.
86;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2005-07-19T22:39:31Z;Juniper back in the black;;A 61per cent surge in sales of network components and security products enabled Juniper Networks, the world's second-largest internet equipment maker, to swing to a second-quarter profit.Juniper, which makes gear that directs traffic over the internet and corporate networks, reported said a second quarter net profit was $89m, or 15 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $12.6m, or 2 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. The results last year reflected Juniper's acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies.Revenues were $493m compared with $306.9m a year ago and earnings not including items was 18 cents per share. On that basis, analysts were expecting Juniper to earn 17 cents per share on sales of $475.1m.For the current third quarter, Juniper forecast revenue of $525m-$530m, topping Wall Street expectations of $496m. Earnings, excluding items, were seen at 18 cents per share in the quarter, in-line with analyst expectations.Shares in Juniper were trading down almost 4 per cent at $25.53 after hours after closing at $26.53 in New York on Tuesday night.
87;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Router demand lift Juniper’s bottom line;;"Strong sales of internet routing equipment helped Juniper Networks report that fourth quarter earnings quadrupled as sales more than doubled, results that surpassed analysts' expectations.""The fourth quarter was strong in every dimension, which completed a year of record performance,"" said Scott Kriens, the US network equipment maker's chief executive.Mr Kriens said Juniper, a smaller rival to industry leader Cisco Systems, was ""in the sweet spot of the new networking industry"" and had both the opportunities and capabilities to grow in an expanding marketplace.The company raised its outlook, forecasting sales in the current first quarter of $430m-$440m and non-GAAP earnings of 15 cents per share. Analysts had expected the company to forecast sales $415m-$425m and earnings of 15 cents per share.For the first half of the year Juniper expected revenue of $885m-$895m, up from an earlier forecast of $850m-$870m.Juniper said sales in its security products division totaled $80m, up 26 per cent from the prior quarter. Sales in the unit, acquired in Juniper's $3.6bn acquisition of NetScreen Technologies last year, disappointed analysts in the third quarter and prompted concerns about the transaction. Mr Kriens said the company had ""retooled"" its security products in the fourth quarter and restored the unit to growth.For the period ended Dec. 31, the equipment maker had a profit of $66m, or 11 cents per share, compared with almost $15m, or 3 cents per share, during the year ago period. Sales more than doubled to $430m compared with $207m the year before.Not including special items, the company had earnings of $86m, or 15 cents per share, compared with $28m, or 6 cents per share, a year ago. On that basis, Juniper was expected to earn 14 cents per share on sales of $413m in the quarter."
88;JNPR;Juniper Networks;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Hacker attacks are not bad news for all;;"Network security and internet telephony will be among the most sought-after technologies as corporations and telecommunications carriers move to upgrade their networks in 2005.Overall demand for data networking gear is expected to grow by only 8-10 per cent in 2005 as corporations and carriers continue to replace traditional circuit-switched networks with packet-based systems.Demand for greater bandwidth to carry voice, storage, and streaming-video traffic is also driving investment.But if overall growth is forecast as modest, demand for network security is expected to grow more than 20 per cent, driven by a seemingly endless wave of viruses, worms and hacker attacks that has prompted IT managers to safeguard the networks they operate.?There is a definite amount of pain associated with these worms,? says Lawrence Orans, networking analyst at research group Gartner.Network equipment makers have responded aggressively to this new opportunity.Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks acquired several small security firms in 2004 in a bid to develop a comprehensive set of hardware and software products aimed at improving network security.Cisco has been moving to embed security features into its routers, while Juniper was considered to have better technology to secure virtual private networks (VPNs), which enable companies to connect remote sites and people together over a public network.A number of small security groups such as Check Point Software, CyberGuard and Internet Security Systems were also expected to benefit from heightened security fears.Analysts expect these equipment makers in 2005 to release more products that safeguard networks from intrusion and cope with intruders should they penetrate a network's outer defences.Internet telephony is expected to be another bright spot, with corporate spending on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) systems growing an estimated 31 per cent to $4.5bn in 2005, according to research group IDC.Cisco leads this market with a roughly 30 per cent share, as many of its US customers switch from traditional voice technology.But the industry leader's efforts to convert corporations will be slowed by two factors: it lacks a direct sales force in many regions outside the US; and many companies are unlikely to toss out their current systems until they are due to be replaced over the next several years.With nearly every major telecoms carrier committed to converging their networks on to a single IP network over the coming years, the telecoms market has become increasingly important for data networking equipment makers such as Cisco.CIBC World Markets said recently that many carriers would start buying much of the gear required for the transition in 2005.IDC estimated that carrier spending on next generation networking gear, not including legacy technologies, fibre and construction costs, would increase by 10 per cent to $35.7bn in 2005.Of the key next generation technologies, investment in internet telephony was seen to be leading the way with 60 per cent growth, followed by local area network switching at 35 per cent and optical networking gear at 26 per cent growth, said IDC.After years of false starts, Cisco finally seemed to be making inroads in the carrier market, but rivals such as Lucent, Alcatel, Nortel and Siemens have long established carrier relationships and reputations for reliability.Another challenge for the large equipment makers was seen in the intensifying competition from Asian manufacturers, most notably China's Huawei Technologies, which has taken advantage of its low cost base to push prices down.Cisco has cautioned that even as it expects to grow by 10-15 per cent annually through to 2008, the company expects that competition from Asian rivals will put pressure on gross margins for several years."

The Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,143.07.Traders had one eye on Friday's key jobs report and were also hoping for upbeat news from Intel after the close.Just under two stocks declined for every stock that gained at the New York Stock Exchange, where 1.7bn shares traded by the closing bell. At the Nasdaq, the gaining issues and the losing stocks were just about evenly split.Data showing that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week appeared to weigh on sentiment. However, traders and investors were expected to focus on Friday's monthly job creation figures for a clearer insight into the US labour market, whose erratic trends have vexed market watchers this year.In other economic news, factory orders rose more than economists had expected in October, helped by defence expenditures.Stocks continued to receive support from a steadily declining oil price. Nymex WTI futures lost more than $2 on Friday morning after a drop of more than 7 per cent on Wednesday that eased concerns about economic growth and bolstered bulls' hopes for a year-end rally.Airline stocks were broadly higher on Thursday as the falling price of oil eased cost concerns. The Amex airline index climbed 3.6 per cent.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, led gainers, rising 9.1 per cent to $10.70. Northwest Airlines rose 3.1 per cent to $11.32 and Delta Air Lines was 8.2 per cent higher at $7.90.Chris Watling, managing director at Longview Economics, said he expected the current rally in the S&P 500 to last through the first quarter. ""Beyond that, we expect equities to struggle next year as the corporate profit outlook worsens relative to current expectations, and as valuation pressure increases from a rising real interest rate, a worsening equity volatility trend and a diminishing profit growth outlook,"" he said.An improving economic picture could also lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again when it meets later this month.Intel fell 1.7 per cent to $22.71 ahead of its mid-quarter trading update, due after the close. The world's largest chipmaker was widely expected to raise earnings guidance.Shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival, closed flat at $22.62. Semiconductors led Wednesday's rally and Mr Pado said this increased the pressure on the sector, especially on Intel.Some technology investors have warned that the sector has not adjusted to sluggish demand. Others have said the market was unprepared for higher interest rates and a possible dollar crisis. Stocks have largely ignored the greenback's latest decline.A host of retailers reported monthly same-store sales that painted a gloomy picture for the sector ahead of its vital Christmas shopping season.Albertsons, the grocer, slipped 6.1 per cent to $24.20 in spite of the retailer revealing higher quarterly profits boosted by stronger sales.Wet Seal, the clothing chain, said sales at stores open at least one year fell nearly 20 per cent in November. The company's shares rose 2.4 per cent to $1.68.Pier 1 Imports, the home goods retailer, fell 2.2 per cent to $18.30 after the company's earnings guidance disappointed investors. Same-store sales also fell as stagnant demand forced the imported furniture store to cut prices.Cendant, the travel and real estate group, slipped 1.2 per cent to $23.14 after it announced that it was set to buy Ebookers, the UK online travel group, in a deal worth at least $415m.Starbucks jumped 1.9 per cent to $58.65 as the world's biggest coffee chain unveiled same-store sales growth of 13 per cent in November.Away from the retail sector, Juniper Networks, the telecommunications equipment maker, edged higher after Scott Kriens, chief executive, said the company was considering using its $1.5bn cash pile to make acquisitions. Shares in Juniper rose 1.5 per cent to $28.70."
