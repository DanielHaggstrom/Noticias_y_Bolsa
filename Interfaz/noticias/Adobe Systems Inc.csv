0;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-02-05T04:00:28Z;Adobe and Salesforce overturn old order in cloud revolution;Oracle and SAP fade after failing to change fast enough;Shantanu Narayen, the chief executive of US software company Adobe, sounds almost incredulous about his company’s recent stock market transformation.Best known for its Photoshop image-editing software and Acrobat document reader, Adobe had a stock market value of $8bn in the wake of the financial crisis. Late last week, however, it overtook Oracle to become the world’s second most valuable software company after Microsoft, with a stock market value of more than $170bn.“We’re worth more than Oracle, we’re worth more than SAP — we’re worth a lot more than IBM,” said Mr Narayen, ticking off the old powers of the IT world that his company has eclipsed. His short explanation for this reordering of the pecking order in tech: “We’re all about growth.”There has been a changing of the guard in the software world. A rejuvenated Microsoft, under Satya Nadella, still sits at the top of the heap. But below it, companies growing fast on the back of cloud computing have benefited from a surge in investor interest.Salesforce, known for its cloud-based sales automation software, itself overtook German software maker SAP in market value last week and is now within 4 per cent of overhauling Oracle. For Marc Benioff, the former top Oracle salesman who co-founded Salesforce 21 years ago, that would represent a big victory over his former mentor, Larry Ellison. The Oracle boss long scoffed at what he claimed was the faddishness of Wall Street’s infatuation with cloud stocks.Speaking late last week, Mr Benioff wouldn’t be drawn on the rivalry with his old employer, but was dismissive of Oracle’s own, stuttering efforts to latch on to the cloud. “Customers don’t talk about them much,” Mr Benioff said. Pointing to the sales growth that has lifted companies such as Salesforce, he added: “The customers have spoken, in terms of the revenue acceleration of the cloud companies.”With stock market investors starved of growth, cloud software has become “one of the only durable growth markets out there right now in a low-interest rate environment”, said Alex Zukin, a technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Public fascination with the most recent generation of highly valued tech start-ups, known as unicorns, has centred on companies that serve consumer markets, like Uber and Lyft (now valued at $62bn and $14bn, respectively). But business software start-ups have turned out to be a more reliable bet, with companies such as ServiceNow and Shopify — each founded within the past seven years — now worth $64bn and $54bn.The rise of cloud software has been a rapid one. Seven years ago, Adobe became the first traditional software company to jettison its old way of doing business — shipping discs loaded in return for an upfront licence fee — and make the switch completely to the cloud.Swapping upfront licence sales for regular subscription fees meant delaying the recognition of revenue until future years, leading to a pause in reported sales. It took three years for Adobe’s revenue to get back to the point it had been at the start of the transition. But in the four years since, it has jumped more than 130 per cent.Both Adobe, which makes tools for creative professionals and marketers, and Salesforce, which expanded from sales to marketing departments, have benefited from the greater penetration of software in the “front office” of businesses, reshaping the jobs of many people whose jobs involve dealing with customers.This was partly a result of luck, said Mr Zukin: As online interaction began to produce a deluge of data from customers, both companies were well placed to help businesses understand and manage the new flood of information.We’re just still at the beginning of the digital transformation of so many companiesAdobe, whose core software products were used by creative types like designers and illustrators, benefited from an explosion in digital content creation that came with the advent of smartphones and the cloud. The cloud also opened the way for “measurement and monetisation”, said Mr Narayen — giving marketers tools to analyse how people were interacting with their content, as well as ways to cash in on it.Companies of all types are still at an early stage of reshaping their operations around this new fount of customer data, added Mr Benioff. “We’re just still at the beginning of the digital transformation of so many companies,” he said.Making their software applications available over the cloud has also made it possible to reach many more users. “We used to serve the top of the pyramid, people [in creative jobs] viewed us just as people in finance view the Bloomberg terminal,” said Mr Narayen. Low-cost versions have expanded the market, particularly in the developing world, he added. The huge shift in stock market value to companies that have risen with the cloud also speaks volumes about the struggles of the old guard to latch on to the cloud revolution. Shares in SAP dropped 6 per cent last week after it reported a fall-off in new cloud business, with a deceleration in bookings to 17 per cent in the most recent quarter, from 34 per cent in the preceding three months.SAP has placed some big bets on the cloud, including two $8bn acquisitions in recent years — of Concur, whose software is used to manage travel expenses, and Qualtrics, which runs online surveys. But SAP’s main growth has come from re-engineering its original back-office applications to process and analyse large volumes of data more rapidly. What cloud growth it had managed had come from “add-on services and applications” rather than its core business, said Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management.Shares in the German software maker have at least fared better than Oracle, whose stock has underperformed the wider US stock market by 60 per cent over the past five years. But SAP and Oracle have been held back by their focus on back-office systems, said Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies — a result of their rise at a time when enterprise resource planning, or ERP, was the driving force in business automation. “Neither has figured out the front office,” Mr Thill said.“It takes years to implement an ERP system, and once it’s implemented you want to run it for years” rather than replace it with cloud software, said Mr Walkush at Jensen, an Oracle investor. In addition, he said, companies using cloud services had become less concerned about the underlying technology they ran on — eroding the loyalty towards Oracle’s database software, which has been a core part of the IT foundation for many corporate applications.In its fiscal year ending in May, Oracle is expected to generate revenue of about $40bn — only 8 per cent more than it did eight years before. The company stopped disclosing its cloud revenue separately in 2018, adding to worries on Wall Street about the slow pace of the transition.The huge valuation swing to fast-growing cloud software companies, meanwhile, has left them more vulnerable to any shift in stock market sentiment or economic outlook. For companies such as Salesforce and Adobe, investor attention has also started to focus on profit margins as well as growth, as they digest recent acquisitions and their sales growth moderates.Shares in Oracle, on the other hand, are trading at only 13 times expected earnings in its current fiscal year. But with little sign of growth returning, there have been few takers.
1;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2019-10-28T16:43:44Z;US to allow Adobe to do business in Venezuela;Maker of Photoshop and Reader software had closed accounts to comply with US sanctions;Software company Adobe has been granted a licence by the US government to continuing working in Venezuela, allowing it to reverse a controversial decision taken earlier this month to shut down all its accounts in the South American country.“After discussions with the US government, we’ve been granted a licence to provide all of our Digital Media products and services in Venezuela,” Adobe said in a statement on Monday. “Users can continue to access the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud portfolio, and all of their content, as they did before. If you lost access to premium services, they will be restored within a week.”On October 7, the California-based company had said it was withdrawing from Venezuela to comply with US sanctions in light of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that bans virtually all trade with the country.The move left thousands of users without access to popular Photoshop and Acrobat Reader software. It also prompted accusations that the firm was being heavy-handed and was hitting ordinary Venezuelans rather than the government of Nicolás Maduro.New York-based Human Rights Watch described the decision as “a total disaster” while Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy organisation, said it was “incredibly counterproductive” and would hit Venezuelan civil society groups and independent media outlets.The government decision to grant Adobe an exemption suggests Washington is taking a pragmatic case-by-case approach to sanctions designed to squeeze the Maduro government.Last week, it issued a waiver allowing Chevron and four US oil service providers to continue working in Venezuela for a further three months while also ringfencing Citgo, the foreign crown jewel of Venezuela’s oil industry, to stop it from being seized by creditors.That latter decision was taken to support Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who has been trying to keep Citgo in Venezuelan hands so that it can be used to reconstruct the country in the event that Mr Maduro is removed from power.The US government and, to a lesser extent, the EU have imposed increasingly tough sanctions on Caracas over the past two years in a bid to force Mr Maduro to quit.Although Venezuela’s economic woes predate the measures, they have exacerbated the situation on the ground. Despite the sanctions, Mr Maduro has refused to quit and still enjoys financial support from Russia and China.
2;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2019-10-08T00:26:58Z;Adobe shuts accounts in Venezuela to comply with US sanctions;Move by software group criticised by users who complain of heavy-handedness;Software company Adobe is shutting all its accounts in Venezuela to comply with US sanctions, leaving thousands of users without access to Photoshop and Acrobat Reader, and prompting accusations that it is being heavy-handed and hitting ordinary people rather than the government of Nicolás Maduro.The California-based company said it had taken the decision in light of the executive order issued by President Donald Trump in early August that bans virtually all trade with the country.“Due to the recent presidential executive order . . . Adobe is no longer permitted to provide you with access to software and services or enable you to make any new purchases,” it said in a letter sent to Venezuelan customers.“We regret any inconvenience this may cause you.”Adobe said that for now it could only refund Venezuelans for their purchases if they had bought software directly from the company*. It said Venezuelan users had until October 28 to download data stored on Adobe software. After that, all Venezuelan accounts would be deactivated.The decision prompted a storm of protest on social media.“A total disaster!” wrote José Miguel Vivanco, director of New York-based Human Rights Watch. “It should be explained to Trump that the idea is to strengthen and not weaken a civil society that is fighting tooth and nail against the Maduro dictatorship.”Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, described the move as “incredibly counterproductive”, tweeting: “Any civil society NGO or independent media outlet that relies on registered copies of Photoshop, InDesign or Acrobat will be impacted.”Even Venezuelans living outside the country said they had been notified by Adobe that their accounts would be closed because they were originally registered in Venezuela.“@Adobe is now closing accounts to Venezuelan citizens indiscriminately?” one twitter user asked. “I’m not associated with the Venezuelan Government and I’m not even living in Venezuela.”“This interpretation of the sanctions is absurd and unfair to the few honest businesses still surviving in Venezuela,” another user tweeted. “Without [the] private sector there cannot be an eventual recovery.”Sign up here to the new podcast from Gideon Rachman, the Financial Times’ chief foreign affairs columnist, and listen in on his conversations with the decision makers and thinkers from all over the globe who are shaping world affairsSome Twitter users reported that TransferWise, a UK-based online money transfer service, had taken similar action, sending letters to its customers in Venezuela on Monday telling them they would not be able to use the service after October 21.Many Venezuelans rely on wire transfers from friends and family living abroad to help them survive their country’s crippling economic collapse.The US government and, to a lesser extent, the EU, have imposed increasingly tough sanctions on Caracas over the past two years in a bid to force Mr Maduro from power. Although Venezuela’s economic woes predate the measures, they have exacerbated the situation on the ground.Despite the sanctions, Mr Maduro has refused to quit and still enjoys financial support from Russia and China.*After initially saying that Venezuelans could not receive refunds, Adobe has since updated its policy to allow Venezuelans to receive refunds if they had purchased the software directly from the company.
3;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2019-06-18T22:13:39Z;Adobe reports upbeat quarterly revenues but delivers soft outlook;;Adobe on Tuesday reported upbeat quarterly results driven by strength in its digital media unit, which includes its creative cloud and photo shop products, but delivered a soft outlook for the current quarter.The California-based company said revenues rose 25 per cent year-on-year to a record $2.74bn, ahead of analysts’ expectations for $2.7bn, according to Refinitiv.Within that, revenues in its largest division, digital media, which includes its creative cloud tools and photoediting app Photoshop, rose 22 per cent from a year ago to $1.89bn. Its so-called digital experience division, which includes advertising and marketing tools, reported a 34 per cent year-on-year increase in revenues to $783.5m, aided by recent acquisitions.Net income slid to $632.6m, or $1.29 a share, in the three months to the end of May, down from $663.2m, or $1.33 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items the company reported earnings of $1.83 a share, ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts of $1.78 a share.“Adobe’s continued momentum is being fuelled by the explosion of creativity across the globe and the widespread business transformation agenda to deliver engaging customer experiences,” said Shantanu Narayen, Adobe chief executive.Adobe has successfully pivoted its enterprise software products to the cloud-based subscription model. Last year it agreed to buy Magento, a provider of ecommerce services for $1.7bn and also snapped up marketing software group Marketo for about $4.75bn — helping it rejuvenate its software offering and deepen its move to the cloud and subscriptions-based services. The acquisition of Marketo in particular was expected to help it better compete with rivals such as Oracle and Salesforce.Adobe’s guidance took some of the sheen off its results. Its outlook for adjusted earnings of $1.95 a share, on revenue of $2.8bn in the current quarter, was just shy of analysts’ estimates for adjusted earnings of $2.05 a share, on revenues of $2.83bn.Adobe shares, which are up 22 per cent year-to-date, rose 3 per cent to $284.75 in after-hours trade.
4;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T17:34:00+0000;Cyber Monday pulls in record $7.9bn in online sales;Record revenues are a 19 per cent increase on last year’s totals;Cyber Monday pulled in a record $7.9bn in online sales this year, as Americans opened up their wallets to snap up deals on everything from toys to TVs and laptops.The figure represents a 19.3 per cent increase from the year-ago period, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks sales data from 80 of the top 100 internet retailers in the US, and underscores the resilience of consumer spending in the world’s most important economy.While Americans are doing less of their shopping in-store, online sales are booming. Online spending on Black Friday leapt 24 per cent from a year ago to $6.22bn, according to Adobe. For Cyber Monday, over a quarter — or $2.2bn — of the purchases were made on mobile phones this year.“Converting mobile traffic to sales has long been a thorn in the side of retailers, but investments in making the experience faster and easier have paid off,” said Taylor Schreiner, director at Adobe Digital Insights.Although Amazon remains dominant online, nearly all big retailers have been boosted by the online spending surge, according to separate research by Edison Trends.That in turn has helped retail stocks regain some of their footing. The sector was hit by a wave of selling at the beginning of last week amid disappointing earnings and outlooks from some of the industry’s biggest names. But many of these companies have recovered somewhat since Thanksgiving Day. Macy’s is up nearly 2 per cent, Best Buy has gained more than 4 per cent and Gap has climbed more than 2 per cent since Friday.
5;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Adobe to buy marketing software group Marketo for $4.75bn;;Adobe has agreed to buy marketing software group Marketo for about $4.75bn, generating a huge payout for Vista Equity Partners, the private owner of the tech company.“Adobe and Marketo both share an unwavering belief in the power of content and data to drive business results,” said Steve Lucas, Marketo chief executive, in Thursday’s announcement. “Marketo delivers the leading B2B marketing engagement platform for the modern marketer, and there is no better home for Marketo to continue to rapidly innovate than Adobe.”For Vista, the successful transaction is a boon, having acquired Marketo for $1.8bn just two years ago.The Texas-based fund started by Robert Smith has made a splash in recent years through a series of eye-catching deals targeting software companies with higher growth but lower profits.Private equity firms tend to stay away from companies with high growth and low profits as they prefer to invest in cash flow-strong targets that allow them to raise sufficient debt to justify their investment models.Mr Smith, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has built a strong record of buying, improving and selling software companies at large premium in recent years.For Adobe the acquisition of Marketo will further help the large tech company to rejuvenate its software offering and deepen its move to the cloud and subscriptions-based services.“The imperative for marketers across all industries is a laser focus on providing relevant, personalised and engaging experiences,” said Brad Rencher, executive vice-president and general manager of digital experience at Adobe. “The acquisition of Marketo widens Adobe’s lead in customer experience across B2C and B2B and puts Adobe Experience Cloud at the heart of all marketing.”The two companies already compete for customers, but Adobe’s automation capabilities do not match Marketo’s. The acquisition would improve its chances of standing up to rivals such as Oracle and Salesforce.Adobe shares, which are up more than 50 per cent year-to-date, were up 0.5 per cent to $266.11 on Thursday.News of an imminent deal was first reported earlier on Thursday by CNBC, while talks about a potential deal were reported earlier this month by Reuters.The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of Adobe’s fiscal 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.
6;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Adobe: picture this;Software group’s move for Marketo seems reasonable enough;Adobe Systems has enhanced its image as slickly as if it had used its Photoshop editing software. The switch from ageing tech group to sprightly software leader via smart purchases, a move to the cloud and a subscriptions-based service has been rewarded.The shares are up 465 per cent in the past five years. This seems like a good time to make a big acquisition.Adobe is reportedly interested in Marketo, a privately held company that makes cloud-based marketing software. Reasonable enough.The two companies already compete for customers but Adobe’s automation capabilities do not match Marketo’s. The acquisition would improve its chances of standing up to rivals such as Oracle and Salesforce.Adobe’s digital experience division, including marketing, is growing better than expected — up 18 per cent in the last quarter to $586m. The more products it can offer, the better chance it has to sign up larger companies.Buying Marketo from its private equity owner could require a stiff premium. In May, Adobe bought Magento, an ecommerce platform, from Permira for $1.7bn — 11 times more than the private equity firm paid three years earlier. Vista Equity Partners bought Marketo in 2016 for $1.8bn. Adobe has $3bn in cash on its balance sheet waiting to be spent.The switch from peddling licences to selling subscriptions is tricky. A drip feed of recurring revenue compares unfavourably with lump sum sales at first. Adobe has passed that point.Revenue reached a quarterly record of $2.2bn in the three months ending on June 1 — up more than 24 per cent year on year. Competitors have failed to beat Adobe’s applications.Adobe’s rapid stock price rise means that it trades at a high 37 times forecast earnings. But profit margins exceed those of Salesforce and Oracle.Acquisitions should support further growth. There is no reason to expect that its winning streak will be broken in the next few quarters.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

7;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2018-06-29T21:53:29Z;Wounded unicorn Domo limps on to the stock market;Software company goes public with valuation nearly 85 per cent below prior year;The parade of successful software companies making their way to Wall Street was interrupted on Friday by the arrival of a less familiar beast: a seriously wounded unicorn, limping on to the stock market with a valuation nearly 85 per cent below where it stood a year ago.The initial public offering of Domo, a data analytics company that was once one of the big hopes of Utah’s budding tech scene, was a reminder of the severe deflation suffered by some highly valued private tech companies. Known as unicorns, the companies have been able to delay a move to Wall Street far longer than earlier generations of start-ups, thanks to a wave of private capital.Domo’s investor list boasts some of the tech world’s most savvy names, including venture capital firms Benchmark and Institutional Venture Partners, as well as BlackRock. They were attracted largely by the pedigree of the company’s founder. Joshua James, 45, once helped start another software company, Omniture, which went on to be sold to Adobe for $1.8bn.Mr James was credited by one early Domo investor with being one of the software industry’s best salespeople — but the company’s product did not live up to the billing, this person said.Domo was valued at about $2.1bn in April last year, when it raised its final round of private capital. By contrast, its IPO on Nasdaq valued it at $331m, before including the $193m it raised by selling new shares to the public this week.Investors who have suffered most from the contraction include BlackRock and GGV Capital, who paid $126.47 a share in sales that continued until June last year — a long way from the $21 that Domo priced its shares in its IPO this week.The collapse in valuation reflects a pending cash shortfall that has forced Domo’s investors to turn to Wall Street for an infusion of money. Domo had $71m in the bank at the end of April and had drawn down everything that was available under its credit facility. It has burnt through an average of $46m a quarter in negative operating cash flow since the beginning of last year, and warned that without a fresh injection of capital it would have started to “significantly reduce operating expenses” in August.Founded in 2010, Domo is already long in the tooth by the standards of software start-ups. It did not launch its platform until 2015, and has struggled to attract enough business despite heavy spending. Its sales and marketing costs were equivalent to 124 per cent of revenues in the latest quarter. Despite that, its growth rate slowed to 32 per cent, from 46 per cent for all of last year.Domo has also attracted attention for its spending with businesses linked to its founder. This has included $300,000 a year paid to Cubby’s Chicago Beef, a company jointly owned by Mr James and his brother Cubby, and $200,000 spent on furnishings from a company in which another James brother is chief executive.Domo’s bumpy ride to Wall Street was at least rewarded with a benign first day of trading on Friday. Its shares rose 30 per cent to $27.30.
8;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
9;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Adobe reports record revenue in Q2;;Adobe Systems sailed past earnings expectations and reported record revenue in its second quarter, with particularly quick sales growth in its cloud business.The company behind Photoshop software reported a 24 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue to a quarterly record of $2.2bn in the three months ended June 1, which topped its own forecast of $2.15bn. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected $2.16bn.Although not the lion’s share of revenue, its Document Cloud division reported year-on-year growth of 22 per cent to $243m.Net income came in at $663.2m, up 77 per cent from a year ago, while diluted earnings per share jumped to $1.33 from 75 cents. Analysts expected $602.1m, or $1.20 a diluted share.In January, Adobe guided towards full-year revenue of $8.725bn and adjusted EPS of $5.50. Analysts are a bit more optimistic and tip sales of $8.8bn and adjusted EPS of $6.46 a share.The company said it expected revenue in the third quarter of $2.24bn, not much higher than analysts’ median forecast of $2.23bn.Adobe shares were up 47.3 per cent so far this year at the closing bell on Thursday, but dropped 2.36 per cent to $252.00 in after-hours trade. The company’s share price has also been supported in recent weeks by the decision to buy back $8bn of common stock through to its 2021 fiscal year.

Adobe announced it had also authorised a new $8bn share buyback programme on Monday.
11;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Adobe shares jump after hours on earnings beat;;Adobe shares jumped in after-hours trading after the company reported a strong start to the 2018 fiscal year, with strong revenue growth across regions and its suite of products that topped Wall Street forecasts.The company behind Photoshop software reported a 24 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue to a quarterly record of $2.08bn in the three months ended March 2, which was ahead of its own forecasts in December for $2.04bn. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters also had their expectations in line with the company’s.Adjusted net income came in at $772m, up 23 per cent from a year ago, while adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.55.Following US tax reform, Adobe updated the market in January that it expected adjusted EPS in the first quarter of $1.43 from a December forecast of $1.27 per share.Mark Garrett, Adobe’s chief financial officer, said the company was targeting revenue in the second quarter of $2.15bn, with revenue and earnings in Q3 and Q4 “to follow similar seasonality as was achieved in FY17.”In January, Adobe guided towards full-year revenue of $8.725bn and adjusted EPS of $5.50.Shares were up 3 per cent in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq.
12;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2018-01-22T22:24:20Z;Adobe market cap tops $100bn on Trump tax cut boost;Becomes fourth software company to exceed the milestone;Adobe has become only the fourth software company in history to see its stock market value top $100bn, after it disclosed the expected effects of the Trump tax cuts on its future earnings.The US company, best known for its Creative Suite of software tools for designers, said the new tax rules would lift its pro forma earnings per share by around 13 per cent in the current fiscal year, which ends in November. It also said that, from next year onwards, its effective tax rate would “stabilise” at around 18 per cent, compared to the 21 per cent it rate it recorded for 2017, before the legislation.The news pushed Adobe’s shares up by 3.5 per cent in after-market trading, lifting its value to $101bn — a level only Microsoft, Oracle and SAP have reached before. The gain caps a five-year run that saw seen its stock jump fourfold, more four times the broad stock market.Like other tech companies, Adobe will have to pay a one-off tax charge on its accumulated foreign earnings — though unlike most, had already been providing against potential taxes, which previously would only have been due it if had repatriated the money. The net effect will be an accounting charge of $85m in the current quarter, the company said.By unlocking their overseas cash holdings, the new tax legislation has raised expectations that the tech companies will reinvest heavily at home. Some have been happy to reinforce that view, while stopping short of promising any extra investment commitments above what they had already been planning. They include Apple, which last week boasted of plans to spend $350bn in the US over the next five years.“With ready access to our offshore cash, we will continue to evaluate investment opportunities to grow our business and we are actively expanding our campuses in the Bay Area and Utah to accommodate the growth of our employee base,” said Mark Garrett, Adobe’s chief financial officer.

That topped Wall Street estimates of $1.95bn.Net income rose to $501.5m in the quarter, compared with $399.6m in the year-ago period. Earnings per share rose to $1.00, up from 80 cents a share in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.26 a share also topped analysts’ estimates of $1.16.The legacy software company has worked to transition away from one-time software license purchases to a cloud-based subscription model in which customers pay a recurring fee.Still, its fiery pace of growth is cooling. While Adobe’s revenues increased 25 per cent year-on-year in fiscal 2017, that is expected to cool to 19.5 per cent next year.Looking ahead, the company is targeting fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $5.50 a share, on revenue of $8.725bn. That compared with analysts’ estimates for earnings of $5.52 a share, on sales of $8.729bn, according to a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts.For the current quarter, the company expects adjusted earnings of $1.27 a share, ahead of Wall Street projections for $1.24 a share, on revenues of $2.04bn, in line with forecasts.Adobe shares are up 70 per cent so far this year.
14;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2017-10-26T17:57:34Z;Gorillas in the mist await cloud players old and new;Traditional IT companies are struggling not to be picked off as laggards in new world;Sometimes, in the midst of a technology shift that takes years to play out, you have to stop the clock to see what is happening.Relative value has been seeping away from old-line IT companies as the cloud becomes a significant locus for computing. It is not a binary choice for tech buyers, who are facing massive sunk cost in their existing systems — as this week’s alliance of convenience between Google and Cisco Systems shows. But there is no disguising the direction of travel.Between them, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc, Cisco and VMware are now worth about $420bn — only 15 per cent more than this same group (before the HP break-up) was worth a decade ago.These companies, taken together, represent a large chunk of what, not so long ago, was thought of as the IT sector. The cloud has changed all that. To put it in perspective: their entire market capitalisation is equivalent to the extra value added over the past decade by Amazon, the leading cloud player.True, Amazon’s business still revolves mostly around ecommerce and logistics. But the solid profit margins of its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, are supporting the entire enterprise. The sheer scale of the addressable market — global IT spending should hit $3.5tn this year, according to Gartner — supports the analysts who argue that this will eventually become Amazon’s main business. That puts into perspective the messy transitional period the IT world is now in — and will continue to struggle through for a long time to come.When traditional IT companies first coined the term “hybrid cloud” — meaning the mixture of computing on their own premises and cloud-based services that is now the reality of life for most big consumers of IT — they were sounding a plea for continued relevance. But the pure cloud players are now making the same case, and building the relationships needed to work in this world. Amazon struck a deal with VMware last year, and now Google has allied itself with Cisco.The truth is, despite the tectonic shifts that seem to upend established tech companies with regularity, IT is a business with very long residuals. The heyday of the mainframe computer ended many years ago, but IBM is still reckoned to derive nearly half its profits from selling the machines, along with related software and services.However, that should not distract from where value — both in business and stock market terms — is shifting. The cloud is no longer just about buying extra storage capacity or processing capacity. Many of the most advanced development environments and higher level services for application developers are now being supplied from the cloud.With the partnership announced this week, Google will be creating many of those tools for Cisco’s customers. And machine learning is the not-so-secret weapon that will do much to drive the next round of cloud development: the chance for outside companies to plug into the artificial intelligence developed for the search giant’s own services could be a big draw in future.Some IT companies, at least in the stock market’s eyes, have already come through the Valley of Death represented by this transition. Microsoft has added $350bn in market value in the past 10 years. Oracle, after leading a wave of consolidation among traditional software companies, is finally getting a cloud lift that has added $120bn in market cap.The market value comparisons are pertinent. The IT sector has always gone through cycles, as periods of innovation give way to scrambles for consolidation. The winners are the ones best positioned when consolidation hits.After an incredible run as two of the winners from cloud-based software applications, Adobe and Salesforce are worth $85bn and $72bn respectively. That might make them look like survivors of the cloud transition. But it is all relative.When Microsoft toyed with buying Salesforce three years ago, for a reputed $60bn, it would have represented about 17 per cent of the larger company’s then-stock market value. Now that Microsoft has a much higher market cap, paying perhaps $80bn now would only represent 13 per cent of its present worth.The cloud is big enough to contain a multitude of software, services and infrastructure companies and more will emerge as it expands further. But there are already gorillas in the mist and — from the traditional IT players to the pure-play cloud services — no one can feel safe.richard.waters@ft.com

17;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2017-07-25T20:20:31Z;Adobe’s Flash to be phased out in 2020;Light dims on software berated by Apple’s Steve Jobs as having ‘major drawbacks’;Seven years after Steve Jobs publicly berated the widely used Flash internet media software, the late Apple co-founder is getting his way.The software — long a necessity of online life, though known to many internet users only from the moments when they can’t play a video because they don’t have it installed — will be phased out in 2020.News of Flash’s demise came the day after it emerged that Microsoft was cutting Paint, a tool that turns anyone into an amateur digital artist, from its Windows operating system. The tide of nostalgia and reproach that followed on social media prompted the software company to promise on Monday night that a Paint app would instead be available free of charge in its online Windows store.Flash was launched in the mid-1990s, a decade after Paint, to make it possible for video and other interactive content to be played on any browser. The software became a standard among developers, making it a key ingredient in pushing the internet into the mainstream. But Jobs accused the software of what he called “major technical drawbacks” and refused to allow it on to Apple’s iPhone and iPad.Apple’s decision contributed to making the mobile development world into rival technology platforms and ended any hopes of Adobe, the software company behind Flash, of making its software the standard way of viewing video on smartphones and tablets.“Jobs was right — but he was also motivated by trying to build a rival standard,” said Jeffrey Hammond, an analyst at Forrester Research.Flash has also been overtaken by the development of improved open standards — promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium — that take on many of the functions it was once needed for. Announcing its decision on Tuesday, Adobe said it was the adoption of these standards that had spelt the end for Flash.The Adobe software had already been in sharp decline in recent years as advertisers moved on and video services such as YouTube dropped the format. Three years ago, about 80 per cent of people who used desktop computers with Google’s Chrome browser encountered multimedia content in Flash at least once a day, according to the search company. That proportion has fallen to only 17 per cent.Jobs was right [to refuse to allow Flash on to Apple’s iPhone] — but he was also motivated by trying to build a rival standard“A large number of the top games that are being built across platforms like Facebook are using Flash,” said Govind Balakrishnan, a vice-president at Adobe. Adobe is now part of an industry-wide effort to wean the remaining developers off the software.Some companies have also written internal applications that depend on the software, said Mr Hammond, forcing them to rewrite their software before the “end of life” for Flash takes effect. Banks have been some of the biggest users of the technology for internal applications, with Bank of America and JPMorgan among those affected, added Mr Balakrishnan.In a blog post attacking Flash in 2010, Jobs complained about what he said were the software’s poor security, lack of reliability, and power-hogging tendencies. “We have routinely asked Adobe to show us Flash performing well on a mobile device, any mobile device, for a few years now. We have never seen it,” he said.Adobe gave up trying to push Flash into the smartphone world soon after Jobs’ attack. It refused to comment on the criticisms on Tuesday.
18;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Adobe sales jump 27% as cloud software push accelerates;;Adobe on Tuesday added to its already hefty 2017 gains after the software maker unveiled a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly sales that reflected continued progress on growing revenues from its cloud-based software suite.The California-based company behind products like Photoshop said its sales in the quarter ending June 2 climbed 26.7 per cent year-over-year to a record $1.77bn, beating Wall Street forecasts of $1.73bn.Annualised recurring revenue from its digital media division, an important metric that gauges adoption and retention of Adobe’s cloud-based software, came in at $4.56bn, a touch higher than the $4.54bn that analysts were expecting and up $312m from the previous quarter.“We’re excited about the strong business momentum we have as we enter the second half of fiscal 2017 and remain confident in our ability to drive strong revenue and earnings growth in the future,” said Mark Garrett, Adobe’s chief financial officer.Net profits climbed to $374.4m from $244.1m from the same time in 2016. On an adjusted basis excluding certain items, earnings per share of $1.02 came in ahead of expectations of 95 cents.The upbeat results sent Adobe shares rallying 4.4 per cent in extended trading. That would add to gains of 36.9 per cent for the year, as of the close of trade on Tuesday.Adobe has been working to shift customers away from software purchased a single time and installed on individual machines towards recurring subscriptions billed at regular intervals.
19;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Adobe: pretty flash;The transition from packaged software to the cloud can be done in public;In an alternative reality, Adobe sold itself to private equity in 2011, when it was valued at $10bn. That has become the fashionable trade for software companies. Rather than endure in public the bumpy transition from selling packaged software to cloud subscriptions, go private where the (hopefully) temporary damage to revenues can be weathered quietly.Instead, Adobe stuck it out, came through the dip, and on Thursday reported record quarterly revenues of $1.7bn. Whether they like it or not, Adobe’s customers for products such as Photoshop have felt obliged to keep paying the subscription fee. Competitors have been inept at displacing Adobe’s suite of creative applications. Adobe exerted its monopoly power.Today it is one of only 40 public companies in the world that are worth more than $20bn, increasing revenues faster than 20 per cent a year and with an operating margin of more than 20 per cent. Among big US tech companies, only Facebook is growing faster with fatter margins. After its shares rose 3 per cent following the results — capping a fivefold increase since that 2011 nadir — Adobe has an enterprise value of $60bn.Having stayed public, Adobe finds itself able to outmuscle private equity competition for software assets when it wants to. That was the case in November when it paid $540m for TubeMogul, a video advertising company, which was last year’s priciest tech deal, according to bankers. To outbid financial sponsors, Adobe paid a 92 per cent premium.It is not fun completing the cloud transition but Adobe is proof that it can be done in the public eye. ValueAct, a hedge fund on the gentle end of the activist spectrum, did buy in 2011 but rather than urge a sale of the apparently flatlining company, it sat back and enjoyed most of the surge, although it sold a year ago, missing out on the 40 per cent rally since then. Public markets should be able to tolerate a few stagnant quarters for growth like this.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
20;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Adobe Systems shares pop on upbeat outlook, earnings beat;;No touch-up needed here.Shares in Adobe Systems advanced in extended trading on Thursday after the software company, known for its flashplayer and image editor Photoshop, issued an upbeat sales outlook and posted better-than-expected first quarter results.Adobe shares advanced 4 per cent in after-hours trade after the company said it is targeting revenue of about $1.73bn in the current quarter on adjusted earnings of 94 cents a share. That was ahead of consensus Wall Street estimates of $1.71bn and 90 cents.That accompanied fiscal first quarter results that topped expectations. Profits rose to $398.4m, or 80 cents a share, in the three months ended March 3, compared with $254.3m, or 50 cents a share, in the year ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 94 cents eclipsed the 87 cents that analysts on Wall Street were looking for.Revenues climbed nearly 22 per cent to a record $1.68bn, above forecasts of $1.65bn.Adobe has been moving away from a traditional software licensing model to a cloud-based subscription model. Its shares have climbed nearly 19 per cent so far this year following a 9.6 per cent advance last year.
21;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2017-03-16T18:08:31Z;Intel and Oracle sense the road ahead in tech;Latest acquisitions show old tech titans are searching for success in new directions;How many of tech’s old guard will make it into the new world? This week Intel and Oracle made their attempts for long-term relevance (the term that tech companies strive for above all else). Intel’s PC and server chips, and Oracle’s database software, will churn out cash for years to come. But the future of tech has always been defined by architectural shifts in computing — things that go under vague terms like the cloud, the internet of things and (most recently) artificial intelligence — that bring new companies to the fore.To judge by their share prices, it looks like the writing has been on the wall. Intel’s stock has missed a powerful chip sector rally, while Oracle’s shares had gone nowhere in the past three years, until a rally this quarter. The leaking of relative stock market value to a new generation is a clear sign that investors are looking elsewhere for the companies that will define the next era of computing.Yet even though tech disruption sometimes seems to happen with lightning speed, shifts in computing architecture play out in slow motion. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chairman, has been talking about a coming shift of computing into the network for two decades. He may have ceded an early lead in cloud computing to Salesforce.com (started by a former Oracle protégé, Marc Benioff), but with the vast bulk of corporate IT budgets still tied to legacy technology, the battle has barely begun.It is tempting to see the sky-high price Intel paid this week for self-driving technology group Mobileye as the sort of desperate roll of the dice that companies make when they fear being left behind. After missing the smartphone boom, Intel clearly needs to stake out a place in the next big tech markets. The tech landscape for self-driving cars is quickly taking shape: Nvidia has been forging alliances to cement its processors as the most powerful “brains” for autonomous vehicles, while Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP and SoftBank’s purchase of ARM have positioned them to take a bigger slice of what is expected to be a rapidly expanding market for silicon in cars.It sounds extravagant for Intel to pay nearly 40 times revenue for Mobile, which provides just one component for the driverless cars of the future: the imaging technology that helps cars “see” their surroundings. But the company could turn out to be a key piece of the jigsaw for Intel, if it opens new supplier relationships in the automobile world, and if the Israeli company can turn its large market share in image-sensing into a fuller set of technologies for driverless vehicles.The real test will not be about technology nor strategy, but whether Intel can develop the skills and forge the alliances needed to compete in this new market. Carmakers are not like the computer manufacturers Intel has dealt with before, and the manufacturing prowess that has been one of its main competitive strengths will only take it so far in a market where success requires more than building faster processors.Oracle made what looked like a desperate gamble of its own recently with the $9bn purchase of NetSuite, a deal that appeared to be driven more by an urge to bulk up Oracle’s cloud revenues than a strong industrial logic.Delivering software and computer platforms as a service in the cloud requires a new approach, as well as a new business model. It takes time to prove that a company built around one way of selling technology can adapt its culture and processes — or that the new business will achieve the kind of scale and profit margin profile needed to sustain Oracle’s stock market valuation. An 8 per cent bounce in Oracle’s shares on Thursday after its latest earnings — taking this year’s rally to 21 per cent — is a sign that investors think it may finally have reached an inflection point.To Oracle’s advantage, there have been other examples of software companies making this switch. Adobe and, more recently, Microsoft have been through similar tortuous transitions and have emerged on the other side with a re-rating of their shares. Turning a supertanker still takes time, but a belief that the ship will actually respond can take hold remarkably quickly. Companies such as Intel and Oracle have been late to stake a more aggressive claim to a larger part of the new computing landscape. But there is still much to play for. The test for companies like these is unchanged: can they channel their formidable resources into competing against a different set of rivals — and how long will their shareholders stay patient?richard.waters@ft.com
22;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2016-11-02T00:10:51Z;Microsoft hits out at Google for revealing flaw exploited by hackers;Software company unable to provide a fix to vulnerability for another week;Microsoft on Tuesday warned that a group of hackers linked to attacks on the Democratic National Committee had exploited a vulnerability in all Windows PCs that it would not be able to fully mend for another week.The flaw was disclosed publicly on Monday by Google, provoking a sharp rebuke from Microsoft about the dangers of revealing flaws such as this before fixes are available.Microsoft said the software flaw had been used by a group it calls Strontium, and which is known more widely as Fancy Bear. The group, which has been operating for nearly a decade, has been linked by security researchers to the Russian military and has been tied to a number of attacks on government, military and corporate systems. These include an assault on the DNC this year that is believed to have led to subsequent email leaks that have embarrassed the Democratic party in the run-up to the presidential election.The flaw was uncovered by two security researchers at Google and notified to Microsoft on October 21. On Monday, when the software company had still not released a “patch” to repair its Windows operating system from attack, Google publicly announced the vulnerability.Terry Myerson, head of the Windows business, hit out at Google on Tuesday, suggesting the internet company had not shown “responsible technology industry participation”. Disclosing a so-called “zero-day” exploit before it has been repaired alerts other hackers to the flaw and can lead to more attacks on Windows PCs.“Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” Mr Myerson wrote in a blog post.Google defended its actions on Monday, saying it always published details of “critical vulnerabilities” seven days after it warns other software companies about them so that computer users will be aware of the danger.It said it had also warned Adobe about a flaw in its own Flash software which, used together with the Windows vulnerability, had enabled hackers to exploit machines. Adobe released a patch for its own product last Wednesday, less than a week after being warned about it.The hacking group identified by Microsoft as having exploited the flaw is known for using spear phishing, or highly targeted emails, to trick users into inadvertently downloading software that then attacks their machines.In this case, Microsoft said, the code planted by the hackers first exploited Adobe’s Flash to take control of a user’s browser, then elevated its own privileges in the software so that it could escape the limitations normally put on web programs. From there, the hackers were able to install a backdoor giving them access to the machines that had been infected.Anyone using Microsoft’s new Edge browser, which is included in Windows 10, should be protected, the company said. But other versions of Windows will be exposed until at least November 8, the date when Microsoft said it planned to release a patch to solve the problem.
23;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2016-09-21T20:53:18Z;Adobe jumps on rapid cloud division growth;US stocks advance after Fed keeps rates unchanged but sends signal of move later in the year;Adobe shares climbed on Wednesday after the software company revealed stronger than expected quarterly results and rapid growth in its cloud division.The California-based company said subscription revenues climbed 41 per cent in the quarter to September 2 from the same period in 2015, offsetting a continuing decline in traditional product sales.Revenues in the digital media division, which includes the Creative Cloud offering that is popular with photographers and graphic artists, jumped 28.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the financial third quarter to $990m, while sales of its cloud-based marketing suite climbed 9.7 per cent.Total sales rose by a fifth to $1.46bn, narrowly topping Wall Street estimates.The strong performance in Adobe’s cloud division sparked optimism among some analysts that Adobe’s transition to a subscription model, where customers pay an ongoing fee rather than purchasing software on a one-time basis, is continuing apace.The results were “strong with upper echelon software industry growth rates showing across many metrics, which is impressive given Adobe’s size”, said Brian Schwartz, an analyst at Oppenheimer.Net income in the financial third quarter rose to $270.8m, from $174.5m in the same period in 2015.On an adjusted basis, which excludes certain items, earnings per share clocked in at 75 cents, topping analyst expectations by three cents.In the current quarter, Adobe said it expected adjusted EPS of 83-89 cents compared with Wall Street forecasts of 78 cents.Adobe shares rallied 7.1 per cent to $107.78, extending the year-to-date rise to 14.7 per cent.Elsewhere, the US energy sector zipped higher as the price of oil rose on the back of a bullish report on American crude stocks.West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, rose 2.9 per cent to $45.34 a barrel, while international standard Brent advanced 2.1 per cent to $46.83.Among the leaders was EOG Resources, a large exploration and production group, which jumped 3.5 per cent to $93.52.The shares of FedEx, the package delivery group, climbed 6.9 per cent to $173.86 after it revealed stronger than expected quarterly results and lifted its profit outlook.FedEx unveiled earnings in the quarter to the end of August of $715m, from $692m in the same three-month period the year before.Adjusted earnings in the fiscal first quarter were $2.90 a share, compared with estimates of $2.80. Revenues jumped 19.5 per cent to $14.7bn, also beating estimates of $14.6bn.The Memphis-based group said it expected profits, excluding certain items, in the current financial year to come in at $11.85-$12.35 a share, up from a previous outlook of $11.75-$12.25.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had risen 1.1 per cent to 2,163.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9 per cent to 18,293.7, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1 per cent to 5,295.2.The upbeat sentiment on Wall Street early in the day came after the Bank of Japan unveiled plans to strengthen its monetary stimulus by saying it will aim to overshoot its inflation target of 2 per cent and cap the country’s 10-year bond yield at zero per cent. Stocks climbed further after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged, but indicated that the case for a rate increase had “strengthened”.

This week, the companies behind 1,200 of the US’s biggest newspapers, including the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, challenged Brave with a cease and desist letter in which they called its model “blatantly illegal”.“Your plan to use our content to sell your advertising is indistinguishable from a plan to steal our content to publish on your own website,” they wrote.Brave fired back, describing the claims as “false assertions”, and arguing that its software “is the solution, not the problem, for users and publishers”.“Make no mistake. This letter is the first shot fired in a war on all ad blockers,” it says.The conflict between publishers reliant on advertising revenues and technology companies that enable readers to strip out digital ads with the tap of a button is escalating.Media companies worry that Brave and other ad blockers threaten their revenues at a time when many of their readers are looking to get their news via platforms such as Facebook, rather than by visiting a newspaper’s website.“It’s a continuing set of challenges for publishers to maintain control of their businesses,” says Brian Kane, co-founder and chief operating officer of Sourcepoint, a company that helps publishers take on ad blockers by blocking them or offering alternative options for readers to access content.Brave is joining a crowded ad blocking market, as companies sprout up to tap into rising consumer concerns over privacy, security and malware. Users are also increasingly concerned by how data-heavy ads slow down page loading times while also eating into their data plans.More than 200m people worldwide use ad blocking software, double the number two years ago, according to estimates by PageFair, the anti-blocking service, and Adobe, the software company.Almost all of the most widely-used web browsers, including Google’s Chrome, Apple’s Safari and Firefox, allow users to block ads.Brave goes a step further than other ad blocking groups. The company aims to give readers several options: simply block ads, donate to publishers or get paid in bitcoin to view replacement ads brokered by Brave. It says it will split ad revenues with publishers.But the publishers who signed this week’s letter argued this violates their copyright and threatened to seek damages of up to $150,000 per piece of content against which Brave serves its own ads.Brave countered that web browsers do not republish content. “Browsers do not just play back recorded pixels from the publishers’ sites. Browsers are rather the end-user agent that mediates and combines all the pieces of content, including third-party ads and first-party publisher news stories,” the company says. “Browsers are free to ignore, rearrange, mash-up and otherwise make use of any content from any source.”Brave is not the only company whose model depends on taking a cut of ad revenues.Eyeo, the company behind Adblock Plus, the most widely-used blocking software, has for years been taking payments from companies including Google and Microsoft to allow some of their ads through its filters. The company’s critics liken this so-called acceptable ads scheme to extortion.In February, Randall Rothenberg, president of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, described ad blocking companies as an “unethical, immoral, mendacious coven of techie wannabes”.Mobile network operators have also spotted an opportunity. Digicel, the Caribbean-focused network owned by Denis O’Brien, Ireland’s richest man, started blocking ads on its network in Jamaica in September. The company is working with Shine, an Israeli start-up, whose software prevents companies including Google from delivering ads to mobile browsers and apps.Mr O’Brien has said he wants to force digital media groups “to put their hands in their pockets” and pay Digicel to allow their ads to reach its customers.With ad blocking rates rising, media companies are increasingly pushing back. German media group Axel Springer forced readers of Bild, Europe’s biggest-selling tabloid newspaper, to either turn off ad blocking or pay for a subscription to access its content. The company said last November that the policy led to a drop in the number of readers using ad blockers from 23 per cent to a “single-digit”.UK broadcasters ITV and Channel 4 are among a number of companies that have refused to load content on their websites when they detect that a visitor is using an ad blocker.Forbes recently began asking readers with ad blocking software to turn it off to be able to read its articles. The company found that 42 per cent of the 2.1m visitors who were asked to disable their ad blockers did so.Yahoo has even run trials denying people who use ad blockers access to their email.But publishers and others in the digital advertising industry say that withholding content from people who block ads is unlikely to be successful without offering a carrot: serving better, less intrusive marketing messages and letting people pay to access content in other ways.“The theory of just guilting someone into ‘white listing’ the ad [exempting it from being blocked] does not work,” says Sourcepoint’s Mr Kane. Instead, he says publishers should try offering readers the ability to buy access to a single article, a day pass to the website or a full subscription, as well as the option of switching off their ad blocker.“The user can choose to have their content consumption subsidised by advertising or they can choose to make direct payment to the publication,” says Ben Barokas, Sourcepoint’s other co-founder and chief executive.“But I think the imposition of the browser in dictating a particular percentage [of revenue] upfront without any input from the other parties is a bit draconian,” he adds.
27;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2016-04-05T18:48:02Z;US business split on clean power plan;Tech companies support government in court case while energy industry opposes it;US companies have lined up on opposing sides over President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, the centrepiece of his climate policy.Apple, Google, other technology companies and some utilities have weighed into the court case over the plan in support of the administration's policy, while coal producers and local electricity companies have opposed it. The division reflects a divide in the country over the policy, which is opposed by most Republican politicians but supported by most Democrats. The Clean Power Plan is intended to cut carbon dioxide from US electricity generation by 32 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. It is the most important single policy for the Obama administration’s international commitment, made for the Paris climate talks last year, to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2025. In the absence of legislation to mandate emissions reductions, which would have no chance of passing in the Republican-dominated Congress, the administration has proposed regulations to make electricity companies invest more in low-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar, and to improve efficiency. However, 27 mostly Republican-controlled states, led by West Virginia, have filed a law suit seeking to block the implementation of the regulations, arguing that the administration is trying to exceed its powers to control pollution under the 1970 Clean Air Act. The states and the business groups that are supporting them won a significant victory in February, when the US Supreme Court ordered a halt to implementation of the plan until it had been fully considered by the courts. The Supreme Court has not yet taken any view on the substantive issue of the legality of the plan, however. That question is still with the District of Columbia appeals court, where the Environmental Protection Agency, the US regulator, and the states will put their cases at a hearing on June 2. More than a dozen business groups, representing industries including oil refining, cement production and chemicals, have backed the states’ challenge to the EPA. The US Chamber of Commerce, which has been leading the business opposition, has argued that the plan is “an unprecedented takeover of the electricity sector”, which is “already causing irreparable harm to businesses and communities across the country”. Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, and organisations representing the mining industry have also intervened in the case in support of the states, as has a group of local electricity co-operatives. [The Clean Power Plan] is already causing irreparable harm to businesses and communities across the countryHowever, several US companies have filed what are known as “amicus briefs” to the court, in support of the EPA’s position. These are arguments from companies that are not directly involved in the case, but have an interest in the outcome. In a joint submission, Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft said that they were “uniquely positioned” to give a view on the case, as some of the largest purchasers of power in the US who had committed to taking a significant proportion of that electricity from renewable sources. They said they planned to use more renewable electricity because “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple benefits”. They added that they believed the Clean Power Plan’s requirements for increased use of renewable energy were achievable and economically viable, with the cost of electricity from wind and solar power falling sharply. Similar arguments in support of the EPA’s case were made by a group of electricity utilities including Calpine, National Grid and Pacific Gas & Electric. They argued that the Clean Power Plan was a lawful way to cut emissions, and would not jeopardise the reliability of US electricity supplies. A third brief, from Ikea, Mars, Adobe and Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance, argued that their businesses would be harmed if emissions from power generation in the US were not cut. Rob Olson, the US chief financial officer for Ikea, which has been developing wind and solar power, said: “Climate change is one of the most significant challenges we face, [and] we look at renewables as an opportunity to hedge our energy costs.” The divisions within US business mean that some industry associations have refrained from intervening in the case. The Edison Electric Institute, which represents US power companies, has not taken a view on either side. Nor has the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry group, intervened in the court case, even though last year it argued that the regulations would “harm American workers and those struggling to pay for energy”. Gas producers could benefit from regulations to cut emissions, because gas emits less carbon dioxide than coal when burnt to generate power.
28;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2016-03-30T13:21:09Z;KKR sells Scout24 stake to insurer Swiss Mobiliar;;KKR has sold its stake in Scout24 Schweiz, Switzerland’s biggest online classified ads portal, to the insurer Swiss Mobiliar within two years of buying it from Ringier, the media company.The US private equity group said on Wednesday that Swiss Mobiliar had acquired its 49 per cent stake in the company, which operates online marketplaces for cars and property, writes Joseph Cotterill .Family-owned Ringier will remain Scout24 Schweiz’s controlling shareholder. The sale will return three times the money KKR originally invested, according to people familiar with the matter.KKR declined to comment on the financial terms of the transaction.KKR invested $110m of equity in August 2014 in a digital joint venture with Ringier which included Scout24 Schweiz. The company’s German counterpart, Scout24, was listed by Deutsche Telekom and buyout owners Blackstone and Hellman & Friedman last year.KKR’s acquisition formed part of a strategy in recent years of expanding in faster-growing online investments alongside old-fashioned leveraged buyouts in Europe.Other European deals by KKR have included BMG, a music rights joint venture with the publisher Bertelsmann, and Trainline, the online ticket seller.Added to recent sales of the BMG stake and Fotolia, a digital image marketplace bought by Adobe last year, KKR’s exit from Scout24 has generated returns of $1bn for investors in its latest European buyout fund, people familiar with the matter added.Many of KKR’s digital European deals have involved taking minority stakes alongside founders or family owners, departing from the usual buyout playback of taking full control of a business.“This is the future of private equity, absolutely,” said Philipp Freise, head of TMT at KKR in Europe who led the deal.The speed of KKR’s exit may also raise eyebrows in traditional private equity, where it is typical to hold investments for five years or more.“We ramped up growth significantly,” said Mr Freise, head of TMT at KKR in Europe. “At that time the right long-term strategic investor knocked on the door.“Scout24 Schweiz has been able to substantially improve its market position in the last two years and has accelerated its growth. KKR has contributed a huge amount to the excellent development of the company,” said Marc Walder, Ringier’s chief executive and chairman of Scout24 Schweiz.
29;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2016-03-18T23:21:21Z;Adobe jumps on cloud business gains;US stocks advance as Vix volatility index extends November lows;Adobe shares roared higher on Friday as investors cheered strong quarterly results and better than expected growth in the software maker’s cloud business.The California-based company said it added 798,000 cloud subscriptions in the quarter through to March 4.The figure “crushed” Wall Street estimates of 608,000, said Samad Samana, an analyst at FBR.Adobe has moved in recent years to a subscription-based model in which it makes its software, like the image editor Photoshop, available to customers as a service through the cloud instead of via one-time software purchases. As a result, its subscription figures are watched closely.Chief executive Shantanu Narayen said the company’s strong performance “is an indicator of the strong momentum we are seeing across our cloud businesses”.The company said its sales jumped by 25 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $1.38bn in the fiscal first quarter, topping estimates of $1.34bn. Profits rose to $254.3m from $84.9m on the same basis. Adjusted profits, which exclude certain items, of 66 cents a share topped Wall Street expectations by 5 cents, and Adobe also lifted its adjusted full-year profit outlook to $2.80 a share from $2.70.The shares jumped 3.9 per cent to $93.42. They have advanced 20 over the past year.Elsewhere, the S&P 500 financial sector climbed 1 per cent after two of the biggest US banks increased their share buyback programmes.JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, said its board approved a $1.9bn addition to its buyback plan. Bank of America, the second-biggest US bank, increased its share repurchase scheme by $800m. JPMorgan climbed 2.5 per cent to $60.22 while BofA rose 2 per cent to $13.67.Many energy stocks advanced as crude oil prices continued their rise. US crude oil tacked on 1.4 per cent to $40.78 a barrel after topping $40 for the first time since December on Thursday.Devon Energy, an exploration and production company, climbed 0.6 per cent to $27.57. Williams, a pipeline operator, rose 1.8 per cent to $18.07.Columbia Pipeline also jumped 5.7 per cent to $24.84 after TransCanada unveiled plans to buy the Houston-based operator in a $13bn deal.PayPal fell after Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel, downgraded the company to “hold” from “buy”.Shares of the payment processing company, which are up about 20 per cent since September, fell by 1.3 per cent to $39.41 on Friday.The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,049.58, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7 per cent to 17,602.30 and the Nasdaq Composite was increased 0.4 per cent to 4,795.65.Meanwhile, the CBOE’s Vix index, a measure of expected S&P 500 volatility over the next 30 days, slid 2.2 per cent to 14.1 after touching its lowest level since November on Thursday.Wall Street’s “fear gauge” had surged as high as 32.1 in January as US equity markets were roiled by concerns the US could be headed for a recession.

Profits rose to $254.3m from $84.9m on the same basis.Adjusted profits, which exclude certain items, of 66 cents a share topped Wall Street expectations by a nickel.Adobe also said it added 798,000 new creative cloud subscriptions during the quarter, topping expectations of 630,000.The company has been making a push into offering its products, such as image editor Photoshop, as services through the cloud instead of traditional software that is purchased and installed on individual workstations.Adobe’s shares jumped 7.7 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday.
31;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2016-02-14T23:31:53Z;Silicon Valley goes back to school to manage growth;As tech start-ups turn into big corporations they are hiring MBA graduates as well as dropouts;Growing up often means changing your attitudes to how the world works. The mantra of drop out, start up, helped define the revolutionary spirit of companies like Facebook, Apple and Microsoft, whose founders quit formal education to launch what became world-beating ventures.However, data from business schools shows that these very companies, plus peers such as Google and Amazon, now rival consultancies and investment banks as the big MBA hirers. Growing up has brought a new attitude to business education among Silicon Valley’s elite.At UCLA Anderson School of Management in Los Angeles, 30 per cent of the 2015 MBA class took roles in technology companies. For the first time, the tech-bound cohort equalled the proportion of students taking the established business school graduate route into the consulting sector.Adobe Systems took the lion’s share of Anderson MBA graduates last year, pushing Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deloitte into second and third place respectively. The most popular place for an internship was Apple, ahead of Deloitte, Mattel and PwC.The increase in technology industry hirings is being driven by changing attitudes among Silicon Valley’s key players and an acknowledgment that many have become the kinds of large companies they used to contrast themselves with, according to Phil Han, Anderson’s director of recruiting operations.“Even five or six years ago, newer tech firms felt that MBAs weren’t needed as much in the technology industry because they felt they needed engineers,” he says.“Many of these companies are now growing so fast that they need the strategic thinking and leadership skills provided by an MBA. As a result they are coming to us more often.”The biggest loser from the rise in technology industry recruitment at Anderson has been the entertainment industry, whose campus is a short car ride from Hollywood’s film and television studios.Companies like Google and Apple, with their freewheeling work practices, office ping pong tables and slides, have stolen the entertainment industry’s crown as the most fun place to work, according to Mr Han.“It is not that students do not want to do media, banking or consulting jobs any more, but these tech companies are offering some really interesting perks and benefits,” he says.Convergence means that it is also harder to distinguish between an entertainment and a technology business.Tech companies hire incredibly smart people to work on really cool, game-changing productsOne of the biggest recruiters of Anderson MBA graduates in recent years was Hulu, a streaming service for television shows, video clips and movies. Many people would view this as a technology company but its output puts it at the heart of the entertainment industry.Digital divisions of the traditional entertainment studios have also begun hiring MBAs, particularly for roles in analytics and digital distribution and operations, Mr Han notes.Mike Carley is in the second year of his MBA at Anderson, but recently secured a job offer from Adobe after a summer internship as a product marketing manager.“Tech companies hire incredibly smart people to work on really cool, complex, game-changing products,” he says. “That is the type of life I want to live, and the type of culture I want to be a part of.”Even at business schools where consultancies and investment banks still take the largest share of MBA graduates, the technology sector is now the fastest growing source of jobs.A fifth of MBA students graduating from London Business School (LBS) last year took jobs in technology companies, up from 6 per cent as recently as 2010.Despite London’s global pre-eminence in banking, barely a quarter of last year’s MBA graduates took jobs in the financial services sector, down from more than a third in 2010.The rise in technology company hires reflects a rebalancing of London’s economy following the growth of tech start-up clusters around neighbourhoods such as Shoreditch and Bermondsey, in turn driving some of the most successful Silicon Valley-based companies to open large offices in the UK.Amazon is among the biggest recruiters of MBA graduates worldwide, amounting to hundreds of jobs globally. It tops the list of tech industry hirers at several top schools in Europe and the US, including LBS.Miriam Park, Amazon’s director of university recruiting, says her employer targets specific schools for a combination of factors, including an evaluation of whether the institution’s ethos fits with the online retailer’s culture.London business schools report a growing trend among large tech companies to hire MBA graduates. Jonathan Moules talks to David Morris of London Business School about how the schools are adapting to meet the new demand for tech-based courses.“We value MBAs for, in many cases, the global approach that they can bring to the business with many candidates having worked and studied in more than one country,” she says.“Their range of experience and variety of backgrounds is invaluable in bringing a different way of looking at our business.”Edward Layoun was among 16 MBA graduates at LBS taking jobs with Amazon last year, more than went to work for Bain & Company or Goldman Sachs.The former management consultant, who changed careers to work for the online retailer after graduating with a distinction from LBS, says he was attracted by the chance to lead teams that are trying to make significant changes to the age-old activity of shopping.He claims that his career highlight last year was helping to lead the roll out of Amazon Prime’s same-day delivery service. “It showed how you can really touch people’s lives in this job,” he says.The perception that companies born in Silicon Valley value employee happiness and work-life balance as a crucial part of their success is a big selling point for those who have worked in other sectors. “I fundamentally disagree with the concept that you have to answer emails at 1:30am or work multiple 20-hour days to do good work, yet stories involving those elements are ubiquitous in the consulting and finance industry,” Anderson’s Mr Carley says.Jovanna Youssef, another Anderson MBA student, is moving from Deloitte to Apple after working in the Cupertino-based computer company’s product management team during an internship.“While I enjoyed my time at Deloitte and learned a lot, I knew I no longer wanted to work on engagements for various clients, but rather I wanted to work within a company,” she says.LBS’s Mr Layoun claims he switched away from a career in consultancy into technology because he was not satisfied with the focus on moneymaking in his former job.“Consulting and investment banking can get you a big pay cheque but at the expense of a lot of things,” he says, adding that he wanted to work for a company that talked about innovation and not just the bottom line.Given the cost of obtaining an MBA, money does play a part and may be a barrier to technology jobs surpassing consultancy positions as the career of choice for business school graduates.Among the class of 2015 MBA graduates at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, the average base salary for those taking jobs in the technology industry was $119,459.This was better than the average for many other sectors, but not as good as consulting, where the average base salary was $133,253, and financial services, with an average base salary of $125,415, according to data from the school.At Kellogg, the largest proportion of 2015 graduates took consultancy and financial services jobs, pushing the technology industry into third place.There are some mixed messages coming from those at the top of the fastest-growing technology companies about whether getting an MBA is important for a career in the sector.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, said in an online Q&A last December that her MBA from Harvard Business School was not necessary to get a job at her employer.Her boss, Mark Zuckerberg, has taken the opposite journey. Having dropped out of his Ivy League education to build his social network, in 2014 Mr Zuckerberg joined the advisory board of Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management, one of China’s top business schools. He even delivered an address in Mandarin to students at Tsinghua University’s Beijing campus. Perhaps it is time for Facebook to post a status update to clarify its position.
32;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Super Bowl ads capitalise on bumper day with new angles;CBS eyes record Super Bowl viewing as advertisers go digital for product push;"When is 30 seconds worth $5m? That is the question that faced Super Bowl advertisers as they geared up for February 7, the biggest day in US marketing.The price tag that broadcaster CBS was charging for a television commercial for this year’s National Football League championship game was double the average $2.5m price a decade ago, according to Kantar Media.But the game regularly breaks US TV viewing records, with 114m people tuning in last year. This Sunday’s pie was set to be even bigger, with CBS for the first time making its livestream of the game and all national commercials available over internet TV boxes including Apple TV and Roku.Advertisers were teasing their ads well before game day, using digital channels to extend their reach.“We’re seeing folks wanting to put their campaigns up earlier and earlier,” says Tara Walpert Levy, managing director of agency sales for Google.Google’s YouTube has been a destination for several years to promote Super Bowl ads, but the video site increasingly faces competition from Facebook, the other giant in online advertising.The social network, whose users watch 100m hours of video each day, says its ads complement television campaigns by targeting consumers on mobile devices. Facebook has signed up brands including Priceline, BMW’s Mini USA and Nestlé’s Butterfinger, promising that “priming” viewers online before showing them TV commercials would make them more likely to buy a product.YouTube touts its metrics which show that advertisers that put up their ads early on its AdBlitz site get twice the views and three times the social shares as those that wait to release their ads during the game. Last year, people watched 14m hours of Super Bowl ads on YouTube, with 60 per cent of viewers tuning in on mobile phones.“We have stopped thinking about the Super Bowl as a one-day event. Our campaign starts when the NFL season starts,” says Ram Krishnan, chief marketing officer at PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay, maker of Doritos and other snacks.Sunday’s matchup between the Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos brings the 10th and final instalment of “Crash the Super Bowl”, Doritos’ annual contest that invites fans to create their own Super Bowl ad for the crisps.It is being replaced by “Legion of the Bold”, another programme that encourages fans to create Doritos ads throughout the year.“Our focus is, ‘How do you have an ongoing conversation with the consumer versus just a one-way message at them during the game?’” says Mr Krishnan.Seth Kaufman, chief marketing officer for Pepsi’s North American beverage business, takes a similarly long-range view. The company has spent $172m in Super Bowl advertising over the past decade, according to Kantar. This year it is running one ad for its namesake cola and another for its Mountain Dew Kickstart drink, in addition to sponsoring the halftime show featuring Beyoncé and Coldplay.“We are thinking about how we leverage the Super Bowl, not just leading into the game, but coming out of it,” he says.Frito-Lay’s Mr Krishnan notes that the two weeks leading up to the NFL’s finale is one of the strongest sales periods for beverages and snacks.The company is creating 75,000 in-store displays to promote its products, hoping for a hefty portion of the 177m pounds of snacks Americans were due to eat during the game.Taco Bell was using its return to the Super Bowl to launch a new product. The fast-food chain began running teasers last week encouraging curious consumers to pre-order the mystery item before it landed in restaurants on Monday.“The new teaser is the postgame extension. If you’re an advertiser that is going to spend this kind of money, your return on investment shouldn’t end at the end of the game,” says Mike Sheldon, chief executive of Deutsch North America, Taco Bell’s advertising agency.The new teaser is the postgame extension. If you’re an advertiser that is going to spend this kind of money, your return on investment shouldn’t end at the end of the gameHow much pay-off can an advertiser expect from a Super Bowl bet?Wix.com, a website development company, credits some of its 34 per cent growth in registered users and 46 per cent boost in premium subscriptions in the first nine months of 2015 to its inaugural Super Bowl ad in last year’s game.The company was returning on Sunday with a TV ad and a multimedia campaign including a YouTube spot to be streamed during the game. Wix is one of the first marketers using Google’s new “real-time” advertising product, which places ads on the video site in response to what happens during televised events.Adobe, the software maker, estimates that brands that advertise during the Super Bowl see traffic to their websites jump more than 60 per cent, a boost that can last for more than three weeks after the game.“Advertisers should consider doing strong digital marketing in that period,” says Ann Lewnes, chief marketing officer. The most popular Super Bowl ads have a viral afterlife on social media that lasts on average 25 days, she added.Hyundai, the South Korean carmaker, was also coming back to the Super Bowl after a year off. Eric Springer, chief creative officer of Innocean, the carmaker’s agency, says the success of its Super Bowl commercials will be measured in part by monitoring social media chatter.“It’s about how well we own Twitter. If you can get people as engaged as possible from now through the Super Bowl — and to continue talking about it after — then you are really making the most of your money,” he says.But establishing a direct connection between social buzz and sales of Hyundai’s cars is not simple, he acknowledged.“Is it trackable how many Elantras they sell? Absolutely,” he says. “Can we take credit? That’s harder to do. But it certainly does not hurt to get that social conversation going.”Social media mentions are not always a sign of success, however. Last year, insurer Nationwide was the second-most mentioned brand on Twitter during the game, according to Salesforce Marketing Cloud. But three-quarters of those conversations were negative as viewers vented their disgust with Nationwide’s ad about a dead child, and the insurer had to issue an apology.The company is sitting out this year’s game.As thousands of football fans poured into the San Francisco Bay Area ahead of the Super Bowl, the start-ups of Silicon Valley were hoping to make their mark, writes Leslie Hook in San Francisco. Companies including Uber and Airbnb are hoping to reach new fans.Uber, the ride-hailing app, announced its first ever mass transit partnership with Caltrain, the commuter rail service, to mark the event. The new service allows riders to carpool to and from train stations in the Bay Area, including stops near Levi’s Stadium, to help ease congestion. The company’s promotions ahead of the game include events with football stars, and delivery of chicken wings, a classic American football food, during the game on Sunday.However, a protest over fare cuts by Uber drivers threatened to disrupt traffic around San Francisco International airport on Super Bowl Sunday, a move that could be embarrassing for the transport company in its home town area.Airbnb, the home-sharing company, was expecting a surge in guests at the weekend. The company forecast 15,000 would come to the Bay Area, quadruple the figure from last year’s Super Bowl. Airbnb says that its nightly rates have stayed around $225 on average despite the surge.However, some entrepreneurial hosts who live near the stadium jacked their fees up to more than $6,000 per night for the weekend.Both Uber and Airbnb see big events like conferences or sports matches as an important part of their business, and have been working to integrate better with such occasions. Airbnb was providing extra safety tips for Super Bowl hosts and guests, for example, and at this summer’s Rio Olympics the company will be an official service provider.When the Super Bowl kicked off on Sunday, it was in the heart of the classic Silicon Valley — just a short walk from the headquarters of companies like Intel and Oracle. But it was the newer arrivals who were hoping they could capture the game.shannon.bond@ft.com

Sales climbed 22 per cent to $1.31bn, matching Wall Street estimates.Earnings per share came in at 62 cents, excluding certain items, topping forecasts by two cents.Adobe also pointed to solid gains in its cloud service, in which it makes some of its hallmark software, such as the photo-editing package Photoshop, available on a subscription basis online.Adobe’s shares climbed 2.7 per cent on Friday to $91.42. The stock is up 25.8 per cent for the year.Shares in JetBlue Airways fell nearly 8 per cent to $23.43 after the low-cost carrier said it expected passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), a key industry metric that measures airlines’ sales relative to its capacity, to fall by between 2 and 3 per cent in the fourth quarter.Elsewhere, shares of DuPont and Dow Chemical slumped after the chemical giants revealed plans to merge in a $130bn deal that will be followed by a three-way split. The shares of both companies had climbed earlier in the week on reports that outlined the brushstrokes of the tie-up.After mergers are announced shares often pull back as investors gauge the regulatory and other risks that could prevent the deal from closing. DuPont fell 4.7 per cent to $71.02, while Dow dropped 2.8 per cent to $53.38.Energy shares took a thrashing on Friday as the price of crude oil continued sliding. US crude oil dropped 1.7 per cent to $36.14 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, sold off by 2.5 per cent to $38.73 a barrel.After an Opec meeting last week ended in chaos, hopes were dashed that a glut of supply will start to ease any time soon. This is bad news for energy companies, especially those that have aggressively funded themselves using debt.The S&P 500 energy sector dropped 3.4 per cent on Friday, leading the markets lower. Large names in the sector fell sharply. For instance, Kinder Morgan, the pipeline operator, dropped 2 per cent to $16.67. Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company, swooned by 8.3 per cent to $47.40.The financial sector was another laggard. Investment banks declined as a small high-yield bond fund halted redemptions, sparking wider concerns about the credit market. Goldman Sachs dropped 3.1 per cent to $176.43, while Morgan Stanley dipped 4.0 per cent to $32.08.The S&P 500 dropped 1.9 per cent to 2,012.37, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.8 per cent to 17,265 and the Nasdaq Composite sold off by 2.2 per cent to 4,933.In a sign of the tumult on Wall Street, the CBOE’s VIX index, a measure of expected S&P 500 volatility over the next 30 days, shot up 11.7 per cent to 21.6. Meanwhile, traders took shelter in safe-haven asset classes, including Treasury bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 0.10 percentage points to 2.13 per cent as traders bid up the asset.adam.samson@ft.comTwitter: @adamsamson

But that may have to change as the company best known for its smartphones looks to conquer new frontiers, according to one analyst.Apple chief executive Tim Cook may consider a large acquisition next year as he looks to begin building growth in new areas, including the car industry, Daniel Ives, an analyst at FRB wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.Here are the four possible targets flagged by Mr Ives:GoProGoPro’s action cameras are “uniquely positioned at the intersection of Apple’s smartphone, wearables and multimedia offerings,” Mr Ives says. As a bonus, the company’s new product cycles could “open the door” to areas like drones and virtual reality, where Apple has had to play catch-up in recent years.Market value: $2.7bn (up after a 15 per cent rally on Thursday driven by Mr Ives’s note)Adobe, BoxBoth companies would help open businesses as a customer base for Apple, Mr Ives said.Adobe would give Apple deeper exposure into the platforms used by “creatives.” (Think Photoshop, the popular photo editing program):Apple would also be at the center of the digital transformation within enterprises, as Adobe’s Document Cloud/Marketing Cloud applications are helping enterprises grapple with the growth of digital marketing, proliferation of mobile devices in the enterprise, and [internet of things].Meanwhile, Box would enable Apple to bolster its iCloud platform, and provide businesses with much richer cloud storage solutions.Adobe market value: $44.6bnBox market value: $1.6bnTeslaA buyout of the electric carmaker would be a longshot, Mr Ives cautioned. Still, snagging Tesla’s advanced battery technology “would greatly accelerate Apple’s entrance into the next-generation auto arena.”Overall, Mr Ives reckons there is a 60 per cent – 70 per cent chance Apple jumps into the auto market by 2020.Market value: $29.8bn
37;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Traffic defies doubts about Cyber Monday;Analysts expect a record $3bn to be spent on the peak US online shopping day;Heavy Cyber Monday traffic overwhelmed Target’s website at times on Monday even as analysts voiced growing doubts over the significance of the biggest US online shopping day of the year.US online sales are expected to rise 12 per cent to a record $3bn this year, Adobe Digital Index said. But retailers are seeing faster ecommerce growth earlier in the holiday season as they offer deeper discounts for a longer period of time both in stores and online.Online shopping grew 18 per cent to $1.6bn on Thanksgiving Day and 15 per cent to $2.7bn on Black Friday, Adobe estimated, with total ecommerce sales up 17 per cent to $8.03bn between Thanksgiving and Sunday.That is still less than 10 per cent of the $83bn Adobe expects Americans to spend over the entire holiday season, and the growth has been driven in part by discounts that could weigh on retailers’ profits.Target announced 15 per cent discounts across its site for the first time, with deep reductions on apparel and toys as it sought to be “a not-to-be-missed destination for deal-seekers on Cyber Monday and throughout Cyber Week”, according to Jason Goldberger, president of Target.com and Mobile.Apple iPads, gaming consoles and televisions were its top sellers over the Black Friday weekend, it added.The Monday after Thanksgiving has also historically been Amazon’s busiest day of the year, with customers around the world ordering 43m items last year at a rate of 500 items per second. Yet the National Retail Federation estimated that the number of consumer planning to shop online this Cyber Monday would fall 5 per cent from the previous year to an estimated 121m.Focus has shifted instead to the growth of mobile shopping, with retailers like Amazon introducing more than 150 “Lightning Deals” that will only be available on its mobile app from Thanksgiving day through to December 9.The NRF’s survey suggested that 24.4 per cent or 29.6m consumers planned to shop on their mobile devices on Monday, compared with 19.3 per cent last year. Adobe said mobile traffic overtook visits from desktop computers on Thanksgiving Day.But analysts are quick to point out that retailers continue to struggle with monetising mobile growth. Mobile accounted for 70 per cent of ecommerce growth in the third quarter but only 16 per cent of total dollars spent, according to Goldman Sachs.The growth predictions also left investors unimpressed. By early afternoon, shares in Kohl’s and Macy’s were each down 2.3 per cent, Gap was down 2.2 per cent and Nordstrom shares slid 1.9 per cent to $56.63. Urban Outfitters was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 retail index, falling 4.65 per cent to $22.55.mamta.badkar@ft.com@mamtabadkar
38;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2015-11-30T00:54:59Z;US retailers roll out new discounts for Cyber Monday;Smartphones and tablets help weekend spending soar to $6.1bn;Big US retailers were on Sunday rolling out a new round of discounts ahead of the official start of Cyber Monday, one of the biggest shopping days on the US calendar, in the hope of adding to Black Friday’s sales bonanza.US consumers with smartphones and tablets boosted online spending between Thursday and Saturday to $6.1bn, a 19 per cent increase from last year, according to Adobe Digital Index, which tracked data on more than 200m visits to 4,500 retail websites. Mobile devices accounted for roughly 34 per cent of online sales, a record and an increase from 27 per cent in 2014.Adobe is predicting $3bn in online sales on Monday, a 12 per cent increase from 2014.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, Best Buy, an electronics retailer, and Macy’s department store were among the stores rolling out Cyber Monday sales on Sunday. Best Buy and Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, are extending their Cyber Monday sales through the week. This was the first time Walmart started Cyber Monday early, with the retailer launching all its 2,000 deals on Sunday evening.Online retailing has transformed holiday shopping but still accounts for only between 7 per cent and 16 per cent of US retailers’ sales, analysts estimate, so strong digital growth is coming from a relatively low base.Early figures for the extended weekend, which traditionally kicks off the US holiday shopping season, showed an estimated decline in purchases in brick and mortar stores. Final spending figures will not be available until this week.ShopperTrak predicted $12.1bn in in-store sales over Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, an estimated decrease from the same period last year. Over the same two days, Adobe estimates online shoppers spent $4.5bn, a new record.Stores are still working on integrating their online and brick and mortar businesses. Many traditional retailers are offering deep discounts despite struggling financially.Cory Brewer, who does most of his shopping online, said he had been persuaded to queue for an Apple Watch at one of Target’s Chicago stores on Thanksgiving evening because it came with a $100 store gift voucher.The National Retail Federation projects that 135.8m people will shop in stores and online over Black Friday weekend, compared with 133.7m last year.You can call it omni-channel shopping. [Monday] is a really big day for everyoneSpending over the entire holiday period is projected to increase 3.7 per cent to $630.5bn this year, with the average family spending $805. That is below the 4.1 per cent rise in spending last year.The NRF predicts 121m shoppers will buy items on Cyber Monday, down from 126m who planned to participate last year. The holiday shopping season begins much earlier, with 60 per cent of those surveyed having started buying in early November, the NRF added.“You can call it omni-channel” shopping, said Matthew Shay, president and chief executive. “Tomorrow is a really big day for everyone.”Some retailers decided to opt out of some of the frenzy. REI, a retailer of outdoor gear, closed its stores on Black Friday “so we can go outside and play”, saying it hoped consumers would do the same.
39;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2015-11-29T16:28:53Z;Mobile sales spike on mixed Black Friday;US stores see healthy traffic as online discounts resemble 2014;Consumers turned to their smartphones and tablets to drive a sharp increase in online sales, as early indications signalled a mixed start to the Black Friday weekend of bargain hunting in the US.While many consumers queued for hours on Thanksgiving to ensure they got the Xbox or high definition television they wanted, others stayed home clicking on deals. Anecdotal evidence from analysts and retailers suggested traffic to stores was healthy, but the first estimates of in-store spending do not come out until Sunday.Online sales jumped by a quarter to $1.73bn on Thanksgiving Day, according to Adobe Digital Index, which tracked 180m visits to shopping sites through the day. Sales from mobile devices accounted for 37 per cent of all online sales, up from 29 per cent last year, though mobile accounted for 57 per cent of all retail site visits.Black Friday online sales climbed 14 per cent to $2.74bn, Adobe said, with a third of sales coming from mobile devices. Products were discounted by 24 per cent on average, it added.Brick-and-mortar sales over Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday were projected to reach $12.1bn, which would be a decline from last year, according to ShopperTrak, suggesting a drop in sales at physical stores as retailers stretched the shopping season over a longer period.Underscoring the increasing importance of integrating online and physical stores, Cory Brewer said he had been persuaded to queue for an Apple Watch at one of Target’s Chicago stores on Thanksgiving evening because it came with a $100 store gift voucher.“I can buy other presents, for my girlfriend, or food,” he said. “I do most of my shopping online now, it’s easier, cheaper and there’s more of a selection.”Large retailers such as Walmart and Target have been investing in improving the integration of their in-store and online services, as shoppers increasingly use mobile devices to research products, redeem coupons, share recommendations and buy. This holiday season will be an important test of how these blending strategies are faring.Target said its online sales reached a new record on Thanksgiving Day, with the number of orders placed on its website or app for in-store pickup up 35 per cent from last year. It said it was seeing in-store traffic “on par with or slightly above” recent years.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, said during the day that Black Friday had been its “ most integrated” between bricks-and-mortar and its website and app so far. It said “tens of millions of customers” had visited its stores and website.“They prepped beforehand — more than 25m customers accessed store maps and [promotions] through our online and mobile tools for Black Friday,” said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer of Walmart US.Online retailing has transformed holiday shopping but still only accounts for between 7 per cent and 16 per cent of US retailers’ sales, analysts estimate, so strong digital growth is coming from a relatively low base.The season that once started on Black Friday now spans all of November and December, as retailers have expanded their promotions and discounts to make the season longer.Online access and the fact that many retailers’ Black Friday promotions now start on Thanksgiving Day means that the frenzy of Black Friday morning has mellowed, reducing the number of irate and exhausted customers fighting over items.It also means that the long weekend has become a less reliable indicator for the rest of the holiday season. Charlie O’Shea, an analyst at Moody’s, argued that this year felt like the longest season he had experienced, starting with the much-hyped release of toys tied to the latest Star Wars film in September.25%Year-on-year increase in US online sales on Thanksgiving Day (Source: Adobe Digital Index)Dave Brandon, chief executive of Toys R Us, said Star Wars products were faring well at his stores, but it depended on the toy. Noting the “unprecedented” amount of Star Wars products, he said it would be interesting to evaluate whether or not there has been overkill when the hype dies down.Mr Brandon said that Hasbro’s PieFace — a YouTube video of which went viral earlier this year — was proving extremely popular, and Adobe said the game was running low on inventory online. Other popular items included Monopoly, Lego Dimensions and Barbie.While Mr Brandon was happy with the early traffic at Toys R Us, he hesitated to jump to conclusions so early in the weekend. Many estimates for toy sales were projecting “mid-to-high” single-digit growth for the broader holiday season, he noted, but “thus far I’ve not seen that extent of growth”.“I do think the customer is being careful, although consumer confidence is relatively high and fuel prices are low.”I do think the customer is being careful, although consumer confidence is relatively high and fuel prices are lowAlthough consumer spending has been fuelling broader economic growth in the US, certain areas such as apparel have been weak recently, which some attribute to unseasonably warm weather.Those Americans feeling flush have been spending more on cars, eating out and travelling. However, lower income households appear to have been held back by rising rents and scant wage increases.This appeared to be playing out at stores in Chicago. Wendell Springs, who queued for five hours on Thanksgiving afternoon to secure an Xbox for his son’s birthday and a 55-inch colour television at a price he could afford was not feeling particularly optimistic.“I’ve been broke all my life, so [a better economy] makes no difference,” he said. “I go to work, go home, pay my bills, that’s it.”Across town, however, Clarissa Smith and her family planned to spend an additional $700 on gifts this Christmas, and had just spent $1,000 at Target.“This is just the beginning,” she said smiling. “Things are better financially, I got a better job.”

It has been downloaded more than 1m times and on Friday passed stalwarts including Serial, This American Life and Radiolab to claim the top spot on the Apple iTunes list of most popular podcasts.The difference between those shows, which have helped to fuel a podcast resurgence, and The Message is not one of style or production values. It is that The Message is a product of General Electric’s marketing department.GE worked with Panoply, the podcast network owned by digital publisher Slate, to produce a sponsored eight-part series that unravels a fictional mystery with help from the conglomerate’s real-life ultrasound technology.The performance of The Message “exceeded all our expectations”, said Andy Goldberg, GE’s chief creative officer. “It’s had a different reach than video on either mobile or desktop. It opens up opportunities for where you can reach people.”The industrial giant is just one of a growing list of companies seeking their own Serial moment, lured by the wild success of the true crime show that became one of 2014’s media hits.“It’s a reinvigoration of the oldest form of communications,” said Levi Slavin, creative director at BBDO New York, the Omnicom-owned advertising agency that worked on the project with GE. “You’ve got this captive audience commuting or on a road trip or stuck in traffic and they’re choosing between genuinely entertaining personalised experiences through audio. We’re trying to make entertainment.”Other companies are also experimenting with audio as part of a larger push into content marketing— promoting their messages through news or entertainment-style articles and multimedia.Goldman Sachs and Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, both produce podcasts that bring together staff and outside experts to discuss topics in finance, technology and business.Richard Edelman, head of Edelman, the public relations company, described podcasting as “a huge opportunity” for brands that are increasingly recasting themselves as “storytellers”.“We’re recommending to clients to do subject-specific shows,” he said. “A celebrity chef sharing recipes at Thanksgiving time could be a good podcast for the dairy industry.”Shannon Bond explores the company’s varied media ventures, including its newest partnership with podcast network Panoply.Adobe, the software company, started making its marketing research white papers available as podcasts, hoping to appeal to people who do not have the time or inclination to read a lengthy document. It signed up Malcolm McDowell, the British actor known for his roles in A Clockwork Orange and Caligula, to narrate one episode.Alex Amado, Adobe’s vice-president of experience marketing, said the audio versions have received six times the number of downloads that the traditional PDFs receive. Adobe has expanded the project to the UK this week, and also plans to bring it to Germany.“It’s really quite accessible and extremely inexpensive — 10 to 15 per cent of the cost of one of our videos. It’s something we can do a lot of,” he said.To meet the growing appetite for brand-sponsored podcasting, Panoply, which co-produced The Message, is creating a unit devoted to custom work for advertisers. The company has also produced sponsored shows for HBO, the premium cable channel, and has been contacted by other brands intrigued by the success of the GE project.“People are rediscovering the joys of audio that in a way that wasn’t available when audio was only on someone’s radio station. Now you can do it yourself,” said Andy Bowers, Panoply’s chief content officer.shannon.bond@ft.com

The London-based producer of Miller Lite, Grolsch and Peroni makes 70 per cent of its sales to emerging markets.PepsiCo, the US snacks and beverage group, also saw roughly $2bn sliced off revenues in its just-completed quarter as currency swings cut into its sales abroad. Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Taco Bell and Dupont, also warned this week of the dollar’s impact on earnings.A strengthening dollar hurts US companies with large overseas operations since the same amount of money made outside the US is worth less when translated back into dollars.A blended rate of reported results and estimates shows third-quarter revenue for companies in the S&P 500 with less than 50 per cent of sales in the US fell 13 per cent year over year compared with a rise of about 1 per cent for those with more than half of sales in the US, according to FactSet.While the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its major peers such as the euro, sterling and Canadian dollar, rose only 0.8 per cent during the period, it significantly appreciated against emerging market currencies during the period.JPMorgan’s emerging market currency index, which measures the most heavily traded EM currencies against the dollar, is down 8.25 per cent.Indeed, investors said the impact of the dollar would be bifurcated.“Broadly speaking, if you look at the S&P 500 the impact of currency in the third quarter will be significantly less than in the first half of the year, but the impact will be in companies that are doing a lot of business in Russia, China or Latin America,” said Oliver Pursche, chief executive at Bruderman Brothers.The dollar will be less of a drag for US multinationals doing business in the western hemisphere as well as in Japan and Australia, he said.James Liu, global market strategist with JPMorgan Asset Management, sees “a light at the end of the tunnel” for the dollar and earnings.“The third quarter should be the last quarter we have these real negative year-on-year comparisons,” he said.With the earnings season about to get under way, the Commerce Department this week reported that in August the gap between US exports and imports swelled more than 15 per cent to $48.3bn, highlighting how a strong dollar has affected the trade balance.
42;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Adobe shares drop on profits warning;Software group blames rising dollar and final transition to cloud for shortfall;Adobe, the US software company, blamed the rising US dollar and the effects of moving its last big software products to the cloud as it slashed its 2016 earnings forecast.The shares fell nearly 10 per cent in after-market trading, though the stock later recovered half its lost ground as investors digested the news.The maker of the Creative Suite of software tools for graphics professionals and the Acrobat document reader has been seen on Wall Street as one of the few traditional software makers to have made a successful switch to the cloud.Its shares had jumped by more than 150 per cent in the past three years on hopes that it had largely completed the difficult transition, which causes slowing reported growth as upfront software license fees are replaced by annual cloud subscriptions.In a financial presentation released ahead of an analyst meeting on Tuesday, however, Adobe said that moving its remaining big products to the cloud would take more than $100m out of its revenues in 2016. The software includes the Acrobat document reader, along with a collection of photographic, marketing and content delivery products.Revenue would fall short by another $200m or so due to foreign exchange movements, it said. As a result, it forecast revenue of $5.7bn for the fiscal year ending in November 2016, compared to the $5.95bn Wall Street had been expecting.The double hit on revenues led the company to wipe about 50 cents from its forecast of pro-forma earnings per share, resulting in a projected $2.70 for next year compared to the $3.17 analysts had been expecting.The bump for Adobe in what had become a smooth transition to the cloud echoes pressures that have built recently on companies like Microsoft and Oracle, which were later to attempt the switch. Oracle has blamed its weak revenues in the past two quarters on its increasing success in moving customers to subscriptions, delaying more of its revenues until future years.The change has led to rising share price volatility, as investors struggle to understand how much the revenue shortfalls are the result of deterioration in the companies’ core businesses, and how much they merely represent a deferral of profits.
43;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T17:39:23+0000;India’s tech-savvy Modi embraces modernity — just not at home;Bans on eating beef and campaigns against kissing in public suggest a less than modern outlook;Narendra Modi is India’s first tech-savvy, social media-enabled prime minister. He has 15m followers on Twitter. He won last year’s election with the help of 10ft high holograms that allowed him to make live addresses to more than 100 election rallies simultaneously in the world’s biggest democracy.This weekend, he will be the first Indian premier to set foot in California in more than 30 years when he visits Silicon Valley, where he is due to meet the bosses of Apple, Tesla Motors, Google, Microsoft and Adobe. The last three CEOs are of Indian origin.On Sunday, Mr Modi and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg will hold a question-and-answer meeting at the company’s headquarters. “This is a Townhall you shouldn’t miss,” Mr Modi said on Facebook, enthusing about India’s role as a hub for tech start-ups.Mr Modi is also on course to become India’s most-travelled leader. He relishes his role as global ambassador, whether he is meeting his friend “Barack” (Obama) or trying traditional archery in Mongolia.Back home in India, though, ministers from Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party and some of his Hindu fundamentalist supporters are starting to look anything but modern. Nor do they even pretend to have an open, internationalist view of the wider world with which Mr Modi wants to engage.Since he took office, the government or its puritanical Hindu political allies have imposed bans on the consumption of beef and other meat in different states, campaigned against kissing in public, raided hotels where unmarried couples were meeting, tried to Hinduise school textbooks and ban inconvenient works of history, seized control of cultural institutions and opposed the spread of the English language.They have also harassed non-government organisations such as Greenpeace and the Ford Foundation, which once funded an activist who wants Mr Modi to stand trial for his role in the Hindu-Muslim bloodbath in Gujarat in 2002.At first, these actions were so discreet that New Delhi could plausibly deny there was any concerted effort to impose a majoritarian, anti-foreign Hindu agenda on this diverse nation of 1.3bn people. “It’s a kind of frightening situation but because it’s scattered, people are not seeing the connection,” says Shiv Visvanathan, a political analyst who contrasts the “technocratic” Mr Modi of foreign travels with the “communal” prime minister of domestic politics.Pew finds that more than two-thirds of Indians hold a very favourable view of the prime ministerRead moreYet the government already seems to be abandoning its earlier discretion. “We will cleanse every area of public discourse that has been westernised and where Indian culture and civilisation need to be restored — be it the history we read, our cultural heritage or our institutes that have been polluted over years,” Mahesh Sharma, the national culture minister, was quoted as telling leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the parent of the BJP, this month.One theory about the latest surge of overt bigotry is that the BJP is desperate to win the forthcoming state election in Bihar by polarising voters and winning over the majority Hindus.In the internet age, however, Mr Modi and the BJP cannot deploy one set of cultural values for domestic use while displaying an entirely different set to the young and mostly liberal investors of Silicon Valley — and expect no one to notice.Indian-American opponents of Mr Modi have launched a website called modifail.com and called for a Silicon Valley protest on Sunday against religious violence, cultural fundamentalism and the erosion of civil liberties.More than 100 US university academics involved with south Asia, most of Indian origin, have urged Silicon Valley entrepreneurs not to forget their corporate responsibility codes when dealing with a Modi government they characterise as alarmingly authoritarian.Mr Modi may have to decide whether he wants to be leader of an ancient Hindu civilisation too proud to think it needs help from the outside world, or of a modern, outward-looking nation of young people even more tech-savvy than he is. As Mr Visvanathan says, Mr Modi and his backers are vainly trying to keep modernity and western values in separate boxes. “It doesn’t quite work,” he says.

Sales rose 21 per cent to $1.2bn.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 28 cents a share, on sales of $1.2bn. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 54 cents a share also topped expectations.Third-quarter results were buoyed by growth in subscribers to its cloud services. New creative cloud subscriptions grew by 684,000, ahead of estimates.Shares of Adobe rose as much as 5 per cent before paring back gains to 1.2 per cent to $81.25 by the close of trading. The share price had slipped in after-hours trading on Thursday immediately after the company announced results, in response to a disappointing outlook. Adobe said it expects fourth quarter sales in the range of $1.28 to $1.33bn, shy of Wall Street’s estimates for $1.36bn.Adjusting for one-time items, the company expects earnings to range between 56 and 62 cents a share, also below forecasts for 64 cents.Analysts pointed out that sales growth is being impacted by the transition to the cloud in its digital media business.“While investors may harbour some concerns around a fourth-quarter revenue guide that came in about $60m light of consensus expectations and the departure of a key executive, strong performance against the above factors leads us to believe the core story remains firmly on track,” Keith Weiss, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said.Freeport-McMoRan was the worst performing stock on the benchmark S&P 500 after the copper miner said it was looking to sell $1bn in new shares.The news followed a similar share offering announced last month, which Freeport said it had completed.In a regulatory filing, the company said that it may offer shares “from time to time through designated sales agents”. Freeport shares fell nearly 11 per cent to $10.74.Shares in La Quinta Holdings fell 15.4 per cent to $16.05 after the hotel chain reduced its guidance and said its chief executive was stepping down.The Texas-based company now expects 2015 adjusted earnings in the range of $393m to $400m, below a previous forecast for $398m to $404m. Revenue per available room, a key industry metric, is now projected to rise between 3.5 to 4.5 per cent for the full-year, compared with its prior outlook for 4.5 to 5.5 per cent growth.The stock was also downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” by analysts at JPMorgan, with the price target cut to $20 from $28.Gold was one of the few asset classes to benefit from the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave its rate unchanged.New York shares of Kinross Gold rose 9.5 per cent to $1.85, while Eldorado Gold added 4.8 per cent to $3.17 and Gold Fields Limited gained 3.1 per cent to $2.88.US markets closed down, continuing Thursday’s losses on the Fed decision. The S&P 500 lost 1.6 per cent to 1,958.08.

45;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2015-08-18T12:18:04Z;Deutsche Telekom executive calls for online advertising subsidy;Likes of Google and Facebook should pay for users’ data plans, Gerszberg proposes;A Deutsche Telekom executive has called for internet companies such as Google and Facebook to subsidise users’ mobile subscriptions because of the way advertising “eats into” data allowances.In an article posted on LinkedIn, Tomasz Gerszberg, senior vice-president of technology strategy, governance and programs, argued that consumers should be protected from soaring data charges related to “annoying” online advertising.“The future model of mobile advertising delivery needs to be changed,” Mr Gerszberg wrote in the post, which was published last week. Deutsche Telekom said the article was written in a personal capacity, and it has since been deleted.His comments will prove controversial with companies such as Google, Facebook and AppNexus, which help brands deliver advertising to websites and apps. Deutsche Telekom has 150m mobile subscribers worldwide.Under Mr Gerszberg’s proposal, online advertising intermediaries would have to start paying carriers such as Deutsche Telekom for the use of their mobile data networks. This advertising would be “zero-rated” for mobile subscribers, meaning that it would not consume any of their monthly data quota.Implicit within the proposal is a threat: carriers could block the advertising of intermediaries that refused to pay. In his article, Mr Gerszberg pointed out that an Israeli start-up called Shine has developed network-filtering software able to stop adverts loading in web pages and apps.Shine’s software only blocks advertising that is delivered to websites and apps via third-party ad networks, and does not interfere with “in-feed” ads such as those found within Facebook’s own app. Facebook, Google and Twitter all run ad networks that extend beyond their own websites.Deutsche Telekom, whose brands include T-Mobile, said: “These are interesting thoughts on the possible future development of advertisement in the mobile industry.”“Deutsche Telekom follows up on all trends and developments in its industry, but we have no fixed plans to introduce such an option.”Shine said it “does not comment on private commercial discussions”.150mmobile subscribers worldwide held by Deutsche TelekomMr Gerszberg, whose LinkedIn profile describes his role as being to “rock the boat”, did not respond to a request for additional information about how his proposed zero-rating scheme for advertising would work.Dean Bubley, a telecoms analyst, said that the proposal would be extremely risky and difficult to implement from a commercial and technical perspective. “It sounds like wishful thinking,” he said. “Are you going to get any hard money out of Google for this? Probably not.”Yet extracting payment from big internet companies is not unthinkable. Both Google and Microsoft have paid to escape the filters of Eyeo, a German company that operates Adblock Plus, a widely used piece of software for blocking ads on desktop computers.Mr Gerszberg’s proposal also comes at a time of intensifying concern among online publishers about the rise of adblocking. The number of people using adblocking software surged 40 per cent to almost 200m over the past year, according to estimates from Adobe and PageFair, a Dublin-based start-up that helps websites deal with blockers.Once limited to desktop computers, adblocking technology is spreading to mobile. In June, Apple said it would allow iPhone users to block ads in its Safari web browser. As well as Deutsche Telekom, other telecoms groups are also considering ways to implement adblocking software at network level.Marketers will spend almost $69bn this year on mobile ads — more than triple the sum they spent two years ago — according to research group eMarketer.
46;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2015-07-22T16:59:34Z;Sage and SAP: software shake-up;Two payments companies face a common conundrum in different ways;"One serves predominantly small businesses, the other large corporations. Both UK-based Sage and Germany’s SAP face a common conundrum. Companies such as Salesforce and NetSuite are winning market share by selling subscription-based software, while users increasingly prefer remotely hosted “cloud” applications that require less internal IT support. Both trends are a threat to licence-based software that users run on their own networks.Sage and SAP are adapting to this new world in very different ways. SAP has spent big, acquiring $18bn worth of cloud-related companies since 2011. This has had a predictable impact on cloud revenues; they rose 130 per cent in the first half. But at a price. Adjusted for exchange-rate movements, operating margins fell 2 percentage points to 28 per cent and net profit dropped too — partly because of interest charges on the €10bn of debt taken on to pay for acquisitions.Sage is pursuing an internal transformation, gradually migrating customers to subscription-based products. A trading statement on Wednesday showed more sedate revenue growth; subscription revenue was up 9.7 per cent and overall revenue grew 7.5 per cent. Operating margins were maintained at 28 per cent.Subscription is the more attractive long-term business model, providing steadier and more predictable revenue and more growth opportunities. The superior growth rates and higher share price ratings of cloud-based software groups attest as much. But business transformations on this scale are tricky and entail short-term pain in return for promises of jam tomorrow.Of the two, Sage is in the stronger position. Small business customers are conservative, giving it more time to complete the transition; meanwhile, it can fall back on other self-help measures such as cost cutting to maintain profitability. It is also small enough to be a potential takeover target.There is hope for SAP, though. Adobe’s push into the cloud was painful at first, but its latest results show sales picking up strongly. Its shares have outperformed both SAP and Sage over the past three years.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
47;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2015-07-01T11:54:02Z;How a subscription model could benefit your business;Technological change is helping drive the return of a method of commerce that slipped out of vogue;"Launching a subscription business is not easy. Just ask Apple, which last week decided to pay artists during the three-month free trial period of its $9.99-a-month Apple Music service, after singer Taylor Swift complained.Shifting to a subscription model requires mindset, management and marketing changes — and an ability to anticipate, and sometimes absorb, the impact on suppliers, customers and financial results. Adobe Systems, the software group that in 2011 switched to selling cloud-based subscriptions rather than licences paid for in advance, had to endure three years of flat sales before this month reporting record quarterly revenues.But the business model that in the pre-digital age was the preserve of periodicals, book-of-the-month direct sales companies and golf clubs is spreading fast. Companies in search of the magic combination of customer loyalty, predictable income and user information are selling pet foods, cosmetics, socks and cheese for monthly payments and challenging incumbents with more traditional models.Dollar Shave Club, set up three years ago to ship fresh razor blades to customers every month, is reported to be worth $615m following a recent funding round, obliging Gillette, among others, to sharpen its approach. The BBC’s funding model, based on an annual licence fee, paid by anyone in the UK who receives its programmes, is under pressure as subscription-based services such as Netflix expand.Peter Fader, co-director of Wharton business school’s Customer Analytics Initiative, expects subscription commerce to become “a mainstream part of our lives” over the coming years. The marketing professor says most companies are over-anxious about how customers will respond to change.Why are subscriptions catching on now, centuries after newspapers pioneered the concept? One reason is the combination of technological and demographic change. John Warrillow, author of The Automatic Customer, subtitled “Creating a subscription business in any industry”, says everyone is now happier to use credit cards online and “young people are more comfortable with this notion of access rather than assets — [they] have no need to own things any more”.Another reason, according to Prof Fader, is that earlier association of subscription models with aggressive direct marketing tactics is fading.Technology has also helped the biggest collectors of customer data, such as Amazon, to retrofit subscriptions to existing customer choices. Amazon’s Subscribe and Save model invites users to select items they regularly reorder and put them on a monthly delivery schedule, with the added enticement of a 15 per cent discount on the usual price.Loyalty is one prize for companies that get subscription services right, even in industries usually associated with big one-off purchases. In 1996, General Motors launched OnStar, its in-car “service assistant”, which links live advisers and in-car computer systems, in the US.The idea was to create a separate stream of revenue from subscriptions that currently range from $19.99 to $34.99 a month (2015 buyers can connect their vehicles to a basic service for free for five years). Now OnStar is more about ensuring customers keep returning to GM vehicles. The group is about to introduce OnStar for its European passenger car. According to Dan Ammann, GM’s president, increasingly the important question is not how much metal can carmakers sell, but “who owns the customer relationship”.Author John Warrillow outlines nine subscription models. Here are four:The all-you-can-eat library: Apple Music or Spotify’s premium service, for example, offering unlimited access to a warehouse of tracks
The surprise box: “Curated goodies” shipped to your home monthly, such as cheese from the Artisanal Premium Cheese Club or five samples of deluxe beauty products from Birchbox
The peace-of-mind model: A form of insurance against something you care for — for instance, your car or your laptop, which LoJack will track for you
The simplifier: List managers, decluttering apps and services such as Hassle Free Home, to manage your mansionYet for many companies, shifting to a subscription model can be painful. A simple move from taking lump-sum payments upfront alters cash flow. To sustain a subscription model involves assessing what the lifetime value of customers, or groups of customers, is likely to be, and reviving some of the “direct marketers’ tricks”, Prof Fader says. One is “RFM analysis” — recency, frequency and monetary value: how recently and how often does the customer buy, and how much do they spend?Phil Libin, chief executive of Evernote, the online workplace productivity tool, recognises some of these pressures. Last month, Evernote introduced a tiered “good-better-best” approach to pricing, adding more features for higher subscriptions, after realising only 5 per cent of customers were using the premium version.Evernote’s most important insight was that customers were not choosing to use the basic service — they were defaul­ted automatically towards it. “Unless you took action, we never told you about the other version,” says Mr Libin. “When you go to a restaurant, there’s an expectation you are going to order something. You can sit there eating breadsticks, but at some point, you’re going to order. We were just letting people hang out.”So far, the Evernote transition to a three-tier subscription system seems to be paying off. But Mr Libin is under no illusions about how hard it will be to keep satisfying customers, preventing their defection to rival services or halting a slide back towards the free version (renamed Evernote Basic, to underline its bare-bones features).Greg Alvo, founder of OrderGroove, a subscription technology platform used by 80 brands (and advised by Prof Fad­er), says one pitfall of shifting to a subscription model is to focus only on the number of new subscribers rather than how to value and retain them, a mistake he equates to “pouring money into a leaky bucket”.Mr Warrillow says subscription businesses should aim to “change the consumer’s behaviour in that first 30 to 60 days”. Ron Adner, of Tuck School of Business, whose book The Wide Lens looks at how companies sustain the wider structure of relationships that make innovative business models successful, says the consumer has to think “I’m getting so much more than I used to”.Relying on customer inertia for re­newing the subscription is another weak strategy. As renewal dates approach, clever companies not only remind you to pay, they also push out an escalating series of messages reminding you to use the service. At the moment of renewal, the customer is more likely to remember why the subscription was useful.At the same time, as Ms Swift’s initial rejection of the new Apple Music contract shows, neglecting any part of the chain of interests involved in sustaining a subscription model can be dangerous.Prof Adner also warns that the proliferation of subscription offers could it­self create a problem. “I think there’s a household limit to how much you can possibly sign up for,” he says.But others believe that customers and businesses are only just appreciating the real value of the subscription model. OrderGroove’s Mr Alvo says the most successful subscription-based companies will simplify customers’ existing behaviour.He adds a word of warning, though, straight from the bad old days of direct marketing scams: “They have to be different from subscription services that lock you in and rip you off.”"
48;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2015-06-18T11:21:42Z;Former Google exec raises $10m to block the adblockers;Venture aims to help publishers prevent loss of ad revenue as tool moves into the mainstream;Ben Barokas, the entrepreneur who sold his advertising technology company Admeld to Google in 2011 for $400m, has launched a venture to help online publishers fight back against people who block ads.His new business, called Sourcepoint, is entering the market at a time of growing concern among online publishers that increased use of adblocking will undermine their business models.This month, Apple said it would allow iPhone users to block ads in its Safari web browser, in the latest indication that adblocking is moving into the mainstream. Sourcepoint estimates that as many as one in five online ads are blocked in the US and the ratio is higher in some European countries.“The publishers we’re working with recognise they’re facing an existential crisis,” said Mr Barokas, who is Sourcepoint’s chief executive.Mr Barokas said Sourcepoint has developed a range of technologies that give publishers “greater flexibility” in how they can make money from people visiting their websites. One such tool allows publishers to prevent people loading a site’s editorial content unless they also load the adverts. In other words, it blocks the blockers.“While users have the legal right to strip out the advertising from web pages, publishers also have the right to prevent users from accessing their content if they modify the web page,” Mr Barokas argued.As well as providing an adblocker blocker, Sourcepoint helps websites give visitors more control over the kinds of advertising they see. One option is a mechanism that lets users pay to eliminate the ads.So far, the New York-based company has raised $10m funding from investors including Spark Capital, Foundry Group, Greycroft and Accel Partners Europe.Internet services have seen advertising revenues soar as consumers turned to smartphones to access the web. But they are having to contend with a new threat: ad-blocking. Ravi Mattu discusses the trend with Robert Cookson.Mr Barokas, who previously held senior roles at Google and AOL, is one of the best-connected figures in the online advertising sector. His Sourcepoint team includes Brian Kane, former chief operating officer of LiveRail, the video ad platform acquired last year by Facebook, and Geir Magnusson, former chief technology officer of AppNexus, the ad tech group that is part owned by WPP.Ciaran O’Kane, chief executive of Exchange Wire, an analysis company, said: “Ben is a serious hitter in ad tech and he will get a lot of publishers signing up.” He added: “The biggest pain point for publishers at the moment is those pesky ad blockers.”Mr Barokas said Sourcepoint is already working with 22 publishers, but confidentiality agreements prevented him from naming them. He said that once Sourcepoint’s tools are integrated into a publisher’s computer servers, they enable the delivery of advertising from all the big intermediaries including Google’s DoubleClick platform.An increasing number of consumers use ad-blocking tools to view websites undisturbed by banners, pop-ups and other flashy graphics that they believe distract from editorial content. A study by Adobe and PageFair, which helps companies deal with ad-blocking, last year reported 70 per cent growth in the use of such technologies to an estimated 140m people – or 5 per cent of the online population.
49;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Adobe: SaaS without the mess;Cloud software need not be synonymous with losses;Software companies often use the idiosyncrasies of the subscription (as opposed to licensing) sales model as an excuse for falling sales or lack of profits — SAP and Salesforce come to mind. But the model itself is not the problem.Adobe reported record revenues in the most recent quarter. The company’s move from licences to subscriptions (software as a service or SaaS, in the jargon) was initially painful. Sales were flat between 2011 and 2014 because new subscriptions, paid over time, did not fully replace big upfront licence sales. But now the results are coming through. New subscriptions to Adobe’s “creative cloud” software rose 40 per cent in the most recent quarter, and annualised recurring revenue (a key metric for subscription companies) nearly doubled. Analysts expect that sales will rise 18 per cent this financial year — the fastest growth in five years. Software as a service need not be synonymous with losing money.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
50;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2015-04-28T12:01:51Z;Adblocking gladiatorial contest is unlikely to end well;Internet advertising inspires an almost visceral loathing, but how else are websites to be funded?;In the late 1980s I spent a large portion of my time being a walking billboard for Coca-Cola, quite unpaid. The Coca-Cola sweatshirt — a rugby-style top with the soft drink logo across the chest — was the height of fashion in my teenage peer group. It was the viral marketing campaign of its day. These shirts were worn with tight, acid-washed jeans and a Flock of Seagulls hairstyle that took about an hour — and half a bottle of hair gel — to create.It is one of those fashion trends that is incredibly difficult to explain to anyone under the age of 30, but it was recently ranked as the fourth greatest 1980s fashion trend, coming in below Vans trainers and neon colours, but higher than the boombox, the mullet haircut and Hawaiian print shorts.I don’t know whether the shirts made us drink any more Coke, but we didn’t mind the branding. I spent a not inconsiderable amount of my pocket money on one of these tops, thereby paying for the privilege of wearing advertising, surely a marketer’s dream.Only Apple, recently, has been as clever in co-opting consumers into its own marketing aims by cleverly positioning itself somewhere between computer software and hardware, designer trend and lifestyle brand.Internet advertising, on the other hand, inspires an almost visceral loathing. Read any online discussion about online ads and somewhere in the thread will be the plaintive cry: “Why, oh why, does the hated pre-roll ad always play flawlessly and then the actual video stutters, halts and buffers to the point where it is unwatchable?”Online ads have an unsavoury reputation. Hackers have been known to hide their malicious, computer-hijacking code in online adverts as a way of getting them into your computer. Users are also concerned about ads that are borderline spyware, tracking the pages we visit online and the purchases we make.At the very least, ads use up bandwidth and increase the time it takes to load a web page. If you are paying for your online data by the gigabyte on a 4G connection, downloading that unwanted advert adds to your costs.Internet services have seen advertising revenues soar as consumers turned to smartphones to access the web. But they are having to contend with a new threat: ad-blocking. Ravi Mattu discusses the trend with Robert Cookson.Little wonder that adblockers, software tools that prevent ads appearing on the web pages you are viewing, have become so popular. These are generally free to download, and are easy for even the tech illiterate to install. According to one survey some 144m people a month (4.9 per cent of all internet users) were regularly using an adblocker at the end of 2014.Online publishers are growing worried as adblocking takes an increasingly large chunk out of their advertising revenues.Publishers had hoped that eventually internet audiences would resign themselves to online ads in the same way they did to ads on TV and in newsprint, as a trade-off, a bitter pill that must be swallowed before we get to the good stuff.But a painless way of circumventing the “pill” has put paid to that patient approach. Millennials, those aged 18-34, are by far the heaviest adult users of adblockers, with 41 per cent of them using such software. The 13-17-year-old cohort coming up behind them are heavier users still. The adblock problem is only going to become worse for publishers.About 61 per cent of people surveyed by PageFair and Adobe said they wanted an ad-free internetNone of the solutions to the publishers’ quandary are convincing. Publishers have tried, for example, to offer paid-for, ad-free versions of their sites, but there has generally been little take-up. For example, some 61 per cent of people surveyed by ad-block tracking company PageFair and software provider Adobe wanted an ad-free internet, but 80 per cent were unwilling to pay for it. Such a response leaves little room for manoeuvre.Google, Amazon, and Microsoft were recently discovered to be quietly paying Adblock Plus, the maker of one of the most popular adblocking tools, to stop blocking ads on their sites. While this may be legal, the big question is do consumers want products, or even companies, that we think protect us from online ads to behave in such a fashion?There are also a number of start-ups, such as New York-based Secret Media, offering advertising encryption that can get around the ad blocking technology.And how long before adblockers adapt to block that kind of encryption too? It seems to be a gladiatorial contest that is unlikely to end well.Some online publishers, such as Reddit, thank those people who visit the site without ad blockers, a polite if somewhat passive-aggressive — and probably ineffectual — approach.Any lasting solution will surely have to involve a better sort of advertising — less obtrusive and perhaps offering some benefit rather than irritation to users — adding to bandwidth as opposed to using it up, enhancing the quality of a video rather than appearing to degrade it.Failing that, publishers may have to revive the branded sweatshirt.
51;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Adobe: clouding over;The company does not publish its renewal rate, showing the cloud business to be still, well, cloudy;Adobe is famous for giving birth to the PDF and Photoshop 25 years ago. These days the company is all about selling software subscriptions in the cloud: subscription sales were two-thirds of revenues in the last quarter, up from 40 per cent the prior year. The market seems overjoyed with Adobe’s transition to the cloud — shares trade at 35 times forward earnings today, up from 29 times two years ago.But the new business model is very different from the old one, which was based on selling one-time, perpetual licenses. Take 2011, the year before Adobe released its “creative cloud” subscription, as a baseline. Revenues then were on par with revenues in the past 12 months, but earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) were 70 per cent higher than today and earnings per share were nearly three times higher.Part of the reason is that in the cloud, the cost of goods sold can be higher (think of the data centre costs). General and administration expenses have also risen. Plus, average selling prices for software subscriptions tend to fall over time, so more subscriptions must be sold to keep revenues flat. Despite these challenges, Adobe’s revenues are expected to rise 17 per cent this year, according to S&P Capital IQ, as more users buy subscriptions to replace licenses that are now outdated. The company itself forecasts annual growth of about 20 per cent between 2014 and 2016.If that happens, Adobe’s progress in the cloud will be the envy of other mature software companies. But disclosure about the cloud business is still, well, cloudy. The company does not publish its churn (or renewal) rate, an important metric for any software subscription business. It also discloses billings, crucial for understanding growth, only once a year and does not break down the billings for product segments such as creative and marketing. To be taken seriously in the cloud, Adobe needs to start reporting like a cloud company, too.
52;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Monday interview: Shantanu Narayen, Adobe CEO;;"Successful tech companies rarely founder because they fail to see the next big disruptive shift coming. Instead, they wait too long to change course or, more often, are tied up by internal cultures and processes that make it hard to react.For Shantanu Narayen, chief executive of Adobe, one of the most prominent software companies built in the desktop era, the rise of cloud computing and the mobile internet could have been one of those moments.An Indian engineer with a strong analytical leaning, Mr Narayen did not underestimate the coming need for change. In the tech industry, he says, “if your business strategy is to preserve the status quo, it’s not a very compelling strategy”.Moving Adobe’s business to the cloud meant scrapping its old approach and switching to selling subscriptions for online access to software packages such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign: “When we did it, we were the first company to say we are not going to issue . . . packaged software, we were going to deliver software on the cloud.”But picking the right moment probably ended up being the easiest part. More challenging was the long slog of remaking a 12,000-employee company whose origins could be traced to the early days of personal computing.“The hardest part of it has been getting people internal to the company sometimes to see the vision,” says Mr Narayen: there was always a risk that what he calls “antibodies” in the system would kick in.There was also the humbling realisation that simply making a correct decision was not enough: “If there was something that I underestimated, it was how important communicating this is — over and over and over again. As a management team you can get used to it and you’re like, OK, we’ve decided: we’re going to burn the boats with regards to desktop software. You just assume everyone is going to follow.”As a long-serving insider who had worked his way up to the top through engineering, product management and head of operations roles, Mr Narayen had a good understanding of what made Adobe tick when the time came to overhaul the maker of Flash and Acrobat.Born May 27, 1963Education Bachelors degree, electronics engineering at Osmania University, India; Masters degree, computer science, Bowling Green State University; MBA, Haas School of BusinessCareer

From annual revenue growth of more than 20 per cent a year, Adobe went into a sharp reversal, with an 18 per cent drop in 2009, before recovering. By 2011, it was time to consider a more radical move.“We had an idea our business was beginning to stagnate,” says Chuck Geschke, who co-founded the company in 1982 and is still co-chairman. “We weren’t speaking to a big enough audience. These markets were becoming saturated.”The markets, in Adobe’s case, in­volved selling software to designers and other “creative professionals”. Like Microsoft’s Office, its Creative Suite package of applications had become a standard tool for use on PCs and Macs.According to Mr Narayen, who was paid $16m in Adobe’s 2013 fiscal year, the significance of the cloud did not stem from the chance to simply deliver the same product to the same customers in a different way.“The lens that you use to look at your opportunities will determine how aspirational you’ll be or how ambitious you are,” he says. “It was one of those go-big moments.”The potential he saw came in two parts. One was to extend Adobe’s market: not just give designers the tools to create digital content but help them manage it, make money out of it and measure how it is being used — an entire “workflow” that took Adobe into new areas such as digital marketing, where it came up against leaders in the enterprise software business like IBM.His second push has been to turn Adobe into an online platform that creative types might think of turning to for almost anything connected with their work, from buying digital content (Adobe recently acquired photo marketplace Fotolia) to finding a place to show off their personal portfolio or look for a new job (something that has led it to start a talent search business).Moves like these may sound obvious in the abstract. But change means forcing workers to grapple with uncertainty before the outline becomes clear.“My job is to set goals where people say they can’t quite connect the dots yet, because if you do it’s probably not aspirational enough,” says Mr Narayen. Though he describes his natural management style as collaborative, pushing other people out of their comfort zones has required a deliberate effort, “appearing to feel I’m always unhappy with what happens”.The lens that you use to look at your opportunities will determine how aspirational you’ll be or how ambitious you areBorn in India to a family of engineers, he followed a well-worn path for his generation, becoming interested in computing at college in India before coming to the US for postgraduate computer science and business degrees. “There’s an Indian community that’s vibrant and thriving,” he says of Silicon Valley. “We attribute a lot of that to the importance of education that we all grew up with.”He puts his first exposure to leadership skills down to an education modelled closely on the British public (that is, private) school system in Hyderabad. But he also has the immigrant’s appreciation of his adopted home — the immense opportunity of Silicon Valley (where he moved to live with an older brother working in the chip industry).Convincing both Wall Street investors and Adobe’s own employees that change was both necessary and desirable took a whole new set of management skills.A large part of the job involved resetting expectations. Much rested on the outcome of a key analyst meeting in 2011, in which every word was carefully honed. “It was really important for us to communicate to the financial community where we were going.”In particular, the shift to the cloud meant switching from upfront software sales to continuing subscriptions, something that was guaranteed to hurt reported revenue in the short term.In 2014, Adobe’s annual revenues were still lower than they had been at the time of the pivotal analyst meeting — but its stock price has climbed 165 per cent, compared to a 65 per cent advance in wider share prices. The group now has a market capitalisation of about $40bn.Convincing workers took more abrupt action. Shutting down businesses that no longer matched Adobe’s strategy, for instance, had a salutary effect. “That sent a message in the company that change was afoot.”A series of significant acquisitions changed the group too. Making such deals work, says Mr Narayen, “comes down to individuals and sponsorship” — making executives personally responsible for deals they champion. The head of Adobe’s digital marketing business took on “a lot of heavy lifting” with the 2013 purchase of Neolane, for instance.Resetting targets, internally and externally, was critical. As Mr Narayen puts it: “Are you inspecting where you think you’re going?”Along with relegating revenue growth as a measure of performance, that meant adding new measures of customer satisfaction to the incentive plans of all employees, such as the amount of time the company’s systems were available.And then there was the communication. “What it required, honestly, was an incredible amount of travel,” he says. “People would joke about how often they heard me, and others in the management team, constantly reiterating what was going on.”In the end, though, there was no substitute for the power of repetition — or of wearing out the shoe leather.Second opinion: eBay’s CEOJohn Donahoe, eBay CEO, has acted as a sounding board on strategy for Shantanu Narayen. He talks of Mr Narayen’s deliberative style and “steeliness” once a decision is made.“He’s a quiet person, he leads with his actions rather than his words. He’s not a guy with a huge ego, but he has a lot of pride,” he adds.Mr Narayen’s resolve was tested when Steve Jobs criticised Adobe’s Flash technology. “He doesn’t get distracted or intimidated,” says Mr Donahoe."

Creative Cloud subscriptions have risen by more than 2m this year.Adobe also announced it would buy a royalty-free stock photography company, Fotolia, for $800m, which the company said would be integrated into Creative Cloud so that users could buy photos, graphics and videos.The acquisition would “add a vibrant marketplace for our customers”, and “reinforce Creative Cloud’s role as the pre-eminent destination for creatives”, said Shantanu Narayen, chief executive.Shares in Adobe have risen 26 per cent this year, outpacing the Nasdaq technology sector index, as strong earnings results have prompted analysts to lift price targets.Bank of America raised its target price for Adobe from $80 to $90 on Friday, citing a “very strong” fourth quarter and higher than expected Creative Cloud subscriptions. RBC Capital and FBR Capital Markets also raised their price targets.34 centsAdobe’s fourth-quarter profits, adjusting for certain items, rose to 34 cents a share, topping Wall Street forecasts of 30 cents.HortonWorks, a big data start-up company spun off by Yahoo in 2011, raised $100m in an initial public offering on Friday. HortonWorks sells support services for Hadoop, an open source software platform to store and analyse vast amounts of data, which was developed by Yahoo in the 2000s.The California-based company was priced at $16 a share, exceeding analyst expectations, and valuing the company at $1bn. Shares in HortonWorks rallied nearly 65 per cent to $26.38 by the close in New York.Camera maker GoPro was upgraded from “neutral” to “overweight” by JPMorgan, which attributed the move to “positive catalysts” including strong fourth-quarter results, holiday season demand and expansion into international markets.Shares in GoPro rose 4.5 per cent to $62.63 at one stage on Friday, although the California-based company, which makes wearable cameras often used in action sports videos, has seen volatile swings in its stock price since its IPO earlier this year. They closed at $60.52, up 0.78 per cent.GoPro shares climbed 30 per cent on its debut in June, and rose more than 100 per cent the week after. But the stock has slid back more than 15 per cent since November 10, after a secondary offering that priced its shares at $75 a piece, or 15 per cent lower than its stock price at the time.RadioShack shares closed more than 3 per cent down after the struggling electronics retailer posted its 11th straight loss and announced plans to cut costs by $400m.RadioShack reported a net loss of $1.58 a share, or $161m, in the third quarter ending on November 1, from $135.9m a year ago. The company’s stock has fallen 83 per cent this year as losses continue to increase and investors question the viability of a turnround.Steep declines in oil prices continued to weigh on the energy sector with the S&P 500 energy index down 2.14 per cent, dragging down the benchmark indices.The stresses on the industry were evident, as Ivanhoe Energy, a Canadian oil and gas company, became the latest to show signs of trouble. It said it was exploring the sale of the company due to “going concern” issues, and warned that it could default on an interest payment of $1.8m due on December 31. Shares in Ivanhoe plunged more than 40 per cent on Friday, to 60c, taking its drop in value this year to 90 per cent.Overall, US equity markets pulled back on Friday amid enduring anxiety over oil prices.The S&P 500 fell 1.62 per cent to 2,002.33, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.79 per cent at 17,280.83.

A couple of weeks ago we had the opportunity to visit tech companies in Seattle and Silicon Valley. I was surprised by the number of companies we could visit. UCLA Anderson and on-campus High Tech Business Club (HTBA) did a great job organising this trek of more than 150 students. Below is snapshot of my tech trek week.Friday 11/14Left for Seattle immediately after 12:45 pm class. Completed economics and accounting homework during travel.Saturday 11/15, Sunday 11/16Had lunch with Anderson alums in Microsoft and Amazon then visited the Space Needle, the Microsoft Bellevue office, Pike Place Market and the Discovery Park. Spent an evening researching the latest developments in companies I will be visiting.Monday 11/17Amazon visit was in downtown Seattle. We were fortunate that it did not rain during our stay. According to a weather company, Seattle has 226 cloudy days per year. Our visit included a tour and panel discussion to learn about different MBA roles, work culture and recruitment process.After Amazon, we visited Nordstrom to learn about their ecommerce operations and see their first retail store. Also attended an alumni and student mixer in the evening to meet alums in a more informal setting.Tuesday 11/18Activities were organised for us in the Microsoft headquarters, which is in Redmond, WA. Left for San Francisco late evening.Wednesday 11/19 – Sunday 11/23The Silicon Valley visit was great but exhaustive. We were visiting at least two companies every day spread across San Francisco and the Bay area. I personally visited Adobe, Rocketfuel, LinkedIn, Yahoo, SonyPS, Twitter, Google and Autodesk. We had around 28 companies to choose from, ranging from a $350bn company like Google to hot start-ups such as Box and Shazam.On Thursday, we had a large alumni mixer called the Anderson Evening. The event was held at The Winery San Francisco and speakers included Google’s Darren Pleasance (’95) and Tapjoy’s Steven Wadsworth (’88).Spent the weekend catching up with old friends in the Bay area and doing touristy things such as visiting the Golden Gate Bridge. Boarded the last flight on Sunday to Los Angeles, completing my stats homework on the way.Please send any questions, comments, start-up pitches and travel tips via the comments box below.

55;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T17:34:00+0000;US retailers eye sales rebound;Strong Cyber Monday start after weekend slip;US retailers were banking on record Cyber Monday spending to make up for a worse than expected sales slip over the Thanksgiving weekend, after extended store hours and early online deals failed to provide a boost to shopper traffic.Adobe said Cyber Monday was off to a strong start, with sales worth $719m taking place between midnight and 10am ET. The 17 per cent increase on last year’s figures was driven by lower prices earlier in the morning and more mobile shopping than expected, with 26 per cent of all purchases being made on smart phones or tablets.However, the National Retail Federation estimated on Sunday that combined in-store and online sales over the four-day Thanksgiving weekend tumbled 11 per cent to $50.9bn, down from $57.4bn last year.Matthew Shay, NRF chief executive, said that increasing numbers of US consumers were choosing to avoid the crowds, and were browsing and waiting for better discounts later in the season. Discounting had begun as early as November 1.“Shoppers are very savvy and deals-focused. From here on in its going to be a dogfight between retailers in a very challenging environment. Every day until Christmas will be Black Friday, every minute a Cyber Monday,” he said.This year has been defined by sharp shifts in consumer spending patterns towards online, including an increase in shoppers using smartphones to make purchases, or buying items online before collecting them in stores. Since November 1 shoppers have spent $22.7bn online, up 15 per cent from a year earlier, according to ComScore, including more than $1.5bn on Black Friday.But the number of shoppers expected to spend on Cyber Monday was still projected to decline. The NRF estimated that 127m shoppers – or 52 per cent of all US consumers – would make an online purchase on Cyber Monday, slipping from 132m last year. Average online basket spends are also falling, with the average consumer who shopped over the weekend spending $159.55 at online retailers, down 10.2 per cent from last year.This has not stopped retailers betting big on what they tout as the biggest online shopping day of the year, with sales expected to hit $2.6bn.Amazon began offering deals on Saturday. Target said it experienced more than a 40 per cent increase in online orders and sales on Thanksgiving, while Walmart had its highest three-day stretch of online traffic and orders from Thursday through to Saturday.Walmart started its so-called Cyber Week on November 29. It said that it would hold back some of its best deals until the evening, after finding that a fifth of all shoppers felt they had to wait until evening in order to plan around their work schedules.Analysts believe that retailers are right to adapt their tactics to fit around the needs and demands of consumers.“The winners and losers of Cyber Monday this year will be defined by those who have invested in their online operations, be it targeted emails, personalised deals and greater attention to their mobile platforms. As apps get more advanced and screens get larger, sales conversions are soaring and this will only continue,” said Calvin Silva, senior retail analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services.
56;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2014-10-21T10:35:23Z;Nielsen launches system to measure online audiences;Advertising and media companies have been calling for better data on digital usage;Nielsen, the measurement company whose television ratings underpin billions of dollars in advertising sales, is rolling out a new system that aims to become the standard currency for pricing digital content.Media companies and advertisers have been pushing for better data on digital audiences as more media consumption happens online and more programming is delivered over the internet.Last week, CBS, the US TV broadcaster, and HBO, the cable network, both announced plans to sell streaming services directly to consumers. In CBS’s case, this “over the top” programming will carry advertising that analysts said could be an important source of revenue for the company.Advertisers have been hesitant to shift big portions of their budgets to digital outlets in part because of concerns over measuring and valuing audiences across a proliferation of platforms and devices.“The way consumers watch video is changing really fast but the measurement hasn’t caught up,” said Brian Hughes of Magna Global, Interpublic’s ad buying and research group.Nielsen is partnering with software group Adobe to capture viewers across websites, mobile apps, internet-connected televisions and gaming consoles.“Media companies will have the ability to better plan and monetise their inventory. Marketers will also be able to better plan their advertising buys,” said Lynda Clarizio, Nielsen’s president of US media.US adults spend more time using digital media than any other kind – an average of five hours and 46 minutes a day, ahead of the four hours and 34 minutes they spend watching traditional television, according to eMarketer, the research group. Multi-tasking can produce an overlap between the figures.But TV advertising still dominates marketers’ budgets, accounting for $68.5bn, or 38 per cent of total US media spending this year, compared with $50.7bn, or a 28 per cent share, for digital ads.In order for advertisers to feel comfortable buying over-the-top spots, they need to know what the audience is, but they also need to feel there is a really trustworthy currency“In order for advertisers to feel comfortable buying over-the-top spots, they need to know what the audience is, but they also need to feel there is a really trustworthy currency,” said Melissa Webster, digital media analyst at IDC, the research group. “The big fear is they’re overpaying.”The digital ratings system will be available next year. Initial clients include Disney’s ESPN, Sony Pictures Television, Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting, Univision and Viacom.“There is tremendous value in understanding how people are consuming content,” said Eric Berger, executive vice-president for digital networks at Sony Pictures Television and general manager of Crackle, Sony’s online video network.During this autumn’s TV season, Nielsen has for the first time started to include mobile viewing in its ratings measurements but only if the streaming shows contain the exact same ads that appear in the traditional broadcast.Establishing a digital ratings system will allow programmers to experiment with different kinds of advertising in their online streams, said Ms Webster.“Even if we’re watching the same programme, you and I might see very different ads, not just based off demographics and where we live, but who we are, what we have bought before and also potentially what else we’re doing when we browse [the internet],” she said.Such “dynamic ad insertion” may lift prices for digital video spots and boost advertising demand over the long term, said Anthony DiClemente, media analyst at Nomura.Nielsen’s announcement on Tuesday followed a mishap for the company earlier this month when it said an error in its system meant it had reported inaccurate ratings for some national broadcast networks since March.
57;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2014-08-09T01:45:55Z;Judge tells of Silicon Valley ‘fear’ of Steve Jobs;;A US judge on Friday offered a behind-the-scenes look at the force of will with which Steve Jobs once held sway over Silicon Valley, as she threw out a proposed settlement of a lawsuit against Apple and three other tech companies.The class action case had been brought on behalf of more than 64,000 tech workers over alleged collusion between the Silicon Valley companies not to poach each other’s staff.“There is compelling evidence that Steve Jobs . . . was a, if not the, central figure in the alleged conspiracy,” Judge Lucy Koh wrote as she rejected a $324.5m settlement.In all, seven tech companies have faced charges that they agreed not to poach each others’ workers, though three of them have already settled.According to Judge Koh, the series of secret pacts began when Mr Jobs reached a no-poaching deal for Pixar, the animation studio he controlled, with George Lucas, head of Lucasfilm.That became the model for agreements with other companies, with “fear of and deference to” Mr Jobs a big reason for the willingness of others to join in the alleged conspiracy, the judge added.The mood was summed up by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who was quoted as saying: “I think Mr Jobs’ view was that people shouldn’t piss him off. And I think that things that pissed him off were – would be hiring, you know – whatever.”Among those to buckle to Mr Jobs’ personal demands was Adobe chief executive Bruce Chizen, who first proposed a limited no-hiring deal covering only junior staff before bowing to pressure not to approach any Apple employees.Google, meanwhile, made a “public spectacle” out of terminating one of its recruiters within an hour of Mr Jobs complaining that the recruiter had approached an Apple employee. When Eric Schmidt, Google’s chairman, emailed Mr Jobs to tell him about the firing and to apologise, the Apple co-founder passed his email on to another Apple executive with a simple emoticon, “:)”.At Mr Jobs’ insistence Google even backed off hiring three engineers who had already left Apple, according to Judge Koh, leading the internet search company to drop its plans to open a Paris engineering centre.I think Mr Jobs’ view was that people shouldn’t piss him off. And I think that things that pissed him off were – would be hiring, you know – whateverEd Colligan, chief executive of rival smartphone maker Palm, was singled out on Friday for having stood up to Mr Jobs’ bullying. He wrote to the then-CEO of Apple that a no-poaching agreement between the two companies would be “not only wrong, it is likely illegal”. He also called Mr Jobs “out of line” for threatening a patent lawsuit in response to Palm’s hiring of a single Apple employee.Mr Jobs wrote back pointing out “the asymmetry in the financial resources of our respective companies” when it came to the costs of legal action, concluding: “My advice is to take a look at our patent portfolio before you make a final decision here.”Another company to resist the spread of no-hiring agreements in Silicon Valley was Facebook, which refused a Google call for a hiring “ceasefire” at a time when it was growing rapidly and trying to poach top engineering talent. The rejection prompted Google to revisit its pay practices, leading to an immediate 10 per cent across-the-board increase in salaries and $1,000 bonuses for all staff.Besides Mr Jobs, the “key players in creating and enforcing the anti-solicitation agreements” were Mr Schmidt and Bill Campbell, the former boss of Intuit and an Apple director and Google adviser, Judge Koh wrote.Potential damages in the case, should it go to trial, could reach $9bn, given the automatic trebling of any award in an antitrust case. Instead, the four companies – Apple, Google, Adobe and Intel – negotiated a settlement totalling $324.5m, up to $82.5m of which would go to plaintiffs’ attorneys in fees and costs.Judge Koh said the amount “falls below the range of reasonableness” given what the plaintiffs could hope to achieve at trial, and that the offer should have been “at least $380m”. Workers covered by the settlement would have received less than those in the earlier case – involving Pixar, Lucasfilm and Intuit – even though their legal position had strengthened considerably since then, she added.A spokesperson for Apple could not immediately be reached for comment, while Google refused to comment.
58;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;LinkedIn boss is wrong about poaching rivals’ employees;Most leaders will authorise all available methods, from money to menaces, to keep their best staff;"In the 1970s you could buy a hippy-ish poster of a bird flying towards a lurid sunset, with the maxim: “If you love something, set it free: if it comes back to you, it’s yours; if it doesn’t, it was never meant to be.” I assumed the slogan had expired along with a taste for joss sticks and tie-dye T-shirts. I am amazed to find it has instead become a formal human resources policy.I blame Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, the business network. He has fleshed out his self-serving manifesto for “managing talent in a networked age” into a slim book, The Alliance. It is full of examples of how companies now arrange loose, short-term “tours of duty” with staff, actively encouraging them to saunter off to other employers, on the basis that everyone will eventually benefit.When I criticised Mr Hoffman for promoting potentially unhealthy career promiscuity last year, two groups of critics took issue with me. One group said LinkedIn’s chairman was merely acknowledging reality. After all, a survey of emerging leaders by London Business School recently revealed that nearly 40 per cent of this younger generation start new jobs already planning their next role. A tiny minority expects life-long careers at the same employer.A second, more cynical bunch of critics pointed out that as companies had not exactly shown much fidelity to their employees, they could hardly blame staff for selfishly pursuing their own interests.But while consultancies and other professional services groups may have an interest in seeing their alumni move on to become potential clients, elsewhere competitive juices stimulated in the normal course of business can quickly turn to bile.Most leaders will authorise all available methods, from money to menaces, to catch and cling on to their best staff – even in California, where the “set them free” slogan probably originated.“Non-compete” clauses are virtually unenforceable in Silicon Valley. They stifle mobility and creativity, according to the Kauffman Foundation, an entrepreneurship think-tank. But the market for software engineers is febrile, so employers turn to other ploys to curb job-hopping. Some 64,000 engineers have sued Google, Apple, Intel and Adobe Systems for forming a different type of alliance – to stop the companies poaching each other’s staff. The companies themselves (plus Intuit and Pixar) settled a Department of Justice lawsuit in 2010, ruling out further such agreements. A judge is deciding whether to approve the $324m settlement in a civil suit between the ex-employees and the companies. (Intuit and Pixar settled earlier.)Along the way, some interesting email exchanges have come to light. In 2007 the late Steve Jobs emailed a smiley-face emoticon to one of his HR executives after learning from Eric Schmidt, then Google’s chief executive, that the search engine company had terminated a recruiter for trying to headhunt an Apple engineer. Another 2007 exchange shows Google once had a policy of making counter-offers within an hour to staff approached by Facebook (which was not part of any pact).Employment lawyers outside California say employers are generally more relaxed about defections than they were 10 years ago. But in high-stakes cases they have “a lot more desire to be difficult”, says John Evason at Baker & McKenzie in London. “It can be quite personal sometimes,” he adds.A US arbitration panel has just ruled that BGC Partners should compensate competitor Tullett Prebon in a dispute over a 2009 “raid” (Tullett’s word) that led to 80 interdealer brokers switching employer. BGC claims its rival has spent more fighting the case than it has won back.Under threat, companies are armouring contracts with tougher non-solicitation clauses and upping the caratage of golden handcuffs for senior staff. After Angela Ahrendts quit Burberry for a job at Apple, with a stock grant of up to $68m, the fashion company’s board approved a £20m deal for Christopher Bailey, her successor, to stop him potentially jumping to a rival. Burberry shareholders rejected the package.Leaders are increasingly expected to grit their teeth and smile when executives quit for rivals. Some even claim it is a compliment that their highly trained stars are in demand elsewhere. But most managers are still likely to treat poaching as an almighty pain in the neck, not a feather in their cap. It should be no surprise if they act to prevent the practice, rather than letting it all hang out, 1970s-style.andrew.hill@ft.com

59;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2014-07-22T17:23:10Z;Digital engagement and the market of one;Personalisation is putting marketing bosses in the IT driver’s seat, write Deloitte’s Eric Openshaw and Christine Cutten;"In 2011, global software company Adobe had one of the most visited sites on the internet with more than 35m unique visitors per week. However, the company was not benefiting. Customers were directed elsewhere to purchase products, and visitors’ experiences depended entirely on their ability to navigate the screens.Then Adobe built an integrated marketing and ecommerce site that could personalise product recommendations, promotions and content for each customer based on past actions and purchases, navigation profile and context, for example the customer’s physical location and device, such as smartphone or in-store kiosk, they are using.The results? By 2013, Adobe’s online revenue had increased 39 per cent. Checkout conversions increased 16 per cent, with a 48 per cent increase in lead conversion and increased revenue per visit, according to Deloitte Tech Trends 2014.Whether a company’s products and services are digitally based or not, direct interaction with customers is increasing, across platforms both digital and physical. And customers are increasingly willing to surrender more information to companies they choose, but they expect relevant and useful content, products and services in return.After years of talking about monetising data, the relatively low cost of data capture, storage and analytics combined with the multi-platform, mobile experience of consumers and enterprise customers has finally provided both more data and the ability to do something valuable with it.The Deloitte Digital Democracy Survey found that 37 per cent of US consumers own a smartphone, tablet and laptop and increasingly rely on mobile devices and social networks for engaging with brands. If you factor in wearables and other connected objects emerging from the “internet of things” ecosystem (for example, retail beacons), the picture for digital engagement becomes even more complex.On one hand, this challenges marketing to deliver the seamless, yet platform-appropriate experience that customers expect. On the other hand, this constant interaction across multiple devices also provides rich contextual data – the how, where and when of interactions – which opens the door for revenue opportunities. These range from personalised products, sales and support to new revenue from customer insights that identify needs or from aggregating data and insights for other business partners.Could data from a fitness band, for example, be used to generate more relevant recommendations and offers to specific individuals – i.e., a personal marketing channel – or would aggregate data from a population of fitness bands be useful to a healthcare organisation or could retail or product companies glean useful insight from activity data combined with financial services data?Certainly sales and marketing have been at the forefront of digital engagement, but the opportunities, and pitfalls, for digital engagement extend across the enterprise. Consumers expect more than a brand presence on social media, and evolving tools create more opportunities to derive value. Companies can improve customer satisfaction, recommendations and sales by making the experience more useful, relevant and appropriate to the individual.For example, media consumers expect a seamless transition from where they left off a television programme or novel on a tablet to when they access the content on a smartphone. Delivering a seamless experience and contextual awareness for other parts of the customer lifecycle – for example, personalising customer support – can improve loyalty and create additional cross-sell opportunities.Doing so may create a competitive advantage, especially for customer experiences viewed as painful – consider how a large telecom company used a “tweet to care” framework to create a customer-centric model to be more proactive and responsive. An advantage now, customers may soon demand this type of engagement.The marketing organisation alone cannot shift an entire company from focusing on markets to understanding and meeting the unique needs and expectations of individuals. “Managing a user’s attention and transferring context across devices require a multidisciplinary approach to exploration and prototyping,” says Soleio Cuervo, head of design for cloud-storage company Dropbox.Uncovering and capitalising on the potential revenue streams from the interaction data will require even more collaboration. The challenge is that many, but not all, interactions fall under the purview of the chief marketing officer (CMO), and many CMOs lack the depth or scope of expertise to manage the technology and navigate the risks and privacy issues.The enterprise, then, must strike a balance between the evolving roles of the CMO and chief information officer (CIO) in an environment where direct-to-customer interactions are continuous. Marketing’s IT footprint has grown bigger as data collection and customer analytics become core to many businesses.Two years ago, Gartner predicted that the CMO would spend more on IT than the CIO by 2017. Already much of the marketing technology spend occurs outside IT as marketing organisations piece together external vendors and cloud-based services to create, localise, manage and analyse customer experiences. Needs change so quickly that efforts are duplicated, and IT is often not consulted for fear of slowing new initiatives down.The answer will not be stricter controls or policing between the CIO and CMO, but a new level of collaboration, putting business needs first. To deliver on customer expectations, marketing organisations, in collaboration with IT and others, are going to have to ramp up to a higher level than ever.What do you think? Who will own the personalised, integrated customer experience across platforms and lifecycle? Can the CIO and CMO roles remain separate?

It reported earnings of $2.46 per diluted share on revenues of $11.8bn. Analysts expected EPS of $2.36 on revenues of $11.66bn.FedEx’s shares closed up 6.16 per cent at $148.95.Company executives raised their economic forecasts for 2015. They now project US GDP growth of 3.1 per cent in 2015, compared to 3 per cent previously, and global GDP to rise 3.1 per cent.Wall Street economists on average expect US GDP to climb 3 per cent in 2015 compared to a year earlier.On a call with analysts, executive vice-president T Michael Glenn said: “The global economy is recovering from the first-quarter setback in the US and slowdown in China and should steadily improve.”Shares in BlackBerry were just under 3 per cent higher to end at $8.29 after Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette said BlackBerry’s new management would probably preserve asset value and balance sheet flexibility.Mr Faucette expects chief executive John Chen to scale back operations soon and quickly improve cash flow, adding that he believed the stock had a fair value of between $6 and $8.“The company’s business clearly continues to deteriorate and we expect that the company will be compelled to expand its expense cutting programmes as our forecasts don’t anticipate that new products will gain meaningful traction,” Mr Faucette said.Shares in Express Scripts fell 2.23 per cent to $68.29 following news that its chief executive, George Paz, had sold about 26 per cent of his holdings.The shares were sold on Friday for $48m and were part of an investment diversification strategy, the company said.Wall Street’s main indices closed slightly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.58 per cent to 16,906.62; the S&P 500 was up 0.77 per cent to 1,956.98 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.59 per cent higher to end the day at 4,362.84."
61;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Digital advances drive functions together and lift IT spending;"Ecommerce, analytics and mobile apps are forcing CIOs and CMOs to co-operate; with interview of the two executives in these respective roles at Vail Resorts";"Marketing and IT may have their differences, but they have a growing amount in common, too. Both suffered budget cuts during the recession, with their activities seen as optional, rather than essential.“Both functions are [considered] discretionary spending,” says Jennifer Beck, a vice-president at Gartner, the technology analysts. “People think: if the numbers don’t look good, let’s cut IT and marketing.”More recently, both areas have seen renewed growth. Spending by marketing departments on technology – from apps to social media and “big data” – is one of the fastest-growing areas of corporate technology. But much, if not most, of it is being managed outside the IT department.This has led to suggestions by analysts that the chief marketing officer will spend more on technology than the chief information officer.Projections by Gartner suggest this point will be reached by 2017, although as Ms Beck points out, this does not mean that the CMO will be taking over the CIO’s role. The jobs are, and are likely to remain, very different.“The CMO is a very creative function, despite the fact that it has become more data driven, but CIOs like a more disciplined approach,” she says. “CMOs and digital marketers are big risk takers, and digital technology allows them to take greater risks, for example by experimenting in social media.”Other analysts suggest, though, that while marketing technology spending is growing rapidly, it is doing so from a low base. “CMO tech spending is 0.1 per cent to 0.3 per cent of revenue, against an IT budget of 2 to 3 per cent of revenue. It is growing, but would have to grow very quickly to make up that difference,” cautions Shvetank Shah, executive director at CEB, the business advisory group.“It is a myth that CMOs want to run IT,” he adds. “What CMOs are interested in, is rapid experimentation.” Marketers want to test ideas, and hand those that work on to other departments, such as IT, sales, or operations, to scale up and run.Nonetheless, marketing now accounts for some of IT’s largest projects. Anita Chandraker, head of IT delivery at PA Consulting Group, says: “With the rise of digital channels, a lot of marketing-led IT spend is identifying customer needs, and predicting what customers are going to do.”Adobe, the creative software company, now spends more on digital than any other form of marketing, and not just because the company also makes digital marketing tools, says Ann Lewnes, chief marketing officer.“At Adobe, 74 per cent of our marketing spend is on digital,” she says. “Last year, our second largest IT programme was our marketing programme,” notes Gerri Martin-Flickinger, CIO.IT involvement, though, is essential if marketing projects are to be effective.Five years ago, Thomson Reuters’ intellectual property and science division introduced a marketing automation platform. Rather than relying just on an email system, the software brings together online activity as well as email responses and leads from events such as trade shows.“It transforms how we are doing marketing. We can communicate more efficiently, and effectively,” says Kim Yeatman, director, marketing operations.As critical is the way the marketing system integrates with other business software, especially the company’s customer relationship management (CRM) application.“Our platform synchronises data with CRM, which is maintained by the technology team. It is a two-way sync. CRM is the system of record,” says Ms Yeatman.It is analytics and ecommerce, however, that are really driving marketing and IT closer together. CMOs and their teams might be comfortable developing mobile apps, or managing social media and content marketing, but these are often discrete areas of operations.Once systems start to share data with core business applications, as they will if they want to draw on operational data, projects are far more likely to need the support of IT.Some mobile apps, too, fall into this category: mobile apps may have started as purely promotional, or as a shop window. But if they involve mobile shopping, or mobile banking, then operations, IT, security – and for physical goods, the supply chain – will need to be involved. This is something marketing is unlikely to be able to support on its own.And analytics projects will, inevitably, need access to business data, as well as offering the potential to pass data back to other business systems.“We are looking at big data, in terms of being able to bring in disparate data sources, and give tools [to marketing] to turn that into useful information,” says Jolyon Ingham, CIO of building supplies company Grafton Group, and a member of the Corporate IT Forum Advisory Group.“In terms of what marketing is looking for: analytics is the key. It’s about driving that capability . . . I do see marketing and IT working more closely together.”This is prompting marketing departments to become more technically-minded, but also IT to become more familiar with the tools that marketing departments need to use.“It does change what IT does,” says Brian Whipple, global head of Accenture Interactive. “The marketing and sales technology that exists today is still fragmented. There are fewer people on the IT side who have grown up with this technology; a lot of folk in IT are not familiar with marketing tools. These have grown up on the CMO side.”But, he says, IT will “skill up” to meet the demand.What matters less, though, is who owns the budget; in fact, digital initiatives are now so important to many businesses that funds are allocated at board level. Even where they are not, marketing and IT are increasingly likely to pool resources.“Who pays is not important. It is how the programme helps our customers, or helps our sales,” says Adobe’s Ms Lewnes.——————————————-Vail Resorts: Marketing and IT chiefs learn to ski in tandemAt Vail Resorts, chief marketing officer Kirsten Lynch is proud of the job her team does telling potential customers about the holidays the US ski resort company offers, writes Jessica Twentyman.“But it’s so much more powerful when our guests tell their own family and friends what a fabulous time they’ve had at our resorts,” she says.Increasingly, she adds, they do that through social media, so over the three years she has been at Vail Resorts, she has worked regularly with Robert Urwiler, chief information officer, to launch a string of digital services designed to help guests make the most of their vacation.“We tend not to look at our work as a series of projects that require input from both marketing and IT,” says Ms Lynch. “It’s more about working together on an ongoing basis to address the company’s strategic priorities.”Says Mr Urwiler: “What makes this relationship work is that we both respect each other’s domain, and each other’s expertise within that domain – but we don’t stick to rigid boundaries in our discussions.“We’re not at all shy in weighing in with our opinions on each other’s issues, challenges and opportunities.”Perhaps the most visible manifestation of their joint efforts is Vail Resorts’ web and mobile application, EpicMix. First launched in time for the 2010-11 ski season, EpicMix uses RFID (radio frequency identification) chips, embedded in season passes and daily tickets, to track skiers’ and snowboarders’ progress around the company’s 10 US resorts.By collecting data through hand-scanning and automatic readers at turnstiles, ski lifts and on ski runs, EpicMix feeds back data to guests through their own, personalised portal, so they can see the number of vertical feet they have skied on a given day and the chairlifts they have ridden. They can also earn points and medals for their achievements on the slopes.But more importantly, guests can opt to share this information with friends and family on Facebook and Twitter, along with photos of themselves in action, taken by Vail Resorts photographers located on the slopes, who identify them via their individual RFID chip.EpicMix has been a big hit with the young and digitally-savvy audience of skiers and snowboarders who visit Vail Resorts each year, says Mr Urwiler. “That makes it fun for us, but it’s also a challenge, because this audience does have high expectations and regularly interacts with other high-end brands all over the planet.” By the end of every ski season, he says, he and Ms Lynch are already hard at work on enhancements to EpicMix for the next season.For the 2013-14 season, for example, they introduced EpicMix Academy, which enables learners – both children and adults – who attend Vail Resorts classes to track their progress as certified by the company’s ski-school instructors.“The reason Kirsten and I are here, working together, is not to maintain the status quo, but to keep pushing the envelope,” says Mr Urwiler.“I think some chief information officers tend to think of problems as technical issues.“My advice to them is to get to build a personal connection with the chief marketing officer and get to understand new business opportunities.“Build a consensus on what success might look like for your company.”Ms Lynch agrees: “Part of the strength of our relationship as chief marketing officer and chief information officer is that at the heart of everything we do and discuss is not a reaction to the latest technologies, but an understanding of the services that we hope our guests will use and enjoy.”"
62;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2014-04-24T21:04:52Z;Tech groups settle lawsuit over hiring pacts;;Google, Apple, Intel and Adobe have settled a lawsuit with tens of thousands of employees who accused the technology companies of anti-competitive behaviour by agreeing not to poach each others’ staff.It means the companies have seen off the threat of a courtroom battle by settling out of court with the 64,000 claimants on undisclosed terms.The employees had sought up to $3bn in damages and this settlement follows agreements reached last year with Lucasfilm, the production company founded by Star Wars director George Lucas, Pixar and software maker Intuit for a total of $20m. The case was set to begin at the end of May.In a letter to the judge, the honourable Lucy H Koh of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, lawyers for both sides said they had settled “all individual and class claims” and would present the principal terms of the settlement to the court on May 27 2014.The civil case follows a probe by the Department of Justice which culminated in the technology and film-making companies promising to eschew blanket deals not to poach staff for the next five years.In 2009, federal authorities started investigating claims that such deals are a form of price-fixing in the market for labour, which artificially depresses wages for employees. The technology companies have been growing fast in a market where there are not enough software engineers or other technical staff to meet demand.Kelly Dermody, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, said it had settled the case where they charged that “these companies violated federal antitrust laws by conspiring for years to suppress the pay of technical, creative and research and development employees, including by agreeing not to actively recruit each other’s employees”.“This is an excellent resolution of the case that will benefit class members. We look forward to presenting it to the court and making the terms available,” Ms Dermody said.
63;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2014-04-23T02:33:20Z;Activist investor Jeff Ubben urges ‘fix’ for Silicon Valley;;One of the West Coast’s leading activist investors has added to the growing criticism of corporate governance in Silicon Valley, and of Google in particular, amid fresh warnings of a bubble in tech valuations.Jeff Ubben, whose hedge fund ValueAct is an investor in Microsoft, eBay and Adobe Systems, singled out what he said was excessive compensation for Eric Schmidt, Google’s chairman.“Jamie Dimon [chairman of JPMorgan Chase] gets hauled over the coals in New York for his $20m, but Eric Schmidt presides over four board meetings and gets paid $100m,” he said, referring to the Google chairman’s 2011 package.David Einhorn, the activist investor behind Greenlight Capital who has taken on Silicon Valley companies such as Apple in recent years, warned on Tuesday that excessive enthusiasm about “cool kid companies” had created a new bubble in tech valuations to rival the late 1990s.Speaking at the Active-Passive Investor Summit in New York on Tuesday, Mr Ubben said: “We’ve got to fix tech.”Silicon Valley’s approach to shareholder rights and to pay put it out of line with governance practices elsewhere in corporate America, Mr Ubben said.Companies such as Facebook and LinkedIn have floated on the stock market with dual classes of shares that give founders and early investors greater voting rights and therefore power. The tech industry says the protections are necessary to guard against the short-term demands of some shareholders, which might include activists.Google has come in for particular criticism after last month introducing a third share class with no voting power at all, further entrenching the power of Mr Schmidt and the search group’s two founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin.The governance structure holds the “seeds” of problems for shareholders in the future, Mr Ubben said. “What comes out of Google 10 years from now is probably dysfunctional.”Google declined to comment.Jesse Cohn, head of US equity activism at Elliott Management, said that weak corporate governance would itself attract activism.“Tech still remains a club, where the view is ‘We’re different from other boards, we can have clubby boards.’ For us, that is an opportunity.”Greenlight Capital said in one of its regular letters to investors: “Now there is a clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years. What is uncertain is how much further the bubble can expand, and what might pop it. In our view the current bubble is an echo of the previous tech bubble, but with fewer large capitalisation stocks and much less public enthusiasm.”Tech companies’ rejection of “conventional valuation methods” in favour of “eyeballs” or price-to-sales ratios, and “huge first day IPO pops for companies that have done little more than use the right buzzwords and attract the right venture capital”, were signs that the bubble was “pretty far along”, Greenlight wrote.Tech still remains a club, where the view is ‘We’re different from other boards, we can have clubby boards.’ For us, that is an opportunityHaving held off shorting stocks that were “disconnected from traditional valuation methods”, Mr Einhorn said he had now created a group of unnamed “high-flying momentum stocks” dubbed “The Bubble Basket”, which he believes could lose at least 90 per cent of their value.“While we aren’t predicting a complete repeat of the collapse, history illustrates that there is enough potential downside in these names to justify the risk of shorting them,” Greenlight said.The Active-Passive Summit brought together numerous activist investors and their advisers to discuss the rising power of these hedge funds, and their differing strategies for winning returns.Where some activists argue for short-term increases in share buybacks or financial re-engineering, particularly at cash-rich companies such as those in the tech sector, ValueAct is among those that typically hold stakes for many years, place a representative on the board and help to nurture a new management team. At Microsoft, the fund contributed to the retirement of Steve Ballmer as chief executive last year.Mr Schmidt received $101m in total compensation in 2011, the year he stepped down as chief executive to become executive chairman, including a $55.6m stock award that vests over several years.His $1.25m salary, bonus of $6m and another $11.4m in stock awards, plus $708,196 in “other compensation” that includes life assurance premiums and personal use of company aircraft, took his total compensation last year to $19.3m.Google’s annual report to investors says that equity compensation ensures a “long-term focus”. Its estimate of the value of Mr Schmidt’s unvested stock options and Google stock units stood at $63.3m at the end of 2013.
64;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Facebook to report strong 2013 despite talk of demise;;The week after academics compared Facebook to an epidemic that will be wiped out almost as quickly as it spread, the social network looks poised to report strong earnings and revenue growth for 2013.It was the year in which Facebook proved wrong the investors who worried it could be knocked over by the shift to mobile. Since the middle of last year, Facebook shares have soared more than 90 per cent, as it reported much better than expected results in the second and third quarters, on the back of mobile advertising.Analysts are, on average, forecasting revenue to rise further, by almost 50 per cent year on year to $7.6bn, and non-GAAP earnings to soar 58.5 per cent to 84 cents for the full year 2013.The group will report its earnings on Wednesday after the close of the market.Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst at Adobe Digital Index, which gathers data on how marketers use social media, said the traffic recorded showed Facebook had record high click-through rates in the fourth quarter.“Facebook had its best quarter ever,” she said, and the number of advertisements clicked on rose 125 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter.But 2013 was also the year where it became fashionable to predict the social network’s demise.First, an acknowledgment that the number of younger teenagers on the site was falling wiped $16bn off the company’s market capitalisation at its third-quarter earnings.Then, the company’s failed $3bn bid for Snapchat was read widely as an effort to lure back the young.And last week a study from Princeton deployed techniques from epidemiology – and comparisons with MySpace – to argue that as Facebook trended down in Google search results, it could lose 80 per cent of its users within three years.The study was criticised because many people reach Facebook through other means such as apps, or by going directly to the website. Mike Develin, a Facebook data scientist, dismissed it by saying that if he used the same scientific principle “correlation equals causation” he could prove Princeton was dying.The Adobe index does not diagnose Facebook as sick but it does point to symptoms that could indicate trouble beyond this quarter, as it struggles to sustain the growth rates of last year.“Facebook might be slowing down in the first quarter, second quarter timeframe – it might not be as good as previous quarters,” Ms Gaffney said.Growth in the click-through rate stalled in the fourth quarter, according to the Adobe Digital Index, after an “exponential growth curve” in the third quarter, she added.Facebook remains by far the largest social network, but others are gaining share. Twitter’s share of referred visits to advertisers’ websites was up 125 per cent year on year, while Facebook’s has fallen 15 per cent.
65;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2014-01-17T18:26:47Z;Costs of Target’s cyber attack have finally hit home;Attacks are on the rise but many companies remain complacent;When the US retailer Target announced that millions of customers’ data had been stolen in a cyber attack last month, I was only vaguely interested, despite being an occasional shopper at the low-price chain. Security breaches are always in the news these days and nothing much seems to have come from the hacking of either LinkedIn or Adobe – although I dutifully changed my passwords, as instructed, after each of those attacks.But, this week, when Target followed up with an email warning that my details were among the 70m stolen, the potential risks hit home. After taking Target up on its offer of a year of free credit monitoring, I learnt from Experian that I have a store card account that has not been used since 2006. I cannot tell from the name what store is involved, so I am not sure how to cancel it. If the cyber fraudsters who have my details figure out how to exploit this, they could be in the money.It has left me feeling remarkably crabby about Target’s lack of security – and, apparently, I am not the only one. The retailer has said it expects like-for-like sales for the quarter containing Christmas to be down 2.5 per cent from a year ago, and has cut its forecasts because some customers seem to be staying away. For retailers, cyber security has finally moved from the “nice to have” category to “essential”, and other industries may soon find they have to follow.In 2013, cyber attacks rose 14 per cent year on year and expanded beyond traditional targets, such as banks and retailers, according to new figures from Cisco. Industries as diverse as pharmaceuticals, electronics and energy all saw more than fivefold increases in the malicious software targeted at their computer systems.This week, the UK government hinted as to what some of the attackers may be after. Ministers warned companies conducting mergers and acquisitions to be particularly careful about cyber security, because electronic sharing of data could make them vulnerable to attack. A string of insider dealing cases has made clear it is possible to make big money with just a few minutes of advance warning about a deal or a profit warning. The secret performance data that is routinely shared as part of M&A talks could be a trader’s treasure trove.Professional services firms are also vulnerable to what Kroll, the security firm, calls “financially motivated hacking” because so much confidential information passes through their email servers.Some groups are beginning to wake up to the risks. AIG, the big US insurer, says that sales of “cyber insurance” surged by a third last year over 2012. But far too many remain complacent – an Experian survey last year found that only 31 per cent of US companies are insured against a cyber attack. Only two-thirds of big companies surveyed by Kroll said they were investing in internet security, even though three-quarters acknowledged being vulnerable to hacking.Target has already counted the cost in lost sales and alienated shoppers. Which unwary company is going to be next on the list?brooke.masters@ft.com
66;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Looming EU rule change could spur insurance take-up;Change ‘is designed to force companies to take data protection seriously’;For almost a decade, many US companies have used cyber-liability insurance to help manage the risk of attacks from hackers. The insurance can cover the cost of dealing with a security breach, as well claims from third parties, such as customers who have suffered damage as a result. By contrast, far fewer European companies actually offer – or take out – cyber-insurance.That could be about to change, as Europe edges closer to ensuring mandatory reporting of security breaches and larger penalties for those who fail to protect their customers’ data from risk of theft.The recent attack on Adobe, the software maker, in which hackers stole encrypted passwords of up to 150m active users, highlights the scale of the threat to companies.In the UK, for example, 93 per cent of large organisations suffered cybersecurity breaches in 2012, according to the Department for Business Innovation and Skills. “In total, the cost to UK plc of security breaches is of the order of billions of pounds per annum – it’s roughly tripled over the past year,” the department said in a report this year.Small businesses are increasingly being targeted, with 87 per cent attacked last year.Use of cyber-insurance has also risen sharply as companies look for ways to manage the risk of security breaches. Marsh, the international insurance broker, says the number of companies buying cyber-insurance jumped 33 per cent from 2011 to 2012. However, the broker says the insurance cover is primarily used by companies in the US, or by companies that operate across the globe.Bob Parisi, global network security and privacy practice leader at Marsh, says: “The lesser uptake outside the US is due almost entirely to the fact that, with a handful of exceptions, the European Union, Asia and the Middle East do not have the same security breach notification laws.“That’s been one of the principal drivers of cyber-liability insurance in the US,” he says. “I can almost look to the day back in 2005 when we started to see the spike. After 2005-06, when we started to see the breach notification laws start in California and work their way east across the country . . . that’s when we started to see a very aggressive uptick in the coverage.”In October, however, the European parliamentary committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs backed a new data protection regulation package. The reform is regarded by many as long overdue as it is designed to replace the European Data Protection Directive, introduced in 1995, before the widespread commercialisation of the web.The new regulation has still to be adopted by the European parliament, and the committee’s support may be seen as the latest move in negotiations between interested parties such as the European Commission, the council of ministers and the European parliament.Nevertheless, some experts believe it could have a significant impact on the way companies deal with the risk from cyber-attacks.Provisions include fines of up to €100m ($138m) or 5 per cent of worldwide annual turnover for the worst security breaches, as well as mandatory notification of breaches.The regulation could also have more power than the 1995 directive.“When the directive was adopted, every country took a slightly different approach in introducing it with its own legislation,” explains James Castro-Edwards, a solicitor at PwC Legal, part of the professional services firm. “The UK’s version, for example, was the Data Protection Act. The new regulation doesn’t need to be enacted by local legislation and is designed to put in place a level playing field across Europe so that there will be less variation in how it is applied.”“A lot of what is contained in the regulation is not substantially different from the directive, but it is more prescriptive,” Mr Castro-Edwards adds. “Much of it is already considered to be best practice among companies, but there will be some who don’t comply, and the fine will force them to do so or risk a big financial penalty.”Could the regulation be Europe’s “2005 moment” for cyber-insurance? “The EU regulatory environment is different to the US,” says Mr Parisi at Marsh. “The EU seems more concerned with the usage of information, whereas US is more concerned with what happens if information gets disclosed – who we punish when we spill the milk.”But he says that assuming the final regulation is not substantially watered down, more European companies may turn to cyber-insurance.Latika Sharma, a partner at PwC Legal, says: “It’s not so much that the rules will change but it will have a bigger impact on companies because of the fine. It’s designed to force all companies to take data protection seriously.”Mr Parisi echoes the point: “Risk managers have been aware of the need to take action,” he says. “But now the folks waking up to it are the C-suite – the board and senior officers are recognising the risks from technology and asking risk managers about [insurance]. It’s no longer a niche product.”
67;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Share prices are rarely hit hard by cyber attacks;;Investors take it in their stride when companies are breached by cyber attacks in incidents that nine times out of 10 have a relatively minor impact on their share prices, according to new research.Faced with evidence that shareholders appear relatively unperturbed by these new online security risks, regulators are likely to renew efforts to persuade them to take cyber threats more seriously.In the UK, government intelligence agents have recently held meetings with large institutional investors to emphasise that cyber security should be a greater corporate priority.Research by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer shows that in only a quarter of cases did the company’s share price fall by more than 1 per cent immediately after a cyber security breach was revealed. The share price fell by more than 2 per cent during the first trading day in only one in 10 instances.Even so, the cumulative total wiped off market capitalisation on the first post-announcement day’s trading reached $53bn, for cyber attacks from the beginning of 2011 to the end of April this year.After five days’ trading, the average dip in share price values was merely 0.26 per cent, with only 12 out of the 135 cases falling more than 5 per cent.Jane Jenkins, Freshfields partner, said the muted share price reaction to attacks was particularly striking given the widespread harm that cyber crime can cause.“Cyber security breaches can leave a company struggling to manage the fallout on many fronts: loss of competitor advantage, interruption of business operations, impact on revenue and reputational damage,” she said.She added that investors’ apparently casual attitude towards cyber attacks might be a sign that they did not fully appreciate the dangers that a company may face if crucial information was stolen.“If financial directors are struggling to compute the risks and put a value on a company’s information, how can investors be expected to do so, given the information is not available to them?”According to the study, Sony reported six cyber attacks but suffered an immediate share price dip of more than 2 per cent only once – in March last year.Signs that investors are generally not too worried by announcements of cyber attacks were apparent earlier in October when Adobe, the group behind the Acrobat document reader, said that 2.9m customer accounts and its source code had been compromised. The share price closed only 1.4 per cent down on the first day, and regained its previous levels in two weeks.And even when Adobe revealed on Wednesday that the breach was much wider than initially reported, its shares fell only slightly more than the market in early trading.The steepest one-day share price fall detailed in the Freshfields study occurred when Global Payments said in March 2012 that up to 1.5m card numbers in North America might have been stolen in a security breach. The group, which processes credit and debit card transactions, saw its shares fall more than 9 per cent on the first trading day after it revealed the attack.
68;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Adobe says 38m customers hit by cyber security breach;;Adobe said on Wednesday that the extent of a major cyber security breach it suffered this summer was much wider than first reported.The company behind Photoshop and the widely used Acrobat document reader said for the first time that hackers stole the encrypted passwords of about 38m active users.At the beginning of this month, when news of the breach emerged, Adobe said only that credit card details of 2.9m customers were compromised, and the source code behind some of its most popular programs was stolen.The software maker said it had contacted the affected active users to urge them to change their passwords. It has also reset IDs for inactive account holders.The breach, among the worst infiltrations of its kind in almost 10 years, is believed to have happened in mid-August and was discovered last month. Adobe and US federal authorities are investigating the attack, which was traced to two US-based servers but could have originated outside the country. Adobe said it had no indication so far that there was any unauthorised activity using stolen Adobe IDs and the passwords had been encrypted.Adobe said its investigation now indicated that a portion of the source code for the popular Adobe Photoshop program had been accessed, as well as code behind products such as Acrobat, Reader and Cold Fusion.Security analysts have warned that the loss of the source code behind such popular programs, used on everything from PCs to smartphones, could unleash a wave of global attacks targeting vulnerabilities in the software to enter users’ devices. One said it was the largest reported theft of source code in almost 10 years, since Microsoft was hacked in 2004.Once inside, hackers can harvest personal information and intellectual property stored on the devices, which can then be sold on the black market.Hackers usually spend a lot of time using trial and error to discover previously unspotted weaknesses in programs, called “zero days”, which they then manipulate to gain access.But having the source code, effectively a blueprint of the program, to examine makes the process much easier. The more popular the program is, the more computers the hackers could access and so the higher the price of the code on the black market. Adobe is a prime target because its Reader software is widely used across the world.Shares in Adobe fell 0.7 per cent in early trading in New York, slightly more than the wider market.
69;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Hacking of Adobe source code raises fears of cyber attacks;;The hacking of source code used by Adobe has raised fears of a wave of global attacks targeting personal and financial data held on devices from PCs to smartphones.In what could be the worst infiltration of its kind in almost 10 years, the software maker revealed last week that cybercriminals had snatched the code behind some of its most popular programs.The hackers infiltrated computers behind the Acrobat document reader, stealing the encrypted credit card details of 2.9m customers and the source code behind programs including one that opens PDFs.Armed with the code, criminals could spot vulnerabilities in the software and manipulate them to hack users’ machines, harvesting personal information and intellectual property that can be sold on the black market.Alex Holden, of Hold Security, who alongside security journalist Brian Krebs helped uncover the crime, warned it could unleash a new generation of attacks.“This is big news. If their source code is compromised, everyone is affected,” he said.Hackers work “in the dark”, painstakingly trying hundreds of possibilities to find vulnerabilities, but they will now be able to “discover countless ways to exploit the source code”.The attack was the worst breach of source code security since Microsoft had program code stolen in 2004, he added.Adobe and US federal authorities are investigating the hack, which was traced to two US-based servers but could have originated outside the country. The California-based group started investigating the breach on September 17 and now believe the code was likely taken around August 14.The company said it was doing everything it could to mitigate the potential risk to customers, including resetting passwords and notifying people whose credit or debit card information may have been compromised.Adobe said the account data were encrypted, so the hackers should not have been able to read it.Brad Arkin, Adobe’s chief security officer, said the company had made a “dramatic” investment to change Adobe Reader in 2010, which had significantly reduced the number of attacks on the software.Even with the source code, the hackers would have to exploit a whole series of vulnerabilities to get in and once they enter, it is now more difficult to infect other areas of someone’s computer, he said.We’re seeing breaches happening more often these days and breaches are getting bigger in terms of magnitude of what’s being stolenThe company is a prime target because its reader software is widely used across the world on devices from PCs to smartphones.The market for weaknesses that a company does not know about or has not fixed – called “zero days” – has grown in recent years, enabling people without computer expertise to buy easy to use hacks.Dan Hubbard, from security company Open DNS, said a zero day could fetch anywhere between $50 and high six figures depending on how many devices it could affect.It is hard to calculate the value of the leak of the code behind a popular program such as Adobe Reader, but it could fetch considerably more, he said.“We don’t really know who out there has the code – it is typically going to be exchanged, sold or traded and not just sit in the hands of the people who got it.”The Adobe hack is the latest sign that it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep the hackers out of corporate IT networks, according to Eric Chiu, from cloud security company HyTrust.Companies have to assume the “bad guy” is already inside the system, and by restricting what data each employee can access limit the damage a criminal can do, he said.“We’re seeing breaches happening more often these days and breaches are getting bigger in terms of magnitude of what’s being stolen.“There is a new era where attackers are trying to get to the crown jewels of the company using sophisticated attacks to steal credentials and access sensitive customer information and source codes,” he added.This article has been amended since original publication to correct possible location of attack and the date when Adobe now believes it was carried out
70;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Adobe says 3m accounts hit in cyber breach;;Adobe, the company behind the widely used Acrobat document reader, has owned up to a devastating cybersecurity breach that experts said could lead to the unleashing of a wave of new online attacks.The California-based company on Thursday revealed that it had been the target of one of the most damaging attacks to hit a big software company. Approximately 2.9m customer accounts had been compromised and part of the source code that underlies its products stolen, Adobe said in a statement.The theft of source code could make it possible for hackers to break into the systems of individuals and companies that use Adobe’s software, raising the spectre of new attacks, according to experts. Besides making the Acrobat PDF reader, Adobe software is widely used in the design and digital media industries.“Effectively, this breach may have opened a gateway for a new generation of viruses, malware and exploits,” Hold Security wrote in a blog post when news of the intrusions was revealed. Hold said that, along with computer security journalist Brian Krebs, it had been the first to identify that the company’s source code had been taken, adding that it had reported the theft to Adobe.According to the software company, the details stolen for 2.9m of its customers included their names, encrypted information about their credit or debit cards, the expiry dates and “other information about customer orders”. It added that it did not believe “at this time” that any decrypted payment information had been taken, but stopped short of issuing a blanket assurance.In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, Adobe said: “We do not believe that the attacks will have a material adverse impact on our business or financial results.” However, it added that they “could have various adverse effects”.Brad Arkin, Adobe’s chief security officer, said the company had no evidence of attacks related to the theft. “Based on our findings to date, we are not aware of any specific increased risk to customers as a result of this incident,” he wrote on a company blog.Adobe also said an undisclosed number of customers had their passwords stolen and that it would notify those concerned after resetting their accounts.The company had been investigating the breach since the middle of August but only discovered the severity of the problem a week ago, according to the security researchers who discovered the source code theft.The problem came to light after “a massive 40 GB source code trove” was found on the server of criminals believed to have been involved in earlier attacks, Mr Krebs said.The source code that appeared to have been accessed illegally included Acrobat and ColdFusion, which is used for building and running internet applications, along with other unspecified products, the company said. It added: “Based on our findings to date, we are not aware of any specific increased risk to customers as a result of this incident.”
71;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Adobe: a dream deferred;Focus on the cash flow statement of the US software business;"When Adobe Systems switched to selling software subscriptions instead of licences, investors knew that its revenue would take a hit for the first few years. No matter. As a “cloud” or “SaaS” provider of graphics software, Adobe could count on the halo above those buzzwords to cushion the drop in profits. Sure enough, quarterly results have sagged. And as predicted, investors love the transformation and have sent Adobe’s shares up 60 per cent over the past year.Investors appreciate that Adobe’s business is now more predictable and that in time it will grow again. But they also know the business is in better shape than it would appear. The old Adobe software licence was “perpetual”. The customer pays (a lot) up front for a box of software that they are free to use forever. Upgrades are released every few years, of course, but those require another hefty outlay.The “software as a service” (SaaS) model delivers programmes over the internet for a monthly fee; subscribers receive free updates as soon as they are ready. Over the average life of a subscription, revenue should be greater than under the perpetual model. For example, Microsoft’s Office cloud option costs $8 per month. The perpetual licence for Office costs $180 up front, and Microsoft estimates that customers update it every five to seven years. That same $180 comes in less than two years under the cloud model.At Adobe, third-quarter net income fell 60 per cent, but cash from operations was only down 18 per cent since deferred revenue – which has been received but not recognised on the P&L – was worth $35m. Only a fraction of the deferred revenue comes from the Photoshop/Acrobat side. Most subscription revenue there is booked as the cash arrives. But Adobe’s fast-growing web analytics business gets most of its cash up front. A nice hedge to have while the subscription business takes hold.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

The week’s gains put the S&P up 4.7 per cent through the first 15 trading sessions of September.BlackBerry shares closed the week with a steep drop, off 17.1 per cent to $8.73 on Friday after the company announced that it would cut 4,500 jobs and would badly miss second-quarter earnings expectations.The rally was led by cyclical areas that investors favour during stronger economic times, with the industrials sector up 1.9 per cent and financials better by 1.6 per cent. However, utilities, considered a defensive sector due to its stable stock prices and high dividends, was among the best performers, up 1.8 per cent.Safeway was the S&P’s strongest stock on the week, up 11.4 per cent to $31.40 after launching a “poison pill” plan after learning that a hedge fund had built up a significant stock position in the company.FedEx added 8.9 per cent to $116.83 per cent on the week on news that the company has endured a sluggish global economy by improving margins. The effort produced better than expected earnings for the parcel delivery service.Home Depot was also among the best stocks on the Dow, up 2.5 per cent to $77.00 for the week after investors bid up the stock during Wednesday’s rally.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also touched record highs during Wednesday’s rally, but declined during the ensuing two days to give back those gains and a bit more.The Dow closed the week up 0.5 per cent to 15,451.09.The blue-chip index was led by Boeing, which added 4.8 per cent to $116.63 on news that the company’s F-15 Silent Eagle was the leading contender for a $7.7bn contract with South Korea.JC Penney endured another difficult week, as shares fell 6.2 per cent to $12.96.

FireEye also enjoyed its debut, up 80 per cent to $36.00.Restaurant operator Darden was among the worst performers on Friday, off 7.1 per cent to $45.78. The company said fist-quarter earnings were down 37 per cent, which fell below expectations.The week’s rally extended what had already been a strong September, but left analysts wondering what exactly the Fed is waiting for before tapering its quantitative easing programme.Mike Sorrentino, chief strategist of Global Financial Private Capital, said attempts to predict when QE would begin to wind down were futile, and investors would be wise to focus on the brighter long-term picture.“To me a lot of this is turning into a guessing game,” he said. “I don't think Ben Bernanke’s wife even knows when tapering is going to happen.”The equity perspective beyond QE, however, is strong, Mr Sorrentino said, with opportunities in high growth sectors.“From our perspective, the economy is looking good; not great, but good . . . Right now, in the short term it looks a little expensive, but long term we see a cyclical bullish story,” he said. “We see potential for GDP growth going forward, albeit it’s going to take a lot to get going. Slow and steady wins the race here, but that’s driving our preference for equities.”"

74;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2013-09-12T14:58:25Z;Adobe shows its creativity with Ireland tax base;;"Adobe Systems is a pioneer in creativity. Since the 1980s its software has facilitated a desktop publishing revolution. What is less well-known is that its creativity extends to its tax structure, which enables the US software company to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars in corporate taxes every year.By establishing two companies registered in low-tax Ireland, Adobe slashed its tax bill on $2.1bn profits earned outside the US over the three years to the end of December 2012 to $144m, giving it an effective tax rate of 6.9 per cent. During this period the company paid $527.1m in US federal taxes on $1bn in profits – an effective tax rate of 52 per cent.Adobe is one of hundreds of technology and pharmaceutical companies, including Apple, Google and Abbott Laboratories, which funnel non-US sales through Ireland to cut their tax bills. Controversy over these tax avoidance strategies has prompted the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to call for an overhaul of global tax rules.“Ireland is not a ‘pure’ tax haven in the classic sense but has many of the features of a tax haven,” says James Stewart, associate professor of finance at Trinity College Dublin. “These features are low corporation tax rates; ease of incorporation; relatively light touch regulation; and tax and other legislation that is very responsive to the needs of multinationals.”A central link in Adobe’s complex tax structure can be tracked to a glass-fronted building in Dublin, which is the registered office of Adobe Software Trading Company Limited and subsidiaries (ASTC) and a sister company Adobe Software Systems Ireland (ASSI).ASSI licenses and distributes Adobe software to non-North American markets while ASTC is the intermediary holding company for a host of Adobe subsidiaries based in Europe, Africa, and the Asia Pacific regions. This structure enables Adobe to consolidate most foreign sales through its low tax Irish company, which acts as a distributor of Adobe’s software products.ASTC generated turnover of €2.3bn and made a pre-tax profit of €540.6m in the 52 weeks to December 2 2011, according to the company’s most recent filing at Ireland’s companies office. It paid €3.09m in Irish corporation tax, which accrued on profits made by its Irish subsidiary, and a further €18.8m in corporation tax to other foreign jurisdictions.The ability of companies such as Adobe to generate business in relatively high tax countries without establishing a tax base – known as a ‘permanent establishment’ or PE – is an issue of concern for the OECD. The organisation is calling for the rules on PE to be tightened up as part of its wider overhaul of tax rules, arguing that taxes should be paid in the jurisdiction where economic activity takes place.A Dutch initiative to crack down on tax avoidance by multinational corporations is being fiercely resisted by the business community, with the American Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands warning it could drive US corporations to move their European headquarters out of the country.The Netherlands, Ireland and Luxembourg are facing a European Commission inquiry over tax practices that critics say allow multinationals to lower their tax bills by billions of euros. This month the Netherlands responded to rising criticism with a plan to tighten conditions for so-called letterbox companies, shell companies that multinationals establish largely for tax purposes.[Continue reading]A recent investigation of the top 50 US technology companies by Reuters found 37 of them used PE structures to avoid tax. For example, Google paid only £3.4m in UK tax in 2011, based on services it provided to other companies in the group. Profits on $4.9bn of sales to UK customers were made in Ireland, where the company says the sales are transacted.The development of the internet, which operates across borders, has made these types of tax avoidance structures more easily deployed by companies as transactions can be struck over technology platforms based in low tax regimes, such as Ireland, Luxembourg or Switzerland.“All companies seek to structure their operations in the most efficient way,” says Michael Ryan, a tax expert at law firm McCann Fitzgerald.“Where permanent establishment can assist is that the company is only taxable on the profits of the PE and if these profits only relate to some small element of the company’s business, the amount upon which they will pay tax may not be that great,” he says.But even paying Ireland’s comparatively low 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate proves too costly for some companies, which have devised additional tax avoidance schemes with colourful names such as the “ Double Irish” to further cut their tax bills.The “Double Irish” relies on multinationals setting up two Irish companies, one of which owns the valuable intellectual property central to its products. The first company is tax resident in Ireland and pays royalties to the second company for use of the IP, which generates expenses that reduce the amount of Irish tax it pays. The second company, which is incorporated in Ireland but not tax resident in the country, collects the royalties in a tax haven, thereby avoiding Irish taxes.“Typically the IP holding company earns much of the profits as it owns the valuable IP. A much smaller amount of profits is earned in countries with sales activity,” says Peter Vale, tax expert at Grant Thornton.The “Double Irish” scheme takes advantage of a loophole in Irish law, which enables companies to be registered in Ireland without being tax resident in the country. This allows Google to hold its IP in an Irish company that is tax resident in Bermuda, which has a zero rate of corporate tax. LinkedIn, the world’s biggest professional-networking website, holds its IP in an Irish company that is tax resident in the Isle of Man, which also has zero rate of corporate tax.Adobe believes in a fair system of taxation that allows governments to enact tax laws and treaties for the needs of their peopleThe accounts of Adobe’s Irish holding company ASTC state that the company is “not subject to Irish corporation tax”. But they do not reveal where the company is tax resident, though the presence of a Bermuda-based lawyer on its board suggests it may be on the Caribbean island.“Adobe pays the lawful amount of tax owed in the countries where we do business,” said the company in a statement to the FT.“Adobe believes in a fair system of taxation that allows governments to enact tax laws and treaties that provide for the needs of their people. Like individual taxpayers, other large companies, and small businesses around the world, Adobe pays the taxes owed under the law. By distributing our capital throughout our global operations, we are able to invest more of our earnings back into jobs, capital for acquisitions, and new product enhancements.”However, global pressure on corporate tax avoidance is mounting as the OECD and tax fairness campaigners claim the practice places small- and medium-sized businesses at a competitive disadvantage to multinationals and robs developing countries of vital revenue.“It is often the poorest countries that suffer the greatest losses due to tax abuse,” says Claire Godfrey, Oxfam’s senior policy adviser on tax. “The current situation is unfair and requires urgent reform”."
75;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Adobe: cloudy outlook;Software group pushes monthly-fee package but is still reliant on its old licence model;"Will consumers buy software the way they buy their magazines? Adobe’s latest quarterly results suggests they will.Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is not a new concept for corporate buyers, especially cash-strapped small and medium-sized enterprises, as the success of Salesforce.com demonstrates. But individuals and businesses with just a handful of employees can now take advantage as well, with Microsoft offering Office, and Adobe serving its package of Photoshop and other design software (called “Creative Cloud”), for a monthly fee.The old model was selling a “perpetual licence”. Users bought boxed software and used it forever, or until they wanted to upgrade (or were compelled to do so). With a subscription, the user pays less up front – Adobe is charging $50/month versus $750 for the box – and has immediate access to updates. For Adobe, a stable revenue stream replaces the boom and bust cycle of new product releases.In the short term, the arithmetic around switching models is difficult. As users switched from licences to subscriptions, Adobe’s first quarter revenue came in at $1bn, ahead of expectations, but still down 4 per cent from last year. And earnings per share, according to analyst consensus, will not reach 2012 levels until 2015. But the market is focused more on operating statistics around the transition.Creative Cloud now has almost 500,000 subscribers, up nearly 50 per cent from the fourth quarter. The company expects to reach 1.25m subscribers by year end. This implies $700m in annualised recurring revenue. Not bad; but Adobe, with $4bn in sales, still leans heavily on perpetual licences and its digital marketing business. With the stock up 30 per cent over the past year, investors looking for more upside will need to make sure they look beyond the clouds.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
76;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2013-03-19T23:35:00Z;Apple poaches Adobe cloud expert;;Apple has poached Adobe’s chief technology officer, Kevin Lynch, an expert in cloud computing and long-time champion of the Flash software that Steve Jobs blocked from the iPhone, stoking a row between the two companies.Mr Lynch joined Adobe, the maker of software and cloud services for marketers, designers and developers such as Photoshop and SiteCatalyst, in 2005 when it acquired Macromedia, creator of Flash, where he was its chief software architect.Adobe said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that he had resigned, effective this Friday, to “pursue other opportunities”. An Apple spokesman said Mr Lynch will be vice-president of technology, reporting to Bob Mansfield, who leads the iPhone maker’s wireless and semiconductor development.Mr Mansfield’s technologies division was created last October when Apple undertook its biggest management reshuffle in years, including the departure of iPhone software chief Scott Forstall, after the fumbled launch of its Maps application in iOS 6.Mr Lynch’s profile page on LinkedIn, the professional networking site, describes his role at Adobe as shaping its “long-term technology vision”, working in “multiscreen, cloud and social computing”.His appointment comes at a time when Apple is still working to improve its suite of internet services, including Siri, its voice-activated virtual assistant, and its iCloud content syncing system, which are widely seen as weaker than equivalent apps from its chief mobile platform rival, Google.However, Apple’s campaign to banish from mobile devices Adobe’s Flash technology, which is widely used in PC web browsers for online animations, has been more successful. Mr Jobs, Apple’s late co-founder, was savage in his criticism of Flash when the iPhone launched, arguing that it was flawed and drained battery life.Adobe abandoned Flash for mobile devices in 2011 as developers looked to apps to deliver their services on smartphones. However, before that, in interviews with the FT and others, Mr Lynch had been one of Adobe’s most prominent defenders of the technology. In February 2010, he argued in a company blogpost that Flash was vital for the web’s “productivity and expressiveness” and that blocking it in favour of other web development languages threatened to send digital video “back to the dark ages”.He was also critical of Apple’s tight control over the iPhone’s App Store, arguing that the “model of open access has proven to be more effective in the long term than a walled approach, where a manufacturer tries to determine what users are able to see or approves and disapproves individual content and applications”.Adobe said it would not replace Mr Lynch’s role as CTO. News of his hiring was first reported by CNBC.
77;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2012-10-19T18:11:14Z;Retouched for the very first time;Years before Photoshop, images were being manipulated and enhanced, as a new exhibition reveals;"Image alteration – or “retouching” – has transcended the pages of glossy magazines to become a political issue. Earlier this year protesters gathered at Teen Vogue’s New York City headquarters to demand more realistic images of young women in the media, while controversy surrounded September’s US Vogue cover featuring Lady Gaga when a video of the shoot showed her looking considerably less svelte than in the published picture. And last year the UK’s Advertising Standards Agency banned a L’Oréal advert in which Julia Roberts’ airbrushed perfection was deemed misleading.But as a new show at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art proves, such alterations are not exclusive to the computer age. As long as people has been making images, they have also been amending them.Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop pulls together some 200 images, all tweaked with a variety of techniques by photographers from the 1840s until 1990, when Adobe Systems introduced its digital editing program. Mia Fineman, the show’s curator, explains: “The show is intended to demonstrate that all the things we associate with digitally manipulated imagery today have been part of photography’s history since the beginning. When people complain about models being turned into skeletons through Photoshop, I feel they need to see how incredibly ubiquitous this has always been.” (Adobe is a sponsor of the show but, says Fineman, had no say in its content.)As if to underline that sentiment, a quote from a 1903 essay by US photographer Edward Steichen is painted above one of the show’s walls: “Every photograph is a fake from start to finish, a purely impersonal, unmanipulated photograph being practically impossible.”The show includes some standout magazine images. In Erwin Blumenfeld’s January 1950 Vogue cover, a model’s face is reduced to a single made-up eye, pointed eyebrow, bold red lip and black beauty mark. In another, Richard Avedon attaches five Audrey Hepburn heads into one multi-tentacled, fantastic image.“Retouched magazine imagery was always a huge part of magazine illustration,” says Fineman. “Part of a magazine has to do with a certain suspension of disbelief: they’re trying to create a world that’s more perfect than the world we live in.”The show’s strength is how it contextualises this development, beginning in the mid-19th century when photographers used basic hand techniques to alter images, primarily by applying colour to black and white. In some cases, such as an anonymous portrait of a soldier, the technique was used to give the picture a painterly quality; in others, such as “Woman with Umbrella in Rain” by Raimund von Stillfried, details such as a geisha’s kimono lining and crimson lipstick come alive with the additions. Like with digital manipulations, the effect is to guide the eye to specific details, and manipulate the viewer.Indeed, says Fineman, “Photography has a reputation as a truthful and objective medium and that reputation makes it irresistible for people who want to convey a message.”In this vein, a selection of politically themed pieces range from the satirical – a 1968 image by Weegee that adds a Pinocchio-style nose to Lyndon B Johnson’s face – to the more ominous: a seemingly untouched photo of German POWS in Stalingrad that is actually two negatives superimposed in a single print to create the impression of a mass of captives streaming across the countryside. Then there’s the photograph of Hitler and Leni Riefenstahl from which Joseph Goebbels was removed to thwart rumours of an affair with the Triumph of the Will director.Sometimes the retouching itself offers the commentary, as in a series of three photographs by Kathy Grove based on classic Brassai, Kertész and Man Ray images – the woman in each photograph has been removed as a comment about objectification. Grove, who also works as a professional retoucher for companies such as Estée Lauder and Revlon, says: “Photography is a way of seeing the world. Just about everything you see has been altered in some way.” With photography, like Magritte’s painting, “Ceci n’est pas une pipe.”‘Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, until January 27 2013; www.metmuseum.org"

However, the S&P 500 is still up more than 11 per cent from the start of the year.“Overall, the market is up 30 per cent from its lows in the late summer of last year but a little consolidation is expected,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING. “The fact that we are holding 1,400 is a good sign and we’ve bounced off lows. There are still many investors who are underweight and we are not too concerned by a small retrenchment on a given day.”Commodity-related stocks were among the worst performers. Joy Global, the mining equipment maker, was the biggest faller among industrials, dropping 4.3 per cent to $75.92. Cummins, the diesel engine manufacturer, fell 3.6 per cent to $123.42.Peabody Energy, the coalminer, dropped 5.4 per cent to $31.64 and was the worst performer in the energy sector. Alpha Natural Resources, another coal supplier, lost 4.1 per cent to $16.61.Markets also reacted to news that US housing starts slipped by 1.1 per cent to 698,000 last month as analysts continued to express concerns over the prospects of a housing market recovery.“Housing starts are expected to rise 9 per cent this year, with single-family construction rising 8 per cent and multi-family starts rising 12 per cent,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo.“Overall, starts should rise an additional 16 per cent in 2013. Even with these gains, however, homebuilding remains well off its long-run trend.”The S&P 500 financials index bucked the weaker trend in the wider market, rising 0.4 per cent to lead the major sector indices on strength from the country’s largest banks.Bank of America, which dispelled rumours that it was considering a share offering to raise additional capital on Monday, led the way higher. Shares in the bank, which said last week it would not return capital to shareholders after passing the Federal Reserve’s stress tests, rose 2.9 per cent to $9.81.Goldman Sachs rose 1.4 per cent to $126.02, while JPMorgan was up 0.4 per cent to $45.38 on reports that the bank will pay $150m to settle a lawsuit with three pension funds. Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $20.41 and Citigroup rose by 2.5 per cent to $38.08.Tiffany & Co, the luxury jewellery retailer, was the best performing stock in the S&P 500. Tiffany’s rose by 6.7 per cent to $73.27 as the company upped its annual profit forecast to $4.05 a share, driven by surging sales in Asia.Williams Company, the natural gas explorer and producer, was among the day’s biggest risers and gained 2.9 per cent to $31.30. The company’s subsidiary, Williams Partner, said it would acquire a natural-gas pipeline system for $2.5bn from Caiman Energy.The Nasdaq Composite Index recovered some of its losses earlier in the day and finished down just 0.1 per cent to 3,074.15. Apple, the largest US company by market value, retreated from a record close achieved after it said it would begin paying a dividend on Monday, only to surge to yet another record high. The stock fell below the $600 mark in early trading only to finish up 0.8 per cent to $605.96Amazon, the online retailer, rose 3.7 per cent to $192.33 a day after it said it would acquire Kiva Systems, a warehouse robotics company, for $775m.Adobe Systems, the largest maker of graphic design software, fell 3.9 per cent to $33.16, as the company said profits for the second quarter would come in below estimates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent to 13,170.19. Earth mover Caterpillar led Dow fallers on the back of the market’s concerns over China. Shares in the company fell by 2.6 to $110.76.United Technologies, the building systems and aerospace equipment maker, fell by 1.6 per cent to $83.26.Walt Disney, the entertainment group, fell 0.5 per cent to $43.24 after the company said it would incur a $200m writedown on John Carter, which cost $300m to produce.

It has also expanded its global footprint and expects to open a further 200 serviced offices this year, up from 139 last year, as it edges towards a target of 2,000 locations by 2014.“Coffee shops have their place but there is a lot of work that is difficult to get done and people do want somewhere quieter,” said Mark Dixon, chief executive. “It’s culture meets technology and it’s colliding with the office market.”Although Regus is expanding its offerings and its footprint to countries including Madagascar, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, it is still heavily reliant upon its mature offices – centres that have been open for two years or more – which last year comprised about 90 per cent of total turnover. Just over 20 per cent of revenues, however, are coming from services other than offices, such as people dropping into business lounges, up from about 10 per cent four years ago.This helped the group report a 12 per cent year on year increase in 2011 revenues to £1.2bn, and a near six-fold jump in pre-tax profit to £45.5m. On an underlying basis, excluding the 2010 restructuring charges, operating profit doubled to £50.6m.The rise in profits indicated the FTSE 250 company had recovered from a poor 2010 when it took a hit from extensive restructuring in the UK and investment in overseas offices. But the shares fell 7.8 per cent to 104p as Mr Dixon warned the economic environment remained challenging.Regus, whose customers include Starbucks, TomTom, Disney and Adobe, offers ready-to-use offices for short-term rentals, as well as drop-in business lounges for mobile workers. Regus also provides meeting rooms, video communication studios, reception facilities, phone messaging and other business support services.Diluted earnings per share for the 12 months to December 31 rose from 0.2p to 4p, and the company proposed a final dividend of 2p, making a full-year payout of 2.9p , compared with the previous year’s 2.6p.Mike Allen at Panmure Gordon said: “We expect 2012 to be another year of significant growth for the company, though this will not come through in earnings per share figures given development costs.“We do not expect consensus forecasts to change materially on the back of these results,” he added.

By promoting the “#McDStories” hashtag, it expected to users to share favourite memories from the world’s largest restaurant chain.Instead, critics of the fast-food chain hijacked the hashtag and used it to pillory McDonald’s, accusing it of peddling unhealthy, unappetising food.The incident was the latest example of how well-intentioned social media marketing can backfire, putting a company on the defensive. While sites such as Facebook and Twitter provide unparalleled access to customers, allowing companies to interact with fans, they also provide a forum for dissenters.McDonald’s was monitoring the conversation on Twitter, and quickly took down its promoted tweets. “With all social media campaigns, we include contingency plans, should the conversation not go as planned,” Rick Wion, social media director for McDonald’s USA, told the FT. “The ability to change midstream helped this small blip from becoming something larger.”Yet the damage was already done, and the episode became a cautionary tale for companies.McDonald’s scored points for being quick to respond. “You need to be on it 24/7,” says Ann Lewnes, chief marketing officer at Adobe, the software company. “That’s one of the biggest changes to marketing today. You don’t just put a campaign out there. At any given moment, someone is saying something about your company and product, and you have to be listening.”Because McDonald’s was listening, it says the damage was limited, with the #McDStories parodies accounting for only 2 per cent of conversation about the brand that day. “The response to any type of complaint has to be almost immediate,” says Ms Lewnes, adding that Adobe also strives to remain vigilant. “We have a policy that within minutes we have to respond in a meaningful manner.”Other brands can simply be tone-deaf in their promotions, drawing the wrath of online critics quick to pounce on the slightest whiff of inappropriateness from a big brand. When Casey Anthony, the mother suspected of murdering her daughter, was acquitted last year, the “#notguilty” hashtag began trending on Twitter.That prompted Entenmann’s, the snack maker, to tweet: “Who’s #notguilty about eating all the tasty treats they want?!” Customers called Entenmann’s out, and the social media agency representing the company apologised in a blog post.“The mis-steps happen when marketing departments aren’t aligned with the brand’s values,” says Nick Law, chief creative officer in North America for R/GA, a digital agency. “There are all these steps in the process where marketers take shortcuts to get some news out in the marketplace.”Social media gaffes are not limited to Twitter, however. Last year Olla, the condom maker, devised a campaign to attract customers. It created a programme that sent men a friend request from their supposedly unborn babies. So a Facebook user named Daniel Ogawa got a friend request from “Daniel Ogawa Jr”, with a picture of a baby and a message that said “Avoid surprises like this one. Use Olla Condoms.”Another ill-fated tactic involves trying to engage with the social media community on false pretences.Last year, ConAgra, a maker of packaged foods, invited bloggers to a four-course meal at an exclusive restaurant in New York. Instead of haute cuisine, the bloggers were served frozen lasagne.The reactions on the blogosphere were swift and fierce. “Our entire meal was a SHAM!” wrote one participant. “We were unwilling participants in a bait-and-switch.” The story went viral, and ConAgra was soon on the defensive.“Social media brings both opportunity and threat. Entering the market with a siloed mindset can be extremely dangerous,” says Laurence Buchanan, Digital Transformation Lead at Cap­gemini Consulting.“Having a mechanism in place to filter through the vast amount of noise generated on social media sites is a pre-requisite,” he says. “But this is a complete waste of investment without the ability to act fast on opportunities and threats as they come up.”
81;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2012-03-07T02:02:19Z;Advertisers rush to master fresh set of skills;There are great opportunities, but companies are still largely feeling their way, says David Gelles;Only a few years ago, digital marketers might have thought all was plain sailing. After a decade of disruption wreaked by the emergence of the popular web, companies and advertising agencies had finally understood the intricacies of placing online display and search ads.Yet in the past few years, a new generation of technologies has come along to disrupt once again the way advertisers operate. Led by Facebook and Twitter, and joined by behemoths such as Google and a bevy of start-ups, these Silicon Valley misfits have muscled into the ad business and upended traditional assumptions about how companies should allocate marketing budgets.In addition to search and display advertising, big companies must now factor in social media, video advertising, mobile marketing and daily deals.“We’ve gone from display and search to this much longer list,” says Nick Law, chief creative officer in North America for R/GA, the digital agency. “These things are connected, and you can’t do one without the other.”The promise of these platforms is tremendous. The new world of digital and social media marketing can give companies increased access to their customers, fresh insights into their preferences, a broader creative palette to work with, and additional data and metrics to study.Yet there are unsolved questions over how best to organise and execute digital and social campaigns. No single formula has emerged, leaving most companies and ad agencies in a state of constant experimentation. There is also lingering confusion over how best to measure the effectiveness of a campaign, and a company’s return on investment.Ann Lewnes, chief marketing officer of Adobe, the software company, says she pushed the company into digital and social marketing early on. “We saw the insights we could glean from customers, the iterations we could do on a campaign,” she says. “We saw the ability to really, really measure results.” Adobe now spends 74 per cent of its more than $100m marketing budget on digital.Even for a digital-first company such as Adobe, each campaign is a fresh start of sorts. Ms Lewnes says 20 per cent of her budget is going towards experimental campaigns, and that each product launch requires a different mix of paid, earned and owned media.Perhaps the largest shift in recent years has been the transition from the one-way, broadcast messaging of television, print and outdoor, to the two-way conversation that social options now allow companies to have with their consumers.“It requires a shift in your perception,” says Maryam Banikarim, chief marketing officer of Gannett, the media company. “People find it hard to realise marketing is a two-way conversation rather than a one-way pushing out.”Yet quantifying the effectiveness, and return on investment, of digital and social campaigns, remains a challenge. Rather than tracking click-through and conversion rates as with search and display advertising, marketers are trying to count followers, measure sentiment and analyse purchase intent.“A lot of people are just measuring their fans and followers,” says Ms Lewnes. “But what’s important are the insights you can glean from the data. Understanding if someone is happy or unhappy with something.”Social signals obtained from Twitter and Facebook can also give companies real-time insight. When MTV saw there was a spike in online conversations around the news that Beyoncé was pregnant, it added more pictures and stories about the story to its website.Yet many markers remain dissatisfied with the state of online measurement.Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, the consumer products group that is the second-largest advertiser in the world, says: “Digital is in theory more measurable than anything else, in theory and in practice, but it’s not broad enough yet. What we’ll see is a significant maturation of ROI in digital.”More insights and creative opportunities mean more work for marketing teams, and can mean increased costs for marketers.In-house and at agencies, marketers are scrambling to acquire new skills, and add staff to monitor the exponential growth of online dialogue about companies.“You have to throw bodies at that,” says Ms Lewnes. “There are people who have to monitor it all day.”Myriad options are also forcing companies and agencies to change the way they work.“Twenty years ago there were templates,” says Mr Law at R/GA. “Now, we don’t have a typical client engagement. Because media are so flexible, we can get very specific.”One brand may need a robust Facebook page, while another may call for a strategy of engaging with consumers on message boards, blogs and elsewhere on the web. Such approaches are forcing departments within organisations to collaborate in new ways.“It’s brought the marketing teams much closer together,” says Ms Lewnes. “They all used to be in their silos. PR was off operating by itself, advertising was operating by itself. Now they’re working together.”At its best, this can result in truly integrated marketing campaigns, with a unified message being pushed out across television, print, radio, and the web.“Things really are getting joined up,” says Mr Weed. “The same creative is going to flow across multiple screens.”Growing access to the web in emerging markets is also allowing for truly global campaigns.“A few years ago I would be engaging much more of a national base on campaigns,” says Mr Weed. “But Google and Facebook are truly global media companies in a way the world has never seen.”The amount of money being committed to digital marketing varies widely, with more developed countries seeing a higher digital spend.Unilever, for example, spends about 35 per cent of its US budget on digital, compared with 25 per cent in Europe, and just 4 per cent in India.Yet emerging markets could rapidly catch up, as they adopt digital media.“In emerging markets they’re going to go through these cycles much more quickly than us,” says Mr Law.And digital advertising is still a small portion of global advertising, accounting for 16 per cent of total spend in 2011, according to ZenithOptimedia.That figure is growing fast, but television is set to remain the biggest advertising platform, accounting for 40 per cent of total spend through at least 2013.Managing the growing array of digital and social initiatives has forced companies to revise their relationships with ad agencies, as well.Unilever reduced its roster of more than 400 digital agencies to fewer than 100, with just 12 lead global agencies, including Razorfish, AKQA and R/GA.“We’re already fragmenting our spend across different media,” says Mr Weed. “If you fragment, the message you’re making it less cohesive and joined up.”Technologies are changing fast, and few marketers would claim to know what new social platform might demand their attention a year from now.Pinterest, the online pinboard and sharing site, is the latest to draw a legion of users – and the interest of marketers – without having proved its business model or staying power.How this shift in the marketing world plays out will help determine the winners and losers in the years to come. At stake are the valuations of companies such as Facebook, which earned $3.7bn last year, mostly from advertising, and is preparing to go public at a value of up to $100bn.Yet some basic trends are emerging, with mobile access to the web leading the pack.“If the first 1bn users connected to the internet through PCs, the next 1bn will be through mobile,” says Mr Weed, who recently visited a family in the slums of Mumbai who nonetheless had two mobile phones.Unilever was the first and largest customer for Apple’s mobile iAd marketing platform, and has renewed its contract for a second year.“I want to get to the future first,” Mr Weed says. “I don’t want to be following my competitors.”If marketers continue to flock to new digital and social options, Facebook and its social media peers may prove their worth.Yet if a proliferation of online options fragments advertisers’ spend, or if the promise of social media goes unfulfilled, this moment could one day be seen as another bubble.Regardless of that, it seems certain that new technologies are destined to change the way consumers interact with brands.Just as the web reshaped the advertising world a decade ago, the new world of digital and social media marketing is forcing companies and ad agencies to re-evaluate where, how and when they engage with potential customers.“Ultimately, this concept of digital will disappear,” says Mr Weed.“My 20-year-old son laughs at me when I talk about online and offline.”

Fixing them would cost about £1,000 each, according to Basekit, which specialises in building websites for small businesses.The company calculated that the total bill based on a “conservative” assumption that half of the UK’s 4.5 million small businesses had Flash-based websites.Chris Winstanley, vice president of marketing at Basekit, said: “Mobile has been an important source of lead generation and sales for many small businesses and its growth is set to continue, with mobile search likely to account for nearly 20 per cent of all search queries by 2012. That’s an enormous amount of traffic that SMEs cannot afford to miss out on.”
83;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

The New York-based investment bank, which is a market-maker in Italian government bonds, spent last week battling to reassure investors about its exposure to eurozone debt.Morgan Stanley fell 9 per cent to $15.76, once again suffering more than other big US banks, as filings showed it had recently carried $1.79bn in net exposure to Italy, after hedges.Goldman Sachs was off 8.2 per cent to $99.67 after the bank said it had $2.3bn of exposure to the Italian government, of which all but $700m is hedged, generally with investment-grade counterparties.Among the commercial banks, Citigroup fell 8.2 per cent to $28.85 and Bank of America was off 5.7 per cent to $6.16.Credit default swaps on US banks also moved upwards on Wednesday. The cost of default protection on Morgan Stanley’s debt rose 50 basis points to 445bp, according to data from Markit. That equates to $445,000 a year to insure $10m of Morgan Stanley debt for five years, but is still well off the 584bp seen at the start of October.The S&P 500 closed at 1,229.1, down 3.7 per cent for its worst daily performance in three months, and decisively back into negative territory for the year.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.9 per cent to 2,621.65, in negative territory for the year for the first time in more than a week.General Motors, plunged 10.9 per cent to $22.31 after the Detroit carmaker posted a quarterly net profit of $1.7bn, 15 per cent lower than the same period last year, and said it would not break even in Europe this year.Software maker Adobe Systems was down 7.7 per cent to $28.08 after the company cut its 2012 revenue forecast and said it would axe 750 jobs at a cost of up to $78m in the fiscal fourth quarter.The company is to reduce its focus on enterprise software for governments and businesses, and stop adapting its Flash Player software for mobile devices and tablets, calling time on a long battle to persuade the likes of Apple to adopt Flash.“A year ago Adobe would have said Flash was critical to the company’s future,” said Chris Hickey, software analyst at Atlantic Equities, from Adobe’s analyst day in New York. “But Flash-specific products only make up a small percentage of revenues, and I think the sell-off in the stock is overdone.”All 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down – an alarming sign of stocks moving in lockstep in response to macro news from Europe.The blue chip-heavy index fell 3.2 per cent to 11,780.87, with China-exposed stocks among the biggest fallers. Alcoa was down 5.4 per cent to $10.20 and Caterpillar fell 4.4 per cent to $91.64, as fears grew that the eurozone crisis is leading banks to tighten lending in Asia.Hewlett-Packard fell 5.4 per cent to $26.33 after a conference call with Meg Whitman, chief executive, failed to clarify whether the company plans to sell its webOS platform.A sale of the software, which was purchased from Palm for $1.2bn in 2010 to run on HP’s failed tablet offering, would probably mean the company accepting a loss.Computer Sciences Corp plunged 15.4 per cent to $27.90 after slashing its full fiscal year earnings forecast to a range of $4.05 to $4.10 a share. It had predicted earnings in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 per share in August.The IT outsourcing company is heavily dependent on US government contracts, and blamed “federal budget uncertainty”, for its lowered guidance.Best Buy was the only stock in the S&P 500 to record gains. It rose 1.4 per cent to $27.22 after Cleveland Research said its survey of individual stores indicated same-store sales growth was positive in October.Groupon executives may be relieved at the timing of last week’s initial public offering, which priced at $20. The stock fell another 3.5 per cent on Wednesday, and is down 7.7 per cent for the week at $24.02, after popping up to $29.52 on its debut last week.
85;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2011-11-09T20:38:29Z;Adobe: pragmatic rebuilding;A policy shift should bring a more predictable and valuable revenue base;Most of us think about Adobe only when one of its update messages pops up on our computer: an update of Flash or Acrobat is available – please cease productive activity, download and restart. But Adobe will sell more than $4bn of its graphics, publishing and web-design software to professional customers this year, at operating margins approaching 40 per cent. So the products must do more than just annoy consumers.Now, chief executive Shantanu Narayen has decided that the company needs an update of its own. On Wednesday, it announced it would invest more heavily in its tools for creating, distributing and marketing online content (often sold through recurring subscription agreements) and move away from slower-growth, lower-margin business communication and collaboration software (sold though one-time licence agreements). As a result of the shift, 750 jobs – about 8 per cent of the total – will be cut, while 2012 revenue growth targets have been slashed by half, to about 5 per cent.The company will also cease development of its Flash Player for mobile devices, investing instead in the HTML5 platform, increasingly the industry standard. This is a moral victory for Apple, which had refused to support Flash on iPhones and iPads.The stock fell 7 per cent after the announcement. This is too harsh. It is crucial that tech companies invest where the growth is. A one-time hit to the top line of less than $200m seems like an acceptable cost, especially if Adobe ends up with a more predictable and, therefore, more valuable revenue base as a result. On mobile Flash, which was never a major contributor to revenue, deciding to swim with the tide is simply pragmatic. Of course, major changes entail execution risk, but sometimes a hard reboot is the only way to get the system running smoothly again.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
86;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2011-11-09T18:25:25Z;Adobe to abandon work on mobile Flash;;Adobe Systems has abandoned future development of its Flash player for mobile devices in what amounts to a posthumous recognition of the software’s condemnation by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.Adobe shares fell as much as 14 per cent on Wednesday, with the Flash announcement part of a wider restructuring announced by the company to focus on its digital media and digital marketing businesses, which it said were “explosive growth categories”.The Silicon Valley company said about 750 jobs would be lost, or about 7 per cent of its workforce, and revenue growth over the next year would be reduced by 4 to 5 percentage points as investment was reduced and licence sales fell in certain enterprise products that were no longer a focus.Adobe’s Flash player has been dominant on the PC for the rendering of videos, games and ads, but its attempts to introduce it on another exploding category – mobile devices – have been fraught with delays and poor performance.It earned the opprobrium of Steve Jobs, its most vocal critic, who did not allow its use on the Safari browser for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.In a tirade against Flash on Apple’s website last year, Mr Jobs described it as unreliable, insecure and battery-draining on the iPhone. He said Flash was a proprietary technology and Apple preferred an open set of web standards known as HTML5.In a blog note on Wednesday, Danny Winokur, Adobe’s head of interactive development, said HTML5 was now universally supported on major mobile devices and Flash Player would no longer be developed beyond an upcoming 11.1 release for Android devices and the BlackBerry Playbook.Analysts welcomed the move. Al Hilwa at the IDC research firm described it as “a wise adjustment in the face of changing web standards”.“HTML5 is coming on strong …having an enormous cadre of staff working on putting Flash on every hardware on the planet appears to be unnecessary when an alternative solution can leverage a broader developer ecosystem,” he said.Adobe makes money from selling developers software tools to create in Flash, rather than from the Flash player itself. It has recently introduced HTML5 creation tools with its Edge product and their incorporation in its Creative Suite software.The company did not specify which enterprise products would become less of a focus and was expected to reveal more about its new strategy at its financial analysts’ day on Wednesday. It did say it would try to extend its leadership in document services with its Acrobat product line.Adobe shares recovered some of their early weakness and were 7.2 per cent lower at $28.23 in early afternoon trading in New York on Wednesday.

It also said it would reinvest any early repayments from mortgage securities back into debt issued by mortgage agencies such as Fannie Mae, to reduce household mortgage rates.“I don’t know if I want to use the word desperate, but it feels like the Federal Reserve is out of bullets,” said Scott O’Neill, portfolio manager of MarketSmith.The S&P closed down 2.9 per cent at 1,166.72, its lowest level in a week.

A broad swath of material, industrials and transport stocks fell after Alpha Natural Resources warned it would ship less coal than expected this year due to falling demand.ANR dropped 17.2 per cent to $22.30, a two-year low, after it said it would ship between 102.5m and 109.5m tonnes of coal this year, down from a previous estimate of between 104m and 112m tonnes.Cliffs Natural Resources was down 12.8 per cent to $61.55 in sympathy. Joy Global, which manufactures coal mining equipment, fell 7.2 per cent to $72.29. Transport groups CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern, which transport coal to ports for export, both fell. CSX was down 8.1 per cent to $18.59, and Norfolk was down 8.3 per cent to $61.93.That pushed the Dow Transport Index, which analysts watch closely as a forward indicator of demand for goods and materials, down 3 per cent by lunch. But the index ended down 5.6 per cent for the day, after a further slump following the FOMC announcement.Software developers rallied strongly, however, as investors reacted to better than expected quarterly results posted by Oracle.Hardware sales declined, but software sales were up for the San Francisco-based company. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, software sales grew more than 50 per cent year-on-year, confounding fears that Europe’s debt crisis would hurt demand. Oracle also predicted revenues would grow 4 to 8 per cent in the current quarter. Its shares closed up 4 per cent to $29.49.“What we’re seeing is a relief rally,” said Richard Davis, software analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “People were scared out of their wits about what these results might be, given the weak macro data.”Adobe shares were up 1 per cent at $24.89, as it was caught up in the software relief rally despite posting quarterly earnings that were below expectations.Shantanu Narayen, chief executive, said the company could still deliver 10 per cent revenue growth for the year, based on a strong fourth quarter.But Steven Ashley at Baird pointed out “guidance assumes normal fourth-quarter economic activity, which might raise eyebrows with some investors”.A key differentiator among software companies may be the level of exposure to businesses, which have stronger balance sheets than consumers.With 55 per cent of Adobe revenues coming from creative professionals, Mr Ashley said this could be a problem. He expects Adobe to deliver 7 per cent growth in revenue from sales to creative professionals this fiscal year.Hewlett-Packard jumped 8.7 per cent to $23.98 on reports it may replace Léo Apotheker, chief executive.Microsoft shares were down 3.7 per cent to $26.35 after the company announced a 25 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend late on Tuesday. Microsoft will increase quarterly dividends by 4 cents to 20 cents.At close to 3 per cent, Microsoft’s dividend is one of the highest among tech companies on the S&P 500, but the company is under pressure to compensate investors for a stagnant share price.Shares in Range Resources, an independent oil and gas explorer, were up 4.7 per cent to $67.96 on buy-out speculation.

The S&P financial index added 1.1 per cent while the KBW banking index climbed 1.4 per cent.The sector was helped by news that banking capital requirements agreed over the weekend were less punitive than some had feared.These gains helped the S&P 500 up 0.9 per cent to 1,280.09, with the index finding support just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses, and traders are using the 200-day average as an excuse to get back in,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound on Wall Street was broad based, with all 10 big S&P indices gaining ground.But technology stocks saw the strongest gains, rebounding from the 1.8 per cent losses in the previous session.The S&P technology index, which had suffered a 10.7 per cent correction since its last cyclical high in February, was up 1.4 per cent.Microsoft was one of the best performing stocks in the sector, rising 3.7 per cent to $25.20 in the biggest one-day move upwards in more than nine months. On Tuesday, the technology group is launching a new cloud version of Microsoft Office.Elsewhere, Amazon was up 4.5 per cent to $201.25 while Adobe Systems added 3.1 per cent to $30.89.The material sector was the worst performing in the session as commodity prices softened. Allegheny Technologies fell 1.5 per cent to $59.11 and the S&P material index was up 0.2 per cent.Sentiment in the session was not helped by weak data on consumer spending, but these technical factors meant the news was largely shrugged off by the markets. Still, data from the commerce department showed that consumer spending had remained largely unchanged in May, which was the first time in nearly a year that spending had not gone up. The figure was also below the 0.1 per cent rise that had been expected by economists.The data are just one in a long line of weak economic numbers released in the past few months which have left the S&P 500 6.1 per cent lower since the start of May.“With the economic indicators weakening and the concerns about the European periphery rising, markets are once again questioning the strength of the economic recovery,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.Even so, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 12,043.56 in the session, reclaiming its 150-day moving average lost last week.The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3 per cent to 2,688.28, bouncing off its own 200-day moving average level hit on Friday.The Nasdaq and the Dow indices are on their way towards 5.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent losses this month, respectively. The S&P 500 is looking at a 4.8 per cent fall in the worst month on the index since June 2010.In corporate news, ReneSola lost ground after announcing that its chief financial officer was resigning.

First Solaris down 16.4 per cent to $116.68 since the start of May. But LDK Solar jumped 4.9 per cent to $7.14 in the session after the Chinese solar company said it planned to buy back up to $100m of its American Depository Shares.Wall Street kicked off the week in positive territory despite some lacklustre consumer spending data as the major indices bounced off key technical support levels after nearly two straight months of losses.The financial sector, which has been one of the worst performing in recent months falling 13 per cent from its last cyclical high in February, saw the strongest gains in the session.Janus Capital was up 2.3 per cent to $8.99 while Bank of America rose 2.3 per cent to $10.76.

The S&P technology index, which has suffered a 10.7 per cent correction since its last cyclical high in February, was up 0.9 per cent.Microsoft was one of the best performing stocks in the sector, rising 3.5 per cent to $25.15 in the biggest one-day move upwards in over nine months. On Tuesday, the technology giant is launching a new cloud version of Microsoft Office.Only the material sector was lower in the session as commodity prices softened. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, lost 0.6 per cent to $48.14 while Cliff Natural Resources fell 0.8 per cent to $85.90.Sentiment in the session was not helped by weak data on consumer spending, but these technical factors meant that the news was largely shrugged off by the markets.Still, data from the commerce department showed that consumer spending had remained largely unchanged in May, which was the first time in nearly a year that spending had not gone up.

90;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;US stocks fall on Bernanke’s outlook;;Industrial transportations stocks climbed after FedEx reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and gave a positive outlook for the year, but the wider markets fell into negative territory after Ben Bernanke gave a cautious assessment of the US economy in a news conference.The package delivery group, considered a bellwether for the wider economy as it transports goods for such a wide range of industries, reported a 33 per cent jump in earnings, sending shares up 2.6 per cent to $91.44.The company gave a stronger-than-expected full-year earnings outlook.This caused a sigh of relief for investors as, due to a run of weak economic data in the US, many had been worried that forecasts would be sluggish.The outlook was “better than feared”, said analysts at Jefferies.Rival package delivery company UPS added 0.7 per cent to $71.11 on the news while Expeditors International of Washington put on 0.4 per cent to $48.45.But in the wider markets the S&P 500 index closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,287.14, breaking a four-session winning streak. The index dipped from positive to negative territory late in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve cut US growth forecasts and offered no hope that there would be another round of monetary stimulus.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent to 12,109.67 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,669.19.According to Investment Company Institute, the last two week were the worst fortnight for equity outflow since May 2010, the week of the flash crash. This did not help the mood in the markets.Wall Street was hurt by a move in the dollar, which edged higher after the Bernanke press conference. This weighed on the industrial, energy and material sectors.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, although these losses were pared somewhat by L-3 Communications, which spiked 4.6 per cent to $86.21 after reports that investors were pushing the defence company to spin off some units.The S&P energy and material sectors were both down 0.4 per cent.In the materials sector, CF Industries was down 2.8 per cent to $142.25 while Allegheny fell 2.5 per cent to $59.91.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.9 per cent to $142.25 while EOG Resources lost 0.8 per cent to $101.34.But the technology sector was the worst performing in the session, led lower by Adobe Systems, the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500.The software company that makes the Photoshop and Illustrator programs for media and internet professionals gave a disappointing earnings forecast, which dragged the stock down 6.3 per cent to $30.01.These losses came despite the fact that the company reported a 54 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings.Many analysts were still upbeat about the software maker in the long term.Analysts at Citigroup said that there were “lots of small things to quibble about” but that the “big picture [was] still bright”.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Autodesk was down 1.5 per cent to $36.47 while Juniper Networks lost 2.4 per cent to $29.53.The S&P technology index was down 0.8 per cent, although losses were pared by strong gains from Jabil Circuit. The electronics contractor was up 3.2 per cent to $19.45 after reporting powerful earnings and a share buy-back.Homebuilders also saw gains after home prices as tracked by the Federal Housing Finance Agency rose 0.8 per cent in April from the previous month, which was better than the 0.3 per cent fall that had been expected. PulteGroup was up 0.4 per cent to $7.49 while DR Horton added 1.4 per cent to $11.54.Consumer staples stocks also suffered, led by Lorillard Tobacco, which was down 1.7 per cent to $110.01.In the previous session, the US Food and Drug Administration released nine warnings on the ill-effects of smoking – combining graphic images and text – that must appear on cigarette packets as well as in advertisements no later than September 2012.The S&P consumer staples index was down, 0.7 per cent.CarMax, the used-car dealer, enjoyed the strongest gains on the S&P 500 after reporting first-quarter earnings up 25 per cent, beating analysts’ expectations. Its shares were up 7 per cent to $32.66 as earnings came in at $126.3m, or 55 cents a share, which was ahead of the 47 cents expected.AeroVironment’s fourth-quarter earnings rose 20.6 per cent on a jump in contract-services, leaving shares in the maker of unmanned aircraft up 19.6 per cent to $34.51.
91;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2011-04-06T20:57:29Z;M&A lawyer charged in $32m insider trading scheme;;A mergers and acquisitions lawyer and a stock trader were accused by federal prosecutors of masterminding a 17-year insider trading scheme that reaped $32m in illegal profits by stealing deal information from three corporate law firms.Prosecutors filed charges in a New Jersey federal court against Matthew Kluger, a former senior associate at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, and Garrett Bauer, a trader who worked at several proprietary trading firms, over the alleged scheme.Mr Kluger allegedly stole confidential information from Wilson Sonsini about deals involving high-technology companies including Oracle, Sun Microsystems, McAfee and 3Com, and passed tips to Mr Bauer through a third unnamed co-conspirator, with instructions on how many shares to buy, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The scheme also involved trading on non-public information obtained from Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, two law firms where Mr Kluger previously worked. None of the law firms were implicated.“Mr Kluger was careful to steal and disclose information about deals on which he did not personally work, but which he learnt about by searching his law firm’s computer system,” according to the complaint.The case comes amid a wider government crackdown on what prosecutors have called the professionalisation of insider trading on Wall Street. Elite firms, including McKinsey & Co, the management consulting group, have been shaken in recent months as former executives and employees have been swept up in insider trading cases.Among the deals Mr Kluger and Mr Bauer were accused of trading in advance of an announcement were Oracle’s acquisition of Sun Microsystems and Adobe’s successful bid for Omniture. The illegal trading dated back as far as Johnson & Johnson’s acquisition of Neutrogena in 1994 and IBM’s bid for Lotus in 1995, the complaint said.Mr Kruger and his cohorts allegedly invested more than $109m during his five years at Wilson Sonsini. Their profits ranged from nearly $200,000 from the merger of HP-3Com to nearly $11.4m from the Oracle-Sun deal. Mr Bauer spent more than $7m of his share of the proceeds on a condo on New York’s Upper East Side and a home in Boca Raton, Florida, according to prosecutors.The trio went to lengths to conceal the scheme, using pay phones and “throwaway” prepaid cellular phones to discuss the trades, the complaint said.They learnt last month they were under investigation by the FBI and Internal Revenue Service, prompting Mr Bauer to tell the third co-conspirator to burn $175,000 in cash from a recent trade, according to transcripts of telephone conversations included in the complaint.Mr Kluger and Mr Bauer were charged with 17 counts, including securities fraud, conspiracy to commit insider trading, conspiracy to commit money laundering and obstruction of justice. The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed a civil complaint.Lawyers for Mr Kluger and Mr Bauer were unable to be reached for comment.“We were shocked to learn of the conduct the government has alleged a former employee committed against us and two other prominent law firms”, said Courtney Dorman, a spokeswoman for Wilson Sonsini. “We have provided our full support to the federal investigation and will continue to do so.”Mr Kluger was arrested at his home in Virginia and Mr Bauer was arrested at his home in New York on Wednesday morning, according to Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for Paul Fishman, US attorney for New Jersey.Additional reporting by Kara Scannell in New York
92;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2011-04-02T00:33:48Z;Hacking attack at RSA targeted Flash flaw;;The recent successful breach of systems at leading authentication company RSA exploited a previously unknown security flaw in Adobe Systems’ Flash player and remote-control technology associated with Chinese spying efforts, the company has disclosed.RSA revealed the breach two weeks ago, warning banks, government agencies and other customers that use its SecurID tokens with fast-changing passwords to revisit their access policies. Though RSA said then that the hackers should not be able to defeat RSA clients’ authentication systems directly with information they may have gleaned, they said the data could be used as part of a broader electronic assault.The lack of detail on the attack has frustrated customers and fanned speculation, with some in the security industry saying that the damage was limited and others saying that the tens of millions of SecurID tokens in use should be replaced.In a conference call with industry analysts on Friday and subsequent blog posts, RSA shed no more light on what the hackers had obtained. But they did say more on how they had fallen victim to the same sort of attack they are hired to ward off.Company officials said that the hackers e-mailed groups of employees at RSA, which is a unit of storage concern EMC and that the e-mails included a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet as an attachment, labelled “2011 Recruitment Plan”.When opened, the attachment exploited a hole then in most versions of Flash, now fixed by software updates from Adobe, that gave the attackers control of at least one user’s machine. The control technology was a version of what is called Poison Ivy, which was also used in GhostNet, described by analysts as a large Chinese spying operation.The RSA hackers harvested the login credentials of more company users, connected to other RSA employee machines and then raised the level of access that the machines’ users were entitled to, eventually getting into computers with information about how SecurID works. The data were encrypted and transferred out of the company.One irony, according to Gartner security analyst Avivah Litan, is that RSA sells fraud-detection systems to banks that could not only have detected the attack, as RSA eventually did, but stopped it midstream.Such systems look for unusual behaviour by users’ machines, such as attempts to access new parts of the network.In a blog post, RSA executive Uri Rivner said that the rash of major breaches at big western companies showed that the industry as a whole needed to share information and come up with better defences. He said security firms should “define and execute a new defence doctrine based on information sharing, deep analytics and advanced threat management”.
93;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2011-03-23T20:29:39Z;Tech groups to count quake sales loss;;IT hardware and software companies will in the next few weeks unveil the estimated hit to revenues of the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which came as local sales teams were preparing for the most important push of the year.The first indication of the impact on tech companies that sell to Japanese companies or government agencies came late on Tuesday, as US software company Adobe slashed its forecast of overall revenue growth for its current quarter by nearly half to reflect the effects of the disaster in Japan.According to analysts, sales to Japan have a disproportionately large effect on tech companies in the current quarter, given the timing of the country’s fiscal year, which closes at the end of March.The effect on local sales is a further blow alongside the supply-chain problems caused by the disruption to component suppliers affected by the disaster.Buyers of IT hardware and software tend to spend more heavily at the close of their fiscal year, as they use up the remains of their IT budgets for the year rather than lose them. The expected loss of this so-called “budget flush” was one reason listed by Adobe for its caution about the outlook in the coming weeks.The US company, which makes desktop programs for creative professionals as well as the Acrobat document software, said it expected to lose $50m in sales, or a third of what it had expected from Japan this quarter. That would leave it with revenues of $995m at the midpoint of its forecast range, sharply cutting its overall growth rate from an expected 10 per cent for the quarter.Adobe executives said it was too early to tell whether the lost sales would be recovered in coming months or whether the effect of the downturn would be longer lasting.Overall, software companies that rely on sales to businesses and government customers generate 5 per cent of their sales from Japan, according to analysts at Barclays Capital, though for some, such as Adobe and Autodesk, the figure is 10 per cent or higher.Japan also consumes about 15 per cent of the world’s semiconductors, Morgan Stanley analysts said, while tech research firm IDC had earlier forecast that the country would account for about 12 per cent of the $12.5bn global server market this quarter.With buyers distracted by the need to deal with the crisis, earlier indications suggested a dent to server sales this quarter, though the real extent of the disaster would not become apparent until the following quarter, said Jed Scaramella, an analyst at IDC.
94;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2011-03-23T14:26:03Z;Financials weigh on Wall Street;;Bank of America lost ground after announcing that the Federal Reserve had “objected” to its planned dividend increase, while the wider markets edged lower for another day as oil prices tipped over $105 a barrel.The bank said it had submitted a plan to the Fed for a “modest increase” in its dividend for the second half of 2011 but that they had “objected to the proposed increase in capital distributions”. Shares were down 1.4 per cent to $13.68.Last Friday, financial stocks on Wall Street were given a boost following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders. But this news left the S&P financial index down 0.7 per cent, the worst performing sector of the session.JPMorgan Chase, which itself announced a dividend last Friday, was down 1 per cent to $45.01. Elsewhere, Zions Bancorporation fell 1.2 per cent to $23.11, while Regions Financial lost 1.8 per cent to $7.17. Goldman Sachs was 1.3 per cent lower to $158.65.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent to 1,289.25, adding to the 0.4 per cent loss in the previous session, as oil prices ticked up and traders continued to try and assess the impact of the conflict in Libya and the fallout from the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.Adobe Systems, the software developer, was down 3.2 per cent to $31.83 after lowering its second-quarter revenue forecast due to the Japanese earthquake.Japan is Adobe’s second-biggest market after the US and accounts for between 10 to 15 per cent of revenue each quarter. The company also reported an 85 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit.The S&P technology sector was down 0.3 per cent with semiconductor stocks losing ground in spite of assurances from analysts that the supply chain disruptions from the Japanese disaster would not sprawl.“We believe the Japan earthquake will result in only a temporary disruption to the semiconductor supply chain and stock prices,” analysts at JPMorgan said. “As a result, we maintain our constructive stance on semiconductors,” the note continued.Investors remained nervous and Applied Materials lost 1.2 per cent to $14.93, while Rubicon Technology fell 2.8 per cent to $25.80. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.6 per cent, down 1.7 per cent overall since the natural disaster in Japan.Elsewhere in the technology sector Jabil Circuit, the world’s third-largest electronics manufacturing services company, was up 8.6 per cent to $20.58 after giving a third-quarter earnings forecast that exceeded analysts’ expectations.
95;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2011-03-01T19:41:42Z;M Stanley target of Chinese hackers;;Morgan Stanley was among the targets of a sophisticated hacking campaign from China that penetrated more than 100 western businesses and was disclosed last year by Google, according to internal documents from a computer security company working with the investment bank.It is unclear what information was captured by the hackers, but a person close to the Wall Street bank said it was not material to the group or its clients. The person said the breach lasted a short time.“Morgan Stanley invests significantly in IT security and manages a robust programme to deal with malware and attempted computer compromises,” the company said in a statement.Another person familiar with the case said that the hackers did not attempt to take control of brokerage accounts or otherwise put themselves in a position to steal money.Instead, the attack fits the pattern of others in what has become known as the “Aurora” campaign. The effort relied on previously unknown security flaws in a version of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer web browser and “social engineering” to trick employees into clicking on links.The hackers copied and removed mainly intellectual property, including hardware designs and software code. They also sought data that would help in business negotiations, especially over merger or joint venture activities.Other companies hit include Google, Adobe Systems and several defence contractors. Companies in the oil and gas, aerospace and auto sectors have also been penetrated, according to investigators in the US.Experts working for the US government tracked the Google hacks to computers at universities in mainland China. US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has formally requested a Chinese investigation, while the Chinese government has denied responsibility.Morgan Stanley and other targets were identified in thousands of e-mails from security company HBGary Federal, which had been hired by the bank.“They have given me access to a very sensitive report on their Aurora experience. I will honour their wishes about not sharing the info with anyone but the good news is that I have some great ideas for our final reports,” an HBGary Federal employee wrote about Morgan Stanley to executives at his company.
96;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2011-02-18T20:25:02Z;Man in the News: Stephen Elop;Andrew Ward and Andrew Parker on Nokia’s emergency call;"One recent Saturday, Stephen Elop went to his office overlooking the ice-bound Baltic Sea at Nokia’s headquarters in Espoo, Finland, and started writing. “Hello there,” he began, in the cheery manner of corporate missives from chief executive to employees. But there was nothing ordinary about the 1,200 words that followed.Mr Elop’s “burning platform” memo, in which he likened Nokia to a man caught between a blazing oil rig and a dangerous leap into icy waters, caused a sensation when it leaked just days before he was due to unveil a new strategy for turning round the troubled phonemaker. The shock factor was precisely what Mr Elop intended, as he laid the ground for his radical decision to forge an alliance with Microsoft.“The one thing I’ve emphasised throughout my career is transparency – to be as open and honest as possible,” Mr Elop told the Financial Times. The 47-year-old Canadian took charge last September, but it was only with his recent moment of frankness that he took full ownership of one of the toughest jobs in global business. At stake is both the survival of the world’s biggest phonemaker, and Europe’s ability to compete against America and Asia at the cutting edge of consumer technology.Mr Elop was recruited because of his software background: as a trained computer engineer, he had more than a decade of experience with American companies including Adobe Systems and, most recently, Microsoft. His mission was to help Nokia’s phones to match the sleek interfaces of Apple’s iPhone and devices using Google’s Android operating system.Yet when Mr Elop announced Nokia’s strategy last week it sounded to critics like an admission of defeat. Nokia still sells almost two-thirds more phones than its nearest rival, yet it is losing market share at an alarming rate. Known for its un-glitzy “candy bar” handsets, it has struggled to adapt to a world in which phones are increasingly used as minicomputers, and viewed as luxury fashion accessories.In Finland, where Nokia remains a symbol of economic virility, Mr Elop has already been labelled a “Trojan horse” for his former employer, with analysts arguing that Microsoft is the winner from the deal. By adopting its Windows Phone operating system for future high-end Nokia handsets, he has all but abandoned the company’s own software platforms, in an era when the value of mobile devices increasingly comes from the applications they support rather than their hardware.Mr Elop insists Nokia and Microsoft together stand a better chance of creating a “three horse race” with Apple and Google. The decision came after weeks of intense deliberations with his top team over future options, including an alliance with Google. “I said to them very clearly: once we get to a decision, we’re all going to stand behind it.”To his admirers, Mr Elop’s willingness to take decisive action is just what Nokia had been missing. As the first non-Finn to lead the company, his appointment was intended to shake-up a bureaucratic, Finnish-dominated culture that had fallen behind its freewheeling US west coast rivals.Mr Elop disputes that Nokia’s problems have much do with its Finnishness, which served the company well enough in the past. But he casts light on the kind of workplace it had become by remarking that his practice of encouraging e-mails from staff and writing an internal blog represented a “cultural revolution”.As a Canadian, Mr Elop says he has a natural empathy for his new home, stemming from his experiences of dark, frigid winters and living in the shadow of a mighty neighbour – in Finland’s case, Russia. Ice hockey is another source of bonding, with the Vancouver Canucks fan developing a new passion for Nokia’s local team, the Espoo Blues. “Ice hockey is one of the best places to meet people in Finland,” he says.Another hobby – flying – has been on hold, with his Cessna Turbo 182 left in its hangar in America. Instead, Mr Elop has been criss-crossing the world on business flights – nearly 60 since starting the job – as he gets to know a company that still has by far the industry’s widest global reach.Not everyone at Nokia is happy with the new regime. Hundreds of research and development workers in Finland walked out in protest when the Microsoft deal was announced; many are likely to lose their jobs. Yet, even union leaders admit radical surgery was required, and praise Mr Elop’s strong communication skills. Some of the speeches he has given the workforce “have been quite inspiring,” says Juha Raudaskoski, a Finnish workers’ representative.An engineer more than a visionary, Mr Elop lacks the charisma of Apple’s Steve Jobs, or even Steve Ballmer, the exuberant Microsoft chief executive. But it was Mr Ballmer who saw his potential, hiring Mr Elop in 2008 to lead Microsoft’s business division, where he also had to defend a market leader against upstart competition – at the time Microsoft’s flagship Office software was coming under attack from Google. Rob Helm, an analyst who follows Microsoft, said Mr Elop’s approach, and his lack of razzmatazz, were refreshing. “He is someone who doesn’t surround himself with a lot of fog. He’s very straightforward.”Even so, Mr Elop is unlikely to find a direct route to success in this, his most difficult task. Nokia’s share price is down by a fifth since the Microsoft deal, signalling investor scepticism with the turnround. Known for his steely confidence and determination, Mr Elop must now prove them wrong.It is a task he will have to undertake alone, at least initially, having left his wife and five school-age children – including triplets – on the other side of the Atlantic until the job settles down. “It’s difficult but technology helps,” he says. “There are a lot of Nokia phones in my family.” The challenge for Mr Elop is to make sure his children’s Finnish handsets become a source of envy in the schoolyard, rather than ridicule."
97;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2011-01-19T22:21:18Z;Wall St sees the light on cloud computing;Investors warm up to software trend;Stock market investors have finally been warming up to a software trend that has been more than 10 years in the making.That’s how it goes with big transitions in the underlying architecture of IT: there are many false dawns in what can appear to be inevitable long-term shifts – in this case, a new approach to information storage and processing, carried out remotely in large datacentres and delivered over the internet. The trick is not necessarily predicting what will happen next, but deciding which horse to back – and when to enter the race.So it has been with something that goes by the ungainly name of software-as-a-service (SaaS). Like many tech trends, this one surfaced under a number of different guises – application service providers was one name given to the early players, on-demand software was another – before taking its current form. Is this finally its moment?The pioneer in this market, Salesforce.com, has seen its shares jump by 70 per cent in the past year. It sells an online service for salespeople to manage their customer data. At nearly $20bn, it is now worth more than software companies such as Adobe, Symantec and Intuit – all of them much bigger and more profitable. Other SaaS names such as NetSuite and SuccessFactors have been caught in the updraft.Entrepreneurs and early investors usually blame accounting for the length of time it has taken Wall Street to get excited about SaaS.The argument goes like this: unlike traditional software companies, which book revenues upfront when they make a sale, these companies sell subscriptions – for instance, $50 a year per employee for a company that wants its sales staff to use an online application that manages their customer relationship data. Since those subscriptions often continue for years but all the costs of selling the service gets booked up front, SaaS companies can look unprofitable for many years, which makes investors cautious.That argument is hard to swallow. Sure, Salesforce only just scrapes out a profit, but its operating cash flow jumped nearly two-thirds in the first nine months of 2010. It doesn’t take a maths genius to understand the economics of this business.A more likely explanation is the length of time it sometimes takes Wall Street to get comfortable with a new market and a new business model. Like all subscription businesses, SaaS companies live or die on a handful of key measures: the money they spend finding new customers, the amount they can extract from those customers in each accounting period, and the rate at which customers fail to renew their subscription agreements and have to be replaced with new ones (known as churn).In a new market, it is not easy to tell how the dynamics of marketing costs, pricing and churn will settle down. Salesforce, which has been at this game for 11 years, spent 47 per cent of its revenues on marketing costs in the latest nine months, a higher proportion than the year before. Does that mean it is ploughing everything into growth, or that it has to spend more on marketing because the business is getting more competitive? What happens to pricing when there is a thriving market of companies vying to outsource the handling of business processes like this?Another factor is the capital investment and operational risks involved in building what amounts to a utility business. Make no mistake, these companies aim to reach huge scale. ADP, the big, boring payroll processing company that has been around for half a century, is the darling that many in this industry look up to.Start-ups, which often lack patient long-term investors and struggle to control breakneck growth, may not seem the obvious entities to which large companies would want to entrust their key data and business processes.That caution points to the other, overriding reason why SaaS has taken time to emerge as a stock market investment story. The early market has been fuelled by small businesses that cannot afford an IT department, along with departmental managers of large businesses who have enough autonomy to make decisions about how to handle non-core processes without involving the CIO. Getting to where the real money is – handling things like the financial processes and supply chains of big corporations – will take years.It’s all in the timing. Wall Street has finally decided that this is a business that’s here to stay – and that, in Salesforce, it has already thrown up at least one company that may emerge to stand alongside the big players in business software (if it isn’t bought by one of them along the way). But to live up to the new expectations they have created, it is time for the SaaS companies to prove that IT managers no longer fear the cloud.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Managing Editorrichard.waters@ft.com
98;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2011-01-07T17:39:14Z;TV makers seek to retune 3D revolution;;Advances in televisions on display at the Consumer Electronics Show helped make a spectacular Las Vegas event, with Sony and Samsung even bringing on dancing girls during their presentations.There have been bigger, flashier sets, with images leaping out from the screens, in some cases without the need for special 3D glasses. Content is richer and more colourful, with film studios and broadcasters keen to see wider distribution.There is also a new live element to internet content to supplement the many on-demand services that have dominated web-connected TVs so far.But a year on from big introductions of 3D and connected “smart TVs”, the show is still barely on the road, with 3D sales disappointing to date and the choice of content services and TV interfaces still confusing consumers.Only about 3m 3D TVs were sold worldwide in 2010, just over 1 per cent of total TV sales of 247m, according to estimates by the DisplaySearch research firm. Internet-connected TVs were far more successful, accounting for about 21 per cent of global shipments.Manufacturers appear divided in their response to consumer resistance to 3D. LG and Vizio are now promoting cheaper “passive” glasses, similar to those worn in the cinema, in response to complaints about the cost of the more sophisticated active-shutter glasses, which are also heavier and subject to flat batteries as consumers forget to recharge them.The TV makers are also working with standard eyewear designers, such as Oakley and Silhouette, to improve the look and feel of the glasses. Samsung showed off spectacles weighing less than an ounce that could be charged wirelessly by resting them on a special stand.Toshiba demonstrated a large-screen TV that displays 3D without the need for any eyewear but the technology still needs work and there are no plans to launch such a set yet.Sony is standing by its active-shutter glasses, which it says provide unmatched quality.In terms of internet connectivity, the Japanese consumer electronics company has chosen Google TV for its web-connected TV interface, while incorporating features of its own Qriocity content service, which will now include streaming of music as well as films.Vizio, which was the leading US LCD TV maker in the third quarter, said this week that it was switching from Yahoo internet widgets to its own interface based on Google’s Android operating system. Samsung, meanwhile, has announced a deal with Adobe to encourage its developer community to provide applications for its own smart TV platform.While alliances with technology companies are shifting, new ones with traditional cable providers are being established that cut out the need for TVs to be dependent on set-top boxes or aerials and coaxial cable, which carries regular and cable TV channels into the home.During CES, both Sony and Samsung have announced partnerships with Time Warner Cable that will allow delivery of the full line-up of its channels of live programming over their TVs’ internet connections. Samsung also announced a similar deal with Comcast cable, which will make programming available over internet protocol to Samsung’s Galaxy Tab tablet and its Android phones.This is part of a newer trend for 2011 – TV makers such as Vizio and Samsung are coming up with tablets and smartphones that can act as both relays and remotes for TVs. This involves using wireless connections to switch content – such as films being watched on a tablet – to the TV screen and using the mobile devices’ touch screens as remote controls.This growing interconnectivity of devices, from phones to TVs, appears to have been behind Qualcomm’s biggest acquisition this week. The leading phone chipmaker bought home network chipmaker Atheros for $3.1bn.“The industry is moving very rapidly and the phone is going to bleed into these adjacent areas [such as the digital home],” says Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm executive vice-president.Intel has also enabled similar capabilities for notebook PCs with the launch of its next-generation chips at the show – allowing high-definition films to be streamed securely over wireless to TVs.Intel’s technology won the confidence of the film studios, which are always worried about copyright piracy among PC owners.Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Fox, Universal and Warner Bros also announced at CES they would begin using UltraViolet this year – the brand for content that can be bought and stored in a digital locker to be used on any device owned by the consumer.With Hollywood now happy to offer content across devices and on TVs, this long-awaited move is promising for both TV makers and consumers, according to Dave Habiger, chief executive of Sonic Solutions, which securely encodes digital content for the studios. “This could be a transformational year – we’ve got an alignment of device manufacturers and storefronts and technology players . . . and consumers seem to like it,” he says.
99;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-12-30T22:43:50Z;Computing’s old guard faces a tough year;;The battle between the old guard of computing and new forces threatening to sweep it away looks set to heat up in 2011.The days appear to be numbered for consumers meeting all their computing needs in the standard fashion of buying a Dell computer, with Intel processor, Seagate hard drive, Logitech mouse and keyboard and running Microsoft’s Windows operating system, with perhaps Adobe media editing software.All of those companies see their market share coming under attack from competitors offering mobile tablet devices and smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab, with typically Arm-based processors, flash memory, Android operating systems and with no need for a mouse, keyboard or packaged software as they stream services over high-speed connections.Consumers’ new love affair with these smart mobile devices is prompting many analysts to look ahead to 2011 and reassess the future of companies that have dominated the traditional PC market.Morgan Stanley predicts that two-thirds of Dell’s revenue and half of its operating income base are at risk from declining PC and server growth in 2011. Its analysts blame two factors – consumers adopting tablets and avoiding or delaying notebook purchases, while businesses buy simpler, cheaper desktop machines that run applications and services delivered to them from “clouds” of datacentre servers.Goldman Sachs predicts that Intel will face challenges in 2011 and beyond from the rise of tablets. Its share in tablets will be modest in 2011, it suggests, and, longer term, its PC customers are working with chip designer Arm. Microsoft may enable Windows for Arm processors, providing Intel with increased competition.Rich Beyer, chief executive of Freescale, which provides processors for many eReaders including Amazon’s Kindle, says the x86 PC chip architectures used by Intel and AMD face some healthy competition.“There is a shift taking place – as smart mobile devices proliferate, the market will open up and ourselves and other semiconductor and operating system companies will be sharing in what has effectively been a pure PC x86 Window market until now,” he says.Jen-hsun Huang, chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia, says 2011 will be the year of “superphones” and tablets. Traditionally a graphics card maker for the PC industry, the company has diversified with Tegra processors for mobile devices and Tesla units for high-end servers.The PC will remain important, he says, but “everyone had better be well-positioned in mobile and cloud computing, because that’s where the new growth is coming from. The whole supply chain is affected from retailers, where consumers buy their computers from a Verizon store rather than Best Buy, to the software industry, where people aren’t buying shrink-wrapped products but are downloading apps and services over the air.”Nomura analysts predict that 50m tablet devices will ship in 2011, prompting a strong cannibalisation effect that will cause the netbook market to fall by 34 per cent to 25m units.They extrapolate this to the entire PC supply chain, predicting hard times for non-tablet component makers from Seagate and Western Digital hard drive makers, to makers of hinges, non-touch screens, keyboards and mice.Jim McGregor, chief technology strategist at the In-Stat research firm, sees 2011 as a year of a consolidation and one that sees “the beginning of the end of several technologies and high-tech companies.“Mobile platforms are now becoming the innovators in terms of software, [user interfaces] and even hardware technology, further increasing the divide and lessening the value proposition of the traditional PC, as well as its share of the mobile processor [market], which will drop below 10 per cent by 2014,” predicts In-Stat in a report.Traditional PC operators will be driven into the data centres where they will compete for fewer customers, says James Staten, cloud computing analyst with Forrester Research.“The fortunes of the big companies are going to be controlled by a smaller and different customer base. For someone like HP with perhaps 500 companies representing 80 per cent of its revenues, that could become five companies, and if one says it feels like buying Dell this year, that would represent a huge change.”However, Warren East, Arm chief executive, sees a strong future for PCs“There are all kinds of apocalyptic scenarios, but personally I’m not a believer in the end of the PC – it offers different functionality and there’s no way we’ll see PCs disappear over the next five years or so,” he says.Mooly Eden, head of Intel’s PC Client group, will introduce its next-generation processor code-named Sandy Bridge at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, which combines graphics and general processing functions on the same chip.He argues that extra computing power will allow PCs to offer more than tablets, with features such as gesture recognition trumping a tablet’s touch screen.“You will see at CES there are many things you will be able to do with a notebook that you couldn’t do a year ago.”Notebook and desktop sales are still running at more than 1m units a day and notebooks have topped consumers’ wish lists for the past three years in surveys, he adds.“The tablet is the new kid in town, but don’t forget his big brother.”
100;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-12-21T23:54:56Z;Lucasfilm settles recruiting complaint;;Lucasfilm, the production company founded by Star Wars director George Lucas, has settled a complaint by the US Department of Justice after it was accused of agreeing anticompetitive practices with Walt Disney’s Pixar unit that restricted employee recruitment.The two companies had an agreement that “eliminated important forms of competition to attract highly skilled employees”, the DoJ alleged.Lucasfilm and Pixar, the Disney-owned company behind animated films such as the Toy Story series, The Incredibles and Wall-E, “agreed to notify each other when making an offer to an employee of the other company”, the DoJ said.The two companies also agreed, when offering a position to the other company’s employee, “not to counter-offer with compensation above the initial offer”.The naming of Lucasfilm in the DoJ complaint followed a wider probe into hiring practices at high-tech companies by the organisation’s antitrust division. Pixar was not a named defendant in the complaint, having agreed a settlement with the DoJ in September.The probe culminated in Google, Apple, Adobe Systems, Intel, Intuit and Pixar promising to eschew blanket deals not to poach staff for the next five years.The DoJ’s antitrust division on Tuesday filed a civil antitrust complaint in district court for the District of Columbia, along with a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the Lucasfilm lawsuit.“The agreement between Lucasfilm and Pixar restrained competition for digital animators without any pro-competitive justification and distorted the competitive process,” said Christine Varney, assistant attorney-general in charge of the DoJ’s antitrust division. “The proposed settlement resolves the department’s antitrust concerns.”Pixar and Lucasfilm have a long history together: Ed Catmull, Pixar’s president and co-founder, was working for George Lucas when he first met John Lasseter, the chief creative officer of Disney and Pixar.Mr Lasseter, who directed the first Toy Story film, joined Lucasfilm’s computer division in the early 1980s, working on the unit that would eventually become Pixar. The unit was acquired by Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, for $10m in 1986 and bought by Disney for $7.4bn in 2006.Since then it has become Disney’s main creative engine: Toy Story 3 recently became the highest-grossing animated film ever made, passing $1bn in worldwide ticket sales. Disney has high hopes for the film at next year’s Academy Awards and is working on a big marketing campaign aimed at raising awareness among the 6,000 voting members of the academy.
101;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-12-21T21:31:37Z;US tech stocks higher on Adobe earnings;;Strong earnings and an optimistic outlook from Adobe Systems helped the technology sector rise as US stocks closed just shy of highs not seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Adobe jumped 6 per cent to $30.93 after the software maker forecast earnings far above analyst expectations.The optimistic outlook marks a turnround from more cautious guidance three months ago as sales of its Creative Suite 5 product rebounded from a dip earlier in the year. The software accounts for most of Adobe’s sales.The company forecast revenue in the first quarter of between $1bn and $1.05bn, above the average analyst projection of $991.9m.Adobe also exceeded expectations in its fourth quarter, with earnings per share of 56 cents compared with the 52 cents consensus.Analysts at FBR Capital Markets raised their price target for the company but maintained its “market perform” rating.“We believe upside potential is limited as we enter the back half of the CS5 product cycle [and] uncertainty surrounding the Flash franchise remains,” they said, adding that Adobe’s move to a recurring revenue model would be good for the longer term but was likely to be disruptive in the short term.Analysts at Citigroup said they preferred other software companies.“We believe that investors are better served owning other similarly or more-cheaply valued software companies … where we have a higher degree of confidence in near- to medium-term growth prospects [and] which are not as tied to specific industry verticals, and/or that are more leveraged to a rebound in corporate capital spending in the data centre.”The S&P 500 technology index gained 0.6 per cent and the wider market continued to hover around its two-year highs.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,254.61, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.5 per cent to close at 11,533.16 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.7 per cent higher at 2,667.61.Jabil Circuit was another technology company to beat expectations and raise forecasts. The electronics manufacturing services provider’s shares surged 10.7 per cent to $19.55, the most in the S&P 500, after it said it had seen strong growth across its divisions.The company forecast second-quarter earnings of 49 to 53 cents per share compared with the average 44 cents estimate.“While the quarter was strong, the bigger story remains how Jabil is moving upmarket to attack opportunities that offer a ‘less traditional’ and higher margin profile,” said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, who maintained an “outperform” rating.“We believe the multiple will continue to expand as investors get comfortable around Jabil’s business transformation that will drive sustainably higher revenues and margins going forward.”In contrast, CarMax tumbled 7.6 per cent to $33.17, the most in the S&P 500, even though the used car retailer reported better than expected earnings.Strong sales from its wholesale unit helped revenue rise 23 per cent but gross profit per vehicle was lower than some analysts had expected.Financials led the risers with the S&P 500 financials index gaining 1.6 per cent, Bank of America adding 2.9 per cent to $12.98, Wells Fargo gaining 2.4 per cent to $30.82 and AIG climbing 3.3 per cent to $55.18.Regional banks climbed even further, up 1.9 per cent, with Regions Financial rising 2.2 per cent to $6.45 and Zions Bancorp higher by 2.1 per cent to $23.02.End-of-year deal activity continued. Martek Biosciences soared 35.6 per cent to $31.67 after the baby food ingredients maker agreed to be bought by DSM, a Dutch group.DSM, which makes vitamins, is paying $1.1bn for the US company, which specialises in healthy, natural ingredients and algal technology.Massey Energy added 1.2 per cent to $52.45 after it was reported that the US coal producer had received an offer from rival Alpha Natural Resources. Shares in Alpha Natural Resources rose 2.8 per cent to $55.10.
102;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-10-24T16:41:33Z;Jobs unlikely to overstretch Apple cash;;Apple chief executive Steve Jobs’s declaration last week that the technology company wants to hold on to its $51bn in cash and securities because it sees “strategic opportunities” ahead, has provoked speculation about what it might acquire.With one of the largest cash hoards in the world and a business that spans hardware, software and content distribution, the possibilities are wide.Among the most fanciful ideas being batted around by outsiders are takeovers of Facebook, the social network valued in private share sales at more than $30bn, and perhaps Disney, the media group worth $67bn, including a large stake held by Mr Jobs.But either would break Apple’s long-running pattern of investments – it has never paid more than $500m for a target – which risks straying into unfamiliar arenas. Former executives and bankers said they would be shocked if the maker of the iPhone, iPad tablet and Mac computer did anything as far-reaching.“I don’t think they will buy anything big any time soon. It is just not in their genes,” said a former Apple strategist.Instead, ex-employees and analysts noted that Apple has historically bought smaller companies with intellectual property and strong talent in areas of growing importance for the company. Modest deals in the past have resulted in the iPod – which grew out of contracts with software engineer Tony Fadell and outside design firm PortalPlayer – as well as the software behind the popular GarageBand music composition and Final Cut video editing programmes, which appear on its computers.A key emphasis for Apple now is the company’s push into internet-connected television, with its Apple TV streaming media player, relaunched in September. It is a complex, technology-intensive battleground, where Apple faces already established cable operators and well-heeled Silicon Valley competitors, such as Google.Apple last month licensed know-how in the sector from Rovi, a company that propelled the technology provider to a record $5bn market capitalisation. Apple could easily buy the company, or one of its competitors, outright.Other logical extensions of Apple’s clout would be in chip design or manufacturing, where the company has bought in the past, and desktop software and internet services, including advertising and content streaming.With a $14bn market capitalisation, Adobe Systems could be one of the largest software targets to tempt Apple, in part, for defensive reasons. In the smartphone sector, Apple is in a major fight for superiority with devices running on Google’s dominant Android operating system. A key advantage of the latter is they have the ability to display videos based on Adobe’s Flash technology.Mr Jobs has complained that Flash is “buggy” and consumes too much battery life, but he may still want to take charge of the company, improve the software, and optimise it for Apple devices.Adobe also has an enviable presence on Microsoft desktops with its free Reader document display program. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, recently discussed with Adobe possibilities for the companies to work more closely and even mentioned a possible offer, which no doubt prompted Apple to consider contingency plans.More plausible would be a deal to strengthen Apple’s shift toward streaming content for use on all its devices, rather than making consumers download shows or music for use on a particular device.For that purpose, Apple could benefit from a content delivery network with significant infrastructure, such as Akamai, which stores copies of website data at locations around the world to get the material to users faster. Akamai is worth $8.5bn, but it has smaller competitors.Apple has also sought more control over the hardware in its devices, allowing it to differentiate its products, control features and maintain secrecy. It bought Silicon Valley chip start-up PA Semi in 2008 for $278m, which helped it develop the A4 microprocessor used in the iPad, iPhone 4 and iPod Touch.That was based on a chip design by the UK’s Arm Holdings, prompting speculation that Apple could buy that company. It seems unlikely given Arm’s open business model of licensing designs to most of the world’s chipmakers.Private investors and analysts said Nvidia, the $6.4bn market cap Silicon Valley graphics chipmaker, is a more likely target.But there is a chance Apple will do nothing. Mr Jobs has often hinted at future purchases without a major move. Given Apple’s near-death in the 1990s, Mr Jobs “likes having a huge cash cushion”, a former executive said.
103;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-10-07T23:50:14Z;Microsoft acquisition of Adobe mooted;;A possible Microsoft acquisition of Adobe Systems, long a rival in the desktop software business, was among ideas for closer co-operation raised informally at a recent meeting between the chief executives of the two companies, according to a person familiar with the talks.The suggestion, arising from a broader discussion about whether the two companies should ally against Apple, highlights Microsoft’s willingness to consider more radical tactics as it tries to counter Apple’s success with the iPhone and iPad.Two people familiar with the meeting – between Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and Shantanu Narayen of Adobe – played down the prospect that the informal takeover suggestion would lead to a deal between the two companies.One said that it had not led to any active takeover discussions, while the other added that no deal was “imminent”. Both characterised the discussion as part of a regular series of meetings to consider a range of possible areas of co-operation.However, news of the meeting, first reported in The New York Times, sent Adobe’s shares up by more than 11 per cent in the final hour of trading on Wall Street on Thursday, lifting its stock market value to $15bn.While it had cash on hand of nearly $37bn at the end of June and a stock market value of more than $200bn, Microsoft has avoided such large acquisitions in the past and failed to push through an unsolicited bid for Yahoo two years ago.Adobe was long seen as a more likely acquisition target for Apple itself, before a recent rift between the companies. The two companies have fallen out over Apple’s decision not to let users of its touchscreen devices view websites using Adobe’s Flash technology. The rift with Apple had helped push Adobe’s shares to their lowest point in more than a year before the meeting was reported.Microsoft and Adobe, meanwhile, have often found themselves at loggerheads. Microsoft has created a rival to Flash, called Silverlight, and Adobe’s promotion of the PDF document format to support sales of its Acrobat software has made it a direct rival to Microsoft’s Office.
104;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-10-07T21:27:31Z;Wall St lower despite fall in new jobless claims;;US stocks edged lower in spite of initial jobless claims unexpectedly falling to their lowest level in three months and September retail sales beating expectations.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,158.06 on Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.2 per cent to 10,948.58 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,383.67.The number of people claiming unemployment benefit for the first time fell to its lowest level for three months. Initial jobless claims last week fell 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 445,000, compared with predictions that they would edge up.The ADP employer services data showed a fall in employment in August, taking the wind out of the sails of the recent stock rally.But investors were focusing on the government-compiled employment monthly figure, the non-farm payrolls, due to be announced on Friday. “Everybody is waiting for the jobs report out tomorrow for a better read on the labour market and, secondly, we’re looking for greater clarity from the Fed as to its next steps,” said Paul Bellew, chief economist for Nationwide Insurance.He added that traders had been watching closely the movement of the dollar ever since the Fed had signalled the potential for further quantitative easing.Retailers reported that same-store sales in September rose 2.8 per cent, compared with an average estimate for a 2.1 per cent gain.The S&P 500 retailers index rose 0.4 per cent and the wider S&P 500 consumer discretionary index was up 0.3 per cent.September sales include the end of the key back-to-school season and many shops aimed at younger consumers beat expectations.Abercrombie & Fitch surged 8.9 per cent to $42.03 after reporting a 13 per cent rise in sales, shoe and accessory retailer Buckle jumped 10.7 per cent to $29.55 and sports clothing retailer Zumiez gained 8.2 per cent to $24.66. American Eagle Outfitters soared 8.1 per cent to $16.23 after it raised its third-quarter forecast for earnings from continuing operations to at least 27 cents per share, above the average estimate of 25 cents.Limited Brands advanced 3.8 per cent to $28.64 after same-store sales at its underwear retailer Victoria’s Secret rose 12 per cent, significantly more than the 4.1 per cent gain forecast.The chain also raised its outlook for October, saying same-store sales would rise in the mid-single digit percentages.JC Penney spent most of the day in negative territory in spite of beating expectations, but surged in the late afternoon up 9.1 per cent to $31.64.But some retail stocks suffered after reporting their September sales.Gap lost 3 per cent to $18.12, after sales were dragged down by poor performance at its Old Navy stores, and Bebe Stores dropped 7.9 per cent to $6.44 after same-store sales fell 4.7 per cent.Alcoa posted its quarterly results after the closing bell.Shares dipped 1.4 per cent to $12.20 during the session but after the miner beat expectations on both the top and bottom line, shares crept up 2.9 per cent in after-hours trading.Pepsi fell 3 per cent to $66.10 after it posted earnings in line with analysts’ expectations but reduced its earnings forecast for the full year from a rise of between 11 and 13 per cent, to a gain of between 11 and 12 per cent.Hotel chain Marriott International also issued a forecast below some analysts’ expectations. The hotelier said it expected fourth-quarter earnings of 33-36 cents per share, below the 37 cent average estimate, and its full-year profit projection also missed the consensus forecast.Marriott shares lost 5.8 per cent to $35.67.Elsewhere, Adobe surged 11.5 per cent to $28.69 after it was reported that the software maker’s chief executive had met with the chief executive of Microsoft, sparking speculation about a possible merger.The stock was temporarily halted by the circuit breakers introduced after May’s “flash crash”.Microsoft shares edged up 0.4 per cent to $24.53.
105;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-10-04T23:04:40Z;Google TV claims key allies;;Google has announced that top media companies will back its assault on the living room with this month’s US launch of Google TV.NBC Universal, Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting are among television industry players bringing enhanced versions of channels to the TV-meets-the-web product. PC peripherals maker Logitech launches its version of Google TV – a special set-top box and remote – in San Francisco on Wednesday. Sony next week shows Google TV integrated in a TV and Blu-ray player at a New York launch.Google has made huge efforts to get retailers, tech companies, network operators and media partners to support its new platform, which could open up TV to other forms of advertising.Its unveiling in May saw an unprecedented gathering of chief executives, with those of Google, Adobe, Best Buy, Dish Network, Intel, Logitech and Sony on stage voicing support.Google said on Monday Turner Broadcasting had optimised its TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and Adult Swim channels for Google TV. NBC Universal would introduce CNBC Real-Time, an application combining news feeds and share prices with the regular financial TV channel.Time Warner’s HBO will enable access to hundreds of programming hours through an enhanced HBO GO website. The National Basketball Association has built NBA Game Time offering real-time game scores and latest highlights.Google launched a website to promote Google TV and announced online services including Twitter, Pandora internet radio and Napster music streaming would optimise content for the big screen.Google TV attempts to integrate the web with TV programming for sets with access to an internet connection and will feature a remote with a keyboard and touchpad. An app downloaded on to an Android phone can also control it.A Google search onscreen for a show such as HBO’s Boardwalk Empire can bring up results including a link to the show itself on the TV programme guide, a web page or a link to the location where it was recorded on a DVR.Google’s approach is more ambitious than that of Apple, which relaunched its Apple TV product this month as a $100 palm-sized set-top box. Apple TV offers movies and TV shows from its iTunes store, web services such as Netflix and YouTube and streaming content from computers on a home network such as photos and iTunes music. It does not mix this content with live television. Google TV’s direct rivals will be cable and telecom operators able to mix web content with programming.
106;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-09-25T00:10:02Z;Tech firms agree to halt anti-poaching deals;;Two of the world’s leading technology companies – Google and Apple – agreed to halt employment practices that restricted each other and additional companies from recruiting their employees, the US Department of Justice said.Google, Apple and four other technology companies settled a DoJ lawsuit by promising to eschew blanket deals not to poach staffers for the next five years. The lawsuit was filed on Friday alongside the settlement, which will need a judge’s final approval.According to the complaint by the antitrust division, senior executives at the companies distorted competition in the high tech sector by agreeing not to recruit each others’ employees by arranging multiple “do not cold call” lists.The DoJ said that “cold calling” – in which a company makes contact with another firm’s employee who has not applied for a job – was a “particularly effective method” of competing for computer engineers and scientists because the employees might not respond to other kinds of recruitment.Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the companies have agreed not to engage in broad no-solicitation deals. Narrower arrangements must be limited in scope and duration and shown to regulators on demand. The settlement does not include a fine.The antitrust division said the agreements between Apple and Google, Apple and Adobe Systems, Apple and Disney’s Pixar, Google and Intel, and Google and Intuit, depressed salaries in theory.According to the DoJ’s complaint, Apple’s agreement with Google began in 2006, when the companies’ executives reached “an express no cold call agreement through direct and explicit communications”.Google spokesman Adam Kovacevich said his company’s deals grew out of technology partnerships that could have been damaged by over-eager recruiting. He said that many employees at the partner companies who sought jobs at Google still got them.The agreements were not limited by geography, time, job function or product group and employees were not alerted to the arrangement, the DoJ said. It alleged that Apple complained to Google in Febuary of 2006 and March 2007 that the internet giant was attempting to recruit individuals and in both cases, Google investigated the matter and reported back to Apple.“The agreements challenged here restrained competition for affected employees …and distorted the competitive process,” said Molly Boast, deputy assistant general in the antitrust division.The DoJ said its complaint arose out of a larger, ongoing investigation into employment practices. Other companies who had been subjects of the antitrust probe, including Microsoft, IBM and Yahoo.,said on Friday that they had been told they were no longer a focus. Genentech said it believed it was also in the clear.

The S&P 500 information technology index fell 0.6 per cent.Adobe led the fallers, slumping 19 per cent to $26.67 after the maker of Photoshop said fourth-
quarter revenue would miss analyst estimates. It said revenue would be between $950m and $1bn, lower than the average projection of $1.03bn.PMC Sierra, the chipmaker, also lowered its sales forecast, saying it expected a maximum of $163m compared with the consensus projection of $173.5m. Its shares fell back 6 per cent to $7.32.Ebay slid 1.6 per cent to $24.34. The group said the president of its main marketplaces unit was leaving the company for personal reasons.

108;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-09-19T19:11:36Z;Groups raise their game in start-ups;;The UK technology investment community was shocked when Realtime Worlds, a hotly tipped video games developer in Scotland, went into administration this summer.The company, founded by David Jones, co-creator of successful franchises such as Lemmings and Grand Theft Auto, closed its doors and shut down its online multiplayer game, APB, last week after administrators failed to find a buyer.Realtime Worlds had raised more than £50m in funding not just from venture capital investors but also from WPP, the world’s largest advertising and communications group.Its collapse highlights the perils of investing in rapidly evolving technologies. But corporate investors are increasingly seeing the strategic as well as financial benefits of this high-risk activity.Failures like that of Realtime Worlds are counterbalanced by successes such as WPP’s investment in Omniture, which returned a $36m gain in six months when the web analytics group was bought by Adobe. Another investment, Invidi, a digital television advertising start-up, recently sold a stake to Google, leaving WPP well placed ahead of the launch of Google TV.While the practice is not yet as common in the UK as it is in the US, more British media and technology groups are starting to see beyond the failures to the potential upside.Taking an active interest in the start-up community is particularly important for those sectors, where the pace of change is so rapid.It can also help avoid unsuccessful acquisitions, says James Mawson, founder of Global Corporate Venturing, a publisher focused on the industry.Last year, for instance, ITV sold Friends Reunited for just £25m having paid £170m for the social network in 2005.“ITV went blind into buying Friends Reunited and it turned into a dog’s dinner,” says Mr Mawson. “If they had been watching the company they could have understood what makes it tick and asked the right questions. If they had a corporate venturing arm, maybe they wouldn’t have had to buy it to play catch-up.”In the US, technology companies such as Intel, Google and Cisco and media groups including Walt Disney and NBC invest tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in their corporate venture funds.Disney’s Steamboat Fund, run by a former VC, has been among the most successful because it has both financial and strategic goals, says Simon Waldman, author of Creative Disruption, published this month by FT Prentice Hall.“When [corporate venturing] works, it’s because it fits the direction the business is going in, rather than being a substitute for core strategic work or changing the business,” he says.“The flaw is that it feels like a good and exciting thing to do but nobody really understands what they are getting into. What you are creating is potentially an enormous amount of distraction.”WPP is the largest UK-based media company to invest in young businesses, but groups including BSkyB, Reed Elsevier and DMGT are also active start-up investors.In technology, Arm, the chip designer, has accelerated its venture activity in the past two years, partly prompted by risk-averse VCs’ declining interest in its sector.“Strategic investors like us need to step up for start-ups, for innovation, or in three years’ time in semiconductor land, investment is going to dry up,” says Bruce Beckloff, Arm’s vice-president for corporate business development.Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive, is best known for large acquisitions, such as that of Taylor Nelson Sofres or 24/7 Real Media, but also does dozens of smaller deals every year, to open up new disciplines and geographical regions.Speaking this summer at a client presentation by eCommera, an e-commerce technology company in which WPP has invested, Sir Martin said he hoped to pay more attention to entrepreneurs. “We tend to go later stage and we should go earlier stage,” he told the Financial Times. “There are bigger opportunities for bigger returns.”For investments such as eCommera, becoming part of the WPP family is appealing because of the group’s scale and contacts. “The customer reach and the international presence are very important,” says Andrew McGregor, co-founder and chief executive of eCommera.Much of WPP’s early-stage activity is handled by Mark Read, head of WPP Digital and strategy director for the group, working with teams in California, Bangalore and Beijing.“For too long, our industry has lived in Madison Avenue and Soho, and in reality the innovation is taking place on the west coast of America and Israel, and [to a lesser extent] the UK,” says Mr Read. “This forces us to get into the dealflow. We do get a lot of insight from the process of looking. It also forces our people internally to pay attention [to start-ups].”WPP does not have a fixed fund dedicated to venture investments, trying to integrate them into its mainstream corporate activity. Stakes are taken in sectors of emerging interest or when WPP is unable to buy a particular firm outright.“It’s about demonstrating to our clients that we are innovating and putting our money where our mouth is,” says Mr Read.
109;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-09-12T16:42:41Z;Nokia’s new chief commits to Finnish culture;;When Stephen Elop was unveiled on Friday as the new chief executive of Nokia, he assured the assembled Finnish media that he was prepared for the long dark nights and freezing temperatures of Helsinki in winter.“As you may know, I’m a Canadian citizen. You may also know that Canada and Finland share the Arctic Circle. That’s something that holds me in good stead.” It was a good-natured effort to forge a bond with the country soon to be his home.But it could not disguise the impression that, once Mr Elop takes charge next Monday, the world’s biggest mobile phone maker will be a little less Finnish.Investors had been pressing Nokia’s board to recruit an outsider to replace Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo and shake up the management that has struggled to keep the company competitive against a new generation of smartphones such as the Apple iPhone.Tommi Saukkoriipi, who runs a Nordic equity fund for Nordea Investment Management, said investors were looking for someone to break from the rigid “Nokia way” of doing things and give the company a “broader view”. They appear to have got their wish with the appointment of Mr Elop, head of Microsoft’s business unit and previously with Adobe Systems, Juniper Networks and Macromedia, all US technology groups.Yet, Mr Elop told the Financial Times in an interview there would be no big dilution of Nokia’s national identity. “The Finnish business culture and the approach they have is very effective,” he said, having seen it up close through the software alliance launched last year between Nokia and Microsoft.Jorma Ollila, Nokia chairman, said Mr Elop’s “cultural sensitivity” to Nokia’s “Finnish heritage” was among the reasons he was chosen. Mr Ollila, who as chief executive from 1992 to 2006 led Nokia’s transformation from a sprawling conglomerate into Europe’s top technology company, bridled at suggestions the company’s Finnishness was to blame for its recent woes.“That [criticism] ignores the 15 years of success which was achieved with this business culture. It’s a no-nonsense culture. It’s about getting things done. We may communicate a bit less but when we say something, we do it,” he said.The appointment of Nokia’s first non-Finnish chief executive would not alter the company’s “special relationship” with its home country, Mr Ollila insisted.Most Finns are proud of Nokia as a symbol of the country’s progress from its traditional dependence on forestry and paper into one of the world’s most advanced economies.Nokia’s rise was part of a broader Nordic success story, with Ericsson of Sweden also at the heart of early mobile industry innovation. Now, as the centre of gravity shifts towards Apple and Google in the US, Finland is counting the cost of Nokia’s decline.At its peak almost a decade ago, the company accounted for 4 per cent of Finnish gross domestic product and 21 per cent of corporation tax revenues. By last year, those figures had fallen to 1.6 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively.“Nokia is still the most important company in the Finnish economy but its role has been greatly reduced,” said Jyrki Ali-Yrkkö, of ETLA, a Finnish think-tank.With most manufacturing done overseas and 90 per cent of its stock under foreign ownership, it could be argued Nokia loosened its home ties long ago. Yet, it remains a crucial part of Finland’s economic ecosystem, employing 21,600 people locally and investing heavily in homegrown research and development.Martti Haikio, historian at the University of Helsinki and author of a book on Nokia, cautioned against writing off the company that has seen many ups and downs since its inception as a paper maker in 1871.Finns pride themselves on their resilience after twice fighting the Soviet Union in the second world war. Mr Haikio expected Nokia to show similar spirit in its battle with Apple and other challengers.“If there’s one word associated with Finland, it’s survival. So the idea that this company will just give up and surrender I find hard to believe,” he said.
110;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-09-10T20:49:27Z;S&P 500 climbs but gains are muted;;US stocks edged higher after a sharp rise in wholesale inventories boosted consumer discretionary stocks and the energy sector benefited from a higher oil price.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,109.56 on Friday and was higher by 0.5 per cent over the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.5 per cent, at 10,462.84, and was higher by 0.1 per cent on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 per cent to 2,232.17, nudging up 0.4 per cent over the week.The rise over the week was hampered by low trading volumes due to Labor Day and the Jewish new year.But Brad Thompson, managing director and fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors, said low volumes were not just a problem this week.“Low volumes have been a systemic fact for the whole market in the entire year,” he said. “You have to look at how robust the breadth and depth of the rally and declines are, and weak volume shows there is not a lot of conviction.”On Friday, data showed US wholesale inventories jumped by 1.3 per cent, more than three times the average analyst estimate.The surge, which was the largest rise for two years, shows companies were confident enough to order more stock earlier in the summer. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index rose 0.9 per cent with Sears, the department store, up 2.9 per cent to $66.80 and homeware retailer Bed Bath & Beyond adding 2.2 per cent to $40.35.Energy shares benefited from the rising price of crude oil after a forced shutdown of the biggest pipeline supplying Canadian oil to Midwest refineries and to a key storage hub in Oklahoma.Chevron advanced 1.9 per cent to $78.82, Halliburton gained 2.2 per cent to $30.88 and National-Oilwell Varco rose 3 per cent to $41.10.But the utilities and information technology sectors weighed on the index.Utilities shares fell 0.8 per cent after PG&E, the owner of California’s largest electricity provider, dropped 8.4 per cent to $44.21.A natural gas explosion on one of PG&E’s lines just outside San Francisco started a fire that reportedly killed four people and destroyed dozens of homes.Some technology shares also fell after chipmakers National Semiconductor Corpand Texas Instruments issued disappointing forecasts and said there was weak demand for personal computers and other devices that used microchips. The semiconductor sector fell 1.4 per cent but the overall S&P 500 information technology index was flat.National Semiconductor Corp, which makes chips that control power in electronic devices, forecast sales in the second quarter of up to $415m, below the average estimate. Its shares sank 6.4 per cent to $12.08.Texas Instruments fell 0.6 per cent to $23.70 after it lowered the upper end of its forecast for third-quarter profit and sales to be in line with analysts’ expectations.Earnings are now projected to be between 66 cents and 72 cents per share on revenues of $3.62bn- $3.78bn.Both Dell and Adobe Systemssuffered from downgrades by Morgan Stanley. Dell dropped 2.6 per cent to $12.06 after it was cut from “overweight” to “underweight” because of weak demand for PCs after the rise of the tablet computer.Adobe Systems, which soared on Thursday after Apple said it would relax restrictions on iPhone application developers, retreated 2 per cent to $32.20 after the maker of graphic design programs was cut to “equal weight” from “overweight” by Morgan Stanley.US-listed shares of Nokia advanced 1.8 per cent to $9.94 after it hired a new chief executive from Microsoft. Stephen Elop, formerly head of Microsoft’s business unit, replaces Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, who was under fire from some investors.
111;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-09-10T19:03:34Z;Apple’s move goes some way to patch up rift;;"Apple may have gone some way to patch up its fractious relationship with Adobe Systems this week but there is still much to be done to heal a major Silicon Valley rift.The former allies have been battling on numerous fronts but Apple on Thursday said it would ease certain restrictions on the use of Adobe software.Prodded by an antitrust investigation and developer complaints, Apple said it would let Adobe’s tools be used to develop software for the iPhone and iPad.Adobe and independent programmers were relieved by the decision, which lets programmers employ the computer code of their choosing before converting them to run on the iPhone.That means that gaming and video applications using Flash can be downloaded for use on Apple’s mobile devices.What it does not mean is that those devices can view full Flash videos from the web, a large bone of contention between the two groups.“I don’t see that coming to IOS,” Apple’s mobile operating system, independent developer Morgan Adams said. “But sites that depend on Flash can deliver an app now – and that’s a fairly user-friendly solution.”Adobe said it would start work on revamping Packager for iPhone, a part of its Flash software toolkit that it had abandoned when Apple this year barred programs written with Flash.That was good news for programmers such as Mike Desimon, who develops online curriculum and had been forced to hire two teams of software experts – one to build custom products for the iPad and one to do the same for non-Apple electronic readers.“We would prefer to create everything once,” Mr Desimon said. “I’m cautiously optimistic.”However, Apple’s initial ban was part of a broader battle; central to which is the inability of Apple’s gadgets to see Flash videos on websites.As web publishers and makers of competing smartphones moaned about the absence of Flash capability, Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, wrote a rare public letter in April.Mr Jobs said then that Flash was the top cause of Mac crashes, had far too many security flaws, and used too much battery life. He also made the more basic point that many Flash sites rely on mouse movements and clicks, and so would have to be recoded to be fully usable from the touch-based operating system deployed on the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.As for Flash-created programs that run on Apple’s mobile devices, Mr Jobs argued that they tended to perform poorly.Tying Apple’s future to Adobe, even without full web video support, has other risks, developers said. If Apple releases a new feature in its operating system, Flash-based programs might stop working until Adobe catches up and makes them compatible, Mr Adams said.But many developers had the same dilemma in assigning resources as Mr Desimon. Flash support for web videos also came recently to devices running Google’s Android smartphone software, increasing the competition.The final blow to Apple’s stance came after Adobe’s complaints to the US Federal Trade Commission found a receptive audience.The company’s about-face on programming tools came the same day that it relented on another financial issue for developers, saying that they could resume sharing customer information with ad networks owned by Apple competitors including Google and Microsoft."
112;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-09-09T21:05:11Z;Positive data boost US equities;;US stocks rose after the number of initial claims for jobless benefits dropped and US exports climbed.The S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent at 1,104.19, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.3 per cent to close at 10,415.24 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent to close higher at 2,236.20.Initial jobless claims fell by 27,000 to 451,000. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time was projected to fall to 470,000 from the previously reported 472,000.A separate release showed that the US trade deficit narrowed more than forecast in July as imports fell and exports climbed to the highest level in almost two years. The gap shrank 14 per cent to $42.8bn, above economists’ projections of $47bn.Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, said the unexpectedly large decline in initial unemployment claims was partly distorted because of staff holidays, and the unchanged continuing claims number showed the labour market was stagnant.But he added: “The sharp narrowing in the trade deficit, however, is harder to ignore, even after taking into account the rising volatility in this series . . . The rise in exports supports the view that the recovery in manufacturing is alive and well, while the decline in imports suggests that the consumer is still focused on boosting savings not spending.“[There is now] a smaller probability of a negative third-quarter GDP but also a smaller probability of an unexpectedly large GDP gain.”But investors revisited their concerns about European debt and shares gave up some of their gains after it was reported that Deutsche Bank was set to launch a rights issue. The fundraising would strengthen its capital ratios ahead of an expected rise in banks’ capital requirements by the Basel committee.US-listed shares in Deutsche Bankfell 3.2 per cent to $59.99.But the broader financial sector rose after Morgan Stanley said banks would be able to boost dividends and buy back shares next year.The S&P 500 financials index rose 1.2 per cent, with Morgan Stanley gaining 4 per cent to $27.01 and Bank of America adding 1 per cent to $13.50.Goldman Sachswas up 1.1 per cent to $149.14 in spite of a fine of £17.5m ($27m) from the UK’s Financial Services Authority. The penalty was for failing to disclose that it was under investigation for fraud by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Elsewhere, deals activity dominated, with 3M continuing the spending spree it began with two acquisitions at the end of August.The industrial conglomerate bought Arizant, which makes products to protect patients against hypothermia, for $810m. Shares in 3M edged up 0.3 per cent to $82.96.Casey’s General Storesrose 1.9 per cent to $43.95 after it was reported that 7-Eleven was the anonymous second bidder which had offered $40 a share for the convenience store chain. Since April, Casey’s has been fending off a hostile bid from Canada’s Alimentation Couche-Tard.Airgas, subject of a bid by Air Products & Chemicals, rose 0.4 per cent to $64.83 after it said its shareholders had been told by proxy advisory companies to vote against a move by Air Products & Chemicals to push out most of its board. Shares in Air Products & Chemicals were higher by 0.2 per cent to $77.95.TNS, which provides data communications to credit card payment processors, nudged up 0.2 per cent to $15.78 after it agreed to buy Cequint, which produces caller identification technology, for as much as $112.5m. TNS also said it would buy back up to $50m of its own stock.In technology, Apple said it planned to relax restrictions for iPhone application developers. Shares in Apple edged higher by 0.1 per cent to $263.07 and Adobe, which creates tools that Apple had previously restricted, jumped 12.1 per cent to $32.86.McDonald's said same store sales in August rose 4.9 per cent, slightly lower than analysts’ estimates of 5 per cent. Shares in the food chain, which hit an all-time high earlier in the week, fell 2.3 per cent to $74.37.
113;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:02:27+0000;Apple relaxes app developer rules;;Apple capitulated to pressure from US antitrust authorities, saying it will give greater freedom to outside developers by letting them ally with competing advertising networks and use programming tools from other companies.The twin reversals revealed on Thursday came amid a probe by the US Federal Trade Commission, which people familiar with the inquiry said had been heading toward filing a lawsuit.Apple publicly announced the change in its programming policies, while also quietly informing developers that they would once again be able to send information on users to Google’s AdMob and other advertising networks.Apple did not mention the FTC’s interest, saying instead: “We have listened to our developers and taken much of their feedback to heart”. The FTC, which hadn’t publicly disclosed the probe, declined to comment.The changes vindicated complaints by Google and others that Apple was not playing fair as its power over mobile platforms grows. They also reflect Washington regulators’ drive to keep up with fast-changing technology landscape, in particular by intervening when companies dominant in one area try too hard to leverage their advantage in adjacent markets.“Apple links its own technology to its own technology. Some people regard that as a major roadblock to compatibility”, said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust law professor at the University of Iowa.Apple has restricted use of its iOS and Mac operating system to its own devices. The company’s online “app store” distributes about 250,000 pre-approved programs, most by outside vendors, that run on iOS devices including the iPhone, iPod and iPad.The apps have been critical to the rapid adoption of the iPhone. Apple still enjoys a wide lead in the downloading of those programs, although a range of smartphones running Google’s rival Android operating system have been gaining market share in handsets.Regulators were concerned that Apple was trying to cement its lead in apps by making it less economical for developers to write programs for both iOS and other systems.Earlier this year, Apple told developers they had to stop creating programmes with Flash and then converting them for iOS use, instead using only an Apple-approved programming language for the whole process. At the time, it argued that Flash led to poor performance in apps. Adobe Systems, which makes Flash, then complained to the FTC.Likewise, Apple might have been seeking too much of a head start when it entered the mobile advertising business this summer.It announced the launch of iAds, in which Apple has helped craft high-end video and interactive advertising to iOS gadgets. But at the same time, Apple said that developers had to stop sending information on their users to other ad networks if those networks were affiliated with those backing rival operating systems – a category that includes Google and Microsoft.After Apple dropped that unpopular exclusion from its developer agreements, Google said in a blog post that the change was “great news for everyone in the mobile community, as we believe that a competitive environment is the best way to drive innovation and growth in mobile advertising.“Mobile advertising has already helped to fund tens of thousands of mobile apps across many different platforms and devices, and it will help do the same for many more in the years ahead”, wrote Google vice president Omar Hamoui.
114;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-07-05T22:24:38Z;Apple likely to spoil Sun Valley’s summer;;Deal talk used to dominate the unofficial agenda of Sun Valley, the annual summer gathering of media, tech and finance moguls.Capital Cities/ABC’s merger with Disney in 1996 and the imminent takeover of NBC Universal by Comcast were both ideas seeded at the exclusive conference sponsored by Allen & Co, the boutique media investment bank.But this week, the chatter will centre on the one invited guest not yet expected to attend – Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple.As late as last week, Mr Jobs had told some associates he planned to skip the event, while relaying to others that he was “leaning against” attending, but was undecided.He has only attended twice in the last 27 years.Ketchum, Idaho, is once a year transformed from being a sleepy ski resort town into a billionaires’ summer camp.But the mood this year will also be decidedly less relaxed than at some previous gatherings. The meeting is sure to witness skirmishes in a crucial battle to shape the media world for the next decade.Mr Jobs is in an arms race with Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, for the future of mobile media and television.Apple’s iPhones and iPad digital tablet devices compete for market share with dozens of devices that run Google’s Android software platform.The fate of a constellation of media executives, whose companies have recovered somewhat from a severe advertising drought last year, rests on the outcome of the war.“The Apple versus Google fight is now a media fight,” said one senior media executive expected to attend the conference. “It’s a big deal and it’s on everybody’s mind.”Chief executives attending the meeting include Rupert Murdoch of News Corp, Barry Diller of IAC, Robert Iger of Disney, and Brian Roberts of Comcast.The pivotal role content plays in the success of both Apple and Google has given the media industry leverage in the platform war. But the economics of digital media in an Apple or Google-dominated future remain under pressure.“The Apple store has been about 99 cents music and they’re trying to drive the price [of films and TV programmes] down,” the senior executive said. “Google starts at zero.”Media companies have favoured Apple’s closed system, which recalls the “walled garden” business model of AOL, when access to entertainment and news required signing up for the service – and revenues to content companies were guaranteed.The lustre of the iPad has also captured the attention of media executives, who have tended to have held off adopting new technology in their personal lives.“A lot of media guys who never got it are using the iPad,” one media executive said.“It’s a different kind of interest than I have ever seen before.”Google, whose mission is to organise the world’s information and to generate income from advertising against content, prefers an open system.Although Mr Murdoch spent last year waging a public relations offensive against Google for acting like a “content kleptomaniac,” his attitude against the group has softened, said one executive close to the company.News Corp has been in talks with Mr Schmidt about forming pay models for news, he added.Google has also stepped up its war with Apple with the debut of Google TV, software which connects television to the vast libraries of the internet.Google TV – which has attracted the backing of Sony, Adobe, Intel and Dish Network – has pushed Apple to rethink its lacklustre television technology, according to executives in contact with Apple.Both companies have failed to rally any substantial support for TV initiatives from content companies.But Sun Valley would not maintain its mystique without at least one tidbit of deal speculation.Disney denied in late May that it was actively seeking a buyer for its ABC television network and stations – but the talk has not died down, said one media executive.Additional reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco

It reaffirmed its intention to keep rates “exceptionally low for an extended period”.Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets, said the move was widely expected: “The latest economic data has been pretty soft. The Fed would not want to make any waves right now.”He said he was focusing on the weekend’s G20 meeting in Toronto.“The G20 meeting could see some fireworks, particularly in the areas of global financial regulation, fiscal stimulus versus austerity measures, and bank taxation,” Mr Cieszynski said.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent at 1,092.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 0.1 per cent to 10,298.44 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.3 per cent to 2,254.23.Adobe Systems, a maker of graphic-design software, declined 7.3 per cent to $30.38 as it forecast third-quarter revenue of between $950m and $1bn. Analysts on average estimated revenues of $962m.US-listed shares in BP were flat at $29.67 on news that Robert Dudley would take over the company’s response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill from Tony Hayward, chief executive. New York state’s pension fund said it planned to sue the company to recover losses from the fall in the oil company’s share price due to the “disastrous” oil spill.The fund said it owned more than 19m shares when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in April.Deepwater drillers moved lower on Wednesday after the Obama administration said it would appeal against a federal judge’s decision to overturn the government’s six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, imposed after the oil spill began nine weeks ago.Diamond Offshore Drilling was 0.4 per cent lower at $62.62, Noble Energy fell 2.1 per cent to $29.45 and Nabors Industries dropped 1 per cent to $20.08.The telecoms sector was the S&P 500’s best performer, boosted by a sector upgrade at Credit Suisse. The broker cited supportive valuations, fallen expectations and stabilising wireless pricing.Sprint Nextel gained 4.6 per cent to $4.52, Verizon Communications rallied 0.9 per cent to $29.33 and AT&T was 0.3 per cent higher at $25.44.Rite Aid rose 5.9 per cent to $1.07 after the drug store chain posted a first-quarter loss of 9 cents a share, better than the 14 cent loss per share expected on average by analysts, helped by lower expenses and lower charges related to store closings.The company reaffirmed its outlook for the full year. It expects a loss in the range of 41 cents to 65 cents a share and revenues in the range of $25.2bn to $25.6bn. Analysts expect a loss of 52 cents a share for the year and revenues of $25.4bn.Rival drug store chain Walgreen was 0.1 per cent up to $28.13 as the stock’s target price was raised from $27 to $29 by Meredith Adler at Barclays Capital.Edwards Lifesciencesdropped 4.9 per cent to $52.15 as Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation on the company, which is focused on developing treatments for cardiovascular diseases, from “buy” to “neutral” .ZymoGenetics, a developer of treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases, added 6.1 per cent to $4.53 as the stock was raised from “neutral” to “buy” at UBS.Chimera Investment fell 3.7 per cent to $3.68 as the mortgage-debt investor run by Annaly Capital Management said it planned to offer up to 100m shares of its common stock.Annaly rose 1 per cent to $17.92.Jabil Circuit was the session’s best performer as it rallied 10.6 per cent to $15.03. The electronics manufacturer said third-quarter profits, excluding non-
recurring items, would be 40 cents per share, easily topping the average analyst estimate of 34 cents."
116;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-06-10T22:06:08Z;Apple likely to avoid antitrust battles;;While US antitrust officials have been taking a more assertive approach in the past 18 months toward technology companies in the general and fast-growing Apple in particular, experts said on Friday that the rising Silicon Valley powerhouse is likely to avoid the sort of brutal legal battles that beset Microsoft for a decade.Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission lawyers, emboldened by a broader interpretation of the law, have been making inquiries in recent weeks about Apple’s conduct in distributing digital music and in barring iPhone applications created with Flash.On Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that regulators had also decided to examine Apple’s exclusion of Google and Microsoft from advertising within applications that run on the iPhone, iPad and iPod.Those efforts will be a distraction for Apple and could help make sure it continues to step carefully as the technology landscape shifts and it faces off against competitors in new areas.But the worst-case scenario for the company and its investors – litigation against an opponent backed by bottomless tax coffers – remains only a remote possibility, because of the facts and the state of the law.On the facts, Apple benefits from its number two position in US market share for smartphones, behind Research in Motion’s BlackBerry.Simply exerting extreme control over that platform isn’t enough to bring government retribution, said Christopher Yoo, a University of Pennsylvania law professor who writes on vertical integration at technology companies.“You have to give Apple its reward for creating an incredibly innovative smartphone” Mr Yoo said, especially because there aren’t massive barriers to new phones coming along. “People who build the proverbial better mousetrap have to get some reward for it.”That’s not to say that Apple’s actions are good for consumers. Barring programs developed with Adobe’s Flash means that some developers who now write applications for Apple and also phones running Google’s Android operating system will pick one horse or the other, said Bert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute.“It sounds like it is more anticompetitive than pro-consumer. It sounds like it would slow innovation rather than speed it up”, Mr Foer said. “I hope that the government gives it very close scrutiny.”Legal action, on the other hand, might not be forthcoming. The marketplaces at issue in the various inquiries wouldn’t be defined more narrowly than all smartphones and could be broader than that, said Herbert Hovenkamp, a University of Iowa authority on antitrust law. Advertising on mobile devices, he said, would “very likely” be determined to be just part of a larger market for internet advertising, where Google is the strongest player.In theory, vertical monopolies raise issues as serious as those presented by the better-known horizontal monopolies, such as the one Microsoft has enjoyed with PC operating systems. The new generation of antitrust officials has also said it will look beyond current market share in determining where economic power might be misused.But the reality is that Apple is among the very few vertical operations with market clout significantly affecting consumers, and regulators are having to revisit dusty treatises on when such operations can be curbed.“They are not ready to rest on vertical issues in the courts if they can help it,” Mr Foer said. “They know it’s going to be an uphill battle.”
117;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-06-10T00:43:42Z;Antitrust probe looms for Apple on mobile ads;;US antitrust regulators plan to investigate whether Apple is unfairly restricting rivals such as Google and Microsoft in the market for advertisements carried on the iPhone, iPad and iPod, people familiar with the move said on Wednesday.Apple has introduced its own network to sell display, video and interactive adverts in the small programs known as apps, which have fuelled the rapid adoption of Apple’s devices. On Monday, it said it had sold $60m worth of adverts that will begin on July 1 and run for the rest of the year.The case provoked a rare public dispute between Google and Apple on Wednesday as the internet group claimed its market-leading mobile advertising network was about to be unfairly excluded from the Apple’s devices.The dispute comes less than a month after US antitrust authorities ended an exhaustive investigation into whether Google itself might end up with too much power in the mobile ads business, and highlights a rapid shift in the balance of power as Apple has set out to dominate advertising on its own devices.According to two people close to the situation, US regulators have already taken an interest in Apple’s actions, though it is not yet clear whether it will be left to the Federal Trade Commission, which carried out the recent Google investigation, or the Department of Justice to take an investigation forward.Apple’s latest rules for developers who create apps for its devices limit the situations in which they can send approved information about their apps’ audiences to advertising services. The information cannot be sent to advertising networks that are affiliated with companies developing or distributing mobile devices or operating systems – a definition that effectively excludes Apple rivals like Google and Microsoft.Such information, including user locations, is critical for making mobile advertising more effective. Google complained on Wednesday that this would have the effect of barring its AdMob advertising service from apps inside Apple’s system.Omar Hamoui, AdMob chief, wrote on a company blog: “This change threatens to decrease, or even eliminate, revenue that helps to support tens of thousands of developers. “The terms hurt both large and small developers by severely limiting their choice of how best to make money. And because advertising funds a huge number of free and low-cost apps, these terms are bad for consumers as well.”Apple did not respond to a request for comment.While the group takes pains to point out that it lags in the US smartphone market behind Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, Apple has already triggered antitrust attention.Regulators have been looking into its marketing of digital music, where it is top retailer by revenue, and its blocking of Flash, the Adobe software.Proving the policy harmed consumers was vital to a formal antitrust argument, experts said.William Comaner, a University of California professor and former US Federal Trade Commission chief economist, said: “It has to affect consumers, not just rival suppliers”.He said it was not clear whether Apple could be considered to be breaking the law, especially because the most recent terms take aim at two Google and Microsoft.Google’s complaint about the iPhone advertising restrictions marks an intensification of its public rivaly with Apple.Until now, Google executives like Eric Schmidt, chief executive and until last year an Apple board member, have generally sought to play down their company’s growing competition with Apple. But in one sign that the gloves have come off, Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, took direct aim at Google’s standing in the mobile operating system market when unveiling the latest model of the iPhone earlier this week.
118;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-05-20T23:08:40Z;Google plans to hit small screens;;Google has unveiled Google TV and announced a powerful array of allies in consumer electronics, retail and broadcast for its assault on the living room.The Silicon Valley company said on Thursday it would launch a service in the autumn that includes Google Search and merges applications and a web browser with television programming through a set-top box or integrated TV.Following a demonstration at Google’s developer conference in San Francisco, Eric Schmidt, chief executive, received strong industry backing for the service as he was joined on stage by the heads of Adobe, BestBuy, Dish Network, Intel, Logitech and Sony.Mr Schmidt said it had taken many years and the advent of software and services such as cloud computing to make internet TV possible.“There was one other thing we needed and that turned out to be fundamental. We needed a whole ecosystem of partners,” he said.Sony is to launch a line-up of televisions and Blu-ray players in the autumn that include Google’s Android operating system and Chrome browser, powered by Intel’s Atom chip.Logitech plans to introduce a set-top box with a remote control and integrated keyboard at the same time.Charlie Ergen, Dish Network chief executive, said the software would allow its satellite subscribers to search across TV programming, their digital video recorder and the web to find related content.Shares in Tivo, which sells DVRs and licenses its programme guide software, fell 6 per cent on the news.The US launches – international ones are expected in 2011 – represent a concerted effort by the partners to grab market share in internet-connected TVs, which were introduced in large numbers at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January.“I think there is going to be an enormous consumer appetite . . . it opens up an entirely new category,” Brian Dunn, Best Buy chief executive, told a news conference.Intel said last week that it had seen explosive demand for its Atom microprocessors from set-top box and TV makers and Paul Otellini, chief executive, described the advent of “Smart TV” as the biggest broadcast revolution since the introduction of colour.“The Google, Sony and Logitech relationship is the earliest, deepest and best we’ve seen so far,” he told reporters.“What I see in the pipeline are other versions, but they don’t have the deep integration of the web and broadcast that this content has, so we’re super excited.”Google and its partners said the service would be free and prices for Sony’s TV and Logitech’s box would be announced at a later date.Sir Howard Stringer, president of Sony, said its Bravia internet video link for its TVs would be maintained, but Google TV was the future, even though Sony lacked exclusivity with the technology.“We have about a six-month lead [over our competitors], we are the first out of the box and it’s up to us to take advantage otherwise everyone else will have a chance to develop a system similarly,” he said.
119;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-05-19T23:55:01Z;Google web expansion set to rile rivals;;Google announced ambitious web expansion plans on Wednesday, involving video, an application store and cloud computing in moves likely to antagonise further its rivals.The Silicon Valley company said that its YouTube subsidiary had begun to convert its entire catalogue over to WebM, a new video standard it hoped would be adopted across the web.WebM incorporates a codec – video compression software that enables the transmission of smooth, high-quality pictures – called VP8, acquired when Google last year bought On2, a video technology company, for $106m.Google said that it was contributing VP8 royalty-free to WebM so it would be a free and open standard. Up to now, web video has been dominated by Adobe’s Flash technology and the H.264 standard, supported by Apple.Google made the announcement at its annual developer conference in San Francisco, where it said it was celebrating the web as the platform of choice for software development.That statement may annoy Microsoft, whose Windows operating system has historically been the platform of choice.To push its point, Google also announced the Chrome Web Store, an open marketplace for web “apps” to be sold by developers and added by users to a desktop page in Google’s Chrome browser. Chrome is also being developed as an operating system by Google.The concept rivals Intel’s AppUp store aimed at netbooks and could be seized on by tablet device makers as a means to compete with Apple’s iPad and App Store.Google said it had more than 70m active users of the Chrome browser, up from 30m a year earlier.Vic Gundotra, engineering vice-president of Google, told a news conference the web was ready for enterprise-class development, referring to the launch of its App Engine for Business and a collaboration with software company VMware on a “new operating system for the cloud” – applications hosted remotely in data centres.The App Engine for Business will allow companies to build and maintain their own applications to run on Google’s web infrastructure “in the cloud”. Google promised simple pricing, a 99.9 per cent uptime service level agreement and, later this year, cloud-based database and secure transaction services. The move will rival Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and other cloud technology companies.“[Google] doesn’t have the trust of enterprise, that takes a while,” commented David Smith, cloud computing analyst with the Gartner research firm.“Part of [the VMware collaboration] is they want to be able to sell their App Engine stuff that runs underneath, plus they say it’s good for the web, which they say all the time.”Mr Gundotra said any increase in web usage helped Google’s business model – nearly all of its revenues still come from web advertising, although its Google Apps offering of applications for businesses is growing in size.
120;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Adobe hits back at Apple in Flash war;;"Adobe Systems is hitting back at Apple in the technology companies’ war over web video formats, with an advertising campaign and a letter from its founders.Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, has criticised Adobe’s Flash technology– a crucial tool for displaying video and interactive content – following the launch of his iPad tablet computer this year.Flash has not been included on the iPad nor on Apple’s iPhone and iPod mobile devices.A new run of print and online ads from Adobe seeks to emphasise its “openness” and explain the “truth about Flash”.It cites figures that suggest three-quarters of web video is viewed using Flash.While making Apple’s point loud and clear, the company’s stance has left much web video and interactive content on the web inaccessible to iPhone and iPad users.In an open letter published on Apple’s website last month, Mr Jobs damned Flash as a “closed and proprietary” system, controlled solely by Adobe, adding that “the mobile era is about low power devices, touch interfaces and open web standards – all areas where Flash falls short”.Adobe says that contrary to Mr Jobs’s claims, the software was originally developed for touch-screen tablets. Its banner ads on websites such as Techcrunch and Wired say it does not love any company that is “taking away your freedom”.They link to an online letter from Adobe’s co-founders and chairmen, Chuck Geschke and John Warnock. “As the founders of Adobe, we believe open markets are in the best interest of developers, content owners and consumers,” the letter says.“We believe that Apple, by taking the opposite approach, has taken a step that could undermine this next chapter of the web – the chapter in which mobile devices outnumber computers, any individual can be a publisher, and content is accessed anywhere and at any time.”After emphasising Adobe’s commitment to publishing the specifications behind its technologies, the letter concludes: “In the end, we believe the question is really this: Who controls the world wide web? And we believe the answer is: nobody and
everybody, but certainly not a single company.”The public spat has become one of the most closely watched dramas in Silicon Valley as two iconic companies argue over their visions of the future of the internet.Apple is encouraging developers to use HTML5, a new computer language, instead of Adobe software, to develop applications for the fast-growing mobile web.Last month, Apple said it would stop letting developers writing programmes for its devices using Adobe software. This attracted the attention of US antitrust regulators, who are considering investigating whether Apple’s refusal to allow Flash on its iPhone platform is anti-competitive."
121;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-05-03T23:55:52Z;Apple faces US antitrust scrutiny;;"US authorities have signalled an interest in a potential antitrust probe into whether the software underpinning Apple’s ground-breaking iPhone unfairly locks out competitors, according to a person familiar with the matter.The regulators’ interest comes in the wake of a dispute that broke out between Apple and Adobe, a software maker, over the latest version of the iPhone software, which was unveiled last month.Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, last week took the unusual step of writing a public letter explaining his decision to bar Adobe’s software from his company’s devices.A decision on whether to open an investigation is at such an early stage that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have yet to agree on which would take the lead in the matter. A decision is expected within a week.The person familiar with the matter said an investigation by either agency would likely focus on allegations Apple operates a “closed” system.In other words, federal officials are looking into whether the company is unfairly forcing developers to use Apple’s own tools to develop applications for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.Apple declined to comment.The DoJ’s antitrust division and the FTC declined to comment.In his rare missive on Apple’s website last week, Mr Jobs sought to explain why Apple’s devices do not support Adobe’s Flash, a widely used video-streaming technology.“Adobe claims that we are a closed system, and that Flash is open, but in fact the opposite is true,” he wrote.Adobe’s Flash has become a de facto standard for the industry to create online games and stream video, with about 75 per cent of video served on websites using Flash.Simon Buckingham, an app developer in New York, says Mr Jobs has demonstrated he is interested in open standards, including the HTML5 Web standard that provides an
alternative way to rendering internet video. Some developers point out that apps developed for Apple products cannot be used on other devices, however.“Apple is making its platform richer, but also making it harder to switch to others,” said Bart Decrem, chief executive of Tapulous, which is one of the biggest game developers for the iPhone.With a big lead over rivals such as Google and Microsoft, “they think it’s prime-time now” to press their advantage by tying developers more closely to their technology, he added."
122;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-04-29T20:38:29Z;US stocks rise on upbeat Fed outlook;;"US stock prices traded significantly higher on Thursday as a Greek bail-out package appeared increasingly within sight and investors took heart from the Federal Reserve’s more upbeat outlook on the US economy.Data showed that initial jobless claims declined modestly last week.“The European Union is going to come together with an appropriate deal for Greece,” said Timothy Speiss, partner at Eisner LLP and practice leader of its personal wealth advisory group. “I am very optimistic with regard to their commitment to this.”“Earnings have on the whole been extremely positive,” he added. “But [in the recent past], we have had corrections immediately after an earnings season.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 1.3 per cent to 1,206.77, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent to 11,167.32 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.6 per cent higher at 2,511.92.ExxonMobil declined 0.8 per cent to $68.66 as the energy producer posted weaker-than-expected first-quarter results, hurt by losses at its US oil refineries. Net income rose 38 per cent to $6.3bn, or $1.33 a share, from $4.55bn, or 92 cents, a year earlier, but below the $1.41 expected on average by analysts.Procter & Gamble retreated 1.5 per cent to $62.20 as the world’s largest consumer products company cut its full-year revenue growth guidance from 3-6 per cent in February to 3-5 per cent. The company also forecast fourth-quarter earnings of up to 74 cents a share, trailing the 76 cents average analyst estimate.Smaller rival Colgate-Palmolive inched down 0.2 per cent to $84.80 as it said sales in the first quarter rose sharply but earnings fell as the company took a charge due to hyper-inflation in Venezuela.Excluding the Venezuela-related charge, earnings rose to $628m, or $1.21 a share, while revenues rose 9.5 per cent to $3.83bn.The company expects double-digit earnings-per-share growth this year.Palm surged 26.1 per cent to $5.84 as the smartphone maker announced on Wednesday after the session’s close that it had sold itself to Hewlett-Packard for $5.70 a share, or $1.2bn, representing a 23 per cent premium over Palm’s closing price on Wednesday.Hewlett-Packard shares fell 0.8 per cent to $52.88.Apple rose 2.7 per cent to $268.64 as Steve Jobs, chief executive, escalated the war of words against Adobe Systems, arguing in an open letter posted on Apple’s website that the technology behind Adobe’s Flash video software fell short of Apple’s standards.Apple refuses to use Adobe’s Flash software in its devices and has banned iPod and iPad software developers from using new Adobe tools to write apps.Shares in Adobe fell 1.4 per cent to $34.96.Motorola gained 3.5 per cent to $7.16 as the mobile phone handset maker forecast surprisingly strong
second-quarter earnings.Bristol-Myers Squibb rallied 4.2 per cent to $25.37 after the drugmaker posted a 14 per cent rise in first-quarter profit, helped by strong sales of Plavix, its blood clot drug, and HIV treatments.It said the new healthcare law would cost the company 12 cents a share in earnings this year and lowered its forecasts for the year for earnings from continuing operations to a range of $1.84 to $1.94 a share, compared with a previous forecast of $1.94 to $2.04 a share.Pharmaceutical group Pfizer advanced 2 per cent to $16.86 and rival Merck rose 2 per cent to $35.25.Fortune Brands climbed 0.6 per cent to $54 as the consumer products group that makes Jim Beam bourbon, Moen faucets and Titleist golf balls reported better-than-expected first-quarter results.Comparable net sales rose 7 per cent in the spirits business, 13 per cent in the home and security business but golf sales fell 3 per cent.It restated its recently updated full-year earnings forecast excluding non-
recurring items in the range of $2.50 to $2.80 a share, a view several analysts called conservative.Visa, a leading global credit card network, slipped 0.8 per cent to $92.82 as
it reported higher-than-expected earnings and raised its revenue outlook, boosting hopes of a revival in consumer spending.Rival American Express was 3.3 per cent higher to $47.60."
123;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Flash video rejection explained by Apple;;"Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, took the rare step on Thursday of publishing an open letter explaining why the technology company is continuing to reject the most widely used format for viewing internet videos.In a posting on Apple’s website, Mr Jobs elaborated on comments made in February against the use of Flash, the most widely-used format for viewing videos on the internet, which is controlled by Adobe Systems. He said Flash videos drained devices’ batteries twice as fast as those encoded in other formats; that Flash was the leading cause of system crashes on Apple’s Mac computers and that Flash programmes performed poorly on mobile devices – especially those controlled by touch rather than a mouse.In place of Flash, Apple backs other formats including HTML5, an open web standard that it is urging more websites to adopt.The letter underscores the group’s determination to keep the allegiance of as many software developers as it can as competition grows among high-tech devices. “Our motivation is simple – we want to provide the most advanced and innovative platform to our developers, and we want them to stand directly on the shoulders of this platform and create the best apps the world has ever seen”, Mr Jobs wrote.Apple products do not support Flash content, meaning websites that use it will not play videos on the iPhone, iPod or the new iPad tablet device. Programmers who write applications based on Flash have been able to convert them for use in Apple gadgets, but this month Apple clamped down and said it would reject such apps from its massive online store, citing their poor performance.That step angered some outside programmers and prompted public complaints from Adobe. Adobe was supported by Google, which said it would work to bring a more developed version of Flash to phones running on its own Android operating system.“I really hope the mobile Flash player for Android comes soon,” read a comment on the Engadget technology website in reaction to Mr Jobs’ letter.Adobe had no immediate comment. More broadly, the war of words over the technologies has struck a nerve among apps developers whose chief outlet is Apple products. Apple has complete say over whether their wares reach the market.Mr Jobs has not written such an open letter since 2007, when he opined separately on the environment and on digital rights management."
124;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;The cutting edge of enterprise stays sharp;;"Out of darkness comes hope. The list of winners of the annual Queen’s Awards for Enterprise demonstrates that, as we emerge from the toughest recession for at least 40 years, the UK has an impressive range of businesses that continue to devise cutting-edge products and services and sell them all over the world.The 2010 list, published today to mark the Queen’s birthday, contains 143 business awards, mixing FTSE companies with subsidiaries of foreign-owned groups and private businesses. The core of it, though, remains the dozens of often unsung smaller companies for which the awards provide important recognition.The innovation and drive of all the winners – and many more – will determine whether the UK really can achieve a much-desired, export-led economic recovery.The UK’s acknowledged strengths, including medical and pharmaceutical technology, aerospace and defence, oil and gas, engineering design, consultancy and project management are well represented.Other winning businesses range from shortbread to folding bicycles, maternity wear, translation, online book retailing and television drama. The FA Premier League is recognised for creating a football phenomenon that up to 2.7bn people around the world can watch on television.As in recent years, the company awards are given for achievement in three categories: international trade, where there are 95 winners out of 565 applicants; innovation, with 38 awards from 414 applications; and sustainable development, with 10 from 190 applications. There are also awards to 11 individuals, including a lifetime achievement award for Doug Scott, chief executive of Tedco, a not-for-profit enterprise agency in Tyneside.Autonomy, the FTSE 100 company founded in 1996 that has built a global enterprise software business out of pattern-recognition algorithms based on work by Thomas Bayes, an 18th century mathematician, wins in the trade category for the first time. Software providers such as Oracle, Hewlett-Packard and Adobe embed its technology within their own.Also among FTSE 100 winners are two subsidiaries of Cobham, the defence and aerospace group: Chelton, which makes antennas, and Domo, which wins an innovation award for wireless digital audio and video link technology that improves safety for bomb disposal teams and others.Pearson, the educational and media group that owns the Financial Times, receives an international trade award. It is the largest winner in terms of employment, with nearly 7,000 UK-based staff.Trade winners from the FTSE 250 include Pace, the digital television technology developer, and Schrader Electronics, a Tomkins subsidiary that makes tyre pressure monitoring systems, based in Antrim, Northern Ireland. Malvern Instruments, a subsidiary of Spectris, wins an innovation award for instruments that measure particles in fluids.Other large or well-known export winners include: Baillie Gifford Overseas, the international arm of the Edinburgh-based investment manager; BupaInternational, the healthcare company;Scott Wilson Group, the infrastructure design and engineering consultancy; and Walkers Shortbread, the family-run Scottish company. Brompton Bicycle wins both trade and innovation awards.At the small end, Innis & Gunn, a five-year-old Scottish brewer of oak-aged speciality beers, has just three employees, as does Vectric, a Worcestershire-based company that develops software for machines in craft industries such as woodcarving, signmaking and engraving. Both are recognised in the trade category.One of the oldest trade winners is Gilbert Gilkes & Gordon, a maker of hydro electric turbines and engine cooling pumps based in Kendal, Cumbria, which started trading in 1853. Winn & Coales International, a specialist in corrosion prevention and sealing technology, was established in 1883.Foreign-owned groups are well represented, including the radar and advanced targeting unit of Selex Galileo, part of Italy’s Finmeccanica defence group, which wins a trade award. So do Baring Asset Management, owned by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance of the US; ContiTech Beattie, a maker of hoses and couplings for the oil and gas industry owned by Germany’s Continental; Sandvik Osprey, a manufacturer of fine metal powders that is part of Sweden’s Sandvik; and Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Networks, part of the French communications group.Manufacturing is represented by a broad range of companies, raising the hopes of those who would like to see a rebalancing of the economy, with less financial services and more industry, especially now that manufacturing is starting to recover from a ferocious downturn.But the list also includes winners from the fields of culture, services and the new economy. Applied Language Solutions, a Greater Manchester-based translation and interpreting company, was founded seven years ago in a back bedroom by Gavin Wheeldon, chief executive, now 33. Now it has a turnover approaching £7.5m, 120 employees and customers in 91 countries. It wins a trade award.Other export awards go to Powercorp International, an independent producer of television dramas including The Devil’s Whore and The Day of the Triffids, along with The Book Depository, which aims to make more titles available through the book supply chain than any other online bookseller in the world, and First Magazine, a publishing and events company that aims to enhance communication between leaders in industry, finance and government.Future Health Technologies, which pioneered the collection and storage of stem cells from umbilical cords, wins a trade award and hopes the market will now expand in the UK, which is behind other countries.Among winners in the innovation category is Concateno, a drug and alcohol test provider, which has developed a mobile detector for roadside drug testing. Ultravision is recognised for its soft contact lenses for people with irregularly shaped corneas, while Salamander has developed software to make military campaigns better co-ordinated – “saving British lives and British money”, it says.Yorkshire’s Joseph Rhodes is recognised for being world leader in super plastic forming presses, joining titanium and aluminium alloys into strong, light shapes for aerospace, and Makevale for its lightweight polymers with uses from dentures to submarine cockpits.Sometimes new technology can assist traditional purposes. Garford Farm Machinery, from Lincolnshire, has developed the Robocrop InRow Weeder, which uses an advanced vision guidance system to weed up to 15 rows of lettuces or brassicas simultaneously.This year’s 143 business awards is below last year’s record 194, the largest in 44 years of the scheme, but higher than the previous two years. The 1,169 applications received this year was above last year’s 1,078 and well ahead of the 683 in 2007."
125;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-03-28T19:22:56Z;Apple rivals ready to exploit weakness;;Apple’s touchscreen iPhone was far ahead of the competition when it launched, but the iPad will have to fight for its place among dozens of other tablet computers that are likely to appear on the market this year.With its similar design to the iPhone, it is already assured of a status that should make it stand out from the pack, but competitors have other features available to exploit its weaknesses.The HP Slate, touted by Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January will run the touch-enabled Windows 7 operating system.As well as matching the touch features of the iPad, HP is emphasising that the Slate offers the “complete internet”.This refers to Apple’s decision not to support Adobe’s Flash software on the iPad, commonly used to present video, advertising and games on the web. The Slate and almost all of the iPad’s competitors will support Flash, which is already installed on 90 per cent of computers and is used to deliver 75 per cent of online videos viewed worldwide.As well as Windows 7-based tablets, the iPad will face a threat from devices based on Google’s free Android operating system, which has mastered touch through its mobile phone implementations.At the CTIA wireless industry show in Las Vegas last week, Marvell, the chipmaker, showed off the iWonder Android-based tablet made by Foxconn of Taiwan. The device with its 10.1-inch screen is expected to sell for about $100, a fraction of the $500 price of the cheapest iPad version.Taiwanese companies may lead in producing iPad-like devices that will undercut Apple deeply on price. Acer has said that it is working on a tablet and Asustek plans to launch its Eee Pad this year.BenQ, MSI and Gigabyte have also expressed interest in tablets, but the lack of firm launch dates from Taiwanese makers suggests that they are waiting to see how well the iPad does compared with other categories such as netbooks, eReaders and smartbooks.The iPad’s rivals are also adding hardware and services in areas where it is missing features – it lacks a camera for instance.“Tablet makers are offering services such as Voice over Internet Protocol, video conferencing, DLNA [Digital Living Network Alliance] and home automation,” says Martyn Humphries, a vice-president at the chipmaker Broadcom.Even AT&T, exclusive carrier for the iPhone and the iPad in the US, is hedging its bets. At CTIA last week, it announced a network launch this year for the OpenTablet – a dual-camera device made by US company OpenPeak and running on Intel’s Atom processor.
126;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Weak housing figures damp US sentiment;standardise;"Mounting worries about the European sovereign debt situation curbed risk appetite, sending Wall Street stocks lower on Wednesday, with negative economic data also weighing on sentiment.New orders for durable goods in the US in February rose 0.5 per cent but missed analysts’ consensus projections for a 1 per cent gain.Sales of new homes in the US dropped for the fourth straight month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 308,000 – the lowest since records begun in 1963.“Housing is the weakest link in the recovery story,” said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of Gamco’s global growth fund. “Real estate makes up about 50 per cent of bank assets. A lot of these mortgages are going delinquent. It’s one area I find troubling, which is why we have a low exposure to financial stocks.”However, Mr Ward regards the broader economic recovery as “very resilient”.At the close, the S&P 500 was down .06 per cent to 1,167.72, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.5 per cent to 10,836.15 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,398.76.One bright sport for the US housing market was Lennar Corp, the third-
largest US housebuilder by revenue, which rallied 3.7 per cent to $17.69 after reporting better quarterly earnings than were expected. Its loss was significantly lower than expected at 4 cents a share versus consensus analyst expectations of a 30 cents a share loss and better than its 98 cents a share loss last year.Gross margins surged to 19.2 per cent from 6.5 per cent a year earlier as the company cut incentives for potential buyers.“Virtually every metric outperformed our expectation,” wrote Stephen East, analyst at Ticonderoga in a client note. “No matter how one cuts it, this was a strong report.”Adobe Systems was one of the session’s biggest risers, advancing 3.7 per cent to $36.51 as the world’s leading graphic design maker forecast significantly stronger second-quarter sales than analysts were expecting.The company said it would launch a new version of its most profitable software – Creative Suite, which comprises design software such as Photoshop – on April 12.Market analysts expect Adobe profit from pent-up demand for the product as many customers avoided upgrading to the current version during the recession.Two tech stocks staged successful debuts, raising hopes for the still struggling initial public offerings market. MaxLinear, a maker of broadband chips, rallied 33.6 per cent above its initial listing price to $18.70 while Calix Networks, a telecoms equipment company, surged 16.2 per cent to $15.10.The oil and gas sector was broadly lower as the price of crude oil fell. Chevron lost 1.1 per cent to $73.93 while ExxonMobil retreated 0.7 per cent to $66.50.ConocoPhillips, the third- largest US oil company by market share, bucked the trend to close flat at $52.53 as the company announced plans to sell half of its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, in the next two years.Coal and natural gas producer Consol Energy added 1.9 per cent to $45.70 as the stock was upgraded from “neutral” to “overweight” by John Bridges, an analyst at JPMorgan, with a nine-month target price of $53 a share.AK Steel gained 0.7 per cent to $23.33 after the steelmaker said it would record a non-cash charge of about $31m resulting from the US healthcare reform legislation. It is one of the first companies to take such a step following the passage of the bill on Sunday.MF Global rose 10.4 per cent to $8.08 as Jon Corzine, former New Jersey governor who ran Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999, was appointed chief executive of the New York-based futures and options broker.General Mills slipped 1.9 per cent to $72.18 despite the food conglomerate posting solid quarterly earnings, aided by new product sales, a focus on cost-cutting and lower input costs.Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee shop chain, fell 0.5 per cent to $25.29 after announcing a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share, its first since going public in 1992."
127;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-02-21T22:41:10Z;Jobs ignites war of words over Flash;The iPad’s missing ingredient;When Steve Jobs, the Apple chief executive, demonstrated web browsing on its latest gadget – the iPad – last month, the video player on the New York Times homepage did not appear. Instead, there was a small blue icon indicating that Flash, the multimedia software made by Adobe, was not installed.Critics seized on the absence of Flash – a crucial tool for displaying video and interactive content – as a fatal flaw of the iPad. Flash is already missing from the iPhone and iPod touch, Apple’s multi-function pocket-sized mobile devices, but its omission from the iPad, which is optimised for web browsing, would be an enormous handicap.A war of words has since broken out between Flash’s supporters and detractors. Advocates, including Adobe, say Flash is integral to the internet and its ubiquity is a testament to its success.But critics, reportedly including a passionate Mr Jobs, say Flash is flawed and cumbersome. They say it is time to rewrite the web using HTML5, a new version of the programming language that will enable websites to stream video and display rich graphics without Flash.“It’s a futures battle,” said Al Hilwa, programme director for applications development software at IDC. “Standards always change, and we’re comparing a future idea of a product with what we have right now.”Analysts say that right now, for better or worse, we have Flash. Adobe’s software is deeply enmeshed in the web. More than 98 per cent of computers have Flash installed and most of the main websites use it to power their video, games and interactive graphics.However, at a recent Apple staff meeting, Mr Jobs is reported to have called Adobe lazy for not working harder on Flash’s flaws and also called on media executives to abandon Flash. Apple declined to comment.Perhaps adding to Mr Jobs’ frustration is the fact that Adobe has been slower to optimise Flash for Apple products. In an interview with the Financial Times, Kevin Lynch, Adobe chief technology officer, acknowledged as much. “CPU [the processor carrying out the computers functions usage on the Mac is higher than on Windows,” he said. “That’s an area we are working on.”But HTML5 is not ready yet. “It’s a standard that has to be agreed upon and that will take another three to five years,” said Mr Hilwa.Even when it is ready, rewriting millions of sites will take years. “Until developers can write in HTML5 and have it work in multiple browsers, they’ll be loath to throw away Flash investments,” said Jeffrey Hammond, an analyst at Forrester Research.Meanwhile, Adobe is aggressively pushing Flash into the booming smartphone market. Last week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Adobe said it would be rolling out Flash on the majority of smartphone operating systems.“We have an incredible focus on bringing flash to smartphone screens and tablets,” said Mr Lynch.With Flash deployed on most other smartphones, Apple, usually a technology pioneer, risks being left behind. “You don’t want to be selling the one phone that has a gaping hole that can’t access most websites,” said Mr Hilwa.
128;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-02-10T22:41:33Z;Indices slide as snow affects trading volumes;;US stocks edged into the red yesterday after Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, outlined the central bank’s plans to reverse its loose monetary policy.However, trading volumes remained low due to heavy snow on the east coast of the US that paralysed transport systems.Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, said Bernanke’s comments over the government’s exit from quantitative easing had weighed on stocks.“Now we’re rallying back because there is no one here. It’s like a holiday,” he added.The S&P 500 fell more than 1 per cent after Bernanke’s comments but only closed 0.2 per cent lower at 1,068.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to 10,038.38 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent lower at 2,147.87.However, the market had already opened in the red as investors waited nervously for greater clarity on Europe’s response to the debt crisis in Greece.Dean Foods led the S&P 500 lower after the dairy products company posted a lower profit than expected and gave a disappointing forecast for this year.The group said it had suffered as high milk prices had encouraged shoppers to switch to discount brands. Its shares, which only edged 0.2 per cent higher last year, plunged 13.9 per cent to $15.19.ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, also weighed heavily on the market after giving a disappointing profit forecast for the first quarter. The group said it expected increased demand from carmakers in the economic recovery but warned that progress would be slow. Its shares lost 7.1 per cent to $36.66.In the technology sector, Adobe Systems rose 1.4 per cent to $32.76 after Credit Suisse upgraded the world’s largest maker of graphic-design programs to “outperform” from “neutral”. Analysts cited confidence in the future of Adobe Flash and the planned upgrade of its Creative Suite product later this year.Sprint Nextel posted a smaller quarterly loss than last year but the results were worse than Wall Street had forecast.The third-largest mobile phone operator has been forced to offer deeper discounts to offset subscription declines, eroding the group’s revenues. Its shares were initially up in pre-market trading but later fell 8 per cent to $3.36.Micron Technology fell 6 per cent to $8.54 after the semiconductor company agreed to buy Numonyx Holdings for about $1.27bn in an attempt to compete better with rivals such as Samsung Electronics.IntercontinentalExchange fell 3.2 per cent to $95.68 after the company missed its quarterly consensus estimate. However, profit during the period still jumped 70 per cent due to a rebound in energy trading.Netgear, which makes networking equipment for homes and small businesses, rose 10.1 per cent to $23.96. The group gave an encouraging forecast for the first quarter thanks to the popularity of new products.Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Dell rose 1.5 per cent to $13.75 after Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded the computer manufacturer to “buy” from “neutral”. Analysts said the group had underperformed since November due to scepticism about the company’s gross margins.The bank also upgraded Tiffany, the luxury jeweller, to “buy” from “neutral”, helping to boost its shares 2.7 per cent to $41.14. Analysts noted the retailer’s potential for international growth and that its January sales had been better than expected.New York Times announced that its quarterly profit had more than tripled, beating analysts’ expectations. However, the group said advertising revenues had continued to decline, falling 15 per cent in the last quarter.While demand has risen for digital advertising, the newspaper group has made plans to charge for content in 2011 in an effort to fully offset lower revenue from print advertising. After early strength, the shares were down 9 per cent to $10.62.Walt Disney gained 0.6 per cent to $30.03. The world’s largest media company posted quarterly profit above analysts’ consensus estimate thanks to rising television revenue and improving trends at its theme park business.
129;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-01-28T20:05:26Z;Q&A: Apple iPad;;Isn’t the iPad just a bigger iPod Touch?They certainly look similar, but the larger screen enables greater functionality. The iPad is arguably the best e-reader produced to date, with its fast processing, elegant presentation, colour and embedded video feature. It is less portable, but its size encourages sharing and it may become popular with families in the home for viewing media.What connectivity will it have?For the standard versions – 16Gb, 32Gb and 64Gb at $500/$600/$700 – there is 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, plus the usual docking connector to a computer. For $130 extra, a 3G connection is available, powered by AT&T in the US, while an international option has yet to be worked out. Users will pay $15 or $30 a month to AT&T depending on their data usage plan.Will there be a new App Store?No, the existing App Store will provide new applications for the iPad, although there are expected to be few available at launch in March.Can you transfer apps from your iPhone/iPod touch?Apps you use on your iPhone or iPod touch will run on the iPad either in their current size or blown up to fill the screen. With games, Apple’s technology doubles the number of pixels to make the resolution look better on a larger screen. Some of Apple’s own apps such as e-mail have been specifically redesigned for the iPad.Is it better to wait a year for a better version?It may pay to wait. Apple has a habit of reducing prices or increasing storage as it works through new generations of products and the iPad, presented by Apple chief executive Steve Jobs, still seems to be priced too high for the mass market. There will also be a shortage of content specifically designed for the iPad initially as Apple is working out deals and pricing with the media industry.What could Apple add to improve the product?The main complaints about the iPad is that it lacks a camera and there is no USB connector nor memory card slot. There is no multi-tasking between applications and the browser lacks support for Adobe’s widely used Flash software.
130;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-01-25T23:47:03Z;Hackers target friends of Google workers;;Personal friends of employees at Google, Adobe and other companies were targeted by hackers in a string of recently disclosed cyberattacks, raising privacy concerns and pointing to a highly sophisticated operation, security experts said.Cybersecurity experts analysing the attacks said the hackers spied on individuals and used other sophisticated techniques, making them extremely difficult to stop. The disclosures come amid renewed alarm over cybersecurity after Google said it had been the target of a series of cyberattacks from China.The most significant discovery is that the attackers had selected employees at the companies with access to proprietary data, then learnt who their friends were. The hackers compromised the social network accounts of those friends, hoping to enhance the probability that their final targets would click on the links they sent.“We’re seeing a lot more up-front reconnaissance, understanding who the players are at the company and how to reach them,” said George Kurtz, chief technology officer at security firm McAfee.“Someone went to the trouble to backtrack: ‘Let me look at their friends, who I can target as a secondary person’.”McAfee discovered that a previously unknown flaw in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer had been used in the attacks. Mr Kurtz said the attackers also used one of the most popular instant messaging programmes to induce victims to click on a link that installed spy software.Another element of the attack code used a formula only published on Chinese language websites, said Joe Stewart, a researcher for security firm SecureWorks. Mr Stewart also found that some of the code had been assembled in 2006, suggesting that the campaign had been not only well organised but enduring.The evidence pointed to a government-sponsored effort that only large spy agencies or perhaps some of the most advanced big companies could have withstood, experts said. China on Monday described accusations it was behind cyberattacks as “groundless”.Sam Curry, vice-president of security firm RSA, said: “This is a loud message for the commercial world, which is: wake up, this isn’t all happiness and goodness and new business.“Doing business on the internet is as risky as sending ships through the Panama Canal.”
131;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2010-01-24T10:32:23Z;On2 dissidents are an example to all;;Back in late November we cast a wary eye on Google’s first attempted takeover of a public company – then a $106m (£65m, €75m) bid for On2 Technologies. The issue, as we saw it, was whether On2’s management had been sufficiently vigorous in its defence of shareholders’ interests.The suggestion had been made by some small shareholders that the On2 managers’ prospective future employment contracts with Google had led to their interests not being perfectly aligned with those of the shareholders. Neither I nor the Financial Times take a position on validity of this concern. Still, the managers’ relatively small collective stake in the company (less than 3.5 per cent of the stock), compared with their rather generous, fully disclosed, offers of future employment with Google, seemed to have created the appearance, if not the reality, of such a misalignment.There were a couple of reasons why this small deal was of general interest. First, On2’s proprietary “codec” technology, which is highly efficient software for the compression and decompression of video image data, is a way of loosening the bandwidth constraints on mobile devices.Using efficient codecs, people create fewer system delays when exchanging YouTube clips over phone networks. Anecdotally, such bandwidth limits had at times constrained the sales of 3G phones in dense centres such as New York. On2’s codec is said to be 40 per cent more efficient at using bandwidth than its main competitor.Second, Google has been so often rumoured to be a prospective buyer for technology and media companies, that its conduct in the On2 deal was of interest to prospective target companies and their shareholders.In the past two months the On2 dissidents have shown how a group of small shareholders can organise an effective response at low cost. The dissidents’ case is that the company’s codec technology is worth more than Google’s offer, and that management should have shopped the company to other strategic-buyer prospects.The leaders, who could be characterised as tech-savvy but modest investors, worked to block the initial offer from going through in late December. Then, at the beginning of this month, On2 holders got an offer of an additional $26m-odd in cash from Google. The dissidents did this without the usual armies of lawyers and bankers that surround the Carl Icahns of the world. They say they have spent less than $100,000 up to now in their fight for better terms.The core On2 shareholder activists are not the blog-first-ask-questions-later screamers found on many investor message boards. As Cornish Hitchcock, a Washington shareholders’ rights lawyer, says: “The disadvantage of the chatboards is all the usual ranting and raving about how management is just a bunch of crooks.” In the course of a shareholder activist campaign, he says, “it is materially false and misleading to make unproven allegations of criminal behaviour. This is a fairly regulated environment”, something not appreciated by the mad bloggers.The On2 activists used public message boards to start organising, but also set up private, invitation-only sites to exchange information, devise strategy and organise agreed responses. William Pollock, one of the dissidents, says: “It is a more professional environment. Also, people on the public message boards are more likely to misrepresent [the] size of their positions.”The On2 activists looked over public filings to identify arbitrageurs, the natural allies of those looking for better offers. One of those, Patrick Birnbaum, an investment director of London’s Centaurus Capital, says: “They found us by going through a list of the top 20 shareholders of the company. They were professional in how they conducted themselves, and had a good strategy.” Right now, Mr Birnbaum seems inclined to accept Google’s sweetened offer. To do even better, he believes, “you would have to have Apple Computer or the Chinese pre-empting Google. But no one came.”Mr Pollock says: “We made contact with the heads of mergers and acquisitions at firms such as Apple, Cisco or Adobe that were logical competitors [for Google]. Obviously we would have wanted them to come in and make a counter-offer. We are not in a position to do anything officially other than making sure the [prospective competing bidders] are aware of the opportunity.”Mr Pollock and the other dissidents didn’t bother to hire an investment banker, but as he says: “You do need a lawyer to advise you and do things properly.” They also used Moxy Vote, a low-cost, online proxy vote site used mostly by political and union activists.For its part, the SEC has been working on what’s called “proxy plumbing” to make corporate governance more consistent with online documentation and organising.The dissidents are still holding out for a higher offer before the shareholder vote on February 17. Even if that doesn’t come, they’ve given a good example of how a civil, knowledgeable and well organised group can do low-cost, effective, kitchen table investment banking.johndizard@hotmail.com
132;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
133;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-12-16T21:45:32Z;US stocks trim early gains;;Wall Street trimmed its early gains after the Federal Reserve highlighted its intention to shut down some of its liquidity facilities as the economy improves.However, the Fed still left interest rates unchanged and issued the promise many equity investors had been hoping for: to keep rates “exceptionally low for an extended period”.Stocks had risen in early trading after consumer price data diminished lingering inflation concerns, which had arisen in the previous session due to a surprise jump in the producer price index.The S&P 500 lost ground after the Fed statement but still closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,109.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned negative, losing 0.1 per cent to 10,441.12 and the Nasdaq was up 0.3 per cent to 2,206.91.“We were struck by the fact that they acknowledged we’re moving towards improvement and their emphasis on the short-term facilities that are going to expire,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “The message for the markets seems to be that the easiest of times are over.”The European Commission ended a decade-long battle with Microsoft, accepting the software maker’s offer to allow European computer users to choose rival internet browsers. Microsoft edged 0.3 per cent higher to $30.10.Intel dropped 2.1 per cent to $19.38 after the US Federal Trade Commission said it would sue the world’s largest computer chip maker for abusing its market position for a decade. Intel futures had risen before the announcement because Citigroup had added the Dow component to its top picks list.AMD, one of Intel’s key rivals, rose on the news, gaining 3.7 per cent to $9.15.Meanwhile, Citigroup shareholders’ losses deepened in spite of a broad-based rally among financials. The shares fell 3.1 per cent to $3.44 after the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority filed an arbitration claim against the bank, accusing it of misleading it over a $7.5bn investment in Citi. The stock is already down 12.7 per cent this week after news of its capital raising.Elsewhere in the sector, Charles Schwab pushed 4.2 per cent higher to $18.07 after the brokerage was raised from “hold” to “buy” at Deutsche Bank and rated “overweight” at Morgan Stanley.Keybanc raised its rating on United States Steel from “hold” to “buy”, lifting the shares 2.9 per cent to $49.67. The optimism did not significantly boost the rest of the industry, however, and AK Steel was only up 0.5 per cent to $20.74.AAR, the aircraft parts and maintenance group, added to the market’s early optimism. The shares, which have risen about 35 per cent this year, were up 18.2 per cent to $24.85. The group reported a higher profit for the second quarter than analysts had been expecting, mainly due to cost cuts.Carnival, the biggest cruise-line operator, was raised from “neutral” to “overweight” by JPMorgan Chase, sending the group’s shares up in early trading. However, they were later down 0.2 per cent to $33.82.The bank also upgraded Royal Caribbean Cruises, the industry’s second-biggest player, from “neutral” to “overweight”, lifting the shares 3.7 per cent to $26.89. Analysts said that they believed consumer confidence would continue to improve next year, prompting more people to head to sea for their holidays.Adobe Systems provided further evidence that consumer demand was increasing. The world’s largest maker of graphic-design programs gained 4.1 per cent to $37.86 after reporting a higher profit than had been expected. But job cuts were also one of the main reasons for the company’s improved bottom line.Borders Group announced it would team up with Kobo to sell digital versions of its books online. The move by the loss-making group follows similar forays by Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble into the digital books market. Borders shares were down 3.3 at $1.19.Playboy slid 9.9 per cent to $3.46, after plunging more than 20 per cent, following a Bloomberg report that Iconix Brand Group had broken off takeover talks with the company.
134;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-12-06T20:18:12Z;Silicon Valley turns its gaze to Wall Street;;Silicon Valley’s technology stock marketing machine is cranking back into high gear. The worst drought in public stock offerings in more than three decades has left a dearth of new listings for young technology companies.Now the Valley’s rising stars are talking of a return to Wall Street next year, with the coming-out of a “class of 2010” that will represent the strongest batch of tech companies to hit the stock market in years.It is hard not to see a big dose of wishful thinking behind the expectations.“It’s been an awful period,” says Matt Regan, a managing director at San Francisco investment bank WR Hambrecht. Initial public offerings have plunged since the start of 2008, with barely 50 operating companies going public since then. That compares with an annual batch of more than 400 in many years in the 1980s and 1990s.For the venture capitalists who supply the money that keeps the Valley’s innovation engine revving, the bad times have been going on longer than that. It is now more than a decade since the US start-up finance industry has returned more cash to its investors than it has taken in.Historically, IPOs have led to some of the biggest paydays. Without a big rebound in public investor interest, the model on which the venture capital industry is based could be under threat.The private equity firms that piled into tech in recent years are also busy primping their best IPO candidates as they seek to restore the flagging confidence of their own investors.“There’s a dance going on between the venture capitalists and private equity firms and their limited partners,” said Susan Mac Cormac, head of the practice that covers renewable energy and other “cleantech” companies at law firm Morrison & Foerster.“You’re going to hear about a lot of companies going public, but far fewer will actually go out.”Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, estimates that IPOs in the US are likely to return to the 160 or so a year they averaged in 2004-2007, well below the levels of the 1980s and 1990s.Wall Street no longer has an appetite for the very small companies that used to be able to tap public capital, he says.Yet even if the actual number of IPOs next year fails to meet the overheated expectations of some in the Valley, the conditions look set for a marked recovery – barring a renewed market or economic setback.The rebound in the Nasdaq index, up 73 per cent from its low point in April, has revived the appetite for tech IPOs and tilted the balance in favour of equity rather than debt finance. “The equity markets have come back faster than the financing markets,” says one private equity investor.Two recent deals confirmed the change in mood and triggered the race by other tech firms to prepare their own public filings: the $650m raised in August by Avago, a chip firm that was the subject of a buy-out in 2005, and the $380m in September for A123Systems, a lossmaking maker of advanced batteries.If these early signs of demand solidify, there is certainly no shortage of supply ready to meet it. To hear Valley financiers talk, the batch of potential newcomers waiting in the wings will bear comparison with some of the most impressive IPO vintages of the past – even 1986, when Microsoft, Oracle and Adobe went public.The marketing hype revolves largely around two sectors: the internet, and “cleantech”.The boom in social media and online advertising since early this decade has so far led to relatively few significant public offerings – with the clear exception of Google’s 2004 debut, which remains the stand-out IPO of the era.Social networks Facebook and LinkedIn are now high up on many public investors’ wish-lists, though both have been working hard to damp anticipation.Having reached profitability and with no immediate need for capital, companies like these can afford to stand back and pick their moment rather than risk rushing to Wall Street before conditions are right.A number of ambitious renewable energy and other “green technology” companies are also lining up to go public, though these companies have demanding capital requirements and are less assured of a good reception. These companies often need to expand production quickly to gain scale, but may still be jumping through regulatory hoops before they can begin operating, says Ms Mac Cormac.“You’re going to have a lot of energy companies needing to go public before they’re producing energy,” she adds. As Silicon Valley turns back to Wall Street, that will represent the biggest test of all.
135;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-11-16T23:37:35Z;Information technology: Aim is to be a global hub for the industry;;In the tiny booths of shopping malls that crowd Santa Ifigênia, you can buy any sort of computer software or hardware you need – from a reconditioned second-hand PC to a mobile phone cable, cut to length and tested for connectivity in front of you by a girl in shorts and flip-flops.Out on the street, vendors wave racks of pirated software and shout out badly pronounced names such as Adobe and Windows.This is São Paulo’s computer centre, where the city’s growing army of internautas or web users come to shop.The other side of this Brazilian sense of can-do is the country’s exploding IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) industry.Antonio Gil, president of Brasscom, the Brazil Association of Information and Communications Companies says: “The IT industry started in São Paulo. The bulk of the corporations are located in the city, so it’s only natural the IT industry would be located here.”Brasscom figures give Brazil the eighth-largest BPO market in the world. In 2008, it turned over more than $59.1bn.But only 2.2 per cent of that, says Mr Gil, comes from exports and that is where growth will come from.“Brazil has been doing IT very well for a number of years and wants to become one of the three largest IT hubs in the world, together with India and China,” Mr Gil says. That $59.1bn could easily become $80bn. And São Paulo is leading the charge. “The city leads the development of the IT industry.”German IT service provider GFT is one of a number of multinationals with a São Paulo office. “We found well-trained people here,” says Carlos Eres, Spanish and Brazilian MD for GFT.The company has 1,100 staff working together on projects all over the world from 20 locations in Germany, UK, France, Switzerland, Spain, India and Brazil.“Brazil is a perfect complement to our southern European centre, the timezone works and it gives me the costs I need,” says Graham Underwood, the company’s British managing director.“I’ve had experience working in India and it’s much less painful here.”Mr Gil concurs. India might be cheaper, but Brazil offers cultural and timezone advantages that make economic sense.“There are 1.7m professionals operating in the IT industry in Brazil. Corporations are looking to improve their competitiveness and one way to do that is to outsource to other countries where your job can be done as well, but at a lower cost. In Brazil, you find the talent to do that.”São Paulo software giant TOTVS has 5,000 employees, a turnover in the last 12 months of R$1.05bn (US$610m) and a presence in 26 markets. It specialises in serving small to medium-sized companies with business software at a cheaper price.“If you go to India, you have service providers. In Brazil we learnt to build the whole solution. We build software,” says José Rogério Luiz, executive financial vice-president and director of investor relations for TOTVS.Adriano Arruda is chief executive of one of the city’s big success stories: online job site Catho. “The biggest companies in Brazil are in São Paulo. A lot of companies are coming in. All the foreign investments are here,” he says. “And all these companies need access, computers, communication, so the IT companies end up here.”Initially a human resources company, Catho, like many of São Paulo’s IT pioneers, such as successful online commerce site BuscarPé, set up online early: in 1997.“It is the inverse of other sites,” Mr Arruda says. “The companies put up their vacancies for nothing and clients pay to put their details on. It is a virtual classified advert.”Twelve years later, Catho has 3m unique users, 140,000 companies on the site and 200,000 vacancies a month. Turnover for 2009 is projected to reach R$130m – with margins, says Mr Arruda, of 30 per cent.Catho grew 30 per cent last year and has 700 employees at its offices in Barueri in Greater São Paulo.But São Paulo has a shortage of IT staff, Mr Arruda warns. “The majority of IT professionals are working. Sometimes you have to take them from the competition. Someone who goes to college who studies IT, has a very good chance of getting a job. There are more vacancies than jobs.”Piracy in places such as Santa Ifigênia is a problem, concedes Brasscom’s Mr Gil, but a problem that is worldwide.“Brazil is relatively well placed in terms of protection of intellectual property,” he says. “The issue of piracy is mostly concerned with Microsoft.”The Brazilian government wants to boost IT-BPO exports in 2010 – from $2.2bn to $3.5bn. Brasscom is working on improving the standard of English and has launched a curriculum in IT English developed with the British Chamber of Commerce in São Paulo.“Brazil leads the world in terms of IT in financial institutions,” Mr Gil says. “All the financial institutions are in São Paulo. The best schools are here. Those are the conditions to make São Paulo one of the most advanced IT centres in the world.”

The last two quarters have been 50 per cent non-media,” said Jeremy Allaire, Brightcove chief executive. “We’re concluding that the total addressable website is every corporate website on the planet.”He added: “We are seeing the rise of video in the marketing landscape. Over the last quarter we’ve seen it pop in retail and e-commerce, where they’re using video as a core part of the buying experience. Retail and e-commerce will be very hot next year.”The new Brightcove platform offers customers more data on who is watching – a fiercely competitive area in which YouTube’s TestTube analytics system has begun offering brand owners dizzying detail on their customers’ musical tastes, holiday destinations andIt is also designed to make it easier for companies to get long-form high definition videos into social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter and onto smartphones from Apple’s iPhone to handsets running Google’s Android operating system.Paul Sagan, chief executive of Akamai, which delivers one fifth of the world’s web traffic, told the Monaco Media Forum last week this year was “a tipping point for video on the internet”. Some 700m people were now using online video around the world, for an average of 3-4 hours a month, and were beginning to watch longer videos, he said.However, the estimated 14bn hours of online video consumption remain a fraction of the 242bn hours of live television viewing.Mr Allaire predicted further consolidation in the emerging online video platform market, where a recent Forrester reports showed Brightcove leading a pack composed of Ooyala, Kaltura, VMIX and others.Only a couple of strong companies would gain true scale, he said. “This market is just now getting to a size where a big company ought to be interested in doing this,” he said. “What are Google, Adobe, Akamai or Cisco going to do?”He would not comment on speculation that Google had looked at Brightcove in recent months, however, saying: “We’re focused on building a global independent company.”Brightcove’s independence could mark Brightcove out in the eyes of content partners from Google, whose YouTube video sharing site has a history of friction with media owners.“The impact of the Great Recession has not been that great,” Mr Allaire said. The group had reached profitability in the first half of 2009 but was now in investment mode, funded by the remaining proceeds of a $60m fundraising struck at a peak of investors’ infatuation with online video just four weeks after Google’s $1.65bn YouTube purchase.Brightcove could benefit from the television industry’s attempts to preserve the economics of the cable industry through an initiative called TV Everywhere which would allow pay-TV subscribers to access their full range of channels online.“There’s an opportunity for Brightcove to power everything that happens in these content companies’ websites.”He added, however, that the group had abandoned early thoughts of aggregating its customers’ videos on its own site to create an online video store akin to Hulu or Netflix. “The aggregators’ products are very well established.”
137;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-11-11T00:50:43Z;Adobe joins tech jobs cull;;A fresh wave of job cuts has started to ripple through the technology industry, despite mounting evidence that tech companies have weathered the worst of the recession and are seeing the first signs of an upturn.The cuts reflect a move to streamline further after the fall-off in orders this year, as well as the after-effects of acquisitions and the failure of some big companies to keep pace with changes in their markets.Adobe, the software maker, on Tuesday became the latest to cut back as it announced plans to shed 680 jobs, or 9 per cent of its workforce.It blamed the job losses on a move to “appropriately align” its costs with its 2010 business plan.In a sign of confidence, the group, which makes the Acrobat document reader and Photoshop software, recently reaffirmed its financial guidance for next year and said it expected the launch of Microsoft and Apple operating systems to trigger higher demand for its desktop software.Like other big tech companies, Adobe had acted quickly to shed jobs when the recession took hold, sacking 600 workers at the end of last year. But with revenues down 18 per cent in the first nine months, the company signalled that it needed to bring its costs down further.Microsoft took similar action last week as it cut a further 800 jobs. That came on top of the 5,000 job losses it announced in January, the first time in its 34-year history that it had been forced into company-wide cost-cutting.Other tech companies have recently announced plans to cut back even more severely as they adjust for bigger declines in their businesses. Electronic Arts, the video-game maker which has struggled with a lack of new hit products, said this week that it would axe 1,500 jobs, or 17 per cent of its workforce. The cuts come on top of an 11 per cent reduction last year.Meanwhile Sun Microsystems said last month that it would cut 3,000 jobs, marking its 10th restructuring plan as it tries to deal with a shift in its markets that has seen customers move to lower-cost, standardised servers.The company also put the timing of the latest cuts down to a delay in the completion of its acquisition by Oracle, which this week became the subject of an official objection from European regulators.The rise in merger and acquisition activity in the sector has also taken its toll on workers. Abobe recently sacked 9 per cent of the 1,200 employees at Omniture, a fast-growing e-commerce software company it acquired last month.
138;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Barnes & Noble to launch e-reader;;Barnes & Noble, the leading US book retailer, is to sell a wireless electronic reader rival to Amazon’s Kindle by the end of November that may become the strongest challenge to Amazon’s dominance in the nascent e-reader market.The Barnes & Noble device, called the Nook, will be sold at the retailer’s more than 750 US stores and online for $259, the same price as the basic version of the Kindle.It enters a growing field of competitors in a market dominated by Amazon. The Kindle accounts for about 60 per cent of the US e-reader market, according to Forrester, which it shares with Sony’s Reader devices.Unlike the Kindle, the Nook will allow readers to lend the electronic books they purchase to friends who own the same device for up to 14 days. Owners will also be able to browse through entire books at the retailer’s stores without buying them, using data streamed over the stores’ wi-fi networks.The Nook appears to be almost the same size and shape as the Kindle 2, or approximately the size of a thin paperback book, and features a similar electronic paper display made by the same manufacturer, E Ink.The device’s 2 gigabyte memory will hold up to 1,700 e-books and will be supported by both free 3G wireless service from AT&T and wi-fi.Amazon launched an international version of the Kindle recently, employing AT&T 3G technology. The Nook should eventually be able to operate outside the US as well.One distinguishing feature of the Nook is the bottom quarter of the screen, where customers can scroll through book covers in colour or search for titles by typing on the area’s virtual keyboard.Book, newspaper and magazine publishers have been seeking more competition in the e-books market and have complained about Amazon’s policy of withholding customer information from content partners and its business agreement that turns over only 30 per cent of revenue to partners.It was not immediately clear if or how Barnes & Noble’s policies are more friendly to partners.The Nook will support the publishing industry standard Epub format or PDB formats. It will also be able to support Adobe’s popular PDF and MP3 audio files and JPG pictures, making Barnes & Noble-purchased files readable on other devices that support the formats.About 1m e-book titles are available in the store, including 500,000 titles through Google’s Booksearch programme.The Nook is also the first reader based on Google’s Android operating system, which underpins its mobile phone devices.
139;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-09-23T00:18:55Z;Intel in drive to create version of App Store;;Intel, hoping to emulate the success of Apple’s App Store, is leading an initiative that would encourage developers to sell applications for netbooks, PCs and other devices powered by its chips.The world’s biggest chipmaker on Tuesday told its annual developer forum in San Francisco that it was creating a platform based on an App Store framework for devices running on its Atom low-power microprocessor. Apple’s App Store, which allows users to shop for applications that personalise their iPhones, has been wildly successful.In a keynote speech, Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, announced support from Acer, Asus and Dell, which are launching their own App Stores – Asus already has its own version – based on Intel’s framework.He said he expected consumers to buy apps to personalise their netbooks and said the concept would be extended to desktop PCs and to smaller devices. Intel is battling to be the microprocessor provider of choice in netbooks and mobile internet devices and sees software as the key to winning market share from makers of processors based on Arm’s chip designs.Mr Otellini said Intel’s goal was for developers to be able to write a program once and have it run on any device based on Intel’s architecture.Intel will provide tools for developers to build on the Atom platform for both Windows and Intel’s new Moblin Linux-based operating system. Microsoft has long opposed the free Linux operating system, but Mr Otellini announced Microsoft’s Silverlight software framework for Web-based applications would support both Windows and Moblin under its initiative.Silverlight competes with Adobe’s Air framework. “They want Silverlight to be successful, so they are being pragmatic [in supporting Linux],” Mr Otellini told reporters before his speech.More than 65,000 applications are available for the iPhone, representing a shift in the way software is sold. The concept has been copied by all the main providers of operating systems for cellphones. With the backing of Intel and key manufacturers, the new App Stores are likely to be similarly disruptive in the PC software world.Mr Otellini told reporters that there was a shift taking place from traditional packaged software to “viral apps” delivered online.
140;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-09-16T20:48:58Z;Energy sector lifts US stocks;;A major oil discovery off the coast of Africa and positive economic data helped US stocks rally to fresh highs for the year on Wednesday.The energy sector propelled the market upward from the opening bell after a consortium of oil companies led by Anadarko Petroleum said it had made an oil find near Sierra Leone. The discovery potentially opens up a new, 1,100 km-wide, multi-billion-barrel oil frontier in west Africa.Shares in the Texas-based company rose 9.6 per cent to $64.85. ConocoPhillips also gained 1 per cent to $46.79 and Chevron rose 1.1 per cent to $72.45 after optimism seeped across the rest of the sector.Higher petrol costs pushed up the consumer price index and US industrial production in August for the second consecutive month, adding to investor hopes that a recovery was under way.While the consumer price index was higher than expected, the core CPI was in line with forecasts and helped to calm investor concerns over inflation. Following an afternoon rally, all of the leading indices closed up more than 1 per cent, notching up three straight days of gains. The S&P 500 climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,068.76, closing at its highest level since October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent at 9,791.71, while the Nasdaq rose 1.5 per cent to 2,133.15.Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, said the market had also broken through significant levels. “Now there’s really no resistance,” he said. “Overseas markets were all up across the board and it just continued over here. Economic news this morning was also better, from the CPI to the industrial production numbers.”Financial stocks added to the gains from the energy sector. Citigroup rebounded after falling nearly 9 per cent on Tuesday. After reports that the government might offload its 34 per cent stake in the bank, it emerged late on Tuesday that Citi had also raised $5bn in government-guaranteed bonds. The move to tap the emergency facility just before it expires could complicate attempts to persuade the government to reduce its stake. The shares rose 1.9 per cent to $4.20. Genworth Financial also pushed the sector higher, gaining 9.1 per cent to $13.14 a day after it priced a common share offering.Other stocks in the sector also climbed on optimism about economic recovery. Wednesday’s positive data added to comments by Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, on Tuesday that the US recession was “very likely over”. Bank of America was up 2.7 per cent at $17.25 and JPMorgan rose 3.4 per cent to $44.65.The materials sector also contributed to the market advance as commodity prices gained momentum and gold approached an 18-month high. Alcoa rose 3.4 per cent to $14.47, after closing 8.1 per cent higher at $13.99 on Tuesday.Deal news lifted sentiment. Adobe Systems said on Tuesday it was buying Omniture, the ad-measurement company, for $1.8bn in an effort to diversify as its core software business declines. The all-cash deal will allow Adobe to embed Omniture’s measurement services into the web content that designers create with its software. Adobe fell 6.4 per cent to $33.35 while Omniture soared 26.3 per cent to $21.88.Bank of America analysts upgraded Amazon.com to “buy” from “neutral”, who said the world’s biggest online retailer would be able to maintain its position ahead of rivals. The shares rose 8.6 per cent to $90.70.Verizon Communications dragged the telecoms services index into negative territory after UBS downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $30.41.Healthcare stocks also came under scrutiny after Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate finance committee, unveiled the long-awaited bill on healthcare reform. Wellpoint rose 3.2 per cent to $54.86 and UnitedHealth gained 5.7 per cent to $29.29.In other news, Pilgrim’s Pride, the biggest maker of chicken products in the US, agreed to sell a 64 per cent stake to Brazilian meat producer JBS for $800m. Shares in the company, which is expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, rose 10.2 per cent to $5.53.
141;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Adobe / Omniture;;"Beware Silicon Valley executives boasting of game-changing deals. Adobe Systems’ $1.8bn all-cash offer for Omniture, a Utah-based web group that helps companies track user behaviour across internet sites, is the latest puzzler to emerge. Adobe wants to add Omniture’s number-crunching products to its array of popular creative software, such as Photoshop and Flash.The idea is not as quixotic as Ebay’s attempt to marry online auctions with Skype’s voice-over-internet telephony. Advertising agencies may well be interested in software that combines creative production with analysis. But the deal still looks pretty wacky, especially the price. Adobe is paying a 24 per cent premium – or 29 times last year’s earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation – for loss-making Omniture. It paid a 25 per cent premium when it bought Macromedia for $3.5bn in 2005 in an all-share deal, its biggest acquisition to date. But Macromedia’s web design software was a natural fit with Adobe; Omniture may prove more awkward.Moreover, while Josh James, Omniture’s 36-year-old co-founder and chief executive, has been hailed as a visionary, founders of dynamic start-ups often depart relatively soon when their companies are acquired.Finally, IDC, the consultants, estimates total web analytics revenues won’t crack $1bn for another four years. No wonder investors marked down Adobe’s shares heavily on Wednesday.Omniture investors, on the other hand, should be happy with the offer, if no rival bidders emerge. One exception will be WPP. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the world’s biggest advertising group, recently bought a 4 per cent stake in Omniture. A full acquisition – currently stymied by WPP’s stretched balance sheet – might have made sense, eventually. Sir Martin has made back his money, and then some. But he has lost the prize.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter"
142;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-09-15T23:49:38Z;Adobe acquires Omniture in $1.8bn cash deal;;Adobe Systems on Tuesday purchased ad-measurement company Omniture for $1.8bn in an effort to diversify as its core software business continues to decline.The surprising, all-cash deal creates an unlikely pair, and will position Adobe to embed Omniture’s measurement services into the web content that designers create with its software.Adobe will offer $21.50 per share in cash for all outstanding Omniture stock, and hopes to complete the transaction by the end of the year. “It’s a lot of cash in a time when cash is crunched,” said Suresh Vittal, an online marketing analyst for Forrester Research.But Mr Vittal said he believed the deal made sense. “It brings together the pre-eminent producer for creating digital assets with the predominant player in web measurement,” he said. “What organisations now have the opportunity to do is embed measurement tools right in the point of creation.”This could lead to a new generation of “smart ads”, Mr Vittal said. “In the grander scheme of things, you finally get a chance to establish standards,” he said.“It positions Adobe to provide an end-to-end platform to address digital media and advertising,” said Shantanu Narayen, Adobe chief executive.Adobe’s third-quarter results, also released on Tuesday, brought into focus the need for diversification. The company recorded revenue of $697.5m, a 21 per cent decline from last year’s $887.3m. Revenues were also down steeply from the second quarter of this year, when Adobe reported $704.7m.The main rationale for the deal was providing existing Adobe customers new services, said Paul Weiskopf, senior vice-president of corporate development for Adobe. But Mr Weiskopf acknowledged that new revenue streams would be helpful. “It gives us greater business model diversification.”Mr Narayen said customers had begun asking Adobe for more services, including the ability to track clicks and views on web ads created with Adobe software.With Omniture, Adobe hopes to create an integrated workflow for designers, developers and online marketers.Omniture will become a new business unit within Adobe. Josh James, chief executive of Ominture, will be senior vice-president of the new business unit, and report to Mr Narayen.
143;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-09-15T22:54:25Z;Cyber-criminals breaching trusted websites;;Cyber-criminals are increasingly targeting trusted websites to infect the computers of people viewing those sites, a successful strategy newly illustrated by a high-profile security lapse at the top US newspaper site.Thousands of visitors to The New York Times website last weekend had their screens fill with what appeared to be an automated scan for computer viruses, followed by warnings the scan had uncovered infections and a recommendation that the PC owners buy protection. Clicking on the offer probably installed a program designed to badger the consumer into buying worthless “scareware” in the future, the Times reported Tuesday.Other sites’ infections have been much worse, downloading hard-to-spot software that steals passwords or financial data. Earlier this month, hacked ads on Whitehousedrugpolicy.gov, the website of Office of National Drug Control Policy, offered links to sites that tried to install “back doors” on viewers’ machines.Website attacks have replaced deceptive emails as the preferred method for financially motivated attacks, said Wolfgang Kandek, chief technology officer at security firm Qualys. Using websites makes it easier to fool consumers and also to evade company firewalls and related defensive systems.The New York Times said criminals posed as an existing advertiser to get into its network. Other crooks are going after trusted sites with smaller but dedicated audiences, experts said.Once inside a corporate computer, malicious software can take further advantage of unfixed security holes in such popular programs as Microsoft Office and Adobe Acrobat. Even two months after the release of patches for vulnerabilities in those two applications, the holes showed up in more than half of 9m machines Qualys scanned, the company reported Tuesday.Mr Kandek said that corporations have learned to fix security problems in the operating systems they use, but they are slower to resolve flaws in applications out of fear that key internal processes will stop working.Still popular with Eastern European crime rings are data-stealing programs sent via emails aimed at a targeted company’s named executives.The payouts from either combined approach are growing larger, according to law enforcement testimony Monday before the Senate’s homeland security committee, which is plotting new cyber-security legislation.The FBI and a panel charged with warning financial institutions about new criminal methods issued a joint bulletin last month alerting banks to a rash of electronic intrusions in which thieves gained control of the bank accounts of small and mid-sized businesses, panel chief William Nelson testified. Joseph Lieberman, the committee chair, said emailed password-grabbers recently led to fraudulent account transfers totaling $700,000 at a Pennsylvania school district and $1.2m at a Texas manufacturer.This week’s hearings added to the pressure on the Obama administration to name the cyber-security coordinator that the president promised in May. Melissa Hathaway, who resigned as acting czar last month, warned a private conference this week that the country needs “to prepare for a digital disaster” such as a cyber-attack on infrastructure that she said could cost $700bn.
144;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-08-14T20:32:03Z;Peru quake victims left waiting for new homes;;"Milagros Collagos Olavarria was in her adobe house by the pan-American highway when she heard a crack and felt the earth begin to shake “as if it was going to swallow us”.Grabbing her toddler Gerardo, the 25-year-old ran outside, where her neighbours were screaming as the heaving intensified. “I was lying on the ground, holding on. The walls were falling, electricity poles snapped and then the highway split open,” she said.Ms Collagos lost six cousins and uncles that day – casualties of an earthquake that measured eight on the Richter scale and affected 75,700 houses in an area of Peru where many people were already struggling to make a living fishing or picking artichokes, asparagus, cotton and citrus fruit.By the time the aftershocks had ended, about 560 people in the towns of Pisco, Chincha and Ica were dead. Water and sewage systems were shattered,
telecommunications in disarray, roads torn up, churches ruined.Two years later, as the region south of Peru’s capital, Lima, prepares for the anniversary of the quake at 6.40pm on Saturday, Ms Collagos says she is one of the lucky ones. “We lost everything, then one day we put our name on a list in the plaza and we won a house,” she said.The lottery of 100 three-bedroom homes, funded by Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s leftist president, is part of a well-worn strategy. The populist leader has often sent emergency aid and subsidised oil abroad to promote his “Bolivarian revolution” and win support for leftist allies such as Ollanta Humala, who narrowly lost to Alan Garcia, Peru’s president, in 2006.Mr Chávez has won the gratitude of Ms Collagos and her neighbours in Chincha, many of whom sport a Venezuelan flag sticker on their homes as well as flying the red-and-white Peruvian flag.The new houses are, however, less of a political threat to Mr Garcia than the rightwing candidate Keiko Fujimori, who regularly leads in opinion polls as potential candidates vie for position ahead of the 2011 election.Nevertheless, the patchwork of pristine white homes, clipped green lawns and painted playground of Simón Bolívar barrio, named after the Latin American hero of independence, provides a stark contrast to the region’s thousands of temporary dwellings.“I’m angry with the government. Reconstruction has been very, very slow,” says Emilio del Solar, mayor of Chincha Baja.According to Care Peru, an aid agency, only 2,000 of the 52,154 houses destroyed in the quake have been rebuilt. Care is using technology developed by Lima’s Catholic University in the aftermath of Pisco quake to build earthquake-resistant adobe houses. “This is the first time we have had a technology simple enough and effective enough for people to build themselves, with some technical supervision,” says Julio Salcedo, head of Care’s reconstruction project.A four-room earthquake-resistant adobe house, with outside latrine and oven, costs between $5,000 (€3,515, £3,025) and $6,000 to build, using residents’ labour, materials supplied by Peruvian state bank Banmat and supervision and training by Care. He estimates the Chávez houses, built by engineers, cost $30,000 a piece.Care has been training thousands of families in the building technique in the hope of rolling out a large-scale programme. “More than a year went by and the government did not approve the model,” says Milo Stanojevich, director of Care Peru. “In Chincha we trained over 2,000 families but ended up building only 150 homes because we had to use donor money to build them.”Forsur, the government’s reconstruction fund, says 330m Peruvian new sols ($112m) have been invested in services and infrastructure in the region. Francis Allison, Peru’s housing minister, has pledged “big change” before December, following a widening of Forsur’s brief to rebuild private homes as well as public infrastructure. He blames regional government for the lack of action.Mamaine, a chef and community leader in the Afro-Peruvian enclave of El Carmen, which still has no sewerage, says people are angry. “For 20 years the people forgot they were living in an earthquake zone. Now we know it can happen at any moment.”Back in the shattered square of Pisco, Jimmy Aicho Romero, a tour guide, sums up the local feeling: “The government had the capacity to do many things, but they haven’t.”"
145;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-08-05T20:19:59Z;Google bolsters internet video;;Google on Wednesday moved to bolster its internet video capability with an acquisition that will provide new technology for its Chrome browser, YouTube website and Android mobile operating system.It is buying On2, a company that makes sophisticated video compression technology, for $106.5m.On2’s technologies have long been a part of the web video infrastructure and analysts consider its newest compression technologies among the best.The company’s client list includes Skype, Sony and Sun Microsystems.“It wasn’t after them for the revenue opportunity,” said Peter Bell, a partner with Highland Capital Partners, which invests in video technology companies. “It was about the core technology.” On2 lost $51m last year.Google probably plans to integrate On2’s technology into its Chrome browser to make it more powerful and a more attractive alternative to rivals such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Mozilla’s Firefox.Chrome has built-in video capabilities, eliminating the need for plug-ins for Adobe‘s Flash and Microsoft’s Silverlight.The acquisition also represents another push by Google into web infrastructure software, opening up yet another front in its broadening war with Microsoft, while also picking a fight with Adobe.In competing with Adobe’s Flash, Google is coming full circle. It was the exploding popularity of YouTube that helped make Flash the dominant web video standard.Google bought YouTube, the biggest video sharing site on the web, for $1.65bn in 2007. On2’s technology is likely to be used to improve the YouTube experience. Google will probably make On2’s technology open source, releasing it to the public and essentially making it free.The deal was a stock-for-stock transaction, with each outstanding share of On2 common stock being converted into $0.60 worth of Google class A common stock, which comes to about $106.5m.Google’s competitors could try to thwart the deal by making an offer of their own for On2.
146;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;SSL flaws prompts ‘secure’ websites warning;;The digital certificates that many websites use to prove their authenticity before users make financial transactions could have been faked using hacking attacks demonstrated at a technology security conference in Las Vegas.The certificates issued by VeriSign and others rely on what is known as the Secure Sockets Layer, which is what produces a small image of a padlock on internet browsers and is reflected in the address bar as https, instead of http.But the technology underpinning the certificates is old, complicated and fragile, and therefore able to be hacked, said researcher Dan Kaminsky.Mr Kaminsky reported his findings to the makers of major browsers and the certificate companies, and all of the holes have been fixed, he said during a standing-room only presentation at the Black Hat USA conference earlier this week.Mr Kaminsky gained fame last year when he uncovered a bug in the domain name system that allowed hackers to wrest control of website addresses. As in the latest case, he worked in secret with software and security companies to temporarily patch the DNS problem before disclosing it in public.The fundamental problem with SSL, Mr Kaminsky said, is that it is among the many security mechanisms structured on top of inherently untrustworthy parts of the internet. About the only thing that has proven reliable is the DNS system for routing web users to the correct numerical address after they type in the words for that website.Infrastructure firms are shifting to a more secure version of DNS, in part because of Mr Kaminsky’s previous discovery, and after that he said a new version of SSL should be based on DNS.Other researchers at the conference disclosed more new methods of attacking smart phones, personal computers and computerised systems governing parking metres. Most of the world’s computers can now be penetrated by an as-yet unpatched vulnerability in Adobe’s Flash software, if Web surfers visit a compromised site.Meanwhile, malware expert Joe Stewart reported that he had broken through the encryption in a two-year-old banking Trojan that has been placed on what he estimated as between 100,000 and 500,000 PCs. Like other keystroke-recording stealth programs, the Clampi Trojan has been distributed largely through compromised legitimate websites that victims visit. Many security programs block those so-called iFrame attacks.But while most previously studied financial Trojans target users of a couple of dozen banks, Clampi scoops up data entered by consumers at 4,500 sites in 70 countries. The sophisticated coding in the program means that most antivirus programs can’t tell if a user’s PC is infected.The information is sent off to criminals who have hired often unsuspecting “mules” who transfer money that has been pilfered from accounts using the stolen data, Mr Stewart said.
147;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-07-12T16:47:07Z;Google leads evolution of browser breakout;;Google’s decision to extend work on its Chrome web browser to include a computer operating system is the latest sign that browsers are breaking out of their traditional mould, amid new developments in how we access the web.Last week’s announcement by the Chrome development team was a landmark in its assumption that the browser held primacy over the operating system’s interface – it was no longer just another application icon on a PC desktop.That notion could undermine the dominant position of the Windows OS, but even Microsoft is recognising a new relationship between the browser and operating system. It has been working on a prototype browser called Gazelle, which would run web applications more securely, through a tie-in with the operating system.Browsers are being transformed with new functionality. Apple’s Safari 4.0 has been given a design similar to the “cover flow” feature in iTunes, where users can flick through previously viewed pages as if they were album-cover art.Last month, Europe’s Opera added a server to its browser. Opera Unite will allow users to host their own websites, share files with friends and stream media.In hardware, Silicon Valley entrepreneur and blogger Michael Arrington is about to launch the Crunchpad, a tablet PC that abandons the traditional PC desktop view for a “full-screen browser operating system”, showing just web applications and sites.In such ways, the browser is becoming less recognisable. Web applications, such as feeds from social networking services, are appearing as mini-windows on PC desktops, using Adobe’s Air platform and Microsoft’s Silverlight technology.Jeffrey Hammond, an analyst covering web applications and services for Forrester Research, says the trend is towards internet-centric rather than browser-centric applications.“The browser is important but it’s the net that’s the killer app, however you access it,” he says.“The browsers we’ve known are the equivalent of the Model T [Ford] – groundbreaking and transformative for sure, but only the starting point of the further evolution of the net.”In the future, users may start their day on the web using very different tools. For example, the forthcoming Google Wave is a reinvention of e-mail, using browser technologies to mix in instant messaging and file sharing in a new kind of interface.Iain Dodsworth starts his day with TweetDeck, the most popular application for monitoring the Twitter micro blogging service and one he created. It shows columns of tweets and the photos and videos they link to, with web pages also due to be included.“TweetDeck has become my browser in a big way, it’s my jumping-off point to everything else,” he says.
148;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-06-17T20:48:21Z;Wall Street afternoon rally peters out;;"US equities fluctuated on Wednesday as bullish healthcare stocks balanced a flagging financial sector, which fell as the government released details of proposed new regulations.The Obama plan would mean tighter regulation of derivatives and stricter controls on capital reserves. This was part of the reason for the decision by S&P to downgrade 22 banks.The rating agency said: “We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions.”This sent bank shares sharply lower. And although the market took some reassurance from the president’s speech, banking shares remained lower.Wells Fargo, which was cut by one notch to AA-, lost 5.4 per cent to $23.09, while Fifth Third, which S&P cut by two notches to BBB, dropped 5.2 per cent to $6.81.“The effect of the regulation is a little bit worrying,” said Stephen Auth of Federated Investors. “But even though it could reduce returns, it may be helpful in damping risk also.”The effect of those falls was outweighed by a strong performance from drug makers. Pfizer gained 3 per cent to $14.58, while Merck rose 1.4 per cent
to $24.77.The sector had been sparked into life by news that Watson Pharmaceuticals was to buy the privately owned Arrow, which makes generic drugs. The deal will cost Watson $1.75bn in cash and shares, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $30.27.Although shares rallied in the afternoon as investors took confidence from positive words about the outlook for the US AAA credit rating from S&P, they fell back again shortly before the close.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 0.1 per cent down at 910.71 and 8,497.18 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.7 per cent to 1,808.06 however.Equities had spent the early part of the morning in negative territory after results from FedEx gave rise to concerns about the health of corporate spending.The second-largest US package delivery company, whose results often indicate the health of the wider business community, beat analysts’ forecasts with its quarterly earnings.But FedEx’s shares fell 1.4 per cent to $50.70 as it said first-quarter earnings could be less than half analysts’ estimates.Consumer stocks rallied strongly during the afternoon, however, with Abercrombie & Fitch a stand-out performer after the clothing retailer said it would close its struggling Ruehl chain. The shares rose 4.5 per cent to $26.97.The strength in the sector came as figures showed inflation is not a near-term concern, with consumer prices rising less than analysts forecast.This followed Monday’s producer price numbers, which revealed a much more moderate rise than some had feared.Wall Street also took solace from results from Adobe, the software company, whose revenues and profits dropped sharply compared with a year ago but remained ahead of analysts’ estimates. The shares gained 1.8 per cent to $28.68.Lincoln National avoided the worst of the sell-off in the financial sector after it said it had completed a $600m capital raising, having sold 40m shares at $15 each. The stock closed 1.1 down at $14.90.E-Trade, the struggling online broker, dropped 11.5 per cent to $1.46 after the company said it would look to raise $1.2bn in fresh capital to boost its balance sheet by selling new equity and launching a debt exchange.Commodity stocks continued their falls of the previous few sessions as metal prices fell further from last week’s peaks. Alcoa, which produces aluminium, lost 3.8 per cent to $10.49, while Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 3.7 per cent to $50.48.Steelmakers also continued their recent falls as metal prices dropped. Nucor dipped 1 per cent to $46.38.Steel Dynamics managed to hold steady however after it received temporary waivers for two financial requirements on $1.5bn of bank loans. The shares were flat at $15.26."
149;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-06-17T14:34:48Z;Wall Street hit by business spending fears;;Wall Street stocks slipped on Wednesday morning as news from FedEx suggested business spending was not improving.The second-largest US package delivery company, whose results often indicate the health of the wider business community, managed to beat analysts’ forecasts with its quarterly earnings. But its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $50.35 as the company said first-quarter earnings could be less than half of analysts’ estimates.Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan Private Bank said that results from Best Buy and FedEx demonstrate that earnings are not the problem. ”Revenues are falling and companies still need to cuts costs, which push other company’s revenues lower. There is no consumer spending power in this economy and equities face a considerable period of consolidation.”This knocked futures and the markets opened in negative territory. After half an hour of trade the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index were both down 0.3 per cent at 909.21 and 1,791.94 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a fraction to 8,501.72.Wall Street was took some solace in results from Adobe, the software company, whose revenues and profits both dropped sharply compared to a year ago, but remained ahead of analysts’ estimates. The shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.80.Concerns over business spending were exacerbated by worries over the consumer sector after consumer confidence was shown to have dipped last week. There were further negative signs on individuals’ financial health from figures showing mortgage applications fell 15.8 per cent last week compared with the previous week as mortgage rates rose.There were encouraging signs, however, that inflation is still not a near-term concern after the consumer price index was shown to have risen by 0.1 per cent in May compared with April, which was less than analysts’ predictions. This followed Monday’s producer price numbers, which showed a much more moderate rise than some had thought.All this came on a day when the government was set to unveil an overhaul of financial regulation, which would give the Federal Reserve much more power to monitor financial companies that pose systemic risk.The increased regulation was one of the factors in the decision by S&P to cut its credit rating on 22 banks, saying, “We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions.” This sent banking shares tumbling. Wells Fargo, which was cut by one notch to AA-, lost 3.9 per cent to $23.45, while Fifth Third, which S&P cut by two notches to BBB, dropped 8.4 per cent to $6.58.Lincoln National was one of the few financial companies to find gains after it said it had completed a $600m capital raising, having sold 40m shares at $15 each. The stock was up 0.3 per cent at $15.10 by mid-morning.E*Trade, the struggling online broker, dropped 13.9 per cent to $1.42, however, after the company said it would look to raise $1.2bn in new capital to boost its balance sheet by selling new equity and launching a debt exchange.Commodity stocks continued their falls of the previous few sessions as the price of materials fell further from last week’s peaks. Alcoa, which produces aluminium, lost 4.2 per cent to $10.44 while Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 4.1 per cent to $50.25.Steelmakers also continued their recent falls as metal prices dropped, and Nucor lost 3 per cent to $45.45. Even Steel Dynamics fell in spite of received temporary waivers for two financial requirements on $1.5bn of bank loans in exchange for higher interest rates. The shares gave up 3.7 per cent to $14.70.There was further consolidation in the healthcare sector as Watson Pharmaceuticals said it would buy the privately owned Arrow Group, which makes generic drugs. The deal will cost Watson $1.75bn in cash and shares, and its stock gained 5.2 per cent to $30.33.European stocks were lower early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was down 2 per cent at 845.60. Asian equity markets closed mainly lower, with the FTSE Asia Pacific index 0.1 per cent lower at 193.66.Bond yields were generally lower and the yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 4 basis points to 1.143 per cent. That on the 10-year Treasury note fell 3bp to 3.63 per cent.The dollar was stronger against major currencies early in New York, gaining 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.63.Gold was trading $0.37 lower at $931.42 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York. US crude prices fell $0.65 to $69.82 a barrel.
150;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-06-17T03:10:17Z;Economic data strengthen mood on Wall St;;US stocks made a modest rebound on Tuesday morning following the previous session’s sell-off.Commodities stocks remained volatile as the price of oil and metals snapped their two-day losing streak to head towards the highs set during last week. Steelmakers, which have moved from stellar gains to sharp losses in the last few sessions, picked up ground once more. AK Steel rose 6.3 per cent to $19.47 while US Steel, which is re-hiring workers in Illinois and Ontario to cope with higher demand, advanced 3.9 per cent to $38.54.Oil also rose, peaking back above the $72 mark after climbing $1.48 to $72.10 per barerel of US crude. That lifted energy producers, including ConocoPhillips, which was 1.9 per cent up at $43.90 and Schlumberger, which rose 1.3 per cent to $59.32.The rising price of commodities, and especially oil, was shown to have pushed inflation up in May as the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from April. But this was much more moderate than analysts had predicted, easing fears that inflation could hamper stocks later in the year.Economists said inflation remained a distant threat. “The continued moderation in the growth of broad money suggests there is little reason to fear that the Fed’s quantitative easing will lead to sharply higher inflation and interest rates,” wrote Capital Economics.Equities were also boosted by figures showing that builders started work on 532,000 homes in May compared with expectations of just 508,000. This lifted homebuilders before the bell after they were some of the previous session’s heaviest fallers, following an unexpected dip in confidence in the sector. Lennar picked up 6.6 per cent to $8.12 and DR Horton gained 3.1 per cent to $9.68.The positive economic data saw futures extend their early gains, but they fell again shortly before the open after industrial production in May was shown to have fallen more than expected. The markets then opened just about in positive territory.After half an hour of trade the benchmark S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent up at 927.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 8,634.81 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.8 per cent to 1,830.06.Best Buy, the biggest US electronics retailer, slipped after reporting earnings roughly in line with analysts’ expectations. The company was expected to benefit from the demise of Circuit City, one of its main competitors, and even though it maintained its full year guidance, the shares fell 4 per cent to $37.11.Meanwhile shares in Adobe rose ahead of its earnings, which were due out after the bell. The company said it would start charging for the online version of its Acrobat reader program after moving the product out of public testing stage. The shares advanced 0.4 per cent to $28.93.Citigroup slipped 0.6 per cent to $3.35 after Vikram Pandit, the chief executive, told the Detroit Economic Club’s National Summit that companies were going to have to look away from American consumption for growth drivers as the US faces slower growth and less credit. The fall came in spite of reports that five companies were in the bidding for its Japanese asset management arm, a deal which could earn the bank $1bn.The telecoms sector suffered a difficult morning after Barclays Capital said investors were likely to move out of the sector, with continuing high unemployment making growth difficult to achieve. Barcap downgraded AT&T, which fell 1.1 per cent to $24.38 but retained its overweight rating on rival Verizon, despite cutting its price target to $34. Verizon’s shares were a fraction lower at $29.72.Research in Motion, meanwhile, maker of the Blackberry mobile device, unveiled a new model which aims to compete globally with Apple’s iPhone. Its shares gained 3.1 per cent to $82.86.Amgen, the Nasdaq-listed biotechnology company, climbed 2.5 per cent to $50.69 after its shares were upgraded by the broker Sanford Bernstein, which said revenues and earnings should re-accelerate over the next year.European stocks were higher early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was up 0.2 per cent at 865.01. Asian equity markets slid for a second consecutive session, with the Hang Seng index losing 3.1 per cent to 17,946.48.Bond yields were up, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note rising 2 basis points to 1.24 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note gaining 3bp to 3.74 per cent.The dollar was weaker against major currencies early in New York, losing 0.6 per cent against sterling to $1.64.Gold was trading $0.67 higher at $934.48 per troy ounce.Oil prices were up early in New York. US crude prices were $1.48 higher at $72.10 a barrel.
151;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-05-04T20:52:26Z;S&P tops 900 as investors return to banks;;US stocks surged on Monday, taking the benchmark S&P 500 above 900 points and into positive territory for the year, in a day dominated by rumour surrounding the government’s stress tests on banks.Citigroup and Bank of America are both believed to working on plans to raise $10bn of capital, while they, and at least two other lenders, are still contesting the government’s findings on the strength of their balance sheets. Bank of America denied that it was working on a $10bn plan.But banking stocks extended early rallies after Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the Obama administration, said banks would be expected to raise money needed to pass the tests privately rather than go to the government.With many analysts saying further government involvement would come with heavier regulation, investors took confidence from the news.Citigroup’s shares rose 7.7 per cent to $3.20, while Bank of America jumped 19.3 per cent to $10.38 and JPMorgan climbed 10.2 per cent to $35.79.Wells Fargo leapt 23.7 per cent to $24.25 after Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, called it a “fabulous” bank, even though Associated Press reported the government wanted it to boost its capital reserves.Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, said that if banks needed to raise capital to pass the government’s tests, it would be bad news for existing shareholders no matter how it is done.“People are living in a dream world right now,” he said. “Shareholders are going to be so diluted. There is no way I would buy American banks at this level.”The gains were extended by figures showing that sales of existing homes had risen unexpectedly in March, providing signs that the housing market could be nearing a bottom.The S&P rose 3.4 per cent to 907.24, the first time it has closed above 900 since early January, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.6 per cent to 8,426.74 points. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.6 per cent to 1,763.56 points.China’s manufacturing expanded in April for the first time in nine months, helping push up metals prices and shares in US metal producers.Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, rose 9.4 per cent to $48.64, while Alcoa gained 6.9 per cent to $10.36.This added to optimism from Sprint Nextel the mobile network operator. The group reported a surprise profit on Monday as cost-cutting efforts added to stronger-than-expected revenues, driven by customers joining its cheaper plans. The company’s shares rose 7.1 per cent to $5.General Motors advanced in the morning after Sergio Marchionne, Fiat chief executive, said he wanted to purchase GM’s European operations by the end of May to create a European supergroup. But its shares later drifted and closed flat for the session at $1.81.There was good news for retailers, as Barclays raised its price target on both JC Penneyand Target on which it also raised its earnings outlook for 2009 and 2010. JC Penney, which Barclays said should recover its margins on the back of lean inventories, gained 5.1 per cent to $32.59.Even though Target was downgraded by Bank of America, which said the group might struggle to keep sale numbers and prices at current levels, it managed to rise 1.3 per cent to $40.55.Pepsi Bottling Group rejected a bid of $29.50 a share from Pepsico to buy up the remaining shares in the group, calling it “grossly inadequate”.Pepsi fell 1.4 per cent to $49.10 on the news, but Pepsi Bottling Group per cent gained 0.3 per cent to $31.50.There was a mixed picture for technology. Adobe, the software maker, was downgraded by Citi and UBS, which both said the stock was unlikely to move higher after the recent rally. It fell 2.8 per cent to $26.69.Intel, the chipmaker, rose after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to “overweight” from “equal weight”, saying orders would improve. It rose 5.4 per cent to $16.66.“The rally is being overdone,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at thinkorswim.“If we continue higher, we will have to sell off before Thursday or the results of the stress test could work against us.”
152;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-02-14T03:33:46Z;Mobile devices a luxury no more;;"The growth of mobile broadband is transforming the kind of content that can be offered to consumers on a handset. But there is still work to do to convince the mass market.Social networking, music downloads and mapping applications were services that, just two years ago, either were not possible on a mobile or were hugely expensive. – both to the content providers and users. “We can now do it very cost effectively,” says Rich Holdsworth, the chief technology officer of optimisation specialists, Wapple.The media industry is keen to seize this opportunity for enhanced mobile content, and this is resulting in what Olaf Swantee, the head of Orange’s global mobile operations, describes as an “explosion” of content designed specifically for the mobile internet.Gaming companies, for example, are developing rich-media games that allow users to link with each other on the move bringing functionality on a par with devices linked to a PC or television. “Handsets can now offer a connected experience, much more like a gaming console,” says Barry Cottle, chief executive of EA Mobile, a division of the gaming company Electronic Arts.This new supply of content is starting to find consumers. Since Apple launched its iPhone App Store – a site with dedicated iPhone applications covering categories from entertainment to finance and social networking – in May 2008, it has had 500m downloads and has generated $120m in revenues, according to publisher Informa.Jin Lee, managing director for the communications and high technology group at consultancy Accenture, points out that Apple went from offering 500 applications to 10,000 in less than six months. “That’s all happening during the downturn,” he says. “This indicates consumers are relying more on their mobile phones as a needed device rather than a luxury, even now.”It is not just the “iPhone” effect, says Mr Swantee at Orange: content consumption using dongles [gadgets that control wireless access] attached to laptops, as well as other handsets, has also been on the rise. He points out that in Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe, usage on its mobile broadband network is as high as in the rest of Orange’s footprint in Europe. “We are seeing the same average revenue per user there as we are in our other markets,” he says. “Mobile broadband is taking off in every country, whether it is a highly developed or underdeveloped market.”Yet even with faster networks and better devices, the industry is scrambling to keep up with the changes underway on the fixed internet, which is also becoming a richer experience.Only a couple of years ago, the size of an average web page was 100 kilobytes; today it’s 350KB. “That trend will not change. Things are only getting more sophisticated,” says Randy Cavaiani, vice president, marketing and business development for Novarra, which, like Wapple, optimises the internet for mobiles. “Functions such as RSS feeds and viral tools work well on the laptop, but the challenge is delivering all that over the limited functionality of a handset.”Indeed, most phones still lack some of the most common applications used for streaming video and audio on the internet, such as Flash from Adobe, which appears on most websites, but cannot be read by the majority of devices on the market. Danny Winokur, senior director of business development in the platform business unit at Adobe says the company’s mobile version of the application, Flash Lite, is starting to see widespread adoption on handsets but he added that full Flash has had “limited success”. He says the company is developing a full Flash version that will work on handsets “by the end of this year”.The mobile world also remains highly complex: a popular destination on the mobile web can attract up to 50,000 unique combinations of phones and browsers, which means formatting content 50,000 different ways to make it user-friendly, says Mr Cavaiani at Novarra.“The challenge continues to be fragmentation,” says Mr Cottle at EA. “Everyone believed that we would consolidate on a single platform but today we have even more handsets, platforms, and capabilities.”For now, says Mitch Lazar, managing director in Europe for Connected Life, Yahoo’s mobile and broadband service, the focus will have to be on mobile-specific content, or “using your mobile to get show times and cinema locations rather than the movie itself”.He says: “The priority now is for publishers to think about mobile first experiences. It’s not about taking the PC and shoving it into the phone. It’s about how best to develop the real estate and the experience to engage the audience.”"
153;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2009-01-10T02:20:51Z;Icing on gingerbread;;"Lovely, scented Santa Fe where in winter the air smells of pine and cedar. Where ristras of bright red chillies hang over every wall. And where, on top of the adobe buildings, the farolitos – traditionally votive candles in brown paper bags, now plastic bags with electric lights inside – flicker at night.In the summer, Santa Fe, capital of New Mexico, is packed with tourists, shopping, eating, heading for the opera just outside town. But in the winter it belongs to me. A handful of visitors amble around the central plaza, or into the galleries and shops, or the hidden courtyards. A few Native Americans huddle under blankets, selling turquoise and silver in the arcades along the 17th-century Palace of the Governors. The air at 7,000ft is as heady and clean as iced gin. More often than not on these deep cold winter days, the sky is an endless blue bowl, the sun intense.I smell the delicious aroma of Café Pasqual even before I turn the corner and see it. This café is a popular spot – where I come to eat a breakfast of huevos motuleños, eggs over easy on corn tortillas with black beans and sautéed banana – but at this time of year there is no queue for tables.The exact date when Santa Fe was founded is disputed, so there will be celebrations this year and next. This is a small city, with 70,000 inhabitants, but it has the grandeur of its age. At night in the winter you can just about imagine conquistadores roaming the wild landscape, establishing Santa Fe as the northernmost outpost of the Spanish empire in the Americas.Even earlier there were the Anasazi, who made their home outside Santa Fe at Chaco Canyon where they lived in exquisitely sophisticated multi-storeyed pueblos. I like to think of them as early Manhattanites. Then, in some 13th-century apocalyptic version of 9/11, they simply vanished. No one is quite sure why. In the winter you can visit the canyon, untroubled by anyone except the spirits.In his book Mornings in Mexico, DH Lawrence wrote of his Taos ranch just up the road from Santa Fe: “In a cold like this, the stars snap like distant coyotes, beyond the moon …And the place heaves with ghosts.”When the low, cold light glints off the city, Santa Fe takes on a gilded patina. Dusk comes on fast, the sky turns pink, gold, then black. The moon, big, white, strange, hangs low over the mountains – the Sangre de Cristo, the Jemez – at the edge of town. The scene reminds me of Ansel Adams’ most famous photograph, “Moonrise, Hernandez, NM”. Adams was on his way back to Santa Fe after a disappointing day of photography when he saw it – the mountains, the moon – and just took the picture. It was late afternoon at the very end of October. Winter was coming.I try to arrive in Santa Fe late at night, always hoping for snow. As much as anything, for me, Santa Fe is about the thrill of the return, about holding my breath to make sure nothing has changed. I’m like a kid yearning for the rituals of past trips in places I love.In Santa Fe I stay at the Inn of the Anasazi where a log fire burns in the lobby. In my room, the bleached wood four-poster is made up with local blankets and fine, crisp Italian linen. The easy chair is covered in brown and white cowhide, the rugs and art are south-western, there’s a fire in the kiva fireplace. If I contact the right spirits – I’m not usually much on animal spirits or crystals, but this is Santa Fe – it snows overnight. In the morning the snow is on the adobe buildings, icing sugar on gingerbread. But even as I head out for coffee, the sun rises, the snow begins to melt.Almost all the houses are adobe, so are most of the galleries and cafés, which pack the elegant city centre and wind up Canyon Road. This is a liberal, arty town of painters, sculptors, jewellers, shopkeepers, real estate novelists (to steal a line from Billy Joel), retirees, rebels with money who bask in the memory of Georgia O’Keeffe on the back of a motorbike. There is also, and importantly, a traditional Hispanic culture; a lot of people are bilingual. Months after the presidential election, in the windows of most houses there are still signs that read “Obamanos”.The adobe architecture gives the city its coherence. Starting in about 1912, when Santa Fe was a dying town, when the railway had passed it by, some of its citizens got together and marketed it as exotic, romantic, artistic, as “the city different”. It was part of the beginning of the “Pueblo Revival” and the idea of living in the sort of buildings native Americans had lived in for millennia.Over the decades, the style grew. With it came a local cuisine, part Mexican, part European, part American. Santa Fe boasts some of the best food in America outside New York and New Orleans and in winter the warming, spicy dishes come into their own.Santa Fe style is kiva fireplaces, gilded folk art icons, distressed wooden doors in thrilling turquoise and green, hammered tin mirrors, elaborate crosses. There’s a cross above the fireplace in my room at the inn. Santa Fe, the city of the Holy Faith, grew up as and remains a Catholic city, and the great cathedral soars in the city centre. But this is also where Michael Linder, who owns a shop where I buy a gold charm, reveals he is the cantor in two of Santa Fe’s synagogues. And that he does “Ave Maria” in the cathedral at the request of his pal the bishop. In his western dude shirt, Michael, who came to Santa Fe by chance decades ago, sings me an exquisite sample in Latin.Santa Fe’s shops are filled with jewellery, photographs, rugs, objets, some kitsch, some very fine. Some people – snobs, mostly – tell me Santa Fe is just a theme park, Disney for adults, that it was made up, invented, contained, by a fantasy of the past. But so what? Its Museum of International Folk Art is the best in the world and its permanent exhibits include wondrous artefacts, beaded African rhinos, toy cars made out of tin cans, punched tin hearts from Mexico. So what if the farolitos on the building tops are plastic bags with electric lights inside?I love Santa Fe precisely because it is man-made, all art and artifice. But, then, so are Venice, and Havana, and Manhattan. I love Santa Fe the way a child loves fairy tales or magic, or, indeed, Disney. I love it in winter, and which city is not better in the off-season, when it’s cold and sunny? For a few days, every winter, Santa Fe makes me feel that I’ve dropped back through a shining rabbit hole into a not quite real city, all lit up and smelling sweet.Reggie Nadelson’s new thriller ‘Londongrad’ is published later this year………………………………………………DetailsGetting there: By air to Albuquerque, New Mexico (via Houston or Denver), then 50 miles north on Interstate 25.Hotels

154;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2008-12-21T19:02:52Z;Christmas shut-down in Silicon Valley;;Workers at some of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies will find themselves spending an uncommonly long time with their families this Christmas as the technology industry responds to the downturn with office and factory closures and enforced holidays.Usually limited to traditional manufacturing industries such as the ailing carmakers, the year-end shut-down is this year sweeping through the office suites and research and development labs of information-age companies.Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, Advanced Micro Devices, Texas Instruments, Dell, Adobe and CSC are among the tech industry heavyweights to be taking a break, with some closed from December 22 until January 5.HP said: “The only workers left to keep the lights on will be those involved in “critical customer support”.The shut-down has been forced by belt-tightening across the sector as corporate and individual customers cut back on spending.The wider cost-cutting has hit even Google, the latest emblem of Silicon Valley prosperity. The internet seach engine has trimmed spending on its famed perks with steps such as cutting the number of restaurants on its campus open in the evening.In spite of the enforced leisure, workers will be hit directly by the closures, with most required to use up part of their holiday entitlement or, if they do not have the days to spare, take unpaid leave.Given that many US workers receive only 10 days of vacation a year, the effect will be biggest there, although most of the companies to close say they will be halting operations worldwide.HP said six days of its two-week shutdown would count against workers’ annual vacation entitlement, while technology services company CSC said employees would be docked seven days’ holiday.One Valley executive said: “Man, is it ugly out there”.He said the pain had spread from the wider economy in recent weeks. “It was nice to see record earnings for high-tech companies in the first three quarters during a so-called recession, and then the wheels fell off in October.”Chip companies and other component makers have taken the brunt of the initial downturn in tech demand, as makers of hardware such as computers and routers have reduced orders in anticipation of deeper problems next year.The iSuppli research company warned last week that excess semiconductor stockpiles in the global electronics supply chain were likely to nearly triple in the fourth quarter.Advanced Micro Devices, the microprocessor maker based in Silicon Valley, said its workforce had been told to take five days’ mandatory vacation in the fourth quarter.Elsewhere, Texas Instruments is temporarily closing many of its factories to run down its inventories. With its manufacturing operation running at only about 45 per cent of capacity, the Dallas-based company says such levels had not been seen since the second half of 2001.
155;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2008-12-17T22:17:09Z;Wall St falls as rate cut euphoria fizzles;;"Macy’s helped consumer discretionary stocks find positive territory on Wall Street on Wednesday as the wider market fell from its monthly high after the company quashed fears over its ability to repay debt.The shares soared 18.2 per cent to $10.01 on the back of plans to amend covenant terms on its $2bn credit facility, led by Bank of America and JP Morgan. Nordstrom, another department store chain, bounced 6.5 per cent to $13.98 and the retail sector stood 1.8 per cent higher overall, helping pare the market’s losses.“It’s a good sign for the retailers, that’s for sure,” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global. He said the move could be a sign that banks were “being a little bit less restrictive”.The market overall failed to hold gains enjoyed in the previous session, when the Federal Reserve’s historic move to cut rates to virtually zero spurred a 5.1 per cent rally in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 closed down 1 per cent on Wednesday at 904.42 after drifting between positive and negative territory throughout the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.1 per cent lower at 8,824.34 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.7 per cent weaker at 1,579.31.Trading was largely muted, however, as investors digested the effects of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate policy.Financials finished 1.3 per cent lower overall. Shares in Morgan Stanley lost as much as 8.3 per cent in the morning session as the bank reported a fourth-quarter loss that was wider than even the most bearish predictions. The figures prompted Moody’s to downgrade the bank’s senior debt rating.Yet the shares finished 2.3 per cent higher as traders were encouraged by the bank’s attempt to reduce its leveraged capital structure. Richard Bove, analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, lifted his price target on the stock to $18.Goldman Sachs, which jumped 14.4 per cent in the previous session following its fourth-quarter results, added a further 3.7 per cent to $78.78.However, regional banks, off 2.3 per cent overall, underperformed the wider financial sector after Fifth Third’s move to cut its fourth-quarter dividend to 1 cent a share sparked concerns others may be required to take similar action. Fifth Third fell 6 per cent to $7.51 while KeyCorp lost 4 per cent to $8.33.Among other consumer stocks, ConAgra and General Mills jumped 8 per cent to $16.25 and 0.2 per cent to $61.35, respectively, on the back of better-than-expected second-quarter profits.Newell Rubbermaid was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, pushed 27.3 per cent lower to $9.58 by a profit warning that prompted analysts at BMO Capital Markets to question whether the company would retain its dividend.Investors did not appear reassured by plans from the maker of Sharpie pens, among other products, to cut up to 10 per cent of non-
manufacturing jobs.Meanwhile, the materials sector provided the market with support, up 0.1 per cent overall. Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold advanced 4.5 per cent to $26.01 as gold prices enjoyed strong gains.However, the energy sector came under selling pressure as US crude prices neared $40 in spite of Opec’s production cut.Elsewhere, Apple continued its bad run, down a further 6.6 per cent to $89.16, after the withdrawal of Steve Jobs, chief executive, from the group’s main event of the year prompted Oppenheimer to downgrade its view of the stock to “perform”.“It’s past time for Apple to either disclose the state of his health or elaborate a viable plan for eventually transferring power,” the analysts wrote, removing their price target. “Until such time, we can no longer continue to recommend Apple as a long-term investment.”Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Adobe afforded the technology sector scant comfort.Shares in the software group were dragged 2.8 per cent lower to $21.69 as the wider sector fell 1.7 per cent.Barclays noted the company did not give guidance for next year. “We believe the near-term environment will continue to pressure the top-line,” wrote the analysts, although they maintained their “overweight” stance."
156;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2008-12-16T19:44:24Z;Wall St adds to gains after Fed move;;Morgan Stanley was among the big winners from a rally in financials on Tuesday as the wider market received a boost from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.The market, already higher in morning trade, rallied after the Fed set a target range for overnight interest rates of between zero and 0.25 per cent.By the close in New York the S&P 500 was up 5.14 per cent at 913.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4.2 per cent higher at 8,924.14. The Nasdaq Composite was 5.41 per cent firmer at 1,589.89.Shares in Morgan, which sank 12 per cent last week and a further 1.5 per cent on Monday, bounced 13.2 per cent to $15.44 ahead of its earnings announcement, due today.It came in the wake of Goldman Sachs’ results on Tuesday, which sparked a relief rally in financial stocks that led Wall Street higher.Investors appeared relieved that Goldman’s fourth-quarter loss was no worse than the most bearish predictions.The bank’s shares advanced 13 per cent to $75.06, even though Moody’s downgraded its long-term senior debt ratings from Aa3 to A1.Goldman’s first loss since becoming a public company – as well as more economic data that set record lows – did not put the wider market in the red traders positioned themselves ahead of an expected interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 1.9 per cent, although at 55.71 it continued to indicate high levels of distress.Discounter brokers such as E Trade, up 8.9 per cent to $1.23, did particularly well. Charles Schwab rose 4.8 per cent to $16.89 after Merrill Lynch lifted its price target from $20 to $21 in a rare analyst upgrade.The market’s rally, which took in all 10 economic sectors, was the latest example of gains in spite of downbeat corporate news and economic developments.Homebuilders, sold off heavily in the previous session, recovered 6.2 per cent, even though Commerce Department figures showed construction starts on homes fell to a fresh 17-and-a-half-year low. Permits for new homes, a measure of future activity, fell to the lowest level since 1981. Both figures were even worse than Wall Street expected.Investors also shrugged off US Department of Labor data that showed consumer inflation fell 1.7 per cent in November, more than expected and the largest monthly decline since records began in 1947, pushed lower by falling energy prices.Retailers such as Bed Bath & Beyond – up 5.6 per cent to $24.84 – enjoyed strong gains.Among the favourites, Best Buy gained 13.8 per cent to $26.71 after the electronics retailer beat third- quarter forecasts, reiterated full-year earnings and unveiled plans to reduce capital spending by about 50 per cent next year.Last month, the group sent a chill through the market when warning of a “seismic” slowdown in consumer spending and on Tuesday it said there had been a “dramatic and potentially long-lasting change in consumer behaviour”.All corporate employees are eligible for a voluntary separation package, the company said, and warned compulsory redundancies may be required.Consumer discretionaries stood 3 per cent higher overall.Most consumer electronics stocks also did well. Dell rose 3.3 per cent to $11.50 and Hewlett-Packard added 2.1 per cent to $35.55.Apple bucked the trend, off 0.1 per cent to $94.70 in the wake of analyst downgrades. Adobe fell 0.5 per cent to $21.23 ahead of results due later in the day from the software group.The materials sector also provided the market with support, up 2.7 per cent overall. Agriculture stocks were given a boost after Merrill Lynch analysts upgraded their view of several stocks in the sector.Among the biggest winners, Potash and Terra Industries advanced 6.8 per cent to $73.95 and 13.2 per cent to $16.68, respectively.Energy stocks found positive territory, even as crude oil remained little changed ahead of the Opec meeting today.Meanwhile, General Motors and Ford were up 2.9 per cent to $4.20 and down 0.6 per cent to $3.16, respectively, as investors continued to await details from the Bush administration of a car industry bail-out.
157;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;What IT means to me: ‘Games need to be taken seriously’;;"Spending time with Jen-Hsun Huang is like taking an intensive refresher course in computer science, physics and mathematics.Mr Huang moves quickly from molecular biological simulation and CT scan image reconstruction, through protein folding, to wind-tunnel simulations and crash tests in the car industry. In between, he covers mathematical models for financial services, supercomputers, and creating a new platform for parallel computing.Mr Huang, then, is not one to stand still. Born in Taiwan, he lived in Thailand as a child, then moved with his uncle and aunt to the US. He went to a boarding school in Kentucky before moving to Oregon, where he went to high school in the suburbs of Portland. He followed that with a degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University.After periods at LSI Logic and AMD, Mr Huang headed to Stanford University to take a masters degree, also in electrical engineering. Just one year on from leaving Stanford, he set about founding the graphics chip company, Nvidia.Fifteen years on, Nvidia is the last remaining independent, large-scale maker of graphics chips for computers. But Mr Huang wants Nvidia to be more than that. The reason for his rapid-fire tour of the sciences – not to mention the arts – is that he believes we are about to reach a tipping point in computing.“We saw an opportunity to move 3D graphics beyond its then-conventional markets in million dollar supercomputers and into consumer applications, primarily video games,” he says of the decision to set up the business in the early 1990s. “It’s ironic that Nvidia is now taking the technology we developed for those applications back to its scientific and industrial roots.”Originally, Nvidia set out to produce graphics chips and cards that added better display capabilities to computers, and Windows computers in particular. These subsystems became progressively more powerful, adding support for 3D graphics and programmable shading. The company added more processing cores to the chip sets, and also made them easier to program, through languages such as Open GL, mostly in order to satisfy the needs of the computer gaming industry.But six years ago, executives at Nvidia noticed that academic researchers were putting their products – also known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, to an unexpected use: parallel computing, which involves multiple instructions being carried out simultaneously.“The GPU was mathematically intensive, but it was designed to display colours on a screen,” recalls Mr Huang.“We noticed that students were programming in languages such as Open GL on our GPUs to generate numbers instead of colours. On their own they had discovered the ‘general purpose’ GPU. But using a graphics language and receiving colours to re-interpret as numbers was such an arcane way of programming that it ruled out the mass market.”As a result, Nvidia adapted its GPUs to run a modified version of the C programming language, which the company calls CUDA.“That made it possible for these processors to become general purpose,” says Mr Huang. “These hundreds of processors are now collaborating to run a C program and to output numbers.“So scientists can use the GPU as a resource for general purpose computing. That is a big innovation.” CUDA is now taught as a system for parallel computing at more than 50 universities, Mr Huang adds with evident pride.An example of how powerful the GPU can be is Stanford University’s Folding@home protein analysis application, which studies the mysterious way proteins assemble themselves. Nearly half the program’s computing power, 1.25 petaflops, comes from just over 11,000 Nvidia GPUs. Some protein folding applications are 140 times quicker running on a graphics processor rather than a CPU, Mr Huang points out.But valuable though Standford’s Folding@home application undoubtedly is, CIOs might fail to see the relevance, and fail to see why they should specify what is a relatively expensive additional component, in the form of a dedicated graphics processor, rather than use the CPU maker’s integrated graphics.Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Huang says they should not, at least not for mainstream enterprise desktops. “Partially, I care about desktop applications, and, partially, I don’t,” he says.“We are not interested in being a generic computing company, where we solve everyone’s problems. We seek out challenging problems for specific groups of people. It was gamers and design professionals; now it is 40m to 50m creative professionals. These are people who have a challenging, visual computing problem, and we can be helpful to them.”For others, hosted computing in some form is the best option. “If you are a gamer or a designer, put a GeForce or Quadro in your system. If you are a secretary, or data entry person, or someone running a basic enterprise desktop, you should put your computing into the cloud.”Mr Huang is, however, enthusiastic about the company’s collaboration with Adobe – the software vendor’s products can talk directly to Nvidia GPUs – and sees an interesting opportunity to move the technology from specialist applications such as Adobe’s Photoshop or Premiere video-editing package, to more general business software, such as Acrobat.“We are seeing accidental innovation, which could be revolutionary,” he says. “Acrobat is an interactive document: where does text end and 3D begin? That will be very subtle. If I see an object I can give it a twirl. I can twirl a teapot or open a car door. That innovation comes from us innovating at the extremes, and then one day a smart company such as Adobe picks it up, because it has become so pervasive.”Technologies such as 3D rendering have become pervasive, Mr Huang says, because of computer gaming. CIOs might not like gaming much, at least not on company computers in company time. But it is gaming that created the market for Nvidia, and gaming that has enabled scientists, doctors and engineers to push the boundaries of computing with low-cost hardware.Mr Huang points out that IBM’s Roadrunner, a massive supercomputer built to model how nuclear weapons age, is built partly around the same Cell processor found in Sony’s PS3 games console. The GPU would not originally have attracted the interest of university researchers, if it were not for the economies of scale brought by sales to the computer games market.Mr Huang believes the gaming community is misunderstood, and not just by CIOs. But then it was gaming that drew him to the IT industry in the first place.“I always loved video games and that started me on the path to technology as a career,” he recalls. “We were the first generation to have access to computers at home and at school. My classmates and I would spend hours creating programs in Basic and coding the machines in the labs. After that I went on to study electrical engineering.”The older generation – Mr Huang is 45 – has not accepted gaming as a worthwhile pastime, he suggests. “Bill Gates says he played a lot of games. It creates puzzle-solvers, people who are good at multi-dimensional problem solving. Research suggests surgeons are more effective if they are gamers too. Kyle Bush, the Nascar [motor racing] driver, uses video gaming to train.”Mr Huang admits that Nvidia’s association with video games has “tarnished” the company’s image. “Because we have our origins in technology for gaming and this still continues to be a significant source of our revenues, we aren’t seen as a ‘serious’ company,” he says.But despite this, technology continues to amaze him. The personal computer industry, he suggests “is having a mid-life crisis”. But developments in parallel computing, and in areas such as the embedded market, for example in cars, or in mobile devices, offer the potential to be as inspiring as the PCs Mr Huang used at college in the 1980s.“Video cameras in your car mirrors will distort and re-distort images so you can see around bends,” he predicts. “You could have a sky view of your car for parallel parking. You would see your car in the third person – that is possible with graphics processors.”If drivers could practise parking using a video game, you suspect Mr Huang would be a very happy man indeed."
158;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
159;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Battered from all sides by a perfect economic storm;;"There are times when El Paredón, a tiny fishing village on Guatemala’s Pacific coast, feels just about as far away as you can get from civilisation and the bustle of modern life. But even here, among unpaved, sandy streets and adobe houses topped with roofs of palm, global economic trends are in evidence.Sandra Pérez, a 34-year-old mother of three, feels them as much as anyone. The sharp rise in international fuel prices this year has meant that she can no longer afford to send her children to school regularly. The boat ride to Sipacate, the nearest town, has gone up from two quetzales (27 US cents, 15 British pence) to five; the bus from there to the school now costs seven quetzales instead of five a few months ago. “When there is no money, my children stay at home,” she says. “It hurts me to know that they are missing out on their education but there is nothing I can do.”Her problems do not end there. Food prices in El Paredón, as in the rest of the world, have suffered precipitous rises this year resulting from the global shortage in grain and other commodities.For Ms Pérez, a single mother who relies on odd jobs in her village, this double blow means not only depriving her children of formal education but also having to send them to find food. She has taught them to go crabbing in the river that runs behind the village and sometimes, when things get really desperate, she sends them on day-long excursions to hunt for iguanas to cook and then sell.“It’s often the only way we can make ends meet,” she says apologetically.Ms Pérez’s problems mirror those affecting the whole of Central America, a region that has been more exposed than most to recent global shocks because it does not produce oil and is not self-sufficient in food.The result is that, after years in which monetary authorities managed first to control and then to lower inflation, prices have shot up 13.5 per cent in the past 12 months to June compared with 6.3 per cent in 2006. Food prices, meanwhile, have gone up a massive 20.7 per cent in the same period.That is little short of frightening for a region in which huge sectors of the population are desperately poor. In Guatemala, by far the most populous of the Central American nations, more than half of the 13m inhabitants live below the poverty line, with one-third surviving on less than $2 a day. In Nicaragua, the situation is worse.It is these poorer segments of society that are most exposed to inflation because they spend a proportionately much larger share of their income on food – more than 60 per cent in some cases. The resulting importance of food prices in the region’s consumer-price indices is so great that, in some cases, they represent about 40 per cent of the total compared with 12-14 per cent in the case of fully industrialised countries.María Antonieta de Bonilla, president of Guatemala’s central bank, summed up the conclusions of many of the region’s policymakers when she told the FT last month: “This is one of the most complex junctures for the region’s central banks in recent history.”A second big threat in the region is the US downturn. Over the past decade or more, the tiny economies – the average gross domestic product of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama is a mere $19.6bn – have managed to diversify their export markets only at the margin, and the US remains Central America’s predominant trading partner by a long way. If the downturn turns out to be prolonged, Central America’s exports are bound to suffer.“We are very worried,” says Eduardo Lizano, an economic analyst and former president of Costa Rica’s central bank. “Half our exports go to the US, half of our tourism comes from the US and half our investments come from the US. We are hugely affected by what happens there.”Costa Rica’s central bank is already forecasting a fall in GDP growth this year to about half of the roughly 7 per cent recorded in 2007.Compounding this vulnerability is the fact that while three-quarters of South America’s exports are still of basic goods such as agricultural and other commodities, which have benefited from recent global trends, only half of Central America’s exports fall into that category. The rest are manufactured goods, which have suffered stiff competition from Asia.The resulting divergence in fortunes within the rest of Latin America is startling. According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (Eclac), the terms of trade for Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela this year improved more than 200 per cent compared with the average for the 1990s: in the case of Central America, including Haiti and the Dominican Republic, they worsened 17 per cent.But the weakening US economy is also bad news for Central America because, potentially, it could have a severe impact on remittances, the financial flows sent by migrant workers living in the US to family and friends back home.Over the past decade or more, remittances to Central America have grown at an extraordinary pace and, for some countries, now represent the principal source of foreign earnings. In Honduras, for example, remittances last year were equivalent to almost a quarter of GDP. In El Salvador and Nicaragua, they were about 18 per cent and 17 per cent of GDP, respectively, and in Guatemala, they were about 12 per cent.The risk is that, as the US economy falters, so too will the amount of money that migrants send back home – particularly given that many of the sectors in which migrants work are the worst-hit, such as construction.Last year, that threat of drying remittances still seemed some way off. But according to a recent study by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), remittances to Latin America could start to fall in real terms this year for the first time since 2001, when it began its study.Put these factors together and the picture for Central American countries starts to look grim. As Michael Shifter of Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank, puts it: “They are getting battered on all sides. It is getting close to becoming a perfect storm.”One of the few candles still flickering in this storm is that Central American economies are far better prepared than they were a few years ago. In the case of Panama, central bank reserves have almost tripled since 2004, while in Nicaragua and Costa Rica they have doubled in the same period. The worst performer is El Salvador, but even here reserves have grown about 20 per cent in the past four years.Government debt has shrunk markedly as a percentage of GDP, falling from 55 per cent on average in 2004 to just 37 per cent by the end of last year. Moreover, much of that debt is now denominated in local currency, reducing still further exchange-rate risk.That relative economic health – other signs include foreign direct investment, which has jumped 110 per cent compared with 2004, and domestic bank lending to the private sector, which has almost doubled in Costa Rica and Nicaragua as a percentage of GDP since 2000, and has expanded roughly 50 per cent in Guatemala and Honduras – should mean that the region continues to grow both this year and next.However, growth rates will not be anything like those of the past few years. As Mr Lizano says: “This year and next year will be bad. After that, we will have to keep our fingers crossed.”He was referring to Costa Rica – but he could just as well have been talking about the whole of Central America."
160;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Oracle earnings stress sector’s dollar woes;;When Oracle, the world’s second biggest software company, reports its latest earnings on Thursday, it will highlight an inconvenient truth for the US technology industry: the big lift the sector has had in recent years from the weakening US dollar is over, at least for now.In its fiscal year to the end of May, roughly a quarter of Oracle’s reported revenue growth came from foreign currency translation effects, as the falling dollar increased the value of its overseas sales. Given their strong position in large parts of the global technology market, many other US tech companies have seen similar lifts from their big overseas positions.Currency adjustments have contributed nearly half of the revenue growth at software makers Symantec and Autodesk in the first half of this year, according to an analysis by Citigroup.A bounce in the dollar since July, particularly against the euro, has put at least a temporary end to that benefit, just as tech companies are bracing for a downturn in demand due to the weakening economy.Adobe, another big software concern, said this week that, in its most recent quarter, foreign currency adjustments had actually depressed its reported revenue slightly compared with the preceding three months, the first time for several years currencies have not provided a tailwind.Since Wall Street generally looks at year-to-year growth rates rather than quarter-to-quarter, the full impact of the stronger dollar, if it holds, will not be felt until next year. However, the dollar bounce will also have an immediate impact in at least two ways.For fast-growing companies whose growth is judged on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the currency tailwind of recent quarters will turn into an immediate headwind. That is still the case with Google, at least when it comes to the “whisper number” that Wall Street uses each quarter to assess the company’s earnings, said Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst at Collins Stewart.“It is significant for Google,” Mr Aggarwal added. “It is a trend reversal, after 10 quarters of positive impact.” Foreign currency earnings have helped to support Google’s growth rate as it has hit the inevitable slowdown that comes with reaching massive size.Revenue growth in the second quarter fell to 43 per cent from 63 per cent a year before, but would have slumped to 36 per cent had it not been for a weaker dollar.A second immediate effect will come as Wall Street analysts start to revise their earnings forecasts for next year to reflect the new exchange rates.
161;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2008-09-05T20:46:51Z;Wall St recovers after late rally in financials;;Wall Street stocks were mixed on Friday after a rally in financials helped soften news that the unemployment rate reached a five-year high in August.Financials were among the biggest casualties of the morning session but climbed strongly, adding 3.2 per cent amid speculation Blackstone Group and KKR, would buy some businesses from Lehman Brothers’ as part of a deal worth around $5bn. Lehman Brothers rose 6.8 per cent to $16.20.Amid the positive momentum, Bank of America overturned early losses. The shares rose 5.3 per cent to $32.23 even though the bank said it was ready to settle federal and state probes into the marketing of auction-rate securities.AIG also put on 5.3 per cent to $22.34 even after Morgan Stanley said the largest US insurer could need to raise $15bn to cushion further housing-related losses.On Friday, the spike in the jobless rate, which has reached 6.1 per cent, conspired with a rise in the home foreclosures to drag markets further into bear market territory.By the close, the S&P 500 was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,242.31. The Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.1 per cent at 2,255.88, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent lower at 11,220.96.The modest recovery on Friday brought to an end a volatile holiday-shortened week during which the the S&P 500 fell 3.2 per cent as fears returned about the health of the global economy. That was the index’s third weekly drop and its biggest loss since February.Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at ChannelCapitalResearch.com, said the unpredictable events of the week had shown investors were “alternating between euphoria and depression”.Selling was widespread, though sectors and companies most exposed to the prospect of a global slowdown were particularly badly hit. Industrials, materials and technology fell 3.9 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively.Among industrials, Terex was a big faller after the maker of construction and mining equipment cut its sales and profits forecast for the year. Its shares fell 23.8 per cent to $38.31 over the week. Caterpillar fell 9.4 per cent to $64.07.In materials, steel stocks were shunned as Goldman Sachs issued a bearish outlook on the sector in a wide-ranging note. US Steel fell 14.6 per cent to $113.61. AK Steel declined 22.8 per cent to $40.63.The technology sector took more blows on Friday after Nokia warned on its market share outlook. Jabil Circuit and Adobe Systems lost 5.4 per cent to $13.31 and 3 per cent to $40.91 respectively.But the sector pared its losses as investors bought back into heavily sold semiconductor stocks, which rose 0.9 per cent.For the week, Dell was among the worst performers, down 6.1 per cent at $20.41, although it clawed back some ground after reports said it was looking to sell some or all of its PC manufacturing plants in a cost-cutting move.Companies in the energy sector also took hits after the oil price lost about 8 per cent over the week. BJ Services and Hess fell 15 per cent to $22.83 and 12.7 per cent to $91.44 respectively.However, that gave respite to battered airlines stocks, such as UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, which rose 10.7 per cent at $12.30.Retailers were shunned after several suffered sluggish sales over the crucial back-to-school period. Abercrombie & Fitch continued its slide yesterday after Citigroup downgraded its recommendation on the stock to “sell”. The shares lost 4.9 per cent to $48.47.Deal news provided one of the few positive developments. SanDisk climbed 29.1 per cent to $17.37 after Samsung Electronics said it was considering a purchase of the memory-card maker.However, Safeway fell 3.9 per cent to $26.15, after Morgan Stanley cut the supermarket chain to “underweight”.

The software giant has validated Nokia’s Intellisync Device Management solution for Siebel CRM, which Oracle acquired in 2005, while the Siebel Wireless version of its flagship CRM product is now available for the Nokia E90 communicator.
Finally, Oracle has announced that Oracle Database Lite, its new client database for mobile devices, supports Symbian 9, the leading smartphone operating system.• Investment banks have more pressing concerns at present than optimising office space. But should the bull roar again, AMD of the US has a hardware solution that allows institutions to squeeze in more traders and workstations.
The ATI FireMV 2260 graphics card allows multiple large screens to be crammed into tight desk space, boosting “trader density” and reducing energy consumption.
AMD acquired ATI, a specialist in graphics cards, in 2006.• Dell claims to have edged ahead of arch-rival Hewlett-Packard in the server price/performance race with two new servers aimed at smaller businesses.
The US computer giant says its rack-mounted PowerEdge R300, based on the quad-core Intel Xeon x5460 chip, achieves up to 26 per cent better performance than a comparable system from HP, while the T300, which adopts the traditional tower format, has a claimed 31 per cent performance advantage over HP.
Prices are $1,249 and $999 respectively.• We have heard of mash-ups, but how about smash-ups? IBM has announced Smash, which is designed to overcome security concerns about using mash-ups (which for the uninitiated are web-based applications that draw data from various internet sources).
IBM’s secure mash-up technology allows different web-based sources to talk to each other, but keeps them separate, so malicious code cannot creep into enterprise systems. In true glasnost spirit, IBM is contributing Smash to the OpenAjax Alliance.• Business Objects, now owned by SAP, has announced Xcelsius Engage 2008, the latest version of its data presentation tool that can be used by anyone familiar with a spreadsheet, or so BO claims.
Improvements include a redesigned interface based on Adobe Flash technology and full integration with Microsoft Excel.• Zoho, the US software-as-a-service specialist, has unveiled Zoho People, a human resources application aimed at SMEs with more than 50 employees.
It is available as a beta release and comprises modules for organisation definition, recruitment, forms, checklists and employee self-service. It can be customised and link to other Zoho Saas offerings.• It took 20 years but HP has finally produced an inkjet printer that can cancel print jobs in mid-stream.
Coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the Deskjet range, HP has unveiled the Deskjet D2500, which has a one-touch print cancel button to stop the printing of unwanted pages and so save ink.
In 20 years, the price of the Deskjet printer has tumbled from $995 to $49 for the new D2500.
The same cannot be said for the price of ink, which today is almost as expensive as the printers themselves."
163;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2008-03-19T20:43:04Z;Wall St falls as oil and gold prices drop;;US stocks gave back much of their recent gains towards the end of the session on Wednesday as markets were dragged down by energy and mining stocks amid tumbling commodity prices.Some of the largest US oil companies were among the fallers after oil experienced its biggest one-day drop since 1991.Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips fell 4.6 per cent to $84.43, 4.9 per cent to $81.89 and 6 per cent to $73.61 respectively.With gold prices also off recent highs, Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining, two of the top US gold producers, dropped 7.2 per cent to $46.03 and 3.6 per cent to $49.06.The benchmark S&P 500 index – which recorded its biggest one day gain in five years on Tuesday – closed down 2.4 per cent at 1,298.42 points, while the Nasdaq composite index was down 2.6 per cent at 2,209.96 points.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.4 per cent to 12,099.66. Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said: “We had a pretty good start to the day and were holding yesterday’s [Tuesday’s] levels for most of the morning but as time ticks on people get a little nervous and they think ‘I want to lock in some profit now’.”Indeed, falling oil and mining stocks wiped out early gains sparked by reassuring results from Morgan Stanley and news that regulators had cleared Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pump money into the embattled US mortgage market.Morgan Stanley shares rose as high as $47.07 in early trading before dropping back to $43.45, up 1.4 per at the close.The broader financial sector, which helped drive the benchmark S&P 500 index up 4.2 per cent on Tuesday, fell back amid renewed concerns about the fragility of the banking sector.An index of investment bank stocks, which had rallied in recent days, fell back 5.4 per cent, while the broader index of S&P 500 financials fell 2 per cent.At the epicentre of the sell off was Merrill Lynch, with shares falling 11.11 per cent to $42.52, after the bank sued XL Capital Assurance to prevent the bond insurer from canceling $3.1bn of credit default swaps on collateralized debt obligations.Lehman Brothers also gave back some of its gains on Tuesday, dropping 9.2 per cent to $42.23 after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said the bank could be exposed to further writedowns.Investors in Clear Channel, the largest US radio company, were spooked by reports that its buy-out by two private equity firms may be delayed due to difficulties in financing the $21bn in loans needed to complete the deal.Clear Channel shares were among the leading fallers in the S&P, dropping 8.9 per cent to $32.60.Rebecca Engmann Darst, an equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers, said the sell-off in financials could be due to news that brokerages were selling leveraged buy-out debt at reduced prices and “underlying skittishness” in the market.However, falls were cushioned somewhat by news that regulators have allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to inject $200 billion into the struggling housing market. The government-chartered mortgage company’s shares surged 8.8 per cent to $30.71 and 14.9 per cent to $29.90.Elsewhere in the mortgage market, shares in Thornburg, a specialist in “Jumbo” mortgages which is struggling to meet margin calls, plummeted 49.66 per cent to $1.50.On Tuesday the shares spiked on news that Thornburg’s lenders had agreed to freeze demands for more collateral until 2009, but on Wednesday the company revealed the tough terms of the deal.Thornburg agreed to give five lenders warrants equivalent to about a 27 per cent stake in the company and committed to raise at least $948m within seven days by issuing senior notes.In corporate news, Visa, the world’s largest credit card network, began trading on Wednesday and its shares soared as high as $69 before falling back to close at $56.50, up 28.4 per cent.On Wednesday the San Francisco-based company raised more than $17.9bn after selling 406m shares for $44 each – $2 higher than top estimates in the prospectus.In technology, Adobe Systems, the maker of design software, led the sector higher after first-quarter profit beat consensus estimates.The shares rose 9 per cent to $34.75
164;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2008-03-17T12:23:36Z;Distance learning boosted;;These are good times for distance learning. The technology is better, applications are on the increase and even the global economic uncertainty seems to be helping the sector. Furthermore, the technique is likely to become even more popular when today’s teenagers – already familiar with multimedia delivery – move into the workplace and want an MBA. There are signs that distance learning, once merely one option among many, is becoming some students’ first choice.The cost of a full-time MBA – little change from $100,000 – might prompt a would-be student to think again about leaving the workplace in an economic recession to study full-time. But for online delivery, such considerations do not come into play. Many schools in recent months have reported increased enquiries for distance-learning programmes.Technological advances mean more content can now be delivered online rapidly, flexibly and most importantly – cheaply. Meanwhile the growth of online social networking has led to virtual communities of MBA students able to interact from all over the globe.This has enhanced not only the kudos of distance learning but also its familiarity. Once considered a viable alternative, now a distance learning MBA or a programme with a significant part of its delivery online is often a student’s first choice.Warwick Business School in the UK has offered distance learning for 20 years. Its MBA programme can be delivered full-time, part-time or via distance learning. Dean Howard Thomas says the school has seen applications soar for the distance learning option and currently has 2,000 online students.Steve Allison, a technical evangelist at Adobe, the software company, predicts significant changes in online learning. With employees increasingly mobile and working in remote locations, individuals will rely far more on e-learning.“With on-demand learning and instant access, the technology will allow you to push out all the information and it is then that you will get a change in the habit of learning,” he says.He says Adobe has found one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the acceptance of new technology is a traditional mentality, with older people reluctant to use the latest IT. To counter this, Adobe tries to ensure its products are easy to use. A further barrier that can dissuade schools from fully embracing new technology is the expense, but Mr Allison says an outlay of £100,000 would ensure that a school is able to hold its own in online delivery.For the end-user the cost of new technology is negligible. Clive Holtham, professor of information management at Cass Business School, London, is a strong proponent of online delivery.“It is reliable, ubiquitous and incredibly cheap for the end-user, but what we have to consider is, ‘are we using [technology] in ways that enhance the student experience?’”Prof Holtham believes this is certainly the case at Cass, where the latest technology enhances the learning experience of both the school’s EMBA and modular MBA students. He says Cass has a policy to ensure it is at the leading edge of new technology. “The real pressure comes from students, if they want something they are very vocal.”Students’ use of online technology extends far beyond educational delivery. The MBA Tour, which provides educational events to MBA schools, has recently launched MBA Networking on Facebook, the social networking site.MBA Networking was initially set up as a forum for would-be MBAs where they would be able to ask questions and receive advice, but the site has proved so popular that it has grown well beyond original expectations and includes discussions ranging from international education to internships and specialised programmes.“MBA Network can reach out to people in professions who might not necessarily think there is something in an MBA for them,” says Peter Von Loesecke, chief executive officer of the MBA Tour.With increased use of technology has come the demand for benchmarking. EFMD – the Brussels-based European Foundation for Management Development – and the Swiss Centre for Innovations in Learning jointly established the EFMD CEL quality scheme for management-development programme accreditation in 2004.It focuses specifically on technology-enhanced learning and aims to disseminate good practice. So far it has accredited seven programmes, the most recent at the University of Liverpool in the UK. Universitas 21 Global, the online graduate school based in Singapore, has also been accredited.At U21Global, applications have been rising year-on-year, says Helen Lange, dean of business management programmes. Established in 2001, the school has the backing of 20 research universities across 12 countries.Ms Lange attributes the success of online courses to changes in the style of education, with a move away from teacher-centric to learner-centric study. As time management issues become more pressing, online delivery becomes increasingly viable. U21Global has seen rapid growth in Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines and is actively marketing in both India and the Middle East.U21 also has its eyes on China, where Ms Lange expects a surge in interest over the next few years.She believes distance learning numbers will continue to grow. “Traditional face-to-face education cannot meet the growing demand. Good-quality education is not able to get to a lot of places that need it. The demand is there now.”One of the perennial criticisms of distance learning is that students miss out on social interaction, regarded as an essential component of the MBA experience. However, Ms Lange believes that this disadvantage is offset by the development of global management skills through online interaction.“At U21Global, students from as many as 65 different countries have to interact virtually with each other,” says Ms Lange. “They are learning to deal with different cultures and languages, mentoring other members of the class. These virtual management skills are …the development of soft skills in the virtual world.”For Prof Holtham, online learning has a bright future, not only for teaching and learning, but also research.Manchester Business School Worldwide agrees. It has launched the Manchester Global MBA aimed at the more experienced executive. It reflects the corporate workplace, blending individual research with face-to-face learning, online collaborative learning and virtual learning technologies.“It is a convergence of lifestyle, working and learning,” says Nigel Banister, chief executive officer of MBSW.While many would agree that online learning is the future of education, Ms Lange goes even further.Having taught in a traditional classroom format for many years she admits she was sceptical that online education could offer as much as face-to-face teaching. However, having experienced e-learning first hand she has changed her mind. “Distance learning – when the pedagogy is right – I think that it is superior.”When schools are entrenched in the face-to-face model, there is often so much invested in that model that it is not easy to change, she says. By comparison, distance learning has a flexibility that is hard to match.With global economic uncertainty ahead, online learning – cheap, flexible and ubiquitous – would appear to be the solution for those who wish to learn while remaining in the workplace.Financial Times Business Education Online Learning MBA special reportFinancial Times Business Education Distance Learning MBA course providers (PDF)
165;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2008-02-20T01:48:17Z;NCC complains of unfair licence agreements;;The National Consumer Council on Tuesday accused 17 of the world’s largest software companies, including Microsoft, Symantec, and Adobe, of forcing consumers to sign “unfair” licence agreements when they purchase software.The consumer watchdog has asked the Office of Fair Trading to launch an investigation into the companies. It has also asked the European Commission to examine the issue as part of its current review of consumer laws.The NCC said computer companies were misleading consumers into “signing away their legal rights” and leaving them with “less protection than when they buy a cheap biro”.Out of 25 popular software products examined by the NCC, 14 did not mention on the outside packaging that use of the software depended on accepting a licence agreement. The terms of the agreements are typically sealed within the packaging, so that users have no idea what they are agreeing to until after they have bought the product.The NCC were also concerned that the terms and conditions tended to be excessively long and full of legal jargon that was difficult to understand.The terms and conditions also often give the software vendor the right to terminate the consumer’s use of the software without notice if there is any suspected misuse, leaving the user with the burden of clearing their name through the courts if this is incorrect.“Consumers can’t have a clue what they’re signing up to when some terms and conditions run to 10 or more pages. There’s a significant imbalance between the rights of the consumer and the rights of the holder,” said Carl Belgrove, senior policy advocate at the NCC.There are few known cases of software companies enforcing extremely unfavourable licensing terms on ordinary users, but the NCC said the potential was there for them to do so.Computer companies like Microsoft have been forced to modify their terms and conditions by the Office of Fair Trading in the past.“None of the companies will be strangers to having their terms and conditions challenged,” said Adam Brown, partner at Simmons and Simmons, the law firm. “The OFT has a document running to more than 200 pages, listing unfair consumer licence terms, in which Microsoft has many mentions.”If the OFT take up an investigation of licences, they are likely to ask the 17 companies to voluntarily change their terms. As a last resort, they can apply for a court injunction to stop the companies from using certain licence terms.
166;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T17:39:23+0000;Gates woos schools with free software;;"Microsoft is to give away some of its core software to university and high school students around the world in an effort to win over the next generation of software developers to its technology.The bid to attract future developers is the latest extension of Microsoft’s long-running battle to keep open-source software at bay, while also fending off advances by companies like IBM and Adobe, both of which have seen some of their technologies make inroads in university computer science departments.The free software plan is due to be spelled out by Bill Gates, the company’s chairman, in a speech on Tuesday at Stanford University.As many as 40m students around the world who study maths or science-related subjects will eventually have access to the software, Microsoft executives estimated.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Gates said the aim was to help draw the next generation of developers to Microsoft technology “and to drive up the rate of innovation in software running on PCs and on Windows servers”.Microsoft is to release its software tools for software development and design free of charge to registered students, starting in the US, China and eight European countries, including the UK.The offer includes the full professional versions of Visual Studio, which developers use to create programmes that run on Windows, and Expressions, a set of design tools.Microsoft’s base of independent developers has long been seen as its most important competitive weapon, reinforcing Windows’ position as the dominant desktop computing platform and its expanding use on servers.However, Mr Gates played down the threat to Microsoft of losing ground if other software development tools make inroads in universities, and he maintained that
Windows had benefited as Unix had diminished in importance in academia.While Microsoft’s set of tools is more complete than rivals, it faces competition on a number of different fronts from Eclipse, a set of open source development tools supported by IBM, and Flash, the popular software for multimedia web applications created by Adobe.New lightweight tools designed to make it easier to write applications for the web, such as Ruby on Rails, have also won a following in academia.Reflecting the importance of this group to the big tech companies, Google has also made a bid for the hearts and minds of university students, although its efforts are focused on giving free access to its online applications rather than the sort of developer tools being offered by Microsoft."
167;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2008-01-31T22:22:48Z;US stocks rebound on bond insurer hopes;;US stocks rebounded strongly on Thursday after MBIA helped alleviate some of the concerns about troubled bond insurers at the end of the worst January for equities since 1990.Sentiment improved considerably after MBIA it had been the target of “fear-mongering” and was confident of retaining its triple-A rating.However, after the closing bell Standard & Poors served a reminder that bond insurers’ problems were not completely solved as it placed MBIA on watch for possible downgrade.Volatile equities had slumped at the open after a spike in jobless claims added to worries about the US labour market market as consumer spending slowed.Investors later rushed to buy into weakness after the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut raised the prospect of cheaper borrowing costs, a potential boon for financial companies and the prostrate real estate market. Energy companies rem­ained a weak spot, however, as corporate earnings disappointed.The S&P 500 closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,378.47 having initially fallen 1.6 per cent. The index fell 6.1 per cent in January, its worst start in 18 years.The S&P homebuilder index enjoyed a particularly strong bounce on Thursday, rising 11.6 per cent as investors cheered Pulte Homes‘ improved liquidity position. Its shares jumped more than 20 per cent to $16.32.The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than more than 450 points from its session low to close up 1.7 per cent at 12,650.36. The Nasdaq Composite also gained 1.7 per cent to 2,389.86.“[The rebound] is primarily due to MBIA. There’s a lot of short covering, especially in the homebuilders,” said Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.Stocks hit the skids in early trading after a sharp spike in weekly claims for un­employment benefit, which jumped 69,000 to 375,000, the highest level since October 2005, unsettled investor. Economists had expected about 320,000.Although these numbers are often volatile and may have been affected by the timing of a public holiday, the uptick will renew concerns that Friday’s employment report may not be as strong as hoped. Morgan Stanley cut its payrolls forecast to 90,000 from 110,000, still significantly more than than December’s 18,000.The bond insurance sector once again dominated market chatter as MBIA reported a $2.3bn fourth-quarter loss after writing down $3.5bn of credit derivatives. But the shares rallied 11 per cent to $15.50 after its chief executive said the company was best positioned to avoid a rating downgrade. Ambac Financial, a rival, climbed 6.8 per cent to $11.59.If bond insurance losses can be contained and earnings visibility increases, many analysts think the beaten-down S&P financial sector, up 2.7 per cent on Thursday, could become an attractive investment.Mastercard, rose 11.2 per cent to $210.09 on Thursday after fourth quarter earnings jumped nearly seven-fold. Meanwhile Bank of America rose 4.7 per cent to $44.18 after a hedge fund said it was seeking to block its takeover of Countrywide Financial, the mortgage lender.Investors also bought battered consumer stocks, spurring a 4.4 per cent jump on the S&P retail index. A Deutsche Bank analyst upgraded the broadline retail sector to “neutral” from “cautious” and said said “the worst will soon be behind us”. Bear Stearns upgraded Nordstrom’s sharesprompting a gain of 5.4 per cent to $38.85.But mixed earnings and the slowdown in consumer spending underscored the riskiness of calling a bottom in the retail stocks. Personal spending rose 0.2 per cent in December, its slowest pace in six months/Procter & Gamble, up 0.7 per cent at $65.56, increased fiscal second-quarter earnings 14 per cent and the company raised its full-year outlook.Burger King, up 2.9 per cent at $46.51, also beat estimates as second-quarter profit jumped 29 per cent. Mattel rose 10.9 per cent to $21.01 after beating quarterly profit forecasts.In contrast, Starbucks’ cautious outlook for 2008 unnerved investors. The shares fell 1.6 per cent to $18.91.After the close Google‘s fourth quarter profit missed expectations causing the shares, which closed up 2.9 per cent at $564.30, to slump 8.1 per cent.Adobe Systems fell 2.8 per cent to $34.93 yesterday after Jefferies & Co. downgraded it from “buy” to “underperform”.In energy, Cameron International dropped 6.9 per cent to $40.10 after the oil services company gavea weaker-than-expected earnings guidance. Marathon Oil’s fourth-quarter earnings fell 38 per cent as refining margins weakened and its shares shed 7.3 per cent to $47.21.

For long distance, the operator would plug into a trunk circuit connected to another bank of switchboards elsewhere.Times have changed. A start-up that calls itself Silicon Valley’s first phone company has come up with a technology that allows web developers to plug into the world of telephony with as little knowledge of the routing involved as an ordinary caller.Ribbit, based in Mountain View, has a “SmartSwitch” that takes care of multiple networks, protocols and devices to allow the web to be connected to any device in any manner. A landline phone can call a web page, a web application can be transformed into a virtual mobile phone.To make this happen, developers making desktop widgets using Adobe’s popular Flash or AIR technologies need only add a couple of lines of code to hook up to Ribbit’s telephonic back-end.The company has been unveiling its first service this week at the Demo conference in California. “Amphibian” can give a physical phone a virtual-world equivalent, enabling consumers to use their phone plans in new web environments.Ribbit says it is enabling voiceware, connecting traditional telephony with the web. It treats voice as an object that can be embedded into any application – such as adding voicemail to a Salesforce.com web-based customer relationship management system.Other companies have developed similar applications, but Ribbit sees itself as empowering developers at large. It is creating a marketplace for the widgets they are developing in hooking into its technology.The coolest application of Ribbit so far is the virtual iPhone, developed by the Knoware design studio. This life-size desktop widget looks just like an iPhone and has the same functionality. Its developer says he was making and receiving calls with it in minutes after inserting Ribbit’s code.Ribbit and the iPhone help explain why Silicon Valley is now also known as Smartphone Valley. As mobiles have become more like computers and gained internet connectivity, the Valley’s expertise has come into play.This is a significant shift. In the past, Europe and Asia have led with cellphone innovation. European Voice-over-IP companies such as Skype and Jajah are now part of the Valley, but Ebay admits it overpaid for the former.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, has failed to break into mobile phones with its processors, eventually selling its division to Marvell Technology. But Apple has changed perceptions and turned the Valley’s fortunes round with its iPhone. Its distinctiveness is expressed in its software and user interface, areas where the Valley excels.At Macworld this month, Steve Jobs announced a software update for the iPhone featuring improved maps and the ability to customise the home screen.This is in readiness for a software developers’ kit, expected in February, which will enable third-party developers to write applications for the iPhone.Google is also leading the way in opening cellphones to software developers. It announced the Open Handset Alliance in November, an initiative for open standards on mobile phones, featuring its Android operating system.Android was the name of the Palo Alto mobile start-up Google acquired two years earlier, one of many in the Valley focusing on the future of telephony.Google is also bidding for wireless spectrum and has bought Jaiku, a Finnish mobile messaging service similar to the Valley’s Twitter.Private equity’s telecom interest in the valley has been piqued. Elevation Partners says it is betting on the possibilities for mobile broadband. It began by paying $325m for a 27 per cent stake in Sunnyvale’s Palm in October. Intel is also planning a comeback through mobile broadband, introducing its WiMax chips this year.European groups have taken note. Ericsson paid $1.9bn for Redback Networks in 2006; Nokia has spent more than $1.5bn on 10 Valley companies over 10 years, including Intellisync for $430m in 2005.In early January, Bob Iannucci, head of Nokia’s research centre in Palo Alto, became the company’s chief technology officer. He is the first non-Finn to take up the role – a clear message from the world’s biggest handset maker that it views Silicon Valley as a centre of innovation."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent on the week to 13,450.65 while the Nasdaq Composite fared better, gaining 2.1 per cent to 2,691.99 over the period. The Russell 2000 small cap index climbed 4.2 per cent to 785.60 this week, helped by an increase in deal-making.The New York Stock Exchange set a volume record in the first hour on Friday as traders settled positions before the holidays and as several types of derivative contracts expired – a quarterly event known as “quadruple witching”. However, volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s so-called “fear barometer” – fell to its lowest level since the end of October, down 19.7 per cent for the week at 18.68.Research In Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry e-mail device, capped a good week for technology after it said third-quarter net in-come more than doubled to $370.5m and revenues soared. The company’s up-beat fourth-quarter guidance exceeded analysts’ estimates and the shares jumped 11.9 per cent on the week to $118.63. UBS raised its price target to $155.RIM’s stellar results came in the same week that Oracle increased second-quarter profit by 35 per cent, helped by strong software licence sales. Its shares rose 7.1 per cent to $22.71 this week.Adobe Systems, the software company, beat estimates with a 21 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits and the shares edged up 0.2 per cent to $42.18.“There’s been no crisis in technology. The momentum has been phenomenal,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Financials had a mixed week as investors were forced to weigh up whether to avoid the sector because of more mortage-related losses or buy into the stocks because of the prospect of big capital infusions from abroad.Reports that Merrill Lynch is in talks with Temasek, Singapore’s state investment agency, about a potential multi-billion-dollar investment moved the shares higher on Friday.Like many US banks, Merrill could benefit from a boost to its capital reserves after it took $8.4bn in writedowns in October. The shares fell 2.3 per cent on the week to $55.54 after an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton forecast Merrill would take another $8.6bn in writedowns this quarter.Morgan Stanley this week tapped China Investment Corp for $5bn as it an-nounced a total of $9.4bn in writedowns for the fourth quarter and posted the first loss in its history. The shares ended the week up 8.1 per cent at $54.37.Bear Stearns, which in October took a $1bn investment from China’s Citic Securities, fell to its first loss this week, after it wrote down $1.9bn for the quarter. The shares fell 5.6 per cent to $89.95 on the week.Investors were rocked by the threat of credit downgrades on monoline bond insurers.A downgrade of bond insurers could seriously affect world credit markets, triggering sharp losses on insured securities.MBIA, fell 27.4 per cent to $20.03 this week after it revealed $30.6n in exposure to complex debt securities. Fitch Ratings warned it could cut MBIA’s triple-A rating unless it raised $1bn in capital.Fitch issued the same warning to Ambac Financial on Friday after identifying $32.2bn in exposure to collateralised debt obligations backed by subprime collateral.However, Ambac’s shares rose 16.9 per cent to $26.66 on the week after Moody’s affirmed its triple-A rating.Transport stocks were disappointing after FedEx, the logistics company, and Union Pacific, rail operator, issued weak earnings guidance, citing rising fuel costs. The shares fell 1.7 per cent to $94.29 and 3.5 per cent to $126.02 respectively.
170;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-12-19T01:08:23Z;Wall St volatile as credit fears continue;;Wall Street stocks battled through another volatile session on Tuesday to end in positive territory but not before the major indices had fluctuated wildly amid continuing credit market anxiety.A massive injection of liquidity from the European Central Bank primed stocks for an early rally on Tuesday but the brokerage sector struggled after some cautionary comments from Goldman Sachs’ chief financial officer.Stocks traded higher for most of the morning, then fell sharply, before rebounding strongly as traders weighed the boost to liquidity against lingering credit market fears.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,454.96, well off its highs for the session, but having fallen as much as 0.7 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 per cent to 2,596.03 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 13,232.47.A recent market downturn has dragged the S&P below its 200-day moving average, a bearish indicator and a blow to those hoping for a December rally.“I’m very disappointed with the way the market has reacted over the last four or five days. The rally that we had in place till last Tuesday [we thought] would continue to have legs,” Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said.Of the 10 leading sectors on the S&P on Tuesday, utilities and energy were strongest while financials again lagged the market.Investors expecting a Goldman-induced rally were disappointed in spite of quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Some chastening words from David Viniar helped to depress a range of investment banking stocks on Tuesday.“We’re cautious about the near-term outlook for our businesses as we see dislocation in some of the world’s capital markets has continued,” Mr Viniar, chief financial officer, said. Goldman’s shares fell 3.4 per cent to $201.51 after Mr Viniar said the sub-prime market had not yet bottomed out while hedge fund redemptions would increase.The company’s fourth-quarter profits rose 2 per cent to $3.22bn, helped by a good performance from its equity-trading unit, while revenues increased 14 per cent to $10.7bn.“I thought the Goldman numbers were terrific and probably should have provided more support for the market,” Mr Orlando said.Goldman was kicking off a big week for Wall Street’s investment banks. Morgan Stanley, down 3 per cent at $48.07, reports on Wednesday and Bear Stearns, 1.6 per cent lower at $92.59, on Thursday. Both are expected to reveal mortgage-related losses.Investment banking stocks lagged in spite of news that the ECB had allotted €348.6bn ($502bn) in short-term loans to help stave off the threat of a year-end liquidity crisis.The move followed a $20bn term loan auction by the Federal Reserve, the results of which will be known on Wednesday.Homebuilders wobbled after construction permits plumbed a 14-year low. Although housing starts fell less than expected last month, the 3.7 per cent decline was accompanied by a 16-year low for single-family home construction. The S&P homebuilder index closed 0.5 per cent higher at 360.22.Adobe Systems provided a boost to the software and services sector after it reported fourth quarter profits rose 21 per cent, beating Wall Street’s expectations.The shares added 2.8 per cent to $42.03 after Adobe increased revenues by 34 per cent and said it would buy back an additional 30m shares. Deutsche Bank upgraded the shares to “buy”.On the Dow, large-cap tech names, including IBM, up 1.7 per cent at $106.31, and Hewlett Packard, 1.6 per cent higher at $36.61, enjoyed strong gains. Tech laggards included Garmin, the navigation device maker, which fell 7.3 per cent to $94.35.After the market closed Palm, the smartphone maker said it made a $9.6m loss for the third quarter and revenues declined. The stock closed up 5 per cent at $5.93 but fell 10.6 per cent in after-hours trade.Consumer-electronics vendors were also in focus after Best Buy’s better-than-expected results were overshadowed by its downbeat guidance. Circuit City Stores, which reports quarterly results on Friday, fell as much as 10 per cent before recovering to close 1 per cent lower at $6.62.
171;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T21:04:30+0000;Brussels hears new complaint over Microsoft;;Microsoft on Thursday faced the first fresh complaint over its market practices in Europe since it lost a long-running antitrust battle with the European Commission this autumn.Opera Software, a Norwegian company whose web browser accounts for slightly less than 2 per cent of online traffic, said it had filed a new complaint with the Commission, in which it accuses Microsoft of abusing a dominant position by tying its own Internet Explorer browser to the Windows operating system.Opera also complains that Microsoft is hindering interoperability by not following accepted web standards.The case marks the first time a competitor has tried to take advantage of a recent landmark legal ruling to try to limit Microsoft’s business practices. In the September judgment, Europe’s Court of First Instance upheld an earlier Commission decision that Microsoft had unlawfully abused its dominant market position, over the tying of its Media Player software to Windows.A Commission official confirmed the Opera complaint and said it would be studied carefully.Microsoft said it would co-operate with any Commission inquiry but added: “We believe the inclusion of the browser into the operating system benefits consumers, and that consumers and PC manufacturers already are free to choose to use any browsers they wish.”The Opera complaint harks back to the “Browser Wars” of a decade ago, which led to US antitrust action against Microsoft. Although the US did not object to Microsoft’s practice of tying its browser to Windows, it found the company had abused its market power in defeating Netscape.Remedies agreed were designed to make it easier for consumers to select different browsers to run on Windows, and to make sure PC makers were free to pre-install any default browser.The case has the backing of some of Microsoft’s biggest rivals through the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, a body that includes IBM, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and AdobeThomas Vinje, ECIS’s legal counsel, said: “Browers are the gateway to the internet. Microsoft seeks to control this gateway.”Opera said it was asking for either an unbundling of Explorer from Windows and/or the pre-installation of alternative web browsers on desktop computers, with a requirement that the company adheres to open web standards.
172;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-11-17T00:11:21Z;Distant dream homes;;"In the village of Jaripo, in a hilly northern part of the Mexican state of Michoacán, there are two types of houses. The first are tiny adobe shacks with clay-brick walls, dirt floors and makeshift latrines out back. These are simple and spartan homes that buzz with the activity of daily life – women cooking, chicken’s clucking, children toddling from room to room. Standing alongside these are Jaripo’s “mansions” – single-family homes with multiple bedrooms, working bathrooms, courtyard fountains and satellite dishes on the roofs. These are, ironically, mostly empty, built by those who grew up in the village but who could only earn the money to build them working in the US.“In almost every village in rural Mexico you find a kind of ghost town,” says Sam Quinones, a Los Angeles Times reporter and author of Antonio’s Gun and Delfino’s Dream, a new book on Mexican migration to the US. “You walk around these gorgeous houses with sliding patio doors and wrought-iron fencing but no one is around. [They] are emigrants’ promises to return for good one day and, though few keep this promise, the dream lives on; billions of dollars cascade into the most isolated villages each year, surreally filling [the country] with empty houses.”The phenomenon is not limited to Mexico. Around the world, residents of impoverished villages leave to earn money abroad, return to build homes that showcase their new wealth, leave again to keep the cash coming in and, as a result, implicitly encourage neighbours to break out of their shacks and follow. Quinones calls this a “cycle of departure”, which can be seen from Peru to Tunisia to the Philippines, especially where poor countries fringe wealthier ones. The home – that basic symbol of roots, solidity and steadfast community – serves as the greatest impetus to exodus.According to World Bank estimates, emigrants sent $165.2bn back to their home countries in 2006, exceeding the amount given in development aid and, in some cases, direct foreign investment. Asia receives the lion’s share, followed by Latin America and, far behind, Africa.Much of the money goes into property, which is seen as a safe investment by those who don’t trust their country’s government or banks or don’t have the financial savvy to put their money into stocks and bonds, says Jean-Pierre Garson, head of the international migration division at the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). “Across the globe migrant workers invest in building houses back home,” he says, “but it takes on a different character in different countries.” And it has varied effects – both positive and negative.Kryztof Borkowski, an electrician from Krakow, Poland, decided to move to London in 2004 after coveting the house that an old school friend built with money earned on UK construction sites. “This kid was not the brightest in the class but three years after he went to London he came back and built himself a great big house that looked down on everyone else in the village,” Borkowski says. “In Poland people work all of their life and can’t even afford a house like that. So I figured if this guy can do it, then I should be able to make enough money in London to build myself a palace.”Ovidiu Mateson, who moved from Transylvania in Romania to the UK in 2005, confirms that the “migrant mansion” effect has spread to his country too. “In many parts of Romania, you see huge houses built by people working in Britain,” he says. “The town of Recas, in the west, is dominated by Scottish-style castles with lions on the gateposts, turrets on the roofs and white marble dwarfs in the gardens. Weirdly, a lot of them also have mules tied up outside.”Though Mateson has no desire to build something similar he is interested in investing in Romanian real estate. “I couldn’t live there any more but I do think Romania is a property hotspot,” he says. “I have friends who are building property portfolios in Romania and I’d certainly invest if I had the money, as a future asset.”In north Africa, mainly Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, there’s a long history of investment in housing by people working overseas. Governments have created special investment plans and even extend loans to would-be homebuyers and builders, according to Garson. But sub-Saharan Africa is a rather different story. Migrant houses, built by people working in Europe, often in healthcare, can be found in countries such as Mali. But elsewhere property is not as much of a priority, says Peter Stalker, author of several books on migration. “If the families do get remittances, the only thing they would spend it on after food is education,” he explains.Asian countries, by contrast, provide some of the best examples of the trend. The Philippines alone has almost 8m people living abroad, sending about $7bn home annually. In Thailand, they have a name for the ostentatious two-storey houses built by those working abroad – “Ban San-U” or “Saudi Arabian houses”.But, according to Stalker, the dynamic is slightly different than the one observed by Quinones in Latin America. “Migration in Asia is often on short-term contracts – male labourers to the Gulf states and young women to the Middle East, Hong Kong and Singapore to work as maids – so migrants are much likelier to return home and eventually occupy the nice houses they’re building,” he explains.The remote Indonesian island of Bawean, 120km north-east of Java, is something of a case in point. About 85 per cent of those who grow up there spend at least several years of their adult lives working overseas, mostly in Malaysia and Singapore. Many invest the proceeds in “smart” one- and two-storey houses with brick walls, tiled roofs and porches, balconies and gardens, which stand incongruously amid a very basic island infrastructure, consisting of only a few paved roads and electricity that works only a few hours each day. They are occupied by wives, children and other relatives and visited only once or twice during holidays by the owners. But all are seen as full-time residences for retirement.“People build for themselves and their families,” says Muhammad Roesidi, who left Bawean 18 years ago and still lives for most of the year in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he works as a canteen supervisor. He built his own home on the island in 1998 for Rp60m ($6,500) and visits regularly. “People believe in the value of property and so they build smart places as soon as they can. I was recently offered Rp300m but I turned it down because I don’t want to sell.”There is great debate over whether migrant mansions are good or bad for poor towns and villages. Quinones thinks it is “a disaster” for Mexico, where remittances totalled $23bn in 2006 (though they have slowed this year as a result of a downturn in the US construction sector, which employs many Mexican men). “When the immigrant workers return driving fancy trucks and wearing fancy clothes and adding a bit to the houses they only live in for a week each year, it has an intoxicating effect on those left behind. The most resourceful men and women whom Mexico most needs will leave,” he says.But others see benefits. Stalker and Garson argue that individual investment in housing improves the living conditions of the owner’s family, even if he or she is absentee; stimulates the local economy by providing construction jobs; and encourages public officials to work on improving infrastructure and services. Both also point to Mexico’s “three-for-one” scheme, whereby each dollar sent back to the country from the US is matched by one from the national government and one from the migrant’s local authority and then spent on development programmes, including low-income housing. Colombia has a similar scheme.Not all economic refugees invest in their home towns, of course. “A whole new generation of migrant worker doesn’t want to return to villages where amenities are few and housing poor,” Garson says. “Throughout south-east Asia, the young are increasingly attracted to the big cities and invest in housing there. They want better amenities, especially good schools for their children. Living abroad also raises lifestyle expectations.”In Europe, “the trend is not so much to invest in their village of origin but in an apartment by the seaside, which will make more sense for family holidays and as an asset for possible future resale,” adds Nicholas Bray, also of the OECD. For example Turkish migrants to Germany are as likely to invest in holiday homes on the coast near Bodrum as in the remote towns where they grew up.Nevertheless, the migrant mansion trend looks set to continue. “Migration flows are driven by push-and-pull factors,” Garson says. “Developed countries need more migrants and in developing countries it’s seen as one way to improve living conditions, reduce unemployment and acquire hard currency.”Additional reporting by John Aglionby"
173;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-11-13T00:44:29Z;Adobe CEO leaves software company;;Bruce Chizen said on Monday that he would step down as chief executive of Adobe, citing personal reasons for leaving the software company as it embarks on his ambitious strategy to become a central provider of the “platform” software used to support digital media.Adobe sought to paint the move as an orderly succession, with the job passing to Shantanu Narayen, who has been president and chief op­er­ating officer since early 2005.Yet Mr Chizen’s departure at the end of this month after seven years at the helm will bring an early conclusion to one of the most successful div­ersification stories in the software industry.Inheriting a struggling maker of desktop software for graphic designers, the marketing exec­utive who first cut his teeth at toymaker Mattel has devised a broader internet play that has taken the company into head-on competition with Microsoft in the race to become a critical supplier of platform software on the internet.“I’m at a point when I’d like to step back and think about what I want to do with the next stage of my life,” Mr Chizen, 52, said.He said he expected to sit on the boards of and in­vest in other companies, and had not ruled out other CEO positions.As evidence that his move had been voluntary, he said he would receive no severance payment. “If you get pushed out, you get a settlement,” he said. “Those of us who resign voluntarily just get thanks.”His departure will leave it to Mr Narayen, a former Silicon Graphics and Apple executive, to see through a strategy that has already pro­voked a strong competitive response this year from Microsoft.Starting with the Adobe Reader for digital documents and the Flash player for video, the next element of this strategy was now being put in place, with a product known as Air that allowed internet applications to run when offline, said Mr Chizen.Adobe said that the departure did not reflect any strategic changes or shift in financial outlook.“The strategy is working and we are on the cusp of this digital explosion,” said Mr Narayen.Adobe said revenue would be “at the high end” of its earlier forecast of $860m to $890m for this quarter, and that revenues were expected to rise 13 per cent next year.Adobe shares closed down 2.43 per cent at $42.19 in after hours trading.
174;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-11-11T19:47:57Z;Microsoft joins merging worlds;;The differences between online and offline computing are dissolving as software companies begin to merge the look and features of desktop programs and web applications.In the past week, Microsoft has launched a new desktop e-mail program – Windows Live Mail – that resembles its online service, while introducing software that allows developers to make offline-capable versions of online applications.Its moves follow similar initiatives by Google, Adobe and Mozilla, the developer of the Firefox web browser.Desktop software, such as Microsoft’s Word processor in Windows, and web applications, such as Google’s g-mail e-mail service, each have their advantages.A desktop program can use the computer’s hard drive to store data, including large multimedia files, and take full advantage of its 3D graphics capabilities.Web applications do not require lengthy installation processes and the software is seamlessly updated. Users’ data are held on remote servers that make them accessible from any computer with an internet connection, also allowing others to share and collaborate.Microsoft’s new Sync Framework enables synchronisation of online and offline data to resolve any differences in files as programs are developed that store data in both environments.Zoho, a web applications provider, has introduced a “go offline” button to its browser-based word processor, Zoho Writer. The button saves documents locally and is an implementation of Google Gears, an offline technology. Google is expected to use Gears to offer offline functionality for web applications. Microsoft’s Silverlight and Adobe’s Air technologies allow online applications to run independently of the browser, so they look like desktop programs but include data being updated live from the internet.Mozilla’s Prism technology strips away browser furniture to make services look like desktop applications. They can even be launched from their own icons placed in the Windows Start menu.“It’s not online versus offline or one displacing the other,” says Michael Gartenberg, analyst with Jupiter Research.“What we are getting closer to is online and offline merging. If it’s done correctly it should be fairly seamless.
175;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-10-22T18:16:04Z;Microsoft concedes defeat in EU battle;;Microsoft finally admitted defeat in its nine-year battle with the European Commission on Monday, agreeing to allow competitors access to technology that Brussels said would create more innovation in the software market.The US software developer agreed to comply with the EU antitrust regulator’s finding that it was abusing its dominance, upheld by the European Court in 2004. The result would be lower prices and more choice for customers, the Commission said.“I welcome the fact that Microsoft has finally undertaken concrete steps to ensure full compliance with the 2004 decision,” Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, said in Brussels. “It is regrettable that Microsoft has only complied after a considerable delay, two court decisions and the imposition of daily penalty payments.”Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, agreed early on Monday to make it easier and cheaper for rivals to link their products to some classes of its software. While only affecting software for so-called “workgroup” servers, widely used but low-value software that manages jobs such as printing from networked computers in an office, the decision is the first tangible result of Microsoft’s defeat before the European Court of First Instance, Europe’s highest court, last month.Thomas Vinje, counsel for ECIS, a trade association that represents rivals such as Adobe and IBM, said: “This is a significant step forwards. The innovation is there but is held back by the lack of inter-operability.”Under Monday’s settlement, Microsoft said it would allow open-source software developers access to inter-operability information for work-group servers used by businesses and other large organisations. Microsoft has 95 per cent of the market share in desktop publishing and more than 70 per cent in work-group server operating systems.Other technology companies using this information will only have to pay a €10,000 ($14,300) one-off fee rather than a percentage of revenues from any software developed as a result. Also, the EC imposed lower royalties for other uses of the software, reducing it from 5.95 per cent to 0.4 per cent.Microsoft also said it would not appeal against the decisive CFI ruling in September, which upheld the Commission’s finding. The decision was the culmination of an investigation that began in December 1998.“We will not appeal [against] the CFI’s decision to the European Court of Justice and will continue to work closely with the Commission and the industry,” the company said.In 2004 Microsoft was fined €497m for market abuse. It was also fined €280.5m in 2006 for failing to comply with the 2004 decision. Ms Kroes said the Commission would now rule “as soon as possible” on whether and how much to fine Microsoft for failing to comply until today with a March ruling that it had overcharged for information.
176;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-10-16T05:16:06Z;BBC to invest in iPlayer despite cost-cutting;;Cost-cutting will not constrain the BBC’s digital ambitions, the broadcaster indicated on Monday as it unveiled plans to extend the reach of its iPlayer online video service.“I strongly believe, as does Mark [Thompson, BBC director-general] and the rest of the board, that we do not intend to beggar the digital future,” said Ashley Highfield, BBC’s director of future media and technology.His comments came ahead of Mr Thompson’s meeting with the BBC Trust on Wednesday to outline cost-cutting plans that could affect up to 2,800 jobs at the corporation.“If we do not invest in this future, if we instead draw up the wagons around our existing services, the BBC will rapidly cease to be relevant to our audiences and will lose its power to be a force for good in British national life,” Mr Thompson wrote in the Sunday Times this weekend.The Trust faced “a difficult judgment” striking the right balance between investment in quality content and new digital services, Mr Thompson added, saying the BBC must “free some fresh investment” for digital distribution initiatives.The iPlayer, which allows viewers to catch up on programmes online up to a week after they have been aired, has caused concern among commercial rivals, whose complaints forced the BBC to rein back its original proposals when it began a trial of the software in April, excluding most book readings and classical music.On Monday Mr Highfield unveiled plans to make versions of the iPlayer accessible to Apple Mac users, members of Facebook’s social network site and 7,500 wi-fi hotspots in Canary Wharf, Heathrow and McDonald’s branches around the country.A deal with The Cloud, a service provider operating the UK’s largest wi-fi network, will allow viewers to download episodes of Doctor Who or Strictly Come Dancing in BAA airports and branches of Coffee Republic to their laptops without paying internet connection fees.The BBC hopes wi-fi distribution – including a version of bbc.co.uk for mobile phones – will attract younger audiences, which the BBC often finds hard to reach.A separate agreement with Adobe Systems will enable the BBC to make iPlayer available as a streaming service for users of Macintosh and Linux operating systems by Christmas, but will stop short of replicating the download service currently available only to Microsoft Windows users.Mr Highfield, who also announced plans to link the iPlayer to online TV listings pages of newspapers and magazines, played down concerns of internet service providers about the strain the iPlayer could place on their networks. “The UK’s internet infrastructure is more than capable of coping with the demand,” he said.BBC dividedThe BBC is suffering from divided leadership, a House of Lords committee claimed on Monday as the government rejected its call for greater clarity about the relationship between the broadcaster’s management and the new BBC Trust.“When the BBC is under attack …there is an urgent need for a united response,” said Lord Fowler, chairman of the Lords communications committee.
177;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-09-18T21:17:13Z;Wall St enjoys best one-day rise in four years;;Wall Street celebrated its best one-day performance in more than four years as investors reacted with jubilation to a surprise Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points.The unanimous vote to cut the federal funds rate from 5.25 per cent to 4.75 per cent was rapturously received after sentiment had appeared to signal a cut of only 25bp.The Federal Reserve also cut the discount rate – the rate at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed – by 50bp to 5.25 per cent.The S&P 500 soared through 1,500 points, closing 2.9 per cent higher at 1,519.78, its best day since March 2003.Stocks particularly exp-osed to turmoil in credit markets had dramatic gains. The S&P financials index closed 4.5 per cent higher while the investment bank index climbed 5.9 per cent.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, soared 10.1 per cent to $47.20 while McGraw-Hill, owner of Standard & Poors, put on 9 per cent to $52.10.The Dow gained 2.5 per cent on the day to 13739.39 while the Nasdaq Composite index closed 2.7 per cent higher at 2651.66“It was a positive surprise for markets,” said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. ”The reaction from investors shows they think the fed has made a strong statement.”However, the Fed decision rekindled concerns about inflationary pressures which had earlier been temporarily soothed by new producer price data.Producer prices tumbled 1.4 per cent in August after a 0.6 per cent rise in July and more than the expected 0.3 per cent decline. Lower energy prices last month sparked the fall in headline PPI, said economists.The core PPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent last month, following a climb of 0.1 per cent in July. For the past year, both the headline and core rates rose 2.2 per cent.The data helped pushed stock prices higher, but investors tend to focus on consumer prices – due on Wednesday – as a better guide for inflation.US crude closed at a record high of $81.51 a barrel, providing renewed support to energy stocks.In after-hours trading, crude surged through the $82 mark as traders bet that the Fed decision would give a boost to economic growth and raise demand for oil.The S&P 500 homebuilders index also rallied, closing 4.5 per cent higher, as traders bet the interest rate cut could provide a fillip to the distressed mortgage market.The sector had struggled earlier after the National Association of Home Builders housing market index fell to equal its all-time low of 20 points, a level last reached in January 1991.However, the S&P homebuilders index is still trading around 60 per cent below its peak in July 2005, and remains at levels last seen in 2003.Financials were the surprise of the day as better than expected earnings from Lehman Brothers galvanised the sector.Lehman announced a 3.2 per cent fall in earnings compared with the same quarter a year ago. But the decline was less than analysts had expected and the stock closed 10 per cent higher at $64.49It was Lehman’s first quarterly decline since 2002, and came as mortgage and leveraged loan positions were written down.The brokerage’s fixed income revenues for the quarter fell 47 per cent to $1.1bn from $2bn the prior year. Lehman said “substantial valuation reductions” led to a net reduction in revenue of $700m.“Investment banking revenues, particularly advisory fees, were stronger than we anticipated,” said Matthew Albrecht, brokerage analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Lehman was kicking off this week’s fiscal third-quarter earnings results with results from Morgan Stanley due on Wednesday and Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns on Thursday.Technology stocks were also in focus after Adobe increased net income for the three months ending August 31 by 117 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. Adobe ended the day 1.5 per cent higher at $43.71 at midday.Best Buy, the consumer-electronics retailer, was also higher after it posted a 8.7 per cent rise in second quarter profits and raised its guidance for the full year. The shares gained 6.5 per cent to $47.46.E*Trade Financial, the online brokerage, fell as low as $13.24 after cutting its earnings forecast for the year by 31 per cent, but even its shares rebounded, closing down 1.5 per cent at $14.
178;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-09-16T21:03:18Z;Microsoft says rivals may rue siding with EU;;Microsoft, which will on Monday learn whether a top European Union court has annulled the landmark 2004 antitrust ruling against the US software developer, is warning technology rivals they should be careful what they wish for.The developer suggests that other software and technology companies such as IBM, Google and Apple could be next in line should the European Commission decision be upheld. It argues that the legal reasoning applied by the Brussels watchdog may well be turned against some of the very companies that have supported the Commission’s case and trigger a broader crackdown on the industry.Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, told the Financial Times: “Obviously, law that is made for Microsoft is going to apply to other market leaders as well. IBM, Google, Apple and others would have to look very carefully at the implications for their business models.”Mr Smith added: “This is a very significant judgement because it will shed light on the answers to two very important questions. Firstly, under what circumstances can market-leading companies improve their products for consumers? And secondly, what rights do market-leading companies have to benefit from their own breakthroughs and inventions?“The answers will affect companies far beyond the IT [information technology] sector and will set precedents that will rule the behaviour of market leaders across Europe for many years to come.”Monday’s ruling by the European Court of First Instance will decide whether the Commission was right to find that Microsoft had abused its dominant market position by shutting out competitors in adjacent markets such as media players and server software.The company was fined a record €497m and ordered to change its business practices. This included having to provide technical information about the ubiquitous Windows operating system to rivals.The court and Microsoft have since been at loggerheads over the precise meaning of the 2004 ruling, and Brussels last year fined the company an additional €280.5m for failing to comply with its orders.During the nine-year legal battle, the Commission has been supported by companies such as Sun Microsystems, RealNetworks and Novell and various industry associations. While some rivals have since struck deals with Microsoft to settle their grievances, some of the biggest names in the software industry continue to back the Commission’s hard line.The most prominent backers of the Brussels line are grouped in an association called Ecis. These include IBM, Oracle, Sun, Nokia, Adobe and Red Hat. Google has not formally sided with the Brussels regulator, but is understood to have raised concerns about Microsoft’s behaviour regarding web search engines.
179;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-08-15T00:29:18Z;VMware shares surge on debut;;Shares of VMware, the software company, defied market nervousness to soar 76 per cent on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday as investors rushed to the most hotly anticipated initial public offering in the technology sector since Google.VMware’s shares rose well above their $29-a-share offer price, the high end of expectations, briefly trading as high as $55 a share before falling back to end the day at $51.The gains meant the company delivered the biggest opening-day gain for an IPO this year.That honour had previously belonged to Fortress Investment Group, a hedge fund, whose shares shot up 67 per cent on their first day of trading in February.Many market watchers had been expecting a strong performance.Sales at VMware have been growing at a breakneck pace amid strong demand for its software, which helps companies increase the efficiency of their computer systems by allowing multiple processes to run on a single computer server.VMware’s sales grew 95 per cent in the first quarter to $256m, putting it on track to top $1bn in sales this year.EMC, the data storage equipment company that bought VMware in 2004 for $635m, earlier this year announced plans to float a 10 per cent stake in the company to unlock value for shareholders.VMware’s stock price on Tuesday implied an overall market capitalisation of just over $19bn, placing it just behind Adobe Systems and ahead of Symantec in a list of the world’s biggest software companies.It is also ahead of Ford Motor, whose market capitalisation amounts to $17bn.“It is always difficult to know how the market is going to react, but this is certainly at the high end of our expectations,” said David Goulden, EMC’s chief financial officer.VMware, which was founded in 1998, has said it plans to use its $957m in IPO proceeds to fund a dividend to EMC and to buy a new corporate headquarters.Diane Greene, VMware’s co-founder and chief executive, said the company was looking forward to using its newly public shares as currency to make acquisitions. It would also reward its 3,000 or so employees for the company’s strong performance, she said. “For them to have equity that’s pure VMware is a big deal.”The company has granted 37m shares as options to employees, according to regulatory filings.Last month, VMware sold a 2.5 per cent stake in the company to Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, for $219m.It also sold a 1.6 per cent stake to Cisco Systems, the networking equipment company, for $150m.Shares of EMC dipped 3.7 per cent on Tuesday to $18.34.They had gained 7.5 per cent on Monday ahead of the VMware IPO.
180;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-06-01T20:23:32Z;Wall St rallies as data boost sentiment;;Wall Street enjoyed another banner week, with the S&P 500 and other benchmarks moving into record territory.Deals and earnings continued to provide a catalyst for big moves in a number of stocks. Technology and small capitalised stocks led gains as a series of economic reports this week suggested that the economy could enter summer on an upswing. While that outlook has largely reduced the chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut this year, stock investors focused on the bright side of a robust economy in 2007.“This week’s data has shown that the economy is gathering momentum,” said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services. “Retail investors have not been buyers of late and this should start to bring them back.”Late on Friday, the S&P closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,536.34, a gain of 1.4 per cent this week. The benchmark closed above its March 2000 record level of 1,527.46 on Wednesday and is now up 8.3 per cent so far this year.Mr Anderson said the S&P 500 is currently valued at attractive levels and that investors should look to favour growth over value stocks and also domestic rather than international equities.Blue chips also moved further into uncharted territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average made its 26th record close this year on Friday. The Dow rose 0.3 per cent to close at 13,668.11 and had made a new intra-day high of 13,692, for a rise of 1.2 per cent this week.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to finish at 2,613.92 for a gain of 2.2 per cent this week. For the year, the Nasdaq is up 8.2 per cent and approaching 2006’s gain of 9.5 per cent. The Russell 2000 index rose 0.7 per cent and closed in record territory on Friday, for a gain of 2.8 per cent this week.Among stocks in the news on Friday, Dell rose 1.45 per cent to $27.30, for a weekly rise of 5 per cent, as its its first quarter earnings beat estimates. The computer maker announced a 10 per cent cut in its workforce after the results.Shares in Dow Jones surged 14.8 per cent to $61.20 on Friday, for a gain of 18.3 per cent this week. The Bancroft family which controls Dow, said it would it would meet and discuss the $5bn offer made by News Corp in April. Shares in News Corp rose 2.5 per cent to $24.22.On Friday, shares in CKX, which operates Elvis Presley’s Graceland estate, rose 37.8 per cent to $14.65, after the company received a $1.3bn buy-out offer from Robert Sillerman, its chairman and chief executive.“We continue to believe the company will ultimately accept the $60-a-share offer from News Corp, with concessions that ensure the journalistic integrity of Dow Jones publications,” said James Peters, publishing industry analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research. “We do not see competing bids emerging.”Earlier in the week, Wachovia said it would buy AG Edwards, a brokerage firm, in a $6.8bn deal. Shares in Wachovia fell 1 per cent to $54.51, while AG Edwards jumped 17.3 per cent to $88.75 this week. The deal will make Wachovia the second largest US retail brokerage after Merrill Lynch.Ceridian rose 7.2 per cent to 35.41 after the information services company agreed to a $5.3bn private equity buy-out.The battle for the CBOT Holdings intensified this week. The InterContinental Exchange struck a $665m deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange to support its bid the CBOT.At this stage, the CBOT has agreed to be bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and has thus far not expressed a preference for a competing bid from ICE. This week, ICE fell 1.4 per cent to $142.97, CBOT rose 2.4 per cent to $196.98, while CME gained 4.6 per cent to $537.Archstone-Smith Trust, a real estate investment trust, was purchased for about $22.2bn, including debt, by Tishman Speyer Properties and Lehman Brothers. ASN rallied 11.5 per cent to $61.57.CDW, the technology retailer agreed to a $7.3bn private equity offer and is shares rose 12.6 per cent to $85.07 this week.In other deal news, Avaya, the office telecommunications-equipment maker, was in discussion with private equity firms and other investors about a possible sale of the company or its divisions. Avaya rose 17.6 per cent to $16.08 this week.Dendreon, jumped 24 per cent to $8.10 this week, after regulators approved its experimental prostate vaccine.Despite the general rally in blue chips, Citigroup dropped 1.1 per cent to $54.51. The bank is one of only five stocks in the Dow that are negative performers to date this year, down 2.1 per cent. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who holds 4 per cent of the stock, gave a ”vote of confidence” to Chuck Prince, chief executive, and said the company should be given ”some time to perform”.Citigroup’s shares rose sharply last month on news that Eddie Lampert’s hedge fund had built a 0.3 per cent stake prompting speculation that he might press for a shake-up.Google rose back above $500 for the first time since the start of February, gaining 3.5 per cent to $501.39 this week. The company released details about its new Gears technology that will enable people to browse internet services, including e-mail, either online, offline or intermittently connected to a network.Shares in Adobe rose 5.1 per cent to $44.53 on news the software designer will incorporate Google’s new gears.Biogen Idec rose 5.7 per cent to $52.29 this week after it approved a $3bn buy-back of its stocks.Wal-Mart raised its share buy-back program to $15bn, on Friday and sent its shares up 3.9 per cent to $49.47.Ciena recorded its third straight quarterly profit and raised its sales forecast. The network equipment maker jumped 16.4 per cent to $34.92.Verisign rose 11.4 per cent to $30.36 this week after chief executive Stratton Sclavos resigned.
181;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-05-31T21:12:12Z;Wall St gains clipped ahead of jobs data;;Wall Street tested record territory on Thursday, amid deal activity and the prospect of an improving economy, but gains were clipped ahead of major data due on Friday.Merger and acquisition activity was led by the news that Wachovia would buy AG Edwards, a brokerage firm, in a $6.8bn deal. Shares in Wachovia fell 0.7 per cent to $54.19, while AG Edwards jumped 14.3 per cent to $88.16. The deal will make Wachovia the second largest US retail brokerage after Merrill Lynch. Shares in Raymond James, a regional brokerage, surged 7.3 per cent to $33.31.In after-hours trade on Thursday, shares of Dell jumped 6.2 per cent to $28.58 after a rise of 2.6 per cent to $26.91 in regular trade. The computer maker announced a 10 per cent cut in its workforce after its first quarter earnings fell slightly from a year ago.On Thursday, the benchmark indices recorded their third straight monthly rise, but blue chips lapsed into negative territory on the day. The S&P 500 barely made a new record close as some investors consolidated recent gains. Investors were also mindful of the May employment report, inflation and manufacturing data due on Friday. Analysts cautioned the market could face pressure if employers failed to create at least 100,000 jobs in May, or if inflation did not moderate as expected.In contrast, solid data could boost the current sense among some investors that the economy is entering summer on an upswing.“People are saying, how can you keep stocks down when the economy is doing better than expected?” asked Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. He said investors had taken heart from the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes from May, released on Wednesday, as it appeared policy makers believed economic growth would hold up.The S&P closed 0.03 per cent higher at a new record close of 1,530.62. The benchmark nudged above Wednesday’s historic mark of 1,530.23, that finally eclipsed its previous March 2000 closing high. The June S&P futures contract settled at 1,533.30, after it had set a new lifetime high of 1,537.70 earlier on Thursday.Within the S&P, industrials and materials were the leading industry groups, while energy and financials loitered in negative territory. Wednesday’s record close for the S&P came after a gap of more than seven years. The industry groups that have driven the rebound from its nadir of 776.76 in October 2002 have been energy and materials.“On an aggregate basis, the full market recovery has officially arrived, with 75 per cent of the issues trading higher now than where they were in March 2000,” said David Blitzer, managing director at Standard & Poor’s.Technology stocks were off their highs for the day, but closed in positive territory with semiconductor stocks rising 1.5 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to close at 2,604.47, and set a fresh six-year closing high.Dendreon, jumped 26.9 per cent to $8.55, after regulators approved its experimental prostate vaccine.Blue chips turned lower after they initially built on their record close from Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.04 per cent lower at 13,627.64, after setting a record intra-day high of 13,673.07. United Technologies, up 1.6 per cent at $70.55, led Dow stocks.Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent at $54.49 after Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who holds 4 per cent of the stock, gave a ”vote of confidence” to Chuck Prince, chief executive, and said the company should be given ”some time to perform”. The comments, in an interview with Institutional Investor magazine, contrast with his criticism last year of Citigroup’s rising costs. Citigroup’s shares rose sharply last month after the disclosure that Eddie Lampert’s hedge fund had built a 0.3 per cent stake prompting speculation that he might press for a shake-up.Citi set a 52-week high of $57 late last year, and is 2.2 per cent lower so far in 2007. The bank is one of only five stocks in the Dow that are negative performers to date this year.In other deal news, Morgan Stanley announced it was buying Investa Property Group, the Australia-based real estate investment trust, for $3.9bn. Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $85.04.Ceridian, an information services company, agreed to a private equity deal worth $5.3bn and its shares rose 3.45 per cent at $35.37.Google slipped 0.1 per cent to $497.91, and off a high of $508.78, after it released details about its new Gears technology that will enable people to browse internet services, including e-mail, either online, offline or intermittently connected to a network.Shares in Adobe rose 1.9 per cent to $44.06 on news the software designer will incorporate Google’s new gears.In earnings news, Ciena recorded its third straight quarterly profit and raised its sales forecast. Shares in the network equipment maker jumped 17.2 per cent to $34.32 and boosted other telecoms stocks. JDS Uniphase rose 3.6 per cent to $13.09. Sears Holdings fell 1.8 per cent to $180.02 after its first-quarter earnings rose 20 per cent, but missed expectations.Novell rose 6.25 per cent to $7.82 after the network software company reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results.HJ Heinz reported an 8 per cent rise in its fourth quarter profit and beat estimates. It shares were a fraction higher at $47.58.Tiffany & Co, the jeweller, rose 0.2 per cent to $52.57, after a 15 per cent rise in its fiscal first-quarter profit, just beating estimates.Motorola lost 0.5 per cent to $18.19, after it said it intended cutting a further 4,000 jobs this year, raising total redundancies to 7,500 in 2007.
182;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-05-09T20:57:28Z;Adobe prepares to launch its Apollo mission;;Adobe, the world’s fourth-largest software company by stock market value, is about to go on the offensive.Best known for its range of desktop software for graphic designers, as well as its Acrobat document reader and Flash video player, Adobe has been caught in the crosshairs of a growing number of Microsoft initiatives of late.Later this year, though, the company plans to make available a new piece of software that will see it step firmly on to Microsoft’s turf.“It’s truly revolutionary,” promises Bruce Chizen, chief executive officer. For Adobe, he adds, it will be one of the most important strategic moves in its 25-year history.The “it” in question is called Apollo, a piece of software designed to bridge the worlds of internet and desktop computing.Internet applications written for the Apollo platform will run outside a web browser on a PC, mobile phone or other device, including (with more limited functionality) when those devices are disconnected.Ebay, for instance, is already preparing an Apollo-based application. Opened not through a browser but by clicking on an icon, like any other piece of desktop software, the Ebay application would be “fed” by information automatically from the web, for instance updating auction results or showing the latest new listings, while it would also keep some functionality when offline.“We’re disrupting how web applications are delivered,” says Mr Chizen. For some of their most heavily used activities on the web, users will no longer have to work inside a browser, he adds.By definition, that will make Apollo a direct challenge to Microsoft, which is trying to extend its own dominant PC software platform out to the internet, as well as on to devices other than the PC.Adobe has even taken a leaf from Microsoft’s strategy book. While promising to make Apollo an open platform for other developers, it is planning to build some of its own applications as well, much as Microsoft established its Office business on top of Windows.The first of these, unveiled in late April, is an Apollo-based media player to compete with Windows Media Player.Picking a fight with Microsoft has never proved to be a smart move for software companies in the past. Adobe is counting on three factors in particular to tip the balance more in its favour as the battle shifts away from Microsoft’s home turf of PC-focused application development.One is the near-ubiquity of its Flash player and Acrobat document reader on PCs, and their increasing use on other “client” devices. Those free pieces of software will serve as the launch pad for Apollo: users upgrading to new versions of Flash and Acrobat will be offered the new software free of charge as well.“By the end of next year, we could have Apollo everywhere,” says Mr Chizen.A second factor is Adobe’s core group of customers: the graphic designers who use its main desktop software products, along with the web developers who could use Apollo to extend the reach of applications developed for the online world.Microsoft, whose technology tools are typically used by software developers with deeper technical skills, has set its own sights on these professionals. However, their familiarity with – and existing investment in – Adobe’s products gives it a head start.The final potential asset is Adobe’s history. It has always straddled the PC and Mac worlds. With Flash, it is now reaching onto cellphones, games consoles and other devices.It hopes to use this history as a “cross-platform” company to set itself apart from Microsoft.
183;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-05-04T18:34:15Z;Out of the ruins...;;"The spiral staircase winds up to a rooftop overlooking the mountains around Kabul, mud-brick houses clinging to their sides like swallows’ nests. But Shawali Bahani’s house bears little resemblance to those traditional adobe constructions.Green-and-white candy-striped columns twirl up the front of the 37-room mansion and there are three tiers of balconies fronted by butterscotch coloured glass. “I built this house for foreigners,” explains Bahani, a 53-year-old engineer. “Afghans couldn’t afford to live here.”But apparently expatriates don’t want to either. The property, a $300,000 investment, has lain vacant for more than a year – clear evidence that the Afghanistan capital’s property market, so euphoric with speculative development after the fall of the Taliban in 2001, has crashed back down to earth.“There is loads of rubbish on the market,” says Richard Scarth, a British chartered surveyor who runs the Kabul-based Property Consulting Afghanistan. “Who wants to live in a 28-bedroom house with 10 bathrooms, no garden and nowhere to park a car? No one.”Such extravagance didn’t seem so crazy six years ago. Real estate prices in Kabul were higher than Tokyo or New York as thousands of international aid workers and consultants poured into the bombed out remains of the city. News agencies were paying thousands of dollars for one house with no running water and an unexploded rocket in the basement.Mirwais Ekhsani, a 22-year-old realtor who runs the Wazir Akbar Khan Property agency, recalls a time before the hardline Islamic regime ended when he rented a four-bedroom house to a Danish charity for $500 a month and danced with joy. By contrast; “in 2002, right after the Taliban fell, it was possible to rent a house like that for $15,000 a month.”But the market has changed dramatically in the past few years. “Now you would get $3,000 to $4,000,” Ekhsani says. Land prices in central Kabul have fallen from $500 per square metre to $300 per square metre. And speculative investors such as Bahani, who counted on a big influx of wealthy foreigners looking for lavish properties, have been left in a lurch.Still, many market observers see the correction as a positive development – a sign that Kabul is rebuilding and stabilising. Previously, the only viable place for foreigners to live was Wazir Akbar Khan, a neighbourhood in the eastern part of the city made famous by the best-selling novel The Kite Runner and seen as the Beverley Hills of Afghanistan in the 1960s. Because the area had been occupied by mujahedin commanders, many of its houses, with original fittings and swimming pools, survived and were eventually rented to embassies and aid organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross.Even here, however, the number of properties totalled only 450 in 2001. In the past six years, that supply has doubled. The neighbourhood is now a more social one, with Thai, Lebanese and Croatian restaurants, and five-bedroom homes sell for more than $500,000.More importantly, perhaps, the building boom has spread to other parts of the city. Neighbouring Shir Poor, for example, is filled with vast Pakistani-designed villas plated with hundreds of mirrored tiles. These properties typically belong to wealthier officials in Hamid Karzai’s administration, though the previous residents, bulldozed out in 2003, were never compensated.Elsewhere, whole neighbourhoods destroyed by the fighting, such as Karte Char and Karte Se in western Kabul, have slowly been rebuilt, driving prices down and allowing foreign companies, aid agencies and their employees to move in. “Every house in Kabul has the same problems with water and electricity, so people are now thinking: ‘Why not move to a district further west and pay half the price?’ ” says Naser Shahalemi, operational director of Gilbert Real Estate, a US-backed estate agency that does business all over the country.These re-emerging neighbourhoods are full of modest, three- or four-bedroom homes in streets that bustle with small tailor’s shops, beauticians and fruit stalls only half and hour’s drive away from Kabul’s embassies and the United Nations offices. But evidence of the recent conflict remains. Sitting in the garden of his three-house compound in Karte Char, where roses are just coming into bloom, New York-based owner Torialai Popal points to the bullet marks in the property next door. “My houses were like that,” he says. “It was an absolute disaster. It took a lot of work to make them habitable again.”Ordinary Afghans are still strugging to recover. The Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), which renovates houses and mosques and repaves roads and digs drains in Kabul’s medieval old city, has tried to set an example by restoring seven mud-brick houses with delicately carved doors and window panels and elaborate plasterwork.Many homeowners think they are too poor to do the work themselves, explains Jolyon Leslie, head of the AKTC, but such projects prove that damaged and derelict properties can be modernised with proper electrics and bathrooms for as little as $3,000.Walking up a staircase where an adobe nook for an oil lamp sits next to a modern light switch, he points out the mix of old and new. “The oil lamp is for the nights when there is no power,” he says.When AKTC started its work, Kabul’s historic quarter was under threat from developers who saw it as a slum that should be pulled down. But the group’s efforts to clear the streets and restore older houses has paid off. “The owners can see that these houses can be very comfortable and they are enormously proud of how beautiful they are,” Leslie says.The programme has also retrained scores of carpenters, stone masons and builders in traditional techniques as well as generating hundreds of days of work for unskilled labourers. But this is a drop in the bucket in the face of Kabul’s breakneck growth.More development – not of expensive mansions but of standard homes and apartments and infrastructure – is desperately needed to serve the city’s booming population. Thirty years ago, when Afghanistan was still a mecca for backpacking hippies, the capital had 750,000 residents. By 1999 it had 1.8m and, according to World Bank estimates, the number grew at 15 per cent per year for the next five years. Larger than the next 10 largest Afghan cities combined, it is now groaning under the weight of its own growth.Only 18 per cent of homes have access to running water, electricity is available less than one day in three in the winter months and the streets are full of sewage. Foreign aid agencies have moved in to help fix these problems but the side effect has been to push poor and even middle class Afghans out of the market. In Microrayon, a Soviet-built housing project that straddled the front line during the civil war, boxy two-bedroom flats rent for at least $300 a month, six times the average government official’s salary.This imbalance has a wider impact, says Hamid Hamedy of Hamedy Real Estate. “The cost of living is what drives corruption,” he says. “Officials have to live in the city but can’t afford a home.”“There is huge demand for affordable homes,” agrees Naser Shahalemi, of Gilbert Real Estate, who is currently in talks with a Dubai bank to secure mortgage lending for lower-income Afghans. “If you could build decent-quality flats where people could pay $300 a month, you would make money.”Raising the investment for more housing will depend on the security situation. Confidence was dented a year ago after the government lost control of the city to riots and crowds of young boys set about looting and burning. “It really set the market back,” Torialai acknowledges. “Foreigners were the target of the riots and it worried them but a lot of Afghan investors also pulled their money out.”With rising crime and a growing battle against Taliban insurgents in the south and east of the country, the risks are great. But, as the centre of the multi-billion dollar aid effort, Kabul will continue to see good demand for quality housing. Scarth – who with the London Development Agency helped prepare east London for commercial development even though some plots were owned by 100 parties and had no access to roads – thinks the situation in Kabul is similar. “You have to create the conditions for investment,” he says. “Kabul is crying out for the same sort of agency.”In the up and coming Karte Se neighbourhood, residents agree that better development planning would be welcome but many are thankful simply for peace. “There are no parks, not enough electricity and water but at least we can still make a living,” says Mohammed Akwali, a tailor whose shop opens on to a busy street. “No one is fighting here anymore.”Gilbert Real Estate, tel: +93 797-091 093Property Consulting Afghanistan, tel: +93 798-500 500; www.pc-af.com"
184;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
185;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2007-04-16T04:33:07Z;Microsoft to unveil rival to Adobe’s Flash;;Microsoft is set on Monday to unveil an internet technology to rival the Flash player, a piece of software made by Adobe that has become an ingredient in the success of video from YouTube and other online experiences.The move will touch off a fight over a strategically important internet technology, echoing earlier battles Microsoft waged against the Netscape browser and RealNetworks’ media player, according to analysts.Like Flash, Microsoft’s Silverlight player is a plug-in for web browsers, a software add-on that powers graphics and video.Flash has been central to advances in web technology that have turned the static, text-based HTML pages of the early internet into a richer interactive experience.That has made web-based applications an appealing alternative to software running on a PC, accelerating the shift to a computing architecture that threatens to weaken Microsoft’s grip.For Microsoft, creating a rival to the Flash player was “hugely important” since this was set to become the user interface for web-based computing, said David Smith, an analyst at Gartner.Jeffrey Hammond, an analyst at Forrester Research, added: “This is a battle for the next generation of eyeballs.”Flash is present on virtually all PCs, and is shipped with many new mobile handsets.YouTube’s decision to use the technology has added to its success: computer users whose machines do not already include the software are prompted to download it before watching a video.In similar battles in the past, Microsoft fought back against early leaders such as Netscape and RealNetworks by integrating its own rival products tightly with its Windows operating system – a tactic that exposed it to attack by antitrust regulators.The company did not plan to follow a similar approach with Silverlight, said Forest Key, a Microsoft executive.Instead, it would count on creators of web video and other content to adopt the technology, prompting internet users to download it to their PCs and other devices when they wanted to view the content.The player was designed to download in around 15 seconds, Mr Key said.Monday’s announcement will include news of partnerships with content produces that will use Silverlight, including Major League Baseball and Netflix, which rents out videos over the internet.A beta version of the software is due in the coming weeks.

I recently saw Adobe demonstrate its latest online meetings software, for example, and it looked perfectly feasible.But a recent piece of research by occupational psychologists Pearn Kandola, carried out for Cisco Systems, suggests that computer-based communication is vastly inferior to face-to-face interaction between members of a team working together.As someone who spends a good proportion of his time firing off e-mails, I can see the problem.The researchers found that virtual teams neglect the need to socialise to establish trust and understanding. Which might be good news for anyone pricked by guilt for socialising in the office.With non-verbal cues accounting for 63 per cent of meaning in face-to-face communication, the report (snappily titled “The Psychology of Effective Business Communications in Geographically Dispersed Teams”) says the main problems of virtual teams are an over-reliance on e-mail, a failure to respond to messages (“virtual silence”), and inappropriate modes of communication.This is a topic Digital Business will be looking at in greater depth in a future issue. We will ask whether the solution is to get flying again or to get the technology to deliver a more all-encompassing package.Among the issues examined in this edition are: women in IT and the worsening gender imbalance in the technology world; the growing importance of IT in mergers and acquisitions; and the contractual status of e-mail.In each issue of Digital Business, we look at key topics of concern to business readers and investors, arming them for their dealings with the world of technology.Each edition also includes updates on trends in security, SMEs, skills, and tools for the individual, along with news, columns and other regular features.And you can listen to Digital Business, too.

193;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Brussels and Microsoft step back from brink;;Microsoft and the European Commission appeared to be stepping back from months of conflict over the Vista operating system, after the US software group revealed on Friday that it had made significant changes to its new flagship product ahead of Vista’s launch next month.Although the Brussels-based antitrust regulator stressed that it had not given a “green light” to Microsoft, Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, gave an upbeat assessment.“They promised they would behave and take into account our rules and regulations. Well, I’m a happy woman,’’ she told Reuters.Microsoft’s competitors said they needed more time to assess the changes to Vista. But most of them welcomed the US software giant’s announcement that it would amend the operating system in order to ensure that computer users had a choice between using rival software or Microsoft’s own products.The changes focus in particular on internet search, security software and a programme similar to Adobe’s PDF reader that lets users create and send fixed documents. Microsoft said it would develop interfaces that would allow rival software to connect better with the new operating system. It would also allow competing software to “override” Vista’s own functions should users install another product providing the same service.Symantec, which had warned that the integration of Microsoft security features into Vista would undermine its business, said Microsoft’s concessions gave reason for “guarded optimism”.However, Symantec said it was crucial that Microsoft made available details of the new interfaces to rival companies as fast as possible.The company said: “If this is true then customers are going to be able to use whatever solution they want. The question is: when is this going to happen?”Symantec said it would require the new information “in a matter of days” in order to make its security software products compatible with the Vista operating system in time for next month’s launch.The probes by Brussels into Microsoft culminated in a landmark ruling in April 2004 that found Microsoft guilty of abusing a dominant position. The group was fined a record €497m ($622m), and this year was ordered to pay another €280.5m for failing to abide by the ruling.But speaking to the Financial Times on Sunday, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, said the two sides had recently tried to tackle their differences in a more co-operative manner.He stressed that the changes to Vista were based on clear Commission guidance: “In the last month or so the Commission gave us guidance that was quite explicit and direct. We got the clarity that we felt we needed.”
194;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;No delay to Vista, Microsoft says;;Microsoft on Friday said it was on track to release the Vista operating system next month, after making significant changes to its new flagship product in an effort to meet concerns expressed by the European Commission and the Korean antitrust authority.Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, said the most recent changes to Vista would ensure that the new system would not undermine competition in the crucial markets for internet search, security software and fixed-document readers.Mr Smith added that the changes were based on guidance given by the Commission, and that the group was now “confident that we are in compliance with European Union law”.The latest move by Microsoft is designed to avoid a new stand-off with the Brussels-based regulator, which two years ago imposed a record €497m ($623m, £336m) fine on the group for abusing a dominant market position. The US software group had previously warned that the uncertainty over the Commission’s response to Vista could delay the launch of its new product.The Commission has repeatedly warned that it might have to take action over Vista because it integrates a wealth of new programmes and functions into the operating system.Groups such as Google, the leader in internet search technology, Symantec and McAfee, which provide security software, and Adobe, the maker of the PDF document reader, are concerned that their business will be harmed if Microsoft “bundles” rival versions of their products into Vista.But Mr Smith insisted on Friday that Microsoft’s rivals would now be able to compete on a level-playing field. Security software companies would, for example, be given sufficient information to make their products interoperable with Vista, including the system’s controversial high-security “kernel” that is designed to protect Vista’s core against viruses and other security breaches.In an effort to meet Korean antitrust concerns, Microsoft will in that market launch versions of Vista that include links to competing media and instant messaging software, and versions of Vista without Microsoft’s Media Player.The Brussels regulator responded to the group’s announcement with a tersely-worded statement, insisting that it “will closely monitor the effects of Vista in the market and, in particular, examine any complaints concerning Vista on their own merits”.Both the Commission and Microsoft stressed that the regulator had not given a “green light” to the Vista launch. “Microsoft must shoulder its own responsibilities to ensure that Vista is fully compliant with [EU] competition rules,” the Commission said.Vista will be made available to Microsoft’s business customers next month, and go on sale to the general public in January.

199;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;Google deal to expand distribution of 'toolbar';;"Google on Wednesday secured what promised to be another important distribution deal for its search engine ""toolbar"" as it races to secure its position in front of a mass internet audience before the launch of Microsoft's new Windows Vista operating system.It also emerged that the search engine company was testing a new online advertising network that would let merchants pay a fee only when an internet user performs a specific action, such as buying a product or registering for a service.In its latest distribution deal, Google unveiled an agreement with Adobe, the maker of graphics and other PC software, to offer the toolbar alongside the Shockwave player, a piece of software widely used to view video over the web.Anyone downloading the player will be offered the Google toolbar at the same time, which plants a Google search box into the PC's browser. The arrangement echoes a deal Google reached with Dell, under which Dell will include the toolbar, along with other Google software, with new PCs.As with the Dell arrangement, Google will pay Adobe for distribution rights, though terms were not specified. Shockwave, a media player that Adobe acquired with its purchase this year of Macromedia, is already installed on more than 55 per cent of all internet-enabled desktop computers, the companies said, and downloads run to ""hundreds of thousands"" a day.Meanwhile, if successful, an experimental new advertising network, based on ""cost per action"", or CPA, would extend Google's range of advertising activities and reduce its reliance on the ""cost per click"" model that has been at the heart of its early success.CPA networks, also known as affiliate marketing networks, let merchants sign up independent websites to help find new customers for their products or services. The website owner is typically paid only when a customer actually makes a purchase, or when they perform some other pre-determined action such as filling in a form on the merchant's site with their personal details.Already used by companies such as Amazon.com, affiliate networks are starting to spring up more widely on the web.Ebay launched a form of CPA network of its own last week, offering to pay affiliate websites that carry its auction listings a share of the sales commission if the adverts result in a sale. A number of online advertising services companies, such as ValueClick and DoubleClick, also run affiliate marketing networks.Websites that take part in Google's test will be able to select merchants whose adverts they want to carry on their site. The adverts will be carried on a separate advertising network, rather than the AdSense system that carries the company's cost-per-click ads.According to details from Google circulated to potential test sites, the adverts can run in parallel on a different part of a webpage to the cost-per-click ads, and so represent an additional way for websites to ""monetise"" their internet traffic."

The company said a committee of independent directors was investigating its stock options grants.The fallout from an investigation into stock options grants also dragged Comverse Technologies down 13.1 per cent to $20.48 after it said it would miss a deadline for filing quarterly earnings.Markets were pre­occupied by crucial May inflation figures expected over the next two days. These could decide whether the Federal Reserve increases US interest rates later this month.“I think people are today positioning themselves with some nervousness,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is bracing itself for a big week on the economic front. This week is probably going to convince people of what the Fed is going to do. In my opinion, it seems like everyone is bracing for a real negative shock on the inflation front.”Walt Disney was a big drag on the Dow, falling 1.5 per cent to $28.90 after Citigroup downgraded it from “buy” to “hold”.Adobe was the best performer in the S&P 500, gaining 3 per cent to $28.84 on an analyst upgrade.Qualcomm dropped 5.2 per cent to $41.19 after announcing it had filed a complaint for copyright infringement against Nokia.

A rise in the price of oil and metals had given momentum to energy and mining stocks, while homebuilders also climbed.“Very simply, the recovery was extremely unimpressive,” said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Associates “It was based on low volume, and was uninspiring. There was no clear signal today that the market had found a bottom.”“It’s got bear market written all over it,” said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.Stronger demand for oil sent crude prices rising. Marathon, an oil producer, added 2.4 per cent to $74.17. Valero, an oil refiner, rose 2.8 per cent to $58.69, more than making up for Monday’s losses, which were caused by a refinery fire.Metals also rode a rally, and on Nymex, copper trading had to be suspended for 15 minutes as prices leapt by more than 5 per cent.

The Russell 2000 index of small companies reached an all-time high.Robust gains in materials and transport outweighed mixed economic data and disappointing earnings in software and healthcare.The week had an inauspicious start after CNBC revealed that Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, felt markets had misinterpreted his congressional testimony as being dovish on interest rates. Markets briefly panicked, pushing the leading indices down.However, continued solid earnings and an easing in the crude price to its lowest level in a month were enough to perk up Wall Street.The markets were also largely cheered by the week’s economic news. Fears of further monetary tightening eased thanks to figures showing an increase in productivity and a fall in non-farm payrolls.“Investors are cheering the top line numbers in employment and not paying attention to the fact that wages are up,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach, who was still nervous about the fact that oil, bond yields, gold and equities were all moving higher. “The market is focusing on the fact that the economy is still quite strong. We have all four markets going up, and somewhere along the line, something is going to give.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 had gained 1 per cent to 1,325.76 on the day, up 1.2 per cent for the week, its highest level since February 2001. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent at 2,342.57 on the day, up 0.9 per cent on the week. The Dow was at 11,577.74, up 1.2 per cent on the day and 1.9 per cent on the week.The materials sector was a star performer, with demand for steel and base metals fuelling upgrades. Nucor added 7.6 per cent for the week to $117.05 after an upgrade from Merrill Lynch, while US Steel gained 9.6 per cent to $75.10. Shares in both have doubled since October 2005, thanks to deal talk.Falling inventories helped copper prices to record highs. These supply constraints sent copper miner Phelps Dodge soaring 9.2 per cent to $94.15, and was upgraded by Bear Stearns. It has risen over 40 per cent since March.Transport was also strong. The Dow Jones Transportation index touched an all-time high, and at one point was up 5.9 per cent for the week. The index has gained 16.5 per cent since the start of the year.Freight shipper Expeditors International soared 24.5 per cent to $106.55, after it raised its dividend and reported earnings per share 20 per cent higher than analysts had forecast.Rail-freight carriers also gained, thanks to increased pricing power and growing imports from China. CSX rose 8.3 per cent to $74.19 on the week and Burlington Northern Santa Fe rose 4.6 per cent to $83.19.Software was one of the worst performing sectors: the S&P software index fell 2.3 per cent on the week.Microsoft continued its slide, losing 4 per cent before a slight recovery. It is down 12.7 per cent since releasing its earnings last week. Online auctioneer eBay lost 5 per cent on Friday - the second worst performance on the S&P 500 - and 5.6 per cent for the week.Adobe Systems, makers of graphic design software, slumped on Wednesday after it said second-quarter revenue and profits would come in at the lower end of its forecasts. It fell 12.8 per cent over the week to $34.18.Electronic Arts fell after its revenues and earnings forecasts fell short of market expectations. The shares fell 15.8 per cent to $47.85, their lowest since November 2004.The healthcare sector remained poorly. Cigna reported sharply lower first quarter profits and the company’s shares fell 14.1 per cent to $91.88. Aetna lost 1.3 per cent to $37.99.One of the biggest fallers was Procter & Gamble, whose forecast for the current quarter was below analysts’ forecasts. It fell 4.3 per cent for the week to $55.73.The NYSE Group rose 3.3 per cent to $68.60 on speculation that it would beat Nasdaq for control of the LSE. NYSE gained 9 per cent on Friday, in reaction to its successful secondary equity offering, which frees it to bid for other exchanges.
205;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2006-05-03T21:07:38Z;Wall Street pulled lower by P&G;;US stocks declined on Wednesday, pulled lower by a drop in Procter & Gamble, a slump across the healthcare sector and falling crude oil.“The market is reacting to disappointment in some of the earnings reports and to the stronger than expected economic data that came out,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at Cybertrader.Data from the Commerce Department showed orders were higher than had been forecast for US-made factory goods. A report from the Institute for Supply Management surprised investors by showing an increase in the non-manufacturing sector of the economy. Together, the data raised fears of higher interest rates.“The big news is going to be that the Fed cannot stop raising interest rates and it is going to have to keep tightening,” said Mr Tower.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent or 5.36 points at 1,307.85, and the Nasdaq was down 0.3 per cent or 5.87 points at 2,303.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day down 0.1 per cent or 16.17 points at 11,400.28.Procter & Gamble tumbled in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, despite reporting a 31 per cent increase in quarterly profit. However, its forecast for the current fiscal fourth quarter was below analysts’ forecasts. That sent shares down 3.3 per cent to $55.22.Oil stocks were depressed by a 4 per cent drop in Nymex June gasoline prices, following an unexpected rise in oil inventories last week. ExxonMobil fell 1.4 per cent to $63.77 and Chevron shed 1.4 per cent to $61.90.“We have had a $15 price rise without any disruption in supply of oil at all. This rise is based on fear of disruption,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “I can see it going back to the low $60 range.”The healthcare sector took a bad turn, with Cigna acting as a catalyst for the decline. Cigna’s 19 per cent decline in first-quarter profit drove its shares down 14.7 per cent to $90. It is down 32.5 per cent from its high for the year, set six weeks ago. Aetna was dragged down by the news, falling 6.5 per cent to $37.22.Microsoft fell 3.5 per cent to $23.17, which is its lowest level since March 2003 and makes it one the worst performers on the Dow this year. Its bad run started with its earnings last week. Traders reacted to a Wall Street Journal report that said Microsoft was considering buying a stake in Yahoo.Software-maker Adobe fell 8.6 per cent to $35.06 after warning that second-quarter profit and revenue would be at the lower end of forecasts.Auto-parts supplier TRW’s quarterly profits beat analyst expectations by 71 per cent. Its shares soared 13.4 per cent to $26.50, while Visteon and Delphi gained 2.7 per cent and 18.2 per cent respectively on the news.
206;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T18:06:46+0000;New Brussels warning to Microsoft;;The European Union’s top antitrust regulator has warned Microsoft that the next version of its flagship Windows operating system, Vista, due out next year, may run foul of competition rules.Neelie Kroes, the EU’s competition commissioner, wrote to Microsoft last week to express her concerns over plans to integrate an internet search facility and several other programmes into Vista.The Brussels regulator believes such moves may end up crushing providers of competing products, and violating a precedent set in the Commission’s landmark March 2004 decision ruling against Microsoft.Ms Kroes’ spokesman stressed that her letter did not mark the opening of a formal Commission antitrust probe, but said Microsoft would presumably have its “own interests at heart” and not launch a product that violated antitrust law.The group has already been forced to postpone Vista’s launch several times because of technical difficulties - and the Commission’s intervention could present Microsoft with yet another obstacle.Ms Kroes’ letter is also certain to distract the group’s attention from a crucial two-day hearing that starts in Brussels on Thursday.It will present Microsoft with a last chance to demonstrate that it has fully complied with the Commission’s 2004 decision and so stave off the threat of fresh antitrust fines worth up to €2m a day.Brussels believes that Microsoft has failed to implement a key element of that ruling, and has warned it will will impose new financial penalties unless the group moves quickly.Microsoft officials say they will on Thursday submit evidence showing the Commission’s accusations are incorrect, while signalling that its stands ready to do all it can to satisfy the regulator’s concerns.But while the group continues to battle on this front, Ms Kroes’ letter to Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, suggests there may be further clashes ahead.Her spokesman said the Commission’s concerns centred on the integration of “internet search, office digital rights management and software to create fixed document formats comparable to PDF”.Her intervention will be welcome news to companies such as Google and Yahoo, whose search machines are currently leading the pack, as well as Adobe, the maker of the Adobe Reader software for handling portable document format (PDF) files. They and other software companies fear that Vista’s powerful bundle of products could hurt their businesses.The regulator said it was was also worried about Microsoft’s “possible failure to disclose [to other companies] all technical information necessary to make competing products interoperable with Vista”.Ms Kroes’ spokesman added: “We are concerned that such behaviour may deny computer manufacturers and consumers a real choice among competing software products and stifle innovation.”A spokesman for the group said it had not yet received Ms Kroes’ letter, and was therefore unable to comment on its details. But he added that “consumers are free to use a wide range of competitor products, and Windows Vista is designed to respect the choices that consumers make”.

209;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2006-01-05T20:38:47Z;Google plans online video store;;Google will on Friday announce plans for an online video service that will carry a wide range of entertainment, sports and news programming, according to a person familiar with its plans.The web search company will also contribute to a “bundle” of consumer software that will be offered free over the internet, marking an attempt by Microsoft rivals to cement their position on the PC desktop before the launch of the next version of the Windows operating system.The pay-per-download video service, dubbed the Google Video Store, is one of the most ambitious attempts to bring traditional television content to the internet. For Google, it signals the first broad service where people will be expected to pay for content, as well as the first time the company has forged deeper commercial relationships with content owners.The service’s content will include TV shows from CBS, music videos from Sony BMG and news from ITN, as well as footage from the National Basketball Association.The search company hopes to position the video service as the web’s first “open digital content marketplace”, where owners of video content can make as much of their material available as they want, according to the person familiar with its plans.Access to the store will be through an iTunes-like interface that will require users to download a Google “player” on to their computers.In another sign on Thursday of the hunt by TV networks to find new ways to reach paying viewers, News Corp’s Fox Entertainment Group announced a partnership with DirecTV that will make programmes from its FX cable network available through video-on-demand as much as two days before they are shown on TV.The Fox announcements follow those of other big networks to sell their shows through new digital distribution channels or through cable and satellite video-on-demand.However, it marks the first time that a network has offered its programming to online consumers before it is broadcast on TV – something that could make it susceptible to piracy.The Google consumer software bundle will bring a new level of co-operation between a number of Microsoft rivals.Adobe’s Acrobat document reader, RealNetworks’ media player, Symantec’s anti-virus software, Firefox’s web browser and Google’s search service all face greater competition from the next version of Windows, which is due for release late this year.
210;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
211;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2005-12-27T22:04:09Z;Muslim investors top 2005 faith funds table;;In a year when the Standard & Poor’s 500 index has nudged up barely 5 per cent, investors would have done better by investing according to the principles of the Koran.Among the small but rapidly growing band of faith-based mutual funds, the main US Muslim fund has beaten funds run according to the principles of the Catholics, the Mennonites, the Presbyterians, and the evangelical Christians. In fact, with the $100m (£58m, €84m) Islamic Amana Growth fund posting a 22 per cent return for the year, they have pretty much beaten everyone, according to data provided by Lipper.Amana Growth and its sister fund, Amana Income, avoid investing in any company that derives more than 5 per cent of its revenue from alcohol, tobacco, pornography, gambling or the sale of pork. It sold stock in Albertson’s, a grocery chain, when alcohol sales began to edge close to 5 per cent of revenue. The Koran’s ban on money lending also eliminates most financial institutions. Morningstar, the fund tracker, notes that Amana keeps stock turnover low because the Koran warns against speculation. Apple, Qualcomm and Adobe are big holdings.Another small fund aimed at the large US Muslim community, the Allied Dow Islamic index, has reaped only 6.9 per cent for the year. It invests 80 per cent of money in various Dow Jones Islamic indices, with the remainder actively managed.The Timothy Plan, which appeals mainly to evangelical Christians, has a clutch of funds that avoid alcohol, tobacco, gambling, abortion, pornography and also any companies that advertise on shows which feature sex or violence. Its biggest, the Large to Midcap Value Fund, has scored a return of 17.5 per cent, this year after underperforming for some time.Among the rest of the pack, the Ave Maria Catholic Values fund - the flagship of four Ave Maria funds which hold a total of $400m - has returned 6.3 per cent for the year. It avoids investing in companies that facilitate abortion, donate to Planned Parenthood, are involved in pornography or offer same-sex partner benefits. That last requirement eliminates about 200 of the 500 companies in the S&P.New Covenant, the Presbyterian mutual fund which, with $2bn under management, is the heavyweight of the faith-based world, and MMA Praxis, the mutual fund arm of the Mennonite Church, have performed largely in line with the market. Both have more in common with socially responsible investing, avoiding companies that make firearms or that cause environmental damage as well as screening out gambling and alcohol-related companies.The tiny Vice Fund - which actively invests in alcohol, tobacco, gambling and so on - has returned less than 5 per cent.
212;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2005-12-16T15:28:02Z;Wall Street higher on lower crude;;Stocks rose in early trading on Friday after crude futures eased back below $60 a barrel. The market was knocked back on Thursday amid renewed fears of inflationary pressures, but Wall Street bulls will be looking for a positive finish for the week with strong corporate earnings and a slew of deal activity possibly giving stocks a lift.Half-way through the morning session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent, or 31.54 points at 10,913.21, while the broader S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent, or 2.57 points to 1,273.51. The Nasdaq Composite index struggled to make headway and was down less than 1 point at 2,258.67.Among early movers, design software maker Adobe Systems surged 9.6 per cent to $38.28 after it announced after the close on Thursday a 38 per cent rise in quarterly profits, beating market expectations.Fellow software maker Oracle fell however, losing 3.2 per cent to $12.42 after reporting lower quarterly profits.General Motors’ announcement that revenue may climb for fiscal 2006 failed to impress Wall Street cynics as the shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $22.04.Consumer electronics retailer Radioshack slumped 4.3 per cent to $22.70 after it said it was unlikely to meet its earnings target for fiscal 2005 because of weaker than expected sales of wireless products and high-margin items such as batteries and accessories.On the deals front, Albertson’s climbed 1.5 per cent to $24.35 on talks that the supermarket chain was set to be sold in a leveraged buyout valued at almost $10bn. An investment group of Cerberus Capital, Kimco Realty and grocery chain Supervalu was reportedly poised to win the auction for Albertson’s for about $9.6bn, or $26 a share.

214;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2005-08-02T20:25:36Z;Wall Street posts gains as oil eases;;Wall Street moved higher on Tuesday as oil prices eased from Monday’s highs and traders digested a string of corporate news, including US July sales from the big three carmakers.By market close, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent higher at 1,244.08 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 10,683.74. The Nasdaq Composite gained over 1.0 per cent, closing at 2,218.15 and touching levels it has not seen in almost four years.Despite the days gains, some analysts warn not to get too excited through what is normally a quiet month of trading.“We hate to rain on anyone’s parade, but according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac, August and September have been the two worst performing months [in the year] over the past 54 years,” said David Rosenberg, senior US economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.Equities were helped by a government report showing that personal spending jumped 0.8 per cent in June, following no change in May.The Commerce Department said income rose 0.5 per cent after a 0.2 per cent increase the previous month.The auto sector was active as three US manufacturers released figures showing an improvement in sales following generous discount schemes over the past few months. “People are looking at the inventories numbers, which are coming down and giving these companies a little more flexibility and control going forward,” said Chip Dixon, US equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in New York.Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler, were mixed at the close. The latter led the way with a rise of 2.8 per cent to $50.75. Ford was up 0.3 per cent to $10.88 while GM lost 0.9 per cent falling to $36.53.Tuesday also saw the end of the CNOOC saga, as the Chinese oil company dropped its $18.5bn offer for Unocal, thereby ending its takeover battle with Chevron, which was up 1.9 per cent at $59.56. Unocal was up 0.3 per cent at $64.53.Falling sharply was Tyco International, which dropped 9.6 per cent to $27.86. The diversified group reported quarterly earnings just above analysts’ expectations, but lowered its outlook for the full year, with rising steel prices set to erode profits at its industrial businesses.US cable heavyweight Comcast said profits soared 62 per cent despite decreasing cable and internet subscriber figures. The stock was up 1.3 per cent to $31.00.The market will also be waiting for other media companies, including Time Warner and Viacom, to report earnings later in the week. The media sector, whose stocks have recently been under pressure, rose 0.8 per cent during the session.Adobe Systems disappointed investors after the software company gave a third-quarter revenue outlook below analyst’s expectations. Its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $28.62Transocean, the world’s largest offshore oil and natural-gas driller, gained 3.0 per cent to $59.65 after its second-quarter profits beat expectations.
215;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2005-06-17T20:23:12Z;Wall Street caps week of steady progress;;Wall Street posted modest gains on Friday, capping a week of slow but steady upward progress. Five successive sessions of mildly positive gains heartened bulls that the rally that began in mid-April looked intact.Leading the gainers on Friday was the homebuilding sector, after strong results from KB Homes and positive comments from analysts.A spike in oil prices, another of the week’s main themes, helped oil companies and gave a further boost to the Dow Jones Industrial average which closed up 0.4 per cent at 10,623.07. At 1,216.96 points the S&P 500 had gained 0.5 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was virtually unchanged at 2,090.11.Over the week, the Dow was 1.1 per cent higher, with the S&P adding 1.6 per cent. The Nasdaq also gained 1.3 per cent.Also adding to animal spirits were new figures indicating that US consumers felt more confident in June.The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index increased to 94.8 from 86.9 in May. Wall Street paid less attention to news that the US current account widened by a larger-than-expected 3.6 per cent to a record $195.1bn in the first quarter.The positive outlook among consumers is perceived as a bullish sign for an economy powered by discretionary spending and helped to counteract yet another rise in oil prices. However, not all market participants were convinced that all was well with consumers.“We’re cautiously optimistic about the markets short term, however we are still very concerned about the long term, particularly consumer debt levels,” said Eric Kallen, managing director of Hayek Kallen Investment Management in Fairhope, Alabama.Crude contracts hit record highs in New York trade at $58.60. Oil prices have been climbing all week, and while they tend to act as a restraint on the markets, oil companies continued to reap rewards from more expensive oil.Chevron rose 1.3 per cent to $58.97, while Exxon Mobil gained 1.3 per cent at $60.89. In another positive for the oil sector, refiner Valero Energy rose 4.25 per cent to $79.95 after forecasting better-than-expected second-quarter earnings.The house-builder KB Homes became the star-turn of the market after it announced a 78 per cent increase in earnings despite persistent jitters about a possible housing bubble. Shares in the company, the fourth best performing stock on the S&P 500 this year, jumped 6.9 per cent to $77.25.Six other builders followed suit after Smith Barney raised its rating, reversing its February near-term downgrade on the companies, including Beazer Homes, which climbed 4.4 per cent to $58.93, and Meritage Homes, which rose 6 per cent to $83.75.Despite the bullish news about consumers, shares in Circuit City fell 4.2 per cent to $16.91 after the electronics retailer posted a worse-than- expected quarterly loss caused by heavy discounting during the period.The company’s poor performance stood in stark contrast to rival Best Buy, which reported earnings earlier in the week that surged far above analyst expectations.Adobe Systems also fell after the software maker behind the Acrobat document reading technology announced a 37 per cent rise in quarterly profit but also issued a conservative forecast for the current quarter. The stock fell 3.3 per cent to $31.34.Morgan Stanley fell 1 per cent, taking its share price to $51.38 in the wake of reports that the bank is considering selling its Discover credit card unit.Goldman Sachs was up by 1.12 per cent to $103.80 despite more bad news for the bank, which reported weaker-than-expected second quarter results on Thursday. While many analysts remained bullish about its prospects, Wachovia Securities cut the bank’s rating to “market perform” from “outperform”, citing earnings volatility.General Motors shares rose 0.2 per cent, to $35.68 after falling earlier in the week on news that its unions were balking at proposed healthcare cuts.
216;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2005-06-07T23:01:28Z;Cisco beats patent infringement claims;;Cisco Systems, the internet equipment maker, said on Tuesday that a US federal jury threw out a patent infringement case brought against it by Storage Technology, marking the latest in a series of recent victories for high-profile defendants accused of patent infringement.Storage Technology, the data storage equipment maker being bought by Sun Microsystems for $4.1bn, claimed Cisco used patented technology in its routers, devices that direct data across the internet.Storage Technology, also known as StorageTek, had initially sought up to $3bn in damages from Cisco but subsequently lowered its claim to $322m. The lawsuit, filed in 1999, was heard in a US district court for northern California in San Francisco.The verdict marks the third recent patent infringement decision in favour of a high profit defendant. A landmark $521m patent-infringement judgment against Microsoft, the software giant, was overturned by a US appeals court in March and remanded back to a lower court for re-examination.That decision stemmed from a US court ruling in 2003 that Microsoft had infringed a patent covering a core piece of internet browser technology. The patent governs the way browsers can be used to launch software “plug-ins”, which make it possible for users to handle applications like Adobe's Acrobat document reader from inside a browser.Also in March, a US federal judge threw out another patent claim brought by chipmaker Rambus against Infineon Technologies, the German chipmaker.Tyler Ochoa, an intellectual property lawyer at Santa Clara University, said plaintiffs have traditionally been perceived to have an advantage in IP infringement cases.The number of these cases has surged over the past decade, particularly those involving so-called “patent trolls,” companies that don't manufacture products and acquire patents with intent of collecting damages from rivals that are allegedly infringing on the patent.Other intellectual property lawyers, however, noted that the number of such cases has leveled off in the past few years because technology groups have become more aggressive in defending their patents.
217;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2005-04-22T20:32:21Z;Wall St ends volatile week with a sell-off;;Wall Street stocks finished lower after a sharp afternoon sell-off yesterday, as investors digested a mixed bag of earnings news and booked profits in the wake of Thursday’s gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 10,157.71, a day after blue chips booked their strongest single-day performance in more than two years. The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,152.14, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 per cent to 1,932.19.For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 per cent, the S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 per cent after surging share prices on Thursday lifted the leading US indices from 2005 lows.The volatile performance underscored the lack of consensus on both Wall Street and Main Street about the strength of the US economy and the prospects for corporate earnings in the months ahead.“People are very nervous,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.Market watchers said the big swings in share prices in recent sessions were driven in part by worries about the growing US trade and budget deficits and a glut of short-term, speculative money in the equity markets.Data showing a sharp rise in consumer prices, an upbeat manufacturing survey and the steepest fall in weekly jobless claims since late 2001 contributed to the uncertain mood.Technical trading also played a role in the big movements this week. A sharp fall last Friday dragged the S&P 500 below its 200-day moving average, a critical support level that may have triggered stop-loss selling this week. The S&P closed below that level again on Friday, raising the prospect of a further selloff when trading resumes next week.3M, the diversified manufactuer, led Dow decliners on Monday. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent for the week in spite of improved earnings.Shares in Adobe, the software group, slipped 0.6 per cent for the week after it agreed to acquire Macromedia, a software rival, for $3.4bn in stock. Macromedia shares surged 21.2 per cent for the week to $39.90.General Motors ended the week higher after it reported a $1.1bn quarterly loss and abandoned its full-year guidance. Ford Motor, GM’s chief US rival, rose 4.5 per cent for the week after it reported steep losses for the quarter. Shares in both companies fell sharply after they issued profit warnings earlier this year.Intel dominated trading on Wednesday after reporting profits up 25 per cent on strong sales. Shares in the world’s biggest maker of computer chips rose 5.1 per cent for the week.Internet stocks received a boost after Google weighed in with a five-fold increase in quarterly profits late on Thursday, boosting shares more than 7 per cent on Friday and 16.7 per cent on the week to $219.84.Yahoo, Google’s main search engine rival, rose 7.4 per cent for the week.Pharmaceuticals took a beating after several big drug companies reported disappointing earnings for the quarter. Pfizer fell 1.8 per cent and Merck shed 1.7 per cent for the week.Eastman Kodak fell 9.4 per cent on Friday after it swung to a quarterly loss. The shares fell 10.7 per cent for the week.Caterpillar led Dow gainers on Wednesday after it reported higher profits and raised its full-year guidance. Shares, which fell sharply this year after a strong performance in 2004, rose 7.6 per cent this week. Motorola was among the leading gainers in Thursday’s sharp rally. Its shares rose 7 per cent this week after the handset maker reporter higher profits.Archipelago Holdings, the electronic stock exchange, put on the most exciting performance this week. Its shares rocketed more than 74 per cent after it agreed to a historic merger with the New York Stock Exchange.Nasdaq Stock Market Inc, the NYSE’s biggest rival, jumped 28 per cent for the week after it agreed to acquire Instinet, an electronic trading group, on Friday. Instinet shares fell 19.7 per cent for the week.America West, the airline, fell 15.4 per cent this week amid reports that it was in talks to buy US Airways, the bankrupt US carrier.
218;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Adobe off 11% on Macromedia deal news;;Adobe, the fast-growing maker of the Acrobat document reader and other desktop software, fell foul of Wall Street's habitual dislike of big software deals on Monday as it announced an all-stock acquisition of multimedia software developer Macromedia.Shares in Adobe dropped by about 11 per cent after news of the deal, pushing the value of the acquisition down to about $3bn and eating into the 25 per cent premium it had initially offered on Macromedia's stock.By adding Macromedia's software for creating and playing multimedia content over the web, including its widely used Flash desktop product, Adobe said it would be able to sell a more complete set of software tools for companies to communicate all types of digital information to a broad audience. The move also puts Adobe on a more direct collision course with Microsoft, which is extending its own reach into software that lets groups of workers collaborate more easily.?This is not a consolidation play,? said Bruce Chizen, chief executive officer of Adobe an apparent reference to Oracle's declared ambition to use a spate of deals to cut costs and reduce the number of competitors in the industry. ?This is all about growth, which is why it's different from the other deals.?That message failed to impress Wall Street, however, where software acquisitions based on claims of growth have also been treated sceptically. The knee-jerk reaction echoed the response to the planned $8.9bn acquisition by Symantec, the largest maker of security software, of Veritas, which makes storage back-up software. Symantec's shares have fallen by more than 40 per cent over concerns about the difficulty of achieving the cross-selling opportunities such deals promise.Software mergers are held back by a number of factors, such as the difficulty of retaining good developers and the disruption that comes from trying to combine two overlapping sales forces, said one Wall Street analyst, who refused to be named. Also, ?you can't take two sets of products and mush them together very easily? a consideration that has complicated Oracle's recent purchase of PeopleSoft.Adobe and Macromedia share a similar business model. Like the Acrobat document reader, the Flash player is distributed free and is present on 98 per cent of all desktop computers that are connected to the internet. The companies then charge developers for the software needed to create files that can take advantage of this large consumer base.To offset the effects of the acquisition, Adobe said it would buy back $1bn of its stock. Although the companies have a large combined share of the market for software that developers use, Mr Chizen said they did not expect antitrust objections.
219;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Wall St mixed as indices regain some ground;;US markets closed mixed on Monday as investors struggled to get to grips with conflicting earnings reports from a handful of prominent companies and a fresh round of mergers and acquisitions.The broader US indices regained some ground after their steep losses last week.By the closing bell, the S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent higher at 1,145.98 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 1,912.92.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 10,071.25, however, extending last week’s losses that saw the blue-chip index record its biggest weekly fall in more than two years.Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist at Smith Barney, said investors had probably overreacted to a series of downbeat corporate reports and economic data last week. “There seems to be a greater punishment being meted out than is deserved,” he said.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said the sharp sell-offs in recent sessions had come in spite of seemingly solid underlying economic fundamentals. “The undertow is good,” said Mr Paulsen.He said that in spite of an expectation of slowing corporate earnings growth this year, many companies could see earnings growth rise into the double digits this quarter.3M, the diversified manufacturer and maker of Post-It notes, led decliners on the Dow. Its shares fell 6.1 per cent to $75.90 in spite of higher quarterly earnings. Net income rose 12 per cent but sales growth was the smallest in 2½ years.Adobe, the software group, fell 9.7 per cent to $54.77 after it agreed to buy Macromedia, maker of Macromedia Flash and other interactive online media applications, for $3.4bn in stock. Macromedia shares jumped 9.8 per cent to $36.72.Bank of America helped lift shares in financial groups, which were among the day’s best performers on the S&P 500. The bank’s shares rose 1 per cent to $44.73 after it reported first-quarter profits up 75 per cent.Texas Instruments, the computer chip-maker, rose 0.7 per cent to $22.92 ahead of its earnings report, due out after the closing bell. Intel, the world’s biggest semiconductor company, rose 0.4 per cent to $22.21. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s chief rival, fell 1.1 per cent to $15.28.Eli Lilly, the pharmaceuticals group, rose 1.6 per cent to $59 after its first-quarter earnings nearly doubled.GameStop, the biggest US video games retailer, rose 9.7 per cent after it agreed to buy Electronics Boutique, a rival, for $1.4bn. Electronics Boutique shares shot up more than 34 per cent.General Motors and Ford Motor, the struggling US automakers, met with mixed fortunes ahead of their quarterly results. GM, which is due to report today, rose 1.8 per cent to $26.07. Ford, which reports tomorrow, fell 1.2 per cent to $9.39.
220;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2005-04-18T18:03:20Z;Global overview: World equity markets still rattled;;World equity markets remained rattled on Monday, shaken by worries over the impact of a softening outlook for the US economy on share valuations.European and Asian markets fell heavily in early trade in nervous anticipation of a bloody follow-up to Friday’s sell-off on Wall Street.But the worst of the feared selling did not materialise on Wall Street as a classic two-way pull between bulls and bears kept the market swinging between positive and negative territory. This provided some tenuous support for European equities, but conditions remained highly volatile and sentiment weak.“It seems as if we have re-entered the bizarre world in which every piece of news must be interpreted as being bad for equity investors,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.At one stage, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 stocks appeared set to test the key 10,000 level, but it then rallied off the lows. At mid-session, the market barometer was 0.6 per cent down at 10,031.37.The broader S&P 500 index was just 0.1 per cent lower at 1,141.39 after some volatile rises and falls. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was unchanged at 1,908.12, helped by news of plans by Adobe Systems to buy Macromedia for $3.4bn in stock.The heaviest of the global selling came in Asia, partly in a catch-up to Friday’s weakness on Wall Street. The Nikkei 225 Average tumbled 3.8 per cent to a four-month low of 10,938, with the market additionally hit by tensions with China. It was the biggest percentage fall for the index in 11 months. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng retreated 2.1 per cent.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index retreated 1.8 per cent – its biggest one-day fall since August – with German and French stocks hit hardest.In other markets, oil dipped below the $50-a-barrel mark briefly, the dollar continued to weaken while US treasury yields slid back towards February levels.Views on the outlook for equities remained highly divided as investors digested recent signals of a slowing US economy such as poor retail sales figures last week. Paul Niven, investment strategist at F&C Asset Management, said the markets were undergoing a correction from the complacency towards risk that prevailed a few weeks ago.He said there had been a rapid shift from concerns over inflation to worries about growth, with little fundamental newsflow to justify it. The widely followed Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index – a measure of investor risk aversion – rose to above 18 yesterday compared with levels below 12 at the start of last week.Mr Levkovich said some renewed sense of earnings optimism was probably needed to turn markets around as the “damage to investor psyche is quite meaningful at this stage”.As of mid-day April 15, only 65 S&P constituents had reported, with 35 posting better-than-expected results compared with 16 that missed numbers. This 2.2:1 ratio of positive/negative earnings surprises was below the 4:1 level seen in the fourth quarter last year.Mr Levkovich said the big problem was earnings guidance. Of the 266 companies that issued profit outlooks in the two weeks to April 15, 135 had guided earnings lower while only 74 had lifted guidance – a negative 2:1 ratio. However, strategists including Mr Levkovich said the market was supported by valuations, low long-term interest rates and good balance sheets.
221;ADBE;Adobe Systems Inc;2004-09-21T20:25:56Z;Fed statement cheers Wall Street;;"Wall Street stocks advanced on Tuesday after Federal Reserve policymakers raised benchmark interest rates by a quarter point as expected and said US economic growth ""appears to have regained some traction and labour market conditions have improved modestly"".By the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.6 per cent to 1,129.28, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 1,921.06 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 10,245.01.While the Fed's decision had been widely anticipated, the markets had been hoping for a more upbeat assessment of the economy, allowing bulls to step in.The US central bank said: ""Even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity"".It also reiterated its belief that rising energy prices did not raise the threat of inflation.Jay Suskind, head trader at Ryan Beck, said the tone of the statement was neutral and that crude prices, which rose above $47 per barrel, were a headwind for equities.""If we had a flat-to-down oil price, we might have had a three-digit rally [for the Dow],"" he said.Market watchers have been divided over the extent of the so-called ""soft patch"" in which the US economic recovery has lingered in recent months.While bulls suggest an improvement is just around the corner, bears warn even tougher times might be ahead. Also, the Fed has attributed any soft patch to high energy prices, and they have not decreased.Accordingly, traders linked their bets on the equity market with their view on the prospects for the economy, with some saying a fourth-quarter rally for stocks is inevitable while others caution that it is more of a hope than a foreseeable reality.The discussion comes as the main stock gauges have struggled to rise past their 90-day moving averages. Technical analysts point out that significant resistance at technically important levels could cause further selling, while their breach could in turn spur additional upward momentum.Away from Fed-watching, the third-quarter earnings season gathered momentum with results from prominent financial services groups.In a reflection of Wall Street's inclination to be optimistic, securities firms' upbeat results trumped some negative news in the technology sector. Goldman Sachs shares climbed 3.6 per cent to $94.96 after the bank posted a 30 per cent rise in quarterly profits that easily beat expectations. The company has been the top adviser in mergers and acquisition this year, and its results also benefitted from strong performance in fixed income, currencies and commodities trading.The performance of fixed income business also helped Lehman Brothers, which said quarterly earnings grew 5 per cent.In a reflection of the recent stock market malaise, Lehman said revenues in its equities business fell 33 per cent. Lehman Brothers shares added 4.9 per cent to $79.74.The two banks' results helped the diversified financials industry group in the S&P 500 index rise 1.6 per cent with about an hour and a half left in the session.Two leading software providers offered opposing views on the sector. Red Hat, the Linux software vendor, saw its shares lose 12.3 per cent to $13.05 after it lowered its third-quarter revenue guidance.However, Adobe Systems added 5.2 per cent to $50.45 after the maker of popular PageMaker and Acrobat software reported a 62 per cent rise in quarterly earnings after the close on Tuesday.In the hardware sector PalmOne, the maker of popular handheld computers and accessories, saw its shares shave 15.2 per cent off their value to trade at $31.60 by mid-afternoon. The company warned of sharply reduced earnings in its second quarter.The shares of Research-in-Motion, whose devices rival PalmOne's, added 2.5 per cent to $76.44. Bradley Thompson at Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of the stock with an ""outperform"" rating, saying the stock it could increase 15-20 per cent in the immediate term."
