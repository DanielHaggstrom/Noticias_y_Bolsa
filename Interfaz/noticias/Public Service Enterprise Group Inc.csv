0;PEG;Public Service Enterprise Group Inc;2016-08-19T16:25:06Z;Williams faces investor revolt after spurning Enterprise offer;Rejection of proposal to create $80bn company heaps pressure on target’s chief executive;Williams Companies is facing a shareholder revolt after it emerged that the US oil and gas pipeline group had rejected a takeover approach from larger rival Enterprise Products Partners that would have created an $80bn company.Corvex Management, which owns more than 4 per cent of Williams shares, wants the company’s senior management to engage with Enterprise Products, according to people familiar with the hedge fund.Several other investors, who asked not to be named, told the Financial Times that Williams’ decision to rebuff the offer cast fresh doubt over the future of Alan Armstrong, the company’s chief executive.Shareholders in favour of a deal argued that Enterprise Products, the US’s largest gas pipeline group, was “a perfect fit” for Williams, as the Tulsa-based company holds complementary natural gas assets.“This is the dream combination,” said one investor, adding Enterprise Products had the kind of management that could help Williams flourish.The US oil and gas pipeline sector, which traditionally has not been a hotbed of dealmaking, has been under sustained pressure following the collapse in energy prices since 2014.Shares in Houston-based Enterprise Products have dropped about 28 per cent over that period. It had a market value of $58.4bn before details of the deal were made public on Thursday. A deal with Williams would allow Enterprise Products to cut costs and reshape its pipeline portfolio.Investors’ anger emerged after the FT first reported on Thursday that Williams had rebuffed Enterprise Products’ offer.Shares in Williams closed up 7.9 per cent on Thursday following the news, giving it a market value of $21.1bn. They slipped 1.5 per cent on Friday. Enterprise fell 2 per cent Thursday and a further 0.8 per cent on Friday.News of the bid came after the planned $33bn sale of Williams to another rival, Energy Transfer Partners, collapsed in June following a bitter court battle. Since then, Williams has suffered a series of boardroom upheavals, with six of 13 directors resigning following a failed attempt to depose Mr Armstrong.Among the directors that stepped down from the board were two activist investors — Keith Meister of Corvex Management and Eric Mandelblatt of Soroban Capital Partners — as well as Ralph Izzo, chief executive of New Jersey’s Public Service Enterprise Group.In a letter to Williams on July 1, when the six board members resigned, Mr Meister wrote: “I have resigned because I can no longer in good conscience serve on a Board where a majority of that Board was unwilling to make a change that I felt was critical to the future direction of the Company — replacing Alan Armstrong as CEO.”It is unclear whether Williams was approached by Enterprise Products before or after July 1. The structure of the offer made by Enterprise Products is also unknown at this stage. Both companies declined to comment.Williams said on Monday that it plans to appoint three independent board members before its next annual shareholder meeting scheduled for November 23.The previous deal for Williams collapsed after Latham & Watkins, the lawyers for Energy Transfer Partners said they were not in a position to provide an opinion on whether the transaction would be tax-free, which was a mandatory condition to the successful completion of the transaction.

I’m flabbergasted by the move today.”Trading activity soared in New York as markets whipsawed — more than 8.6bn shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, the third busiest trading day of the year.Equity volatility as gauged by the CBOE’s Vix index, a measure of the expected moves in the S&P 500 over the coming month, rose as high as 19.2 in early morning trading, before retreating 4.7 per cent to 16.2. Vix readings above 20 in the past have indicated an escalation of investor worry.Utilities led the benchmark index, with the S&P 500 utility index rising 2.5 per cent, buoyed by a 3.3 per cent rise from Duke Energy to $75.27. Public Service Enterprise Group climbed 3.3 per cent to $41.64 while PPL, an electricity provider in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, gained 3 per cent to $30.93.Often viewed as a proxy for bonds, utilities — which carry high debt loads, are among the most correlated to interest rate moves and offer above average dividend yields — have rallied as turmoil in the Eurozone and China lapped volatility higher.That unease has weighed on trader expectations of when the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates — a major headwind for the sector. Federal Funds futures now imply the US central bank will not lift rates until March 2016.The material sector was the only industry to remain in negative territory after the late-day rally, as investors took fright at turmoil in Chinese equities and gold and copper prices slid.Newmont Mining Corp, the gold producer, was the steepest faller on the S&P 500, sliding 6 per cent to $22.41, while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, dropped 3.3 per cent to $17.25, adding to Monday’s 3 per cent decline.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices dropped 15.4 per cent to $2.09 after it warned on sales and cut guidance after the market close yesterday. Computer graphic chipmaker Nvidia shed 1.9 per cent to $19.79.Additional reporting by Pan Yuk.
2;PEG;Public Service Enterprise Group Inc;2014-07-03T17:11:50Z;Utility stocks cool with temperatures;;Energy utility company stocks cooled along with US midwest and east coast weather forecasts, with natural gas prices trading near their three-month lows.The price of gas fell to $4.36 midweek from a spike to a high of $6.15 in February following the severe winter weather patterns. In the past three days, the price had fallen sharply from $4.60, said Travis Miller, a Morningstar analyst.The drop was the consequence of cooler than expected weather forecasts, and demand for power to run air conditioners and fans fell.“This is the biggest drop since February after the polar vortex,” Mr Miller said. “Utilities had a big run in gas prices after the polar vortex. It had a big spike and a big drop.”It was not unusual to see investors rotating their funds from utilities into more growth-oriented sectors, particularly in a rallying market, he noted.The fallers in the S&P 500 were led by Public Service Enterprise Group, the New Jersey-based utility company, down 3 per cent to $38.16.The Tampa-based TECO Energy fell 2 per cent to 17.71. New Orleans-based Entergy fell 2 per cent to $76.97, and North Carolina’s Duke Energy fell 1 per cent to $71.39. Chicago-based Exelon fell 2 per cent to $33.97.By contrast, the S&P 500 gainers were led by Petsmart, the US’s largest retailer of pet items, rising 13 per cent to $67.28 after hedge fund Jana Partners expressed interest in buying the company.Jana Partners on Thursday disclosed a 9.9 per cent stake in Petsmart and pushed management to examine options for the company.Jana, run by Barry Rosenstein, amassed its stake after a difficult first quarter for Petsmart in which sales missed expectations.Shares in the company have fallen roughly 12 per cent over the past year.A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made clear that, with its almost 10 per cent stake, Jana expected Petsmart to look at options including a sale, better operating performance and a return of capital to investors.Shares in tobacco groups Lorillard and Reynolds American jumped on merger speculation, after a CNBC report that the two were nearing a deal, following on rumours of talks earlier this year.Shares in Lorillard, maker of Newport and other brands, jumped 5 per cent to $64.41. Shares in Reynolds, maker of Camel, Pall Mall, Winston and others, rose 2 per cent to $61.56.Shares in truck manufacturer Paccar added 5 per cent to $67.25 after Volkswagen denied claims it was interested in making a bid for the company.Speculation of a potential bid for Paccar surfaced late on Wednesday after analysts at Sanford Bernstein said that the head of Daimler’s truck division had told investors that Volkswagen was eyeing a bid for the US truckmaker.Washington-based Paccar had been seen as offering the potential for VW to gain a foothold in the North American market where it lacks a presence.Volkswagen has been trying to integrate its truck operations more closely as it says that could help it achieve extra synergies of at least €650m annually within the next 10 to 15 years.That will help it boost its challenge to rivals Daimler and Volvo. VW’s truck assets comprise Scania, MAN and VW commercial vehicles.Christine Ritz, a VW spokeswoman, denied the reports to media outlets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to breach the 17,000 level for the first time, reaching 17,068.26 by close, buoyed by a much stronger than expected employment report.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,985.44 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 4,485.92.
3;PEG;Public Service Enterprise Group Inc;2012-01-03T22:18:50Z;Miners rally on Chinese economic data;;Energy and material stocks gave Wall Street a new year bounce as miners and steelmakers rallied on economic data from China.Alpha Natural Resources, which exports metallurgical coal to China for use in steelmaking, climbed 8 per cent to $22.07 after the official Chinese purchasing managers’ index moved back above 50 for December, suggesting China’s factories expanded output. US Steel Corp climbed 5.9 per cent to $28.03.The S&P 500 closed up 1.6 per cent to 1,277.05, led by financials, with Citigroup climbing 7.7 per cent to $28.33 and Morgan Stanley up 6.3 per cent to $16.08The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent to 12,397.31 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.7 per cent to 2,648.72.“Technically, stocks enjoy a seasonal tailwind early in the first quarter,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird, who said the S&P 500 could be set for “an attack on the 1,300 area” if cyclical sectors rally.Oil explorers and producers gained as the price of crude oil rose after Iran made threats over a US aircraft carrier near its waters.Driller and oilfield services provider Nabors Industries jumped 9.7 per cent to $19.02 for the best performance in the S&P 500 and oil producer Denbury Resources climbed 7.9 per cent to $16.29.A rash of joint venture deals announced between US explorers and foreign companies provided more evidence of rising prices for drilling rights in booming shale plays.Chesapeake Energy closed up 5.9 per cent to $23.60, after announcing a joint venture with French oil group Total.Chesapeake’s Total deal comes on top of existing joint ventures with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation but, despite the company’s apparent ability to generate cash from its shale acquisitions, its share price has fallen significantly over the past year.Analysts point to the company’s failure to bring its debt level to less than $10bn.“The key now will be to see how much [of the Total deal] flows through to debt reduction,” said Tim Rezvan at Sterne Agee. “Spending has been out of control at Chesapeake without the transparency of other companies,” he added.Devon Energy climbed 6.6 per cent to $66.11 after announcing a transaction with Sinopec International, another Chinese oil company, which will take a one-third interest in five separate Devon ventures for $2.2bn.Oilfield services provider Halliburton was a rare faller, closing 1 per cent lower at $34.15, as BPproceeded with plans to recover all costs related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill from the company.A Washington court’s decision to delay implementation of Environmental Protection Agency rules on interstate air pollution wreaked havoc among coal miners and utilities.The EPA rules, which were meant to be effective from January 1, aim to curb mercury and sulphur emissions from power stations.Coal miner Peabody Energy rose 8.8 per cent to $36.01, while Consol Energy, which operates coal-fired power stations, climbed 6.1 per cent to $38.93.But not all analysts were convinced by the rally. “This is just a temporary reprieve,” said Brandon Blossman, of Tudor Pickering. “Clean air regulations have been moving along for the last 30 years and this is just the latest incarnation. The industry is not going to reverse the trend.”Non-coal utilities had rallied strongly since the EPA first announced the new clean air rules on December 21, but gave up gains on Tuesday. Gas focused Public Service Enterprise Group fell 3.6 per cent to $31.81 and FirstEnergy fell 3.4 per cent to $42.81.Wynn Resorts climbed 3.2 per cent to $113.97. The casino and resort company was boosted by news that gaming revenues in Macao had surged in 2011.Fears that scarcer credit in China would lead to a fall in junket tourism by Chinese businesses to Macao had weighed heavily on Wynn in 2011.Shares in Tenet Healthcare slumped 3.3 per cent to $4.96 as Citigroup analysts downgraded the stock and told clients to brace themselves for “a long bear market in US entitlement spending”.Gary Taylor, of Citigroup, said Medicare-exposed companies could suffer revenue squeezes as healthcare spending becomes a target of government spending cuts.Barclays Capital analysts were bullish on semiconductor stocks, arguing that manufacturers have almost completed the process of running down excess inventory.“We expect demand trends to begin to outpace end-market growth beginning in [the second quarter of] 2012, enabling overall semi revenue growth of flat to 4 per cent in 2012,” said C.J. Muse of Barclays Capital. Micron Technology surged 7.3 per cent to $6.75, as Barclays Capital recommended that clients buy the stock.Shares in Californian rare-earth miner Molycorp climbed 4.8 per cent to $25.12 after the company said more than three-quarters of phase-one production at its flagship California manufacturing facility had been committed to customer orders or internal use.
4;PEG;Public Service Enterprise Group Inc;2011-12-21T22:06:04Z;EPA toughens rules on US power emissions;;The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday released tough new rules that will impose for the first time nationwide limits on the emission of mercury and other toxic air pollutants from certain US power plants.“This has been 20 years in the making,” Lisa Jackson, the EPA administrator, said in Washington. “This is a great victory for public health.”The EPA estimates that the total health and economic benefits of the new standards will be as much as $90bn a year. Power plants are among the largest US source of pollutants such as mercury that have been linked to a range of disorders, including developmental problems in children.Ms Jackson also touted the job-creating potential of the new rules. While the measures will cost about $9.6bn to implement, she said that installing and maintaining new pollution controls would provide 46,000 short-term construction jobs and 8,000 long-term utility jobs.The regulations have provoked a storm of criticism from owners of coal-fired power plants that may have to pay for expensive retrofits to their plants, or even be forced to shut them down, to meet the new standards.Steve Miller, head of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a lobby group backed by US coal miners, said the rules would “destroy jobs, raise the cost of energy and could even make electricity less reliable”.However, the energy industry has been far from united on the issue. Owners of nuclear power and gas-fired power plants such as Exelon have backed the measures, arguing that they will encourage a switch to cleaner technologies.Eric Svenson, vice-president of policy and environment at PSEG, the New Jersey-based power company, said the rules were “overdue” and praised the EPA for adopting a pragmatic approach.In its final ruling, the EPA offered some concessions to the power industry. The agency said it would encourage state authorities to give companies longer to implement new emission reduction technologies and made several technical adjustments to its earlier proposals.Mr Svenson noted that, despite the outcry from some interest groups, much of the industry was already compliant with the new standards. PSEG has already spent about $1.6bn on upgrading three of its power plants.According to the EPA, which has been trying to regulate power plant emissions for about two decades, there are about 1,100 coal units and about 300 oil-fired units at power plants in the US that will be covered by the rules.Susan Tierney, managing principal with Analysis Group and a former assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Energy, said the rules would provide “certainty for investment decisions in the electric power industry”, adding that the EPA had already regulated toxic pollution from most other important sources.Frances Beinecke, president of the National Resources Defence Council, said: “We can breathe easier today. After decades of industry-induced delay, the EPA did exactly what it was designed to do: look out for our health and our environment.”

The S&P financial index added 1.1 per cent while the KBW banking index climbed 1.4 per cent.The sector was helped by news that banking capital requirements agreed over the weekend were less punitive than some had feared.These gains helped the S&P 500 up 0.9 per cent to 1,280.09, with the index finding support just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses, and traders are using the 200-day average as an excuse to get back in,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound on Wall Street was broad based, with all 10 big S&P indices gaining ground.But technology stocks saw the strongest gains, rebounding from the 1.8 per cent losses in the previous session.The S&P technology index, which had suffered a 10.7 per cent correction since its last cyclical high in February, was up 1.4 per cent.Microsoft was one of the best performing stocks in the sector, rising 3.7 per cent to $25.20 in the biggest one-day move upwards in more than nine months. On Tuesday, the technology group is launching a new cloud version of Microsoft Office.Elsewhere, Amazon was up 4.5 per cent to $201.25 while Adobe Systems added 3.1 per cent to $30.89.The material sector was the worst performing in the session as commodity prices softened. Allegheny Technologies fell 1.5 per cent to $59.11 and the S&P material index was up 0.2 per cent.Sentiment in the session was not helped by weak data on consumer spending, but these technical factors meant the news was largely shrugged off by the markets. Still, data from the commerce department showed that consumer spending had remained largely unchanged in May, which was the first time in nearly a year that spending had not gone up. The figure was also below the 0.1 per cent rise that had been expected by economists.The data are just one in a long line of weak economic numbers released in the past few months which have left the S&P 500 6.1 per cent lower since the start of May.“With the economic indicators weakening and the concerns about the European periphery rising, markets are once again questioning the strength of the economic recovery,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.Even so, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 12,043.56 in the session, reclaiming its 150-day moving average lost last week.The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3 per cent to 2,688.28, bouncing off its own 200-day moving average level hit on Friday.The Nasdaq and the Dow indices are on their way towards 5.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent losses this month, respectively.

6;PEG;Public Service Enterprise Group Inc;2010-08-13T02:01:35Z;Johnson & Johnson borrows at record lows;;Johnson & Johnson joined the list of well-known, highly rated companies taking advantage of the plunge in interest rates to borrow at record lows.The maker of Tylenol, Band-aids and baby lotion on Thursday was selling $1.1bn of 10-year and 30-year bonds, both with the lowest ever coupon payments.“Investors are putting money in the corporate bond market because it is considered a safe place notwithstanding the fact that the macroeconomic picture is not very strong,” said David Trahan, head of the US investment grade syndicate at Citigroup, which was a bookrunner on the deal.With the stock market volatile and the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yield well below 3 per cent, investors have been buying corporate debt to gain some additional yield for what they perceive as modest extra risk. Corporate default rates have plummeted since the financial crisis and companies have been hoarding cash.But the rock-bottom rates are not tempting all investors. Some caution that these levels leave little room for error in an uncertain economic environment and one where rates ultimately have to rise.“Companies are playing bond buyers for the fool,” said Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.J&J, which carries a rare triple A rating, was selling 10-year bonds with an expected final coupon of 2.95 per cent and 30-year bonds with an expected final coupon of 4.5 per cent, the lowest ever paid on both types of debt, according to Thomson Reuters.The 10-year debt came with lower proposed interest payment than the previous records set by PSEG and McDonald’s in recent deals, while the coupon on the 30-year bonds J&J sold was lower than for a recent deal priced by Northern State Power Minnesota.IBM last week sold bonds to investors at the lowest rate for any corporate bond, according to bankers. It raised $1.5bn in three-year bonds with a coupon of 1 per cent, or just 30 basis points over Treasuries.While absolute yields are at historic lows, risk premiums, or spreads to Treasuries, have not reached this level. The yields on J&Js bonds, which priced at a slight discount to par, were at a spread of 43bp and 68bp, respectively, for the 10 and 30-year tranches.Even as corporate borrowing costs have steadily ratcheted lower, bankers said that J&J could represent the bottom. “It is not going to be easily eclipsed,” said Mr Trahan.“I doubt we will see [bonds sales] with rates below Treasuries anytime soon.”
7;PEG;Public Service Enterprise Group Inc;2010-02-12T00:22:33Z;US power groups to merge in $4.7bn deal;;"FirstEnergy agreed on Thursday to acquire Allegheny Energy for $4.7bn in an all-stock deal that would create one of the largest utility groups in the US.The combined company would have 10 regulated power utilities across seven states; Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and West Virginia. It would have 24,000 megawatts of generating capacity from coal, nuclear, natural gas, oil and renewable power.Some analysts think a deal between FirstEnergy and Allegheny could lead to more tie-ups in the utility sector, which they say is ripe for consolidation. Karl Miller, founder of MMC Energy, noted that the US has more than 250 mid-size and large utilities and distribution companies.But regulators have scuttled previous merger attempts by utilities. FPL, which owns Florida’s largest utility, abandoned a $11.4bn takeover attempt of Constellation Energy group in 2006 after a face-off with regulators in Maryland, where Constellation is based. Exelon, a utility based in Chicago, dropped its plan in 2006 to buy Public Service Enterprise Group of New Jersey amid concerns by regulators in that state.In both cases, legislators raised concerns that the combined utility groups could lead to higher power rates.Anthony Alexander, FirstEnergy president and chief executive officer, said he did not anticipate any problem with regulators, given two of the six states involved do not require formal approval, and in the other four the companies have good relationships with regulators.“We have very strong …customer satisfaction ratings in those states. We are active in the communities,” Mr Alexander said.FirstEnergy said it expected to close the deal with Allegheny in 12 to 14 months. They expect the combined company, which would have more than 6m customers, to have $16bn in annual revenue and $1.4bn in annual net income, combining year-end 2009 figures.Under the agreement, Allegheny shareholders would receive 0.667 shares of FirstEnergy common stock for each share of Allegheny they own. Based on the closing stock prices for both companies on Wednesday, Allegheny shareholders would receive a value of $27.65 per share, or a total of $4.7bn. FirstEnergy also will assume about $3.8bn in Allegheny debt.The offer represents a premium of 31.6 per cent to the closing price of Allegheny on Wednesday, and a 22.3 per cent premium to the average stock price of Allegheny over the last 60 days."

The gains brought the Dow Jones Industrial Average to within 170 points of its all time high, set in January 2000.Microsoft announced that its Zune digital music player – a rival to Apple’s iPod – would be available for the Christmas shopping season. Goldman Sachs also raised its price target on the stock from $30 to $33, and said the company’s Vista operating system might meet its January release date. Microsoft shares jumped 4.9 per cent over the week to $26.85, their highest level since April.Reports of buyout activity were behind two of the week’s biggest moves. Freescale Semiconductor, which was spun off by Motorola in 2004, soared 20.8 per cent to $37.16 over the week on rumours that two private equity groups were bidding to buy the chipmaker for about $16bn. If the deal goes through, it will be the largest leveraged buyout to date in the technology industry.Home improvement retailer Home Depot leapt 8.1 per cent to $37.22 on rumours that Edward Lampert, a well-known hedge fund manager, might invest in the company.There were other signals of strength in the consumer sector. Electronics retailer Best Buy gained 16.2 per cent to $53.83 over the week, after it announced a better than expected gain in second quarter earnings, helped by robust sales of flat panel televisions.

On Friday, data showed that core consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in August, in line with expectations, cooling fears of rising inflation.“The week’s themes were all positive,” said Fritz Meyer, senior investment officer at AIM Investments.“Gasoline is down, mortgage rates are down, and consumer spending is holding up,” he said.“Stocks like it, and they like the combination of healthy economic growth coupled with fading anxiety over inflation.”Commodities had another bad week with crude oil, copper and gold all sliding. The S&P Diversified Metals and Mining Index slumped 8.8 per cent, and eight of the 10 worst performers in the S&P 500 for the week were miners and energy companies.On the week, Freeport McMoran and Newmont Mining slumped 10.6 per cent to $52.10 and 8.4 per cent to $44.15, respectively. ExxonMobil sank 3.2 per cent to $64.65.The lower energy prices proved a boon for Wal-Mart, however, which added 3.2 per cent to $48.22, while energy-intensive chemical maker Dupont, ticked up 5.6 per cent over the week to $42.25.Ford Motor announced it would cut annual costs by about $5bn and shed 10,000 salaried jobs - in addition to cuts of 4,000 previously announced – as part of its restructuring plan.

The stock shed 4.2 per cent to $47.18.Nymex crude ticked higher but data showing unexpectedly high inventories of crude oil and gasoline still depressed energy stocks. Marathon Oil declined 3.4 per cent to $84.18 and Weatherford International fell 2.1 per cent to $43.35.The Nasdaq was helped by gains from Ebay and Amazon, which added 4.7 per cent to $28.45 and 3.9 per cent to $30.67 respectively.Chipmakers also staged a rally.

12;PEG;Public Service Enterprise Group Inc;2006-06-02T21:24:41Z;Wall Street mixed as data vie with rising crude;;Wall Street lacked a clear direction this week as investors weighed strengthening oil prices against the potentially soothing implications of benign economic data.Telecommunications and energy services companies were in the news, with Ciena, Qwest and NRG Energy all posting strong gains.Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards and Sons, said market activity was sluggish.“I call it a turtle market,” said Mr Goldman. “A turtle plods along and carries a wall of worry on its back. I think the market is going to plod along and not be a bull or a bear.“There’s enough muck on the ground that the turtle is not going to make much progress.”Economic data this week helped ease fears of inflationary pressures in the US economy. On Friday, non-farm payroll figures showed job growth was significantly weaker than expected, while other figures showed a slowing in manufacturing and construction activity.Markets took the data in their stride, and were unfazed by the release of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s May meeting, which said inflation expectations had risen.Oil pushed higher, with crude for July delivery finishing the week at $72.33 – a three week high – as Tehran brushed off a conditional offer of talks from the US.At the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 2.51 points, for the day at 1,288.22, a weekly gain of 0.6 per cent.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent, or 12.41 points, at 11,247.87, a loss of 0.3 per cent for the week.Communications stocks were the week’s strongest performers, in spite of a precipitous fall for ADC Telecommunications, which sank 23.5 per cent to $17.63 after it announced it would buy Andrew Corp for $2bn.Ciena was in the vanguard of the telecoms rally. The producer of telecoms software posted a far smaller quarterly loss than had been expected, and gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the third quarter. The shares gained 16.8 per cent to $4.65, a seven week high.Qwest followed suit, jumping 7.5 per cent to $7.45, its highest level since April 2002, while a broker upgrade for AT&T sent shares 1.9 per cent higher to $26.73.The traditionally defensive utility sector saw heavy trading as deals news buoyed stocks, sending the S&P Utilities Index up 2.6 per cent on the week. NRG Energy leapt 16.9 per cent to $51.07 after Mirant announced it had made an $8bn cash-and-shares bid for the company. Other power companies rose on the news, with Dynegy up 8.1 per cent to $5.34 and Reliant gaining 4.9 per cent to $12.01.Public Service Enterprise jumped 5.2 per cent to $67.03 after regulators approved the transfer of its licences to Exelon ahead of their upcoming merger.“Defensive growth areas are attracting more attention, as they should do,” said Mr Goldman at AG Edwards.Energy distribution companies were also pulled higher by acquisitions in the sector. Kinder Morgan added 19.8 per cent to $101.10 following news that senior management and private equity groups were launching a buy-out that would take the utility back into private hands. The news pulled Williams up 9 per cent to $23.26 and El Paso added 2.2 per cent to $15.48.NYSE Group rose 6.6 per cent to $65.43 after it signed an agreement to merge with Euronext in a $10.2bn deal.Healthcare stocks staged a rally, with UnitedHealth gaining 9 per cent to $46.98, its best week since November 2004.

The Nasdaq Composite pulled back from an early rally, falling 0.3 per cent to 2,127.85.The three leading US indices have notched modest gains this month following a rally that began in late October and gained steam in November in the wake of the US presidential election.Last week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both touched 3½-year highs, and yesterday, Standard & Poors, the investment resarch group, said that it expects operating earnings on the S&P500 index to top $160bn in the fourth quarter - a new record. .Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, said that, although he expected Wall Street to continue to gain ground through the year-end, economic growth was likely to slow in 2005 as the effects of rising interest rates take hold and prices rise to make up for the falling value of the dollar.Bullish investors focused on the short term were cheered in early trading by upbeat reports from Intel and Nokia, two bellwether tech stocks.Semiconductors rallied in early trading after analysts at JPMorgan raised their fourth-quarter earnings forecast for Intel, the world's leading computer chip maker. But investor sentiment later soured, pushing Intel shares down 0.3 per cent to $22.70 by the closing bell. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival, fell 2.6 per cent to $21.84, while National Semiconductor fell 1.3 per cent to $17.40.Chipmakers have been hit this year by sagging demand that left many companies with bloated inventories and reduced pricing power. Although some investors welcomed the improved earnings forecast for Intel, one trader cautioned that chipmakers would not be out of the woods until there were clear signs of an inventory correction in 2005.Telecommunications equipment stocks were also in the spotlight after the chief executive of Nokia told the Financial Times he was confident that the market for mobile phones would grow by 10 per cent in 2005. Nokia's US-listed shares rose 0.6 per cent to $15.24.Shares in Motorola, a Nokia competitor, fell 0.3 per cent to $16.95.The pharmaceuticals sector continued to reel from Friday's warning that Pfizer's Celebrex arthritis medication had increased the risk of heart attacks in patients in clinical trials. Pfizer, which fell 11 per cent after the announcement on Friday, fell 5.7 per cent to $24.94 after the company said it would stop advertising the drug.Merck, which withdrew its arthritis painkiller after studies revealed that it increased the chance of heart problems, fell 0.3 per cent to $31.51.Energy stocks were among the best performers yesterday, led by Exelon, the nuclear power company. Exelon shares rose 2.8 per cent to $43.05 after the company announced a $13.2bn deal to buy Public Service Enterprise Group, a New Jersey-based rival. PSE shares jumped 7 per cent to $50.56.Monsanto, the life sciences group, rose 2 per cent to $52.49 after it said that operating profits should be better than expected in the first-quarter thanks to its booming trade in bio-engineered seeds.McAfee was the big loser among software stocks. Shares in the company, which specialises in anti-virus software, fell 6.8 per cent to $26.98 after Microsoft said it had chosen another company to provide virus-scanning services to customers of its Hotmail e-mail network. Shares in Trend Micro, the Japanese company chosen by Microsoft to replace McAfee, jumped 8.5 per cent to $54.78.Shares in Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, rose 0.4 per cent to $52.20 after it said sales last week had been stronger than expected. Kmart, a rival retail group, fell 1.9 per cent to $98.40, however, while shares in rival Target were flat at $50.54. Stephanie Hoff, analyst at Edward Jones, said that retailers had been forced to offer discounts to get people into stores following a week start to the holiday shopping season.""What that probably means is that margins [for the holiday season] will still be okay, but not as good as they could have been,"" she said.Fannie Mae, the embattled mortgage finance group, fell 1.3 per cent to $69.42 following reports that it had deferred a decision about whether to dismiss Franklin Raines as chief executive in the wake of an accounting scandal."
14;PEG;Public Service Enterprise Group Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Lazard’s bold and risky bet;;"Merger fever is gripping Wall Street again. After a three-year lull, US companies are sealing multi-billion dollar deals across a wide range of industries, to the delight of the investment bankers who earn hefty fees from advising them.Last week, more than $85bn (£44bn, €64bn) worth of US deals were agreed, and over the weekend, the last touches were being put on a $12bn stock merger between two US electrical companies, Exelon and Public Service Enterprise Group.Lazard, the 156-year-old mergers and acquisitions advisory firm, has not missed out on the action: last week, its telecommunications team was working on Nextel's $35bn merger with Sprint.But the thrill of returning business was not the only reason for excitement on the top floors of number 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the art deco Manhattan skyscraper where Lazard is based.For the past six months, Bruce Wasserstein, the renowned Wall Street dealmaker who runs Lazard, and a tight group of close associates, have been busy plotting one of the boldest moves in the recent history of banking. Late on Friday, Lazard filed with US regulators to raise up to $850m in an initial public offering that could value the firm at more than $3bn. A successful listing would represent the first by a large and historic Wall Street investment bank since Goldman Sachs went public in 1999. But the magnitude of the achievement may be eclipsed by the task ahead: Lazard will need to persuade potential investors to buy the shares, and must then deliver on its promise of sustainable earnings growth in its core business, advising companies on mergers and acquisitions. There, the outlook is ambiguous.Much has changed since Goldman's listing in the middle of the late 1990s investment banking boom. In spite of the recent rebound in M&A activity, the overall fee pool for working on deals is dramatically smaller. Yet none of the large investment banks have exited the business, meaning the landscape now is one of intense competition for relatively few top assignments.This has put tremendous pressure on the world's private banks, which in turn are being forced to make painful judgments about their ability to compete as independent partnerships.So far, Rothschild has chosen to stay independent; Cazenove of the UK has bowed to a joint venture with JPMorgan, while Greenhill of the US and now Lazard, by far the largest and most influential, have opted to go public.In Lazard's 173-page IPO document, which contains financial data about the firm that has been kept secret for decades, the firm explains why it believes M&A advisory work is set to enjoy ""a favourable climate"". It cites ""globalisation"", ""focus on stockholder value"" and the need of companies to ""realise economies of scale"".Lazard also explains how it intends to spar with the likes of Goldman, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup and others, when it is smaller and has fewer products to offer clients: ""On the basis of our intellectual (rather than our financial) capital"" and by ""offering independent, trusted and unbiased advice.""Lazard's confidence relies on the belief that M&A advisory work is the most profitable thing a bank can do because it can generate hefty fees based on low costs. ""M&A is pure profit for firms like Goldman and Morgan Stanley, and Lazard is in that category as well,"" says one Wall Street banking analyst. In addition, the conflicts of interest that riddled ""full-service"" investment banks in the post-bubble period because of their awkward mix of trading, underwriting and advisory work may have boosted Lazard's case even further.So-called ""relationship banking"" - advising companies without strong-arming them into purchasing a host of other products - could command even more of a premium now. But there is another interpretation: prices of M&A advisory services are destined to fall as investment bankers bundle them with other products such as underwriting and credit. In addition, an increasing number of companies are doing M&A work in-house, decreasing their reliance on investment banks to do the kind of strategic thinking that translates into the highest fees.In that kind of environment, Lazard would possibly be the most vulnerable large player in the industry.""There is a risk [for Lazard] in the trend towards the bundling of products . . . If you are happy with the likes of Citigroup and JPMorgan with one product, you start using them for other things as well,"" says Alastair Ryan, a banking analyst at UBS in London.""They are being squeezed from both sides,"" says one top M&A banker from a competing financial services group. ""The larger firms can offer scale, global reach and a host of other products. And there are now a lot of boutiques, such as Blackstone, Evercore and Allen & Company, that are trying to do what Lazard does.""In this debate, history may well weigh in on Mr Wasserstein's side. In the past decade, every IPO of a brand-name investment bank has been extraordinarily successful.From Goldman to Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns to Lehman Brothers, investors who piled into the stocks when they first listed have earned handsome returns. Goldman shares have risen about 30 per cent since the IPO in 1999. Lehman shares, which were hovering around $10 in the mid-1990s, closed at $86.82 on Friday.And shares in Greenhill, Lazard's much smaller peer that went public in May, are trading more than 50 per cent its offer price, hitting a peak last week. Yet Lazard's investor roadshow, rolling on ahead of a possible March listing, will probably involve a lot of tough questions on subjects other than direction of the M&A advisory business and the track record of investment banking IPOs.One specific concern might be the internal power struggle at Lazard that made the run-up to the IPO unusually fraught. For several months Mr Wasserstein and Michel David-Weill, Lazard's chairman and a descendant of the three brothers who founded Lazard as a dry goods store in 1848 in New Orleans, were locked in a rancorous and public dispute over whether a listing should happen at all.Mr David-Weill, who brought Mr Wasserstein in to run the firm in 2001 and has a veto over any large decision, was doggedly opposed to the plan to list.Only this month did the two men reach a compromise under which Mr David-Weill acquiesced to the IPO in exchange for Mr Wasserstein agreeing to what effectively amounts to a deadline of January 2006 to take the firm public or resign.Now, after that partial victory, Mr Wasserstein will need to prove that the dispute with Mr David-Weill has not undermined Lazard's credibility externally, which could drive away clients, or sapped morale internally, raising the possibility of an exodus of top bankers. Certainly business does not seem to have suffered in the struggle over Lazard's future thus far.In the last three months, at the height of the feud between its top executives, Lazard has won assignments to advise on some of the world's largest corporate deals, including MTFG's bid for Japan's UFJ, Nextel's merger with Sprint, and Telecom Italia's purchase of the stake of TIM it did not own.In the IPO document, Lazard says M&A revenue growth increased in the fouth quarter of this year to the point where M&A revenues are expected to grow 13 per cent in 2004, ahead of 9 per cent for the first three quarters of this year.""Ultimately the market accepts infighting,"" says Bob Bostrom, a financial services lawyer at Winston & Strawn in New York. ""There are similar issues at all investment banks."" Moreover, despite all the grumbling in private, only Gerardo Braggiotti, Lazard's top banker in Italy and a significant fee-earner for the bank, has not pledged Mr Wasserstein his support for the IPO.However, there are concerns that some of the concessions made by Mr Wasserstein to win Mr David-Weill around may undermine the listing.One such concession was the decision to tone down the ""lock-up"" period for many of the firm's bankers.The latest terms provide for partners to be able to immediately cash in on one third of their stakes after three years, with the rest coming in the fourth and fifth years.If bankers only stay for two years, they will be able to start cashing in their stakes in the fourth year. And should they leave before that, they will have to wait until after eight years. According to people familiar with the matter, Mr Wasserstein was originally aiming to persuade partners to pledge to stay at the firm for longer, possibly as long as five years, before they could cash in on their stakes.Another concession by Mr Wasserstein was his decision to accept a deadline for the listing, after earlier refusing to do so on the grounds it would prevent the banks underwriting the offering - led by Goldman and including Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse First Boston and JPMorgan - from picking the right timing to go to market.If Mr Wasserstein does not buy out Mr David-Weill by the end of December next year he will enter a three-month period of discussions over his future with the chairman that will almost inevitably lead to his departure.This has raised all sorts of conspiracy theories on Wall Street, which would have Mr David-Weill actively campaigning against the IPO in spite of his pronouncements to the contrary. According to those theorists, Mr David-Weill has already lined up Mr Braggiotti to step into Mr Wasserstein's shoes.Another thing that may perturb investors is the complexity of the structure of the IPO, which involves three distinct operations. First, Lazard will be split in two. One part will bring together the firm's advisory businesses, including restructuring, and its asset management unit - a stable but relatively slow growth business. The other arm will contain non-performing or loss-making assets such as the capital markets business, including Panmure, the UK stockbroker.Second, there will be the public stock market listing of the unit combining the advisory and asset management businesses. Proceeds of up to $850m from the share sale will then be used for the third step, a buy-out of Mr David-Weill and Eurazeo, the French private equity group, as well as the other Paris-based investors, called ""capitalists"", who together hold about 45 per cent of the equity.Mr David-Weill has agreed to a $1.6bn price tag for his exit from the firm. ""The valuation of the buy-out of the partners means that investors may want to stay away,"" says a senior Wall Street banker who often works on deals with large financial services companies. He was reflecting on the possibility that Lazard will start its public life with a significant debt load.There is also expected to be close scrutiny of Lazard's ability to keep its compensation costs as low as possible. At $481m last year, salaries and bonuses to bankers were by far the biggest expense for Lazard, resulting in a ratio of compensation to operating expenses of 72.5 per cent. In the first nine months of this year, that figure was even higher, at 81.5 per cent. After the IPO, Lazard is pledging to keep compensation costs and bonuses below the threshold of 57.5 per cent of operating revenues.The lavish spending on pay for bankers introduced by Mr Wasserstein was one of the roots of his dispute with Mr David-Weill, and led to sharp public disagreements over key numbers such as the bank's profitability. In the filing, Lazard's net income is shown to have fallen from $306m in 2001 to $297m in 2002 and $250m last year.For all the doubts and mystery surrounding the Lazard IPO, there are not many on Wall Street who would bet against Mr Wasserstein's success. Chances are that the former First Boston banker will probably be ringing the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange - a common gesture for the chief executive of a newly listed company in the US - his victory complete.But his feelings, and those at Lazard, may be more akin to those described by Lisa Endlich, a former Goldman Sachs trader, in Culture of Success,her book about that bank's leap from private to public.""It was a windfall beyond what most had expected,"" Ms Endlich wrote, ""but, coming as it did after a year of tumult, enthusiasm was tempered by an element of relief.""Lessons from GoldmanAs Lazard moves closer to an initial public offering, the question for potential investors is whether it can retain its most talented staff and keep them focused on growth, writes David Wells.Bruce Wasserstein, Lazard’s chief executive, is considering ways to compel key employees to stay on for the long term. But retaining staff must involve more than just rules and contractual obligations.This was made clear when Goldman Sachs first sold shares to the public in May 1999. The investment bank was ending a 130-year partnership and critics said the move was akin to suicide because Goldman’s top bankers and traders would take the spoils of the offering and run.Goldman itself warned investors that it might not be able to retain some partners and could lose employees who aspired to that rank. Even today, when a senior Goldman employee retires or leaves to start a hedge fund, it is common to hear that they left because Goldman is “no longer the place it used to be”.In many ways, Goldman is indeed a changed place. It is a public company with a market capitalisation of about $51bn (£26.3bn, €38.5bn). More than half its employees joined after the IPO and have no idea what it was like to work there before.But Goldman has taken steps over the past five years to retain elements of its old partnership culture. It has also kept many top employees because of measures taken ahead of the listing. Half the 221 active partners at the time of the IPO were still at the firm four years later.Many partners said they would continue to work for Hank Paulson, the chief executive, for two years after the offering. Senior staff also promised to hold on to at least 25 per cent of the shares they received and abide by limitations on when they could sell. When resignation letters did cross Mr Paulson’s desk, Goldman’s policy of having co-heads of departments mitigated the impact. Several people who retired timed their departures around impending deals and the availability of successors, and then stayed on as advisers.Goldman also paid close attention to compensation for all employees, using carrots and sticks. The carrots were stock awards and the sticks were lock-up periods that governed when the shares could be sold.Goldman has never revealed the share allocation formula it used to reimburse partners for their stake in the firm but regulatory filings show that the active partners at the time of the IPO split 265m shares - an average award of 1.2m shares. Such a stake would be worth about $125m using Friday’s closing price of $103.75.Goldman also gave - and continues to give - stock to employees who were not partners. And it released the IPO-related awards to employees over a five-year period. It has focused on career development using methods from its partnership days, such as having senior staff retire or step into mentoring roles to make way for rising stars.The investment bank has also tried to keep the partnership concept alive by creating a so-called partnership pool to which it names new members every two years. Goldman says the partner system keeps staff motivated, lures talent, and provides a mechanism through which executives, including the chairman and chief executive, are told when they have said something that breaks with Goldman’s values.For Goldman to retain its old culture and prevent the stock from sinking, it was important to convince partners to hold on to some of their stake by making them believe the company would gain in value. Goldman’s policies appear to have paid off - it reported record profits this year. For Lazard to do as well, it will have to adopt similar steps that will assure investors that staff are long-term greedy, not just plain greedy."
