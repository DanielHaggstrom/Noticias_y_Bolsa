0;APH;Amphenol Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Healthcare division lifts profits at Volex;;A fast-growing healthcare division lifted profits at Volex, the electric and telecom cables maker, in what its chief executive called its “best performance in a decade”.Upbeat half-year results were also driven by the company’s consumer division, which provides power cords to Apple, off steady iPad and iPhone sales.Volex reported adjusted operating profits of $14.9m, a year-on-year increase of 16 per cent. Just three years ago Mike McTighe, Volex’s chairman, said the company was in “corporate triage”, but since then it has undergone a restructuring.Ray Walsh, chief executive, said management was closely watching developments in Europe and hoped to see sustained improvement in the US. “That being said, we don’t have any indication of clients pushing orders down,” he said.The UK-based company, which has consumer, telecoms, healthcare and industrial divisions, said group revenues increased by 14 per cent to $270.6m.Revenues in the company’s healthcare business jumped 30 per cent, driven by the launch of a digital broadband MRI scanner with Philips earlier this year.Its consumer division, accounting for around 60 per cent of revenues, also recorded double-digit revenue growth, due largely to the company’s development of next-generation connectors using halogen-free material.The company uses a share-based payment scheme to incentivise managers. After this charge, the company’s pre-tax profits dipped 3 per cent to $10.3m while diluted earnings a share rose 4 per cent to 14.4c. The company declared an interim dividend of 1.5c a share.Mr McTighe implemented a turnround plan in 2008, which involved replacing the senior management team and investing in manufacturing, adding to capacity for high-speed copper processes and IT infrastructure.Capital expenditure grew by 92 per cent to $4.8m in the first half, which the company said matched its strategy.Thomas Rands, analyst at Peel Hunt, said he was not worried about the company’s high spending.“The balancing act now is to increase revenues while increasing margins,” he said.Volex’s gross margins were down 0.5 per cent from last year to 19.2 per cent. This compares with industry peers such as Amphenol, which had a gross margin of 32.6 per cent, Molex’s 30.3 per cent, and Tyco’s 37.7 per cent.Volex said its peers had greater scale and a stronger product mix.The company’s shares, trading at 30.5p three years ago, fell 1.6 per cent to 283.5p on Wednesday.
