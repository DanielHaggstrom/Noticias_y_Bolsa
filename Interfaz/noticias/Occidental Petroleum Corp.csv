0;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-15T16:24:41Z;Occidental pays Buffett dividend in shares to save cash;Indebted US oil driller has been trying to shore up its finances after crude price crash;Warren Buffett is getting the latest of his controversial dividends from Occidental Petroleum in the form of shares instead of cash, as the heavily indebted oil producer attempts to shore up its balance sheet in the face of an oil-price rout that has rattled the industry.In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Occidental said it had issued 17.3m shares to Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, worth about $257m at the previous night’s closing price and amounting to 1.9 per cent of the company’s equity.Berkshire already owned 18.9m Occidental shares at the end of December, according to other filings.News of the share dilution sent Occidental stock more than 12 per cent lower on Wednesday, triggering short-sale limits on the shares.Occidental turned to Mr Buffett last April to help fund its $55bn takeover of rival Anadarko, but the financing came at a high price. In return for $10bn, Berkshire received preferred shares carrying an 8 per cent dividend. Occidental had the option to pay with either cash or by issuing new shares to Berkshire.The Anadarko deal, which was lambasted as too expensive by some shareholders, including activist Carl Icahn, saddled the company with debt just before oil prices fell. Occidental has since taken a series of emergency measures to shore up its financial position, including cutting capital expenditure and slashing the dividend on its common shares by 90 per cent. For Berkshire, the $10bn investment in Occidental came after Mr Buffett had gone years without clinching one of the multibillion-dollar deals for which he is known. It allowed him to put part of Berkshire’s mammoth cash pile to work, which at the time was primarily invested in short-term Treasury bills. It is unclear whether Mr Buffett will decide to sell the additional stock. Investors have soured on the US’s heavily-indebted shale oil producers in recent years, causing equity valuations for the sector to underperform against the wider market. The crisis has deepened with a halving of the oil price since January as lockdowns due to coronavirus caused a collapse of in global demand.Record oil production cuts announced by Opec and Russia on Sunday failed to stop further price declines this week. The US crude benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, dropped beneath $20 a barrel on Wednesday, sparking further declines in US shale producers’ shares.Investors have punished Occidental, the US’s biggest domestic oil producer, since it took on debts of almost $50bn to clinch the Anadarko takeover, which closed in August. Its market capitalisation has tumbled from $42bn when the deal closed in August to less than $12bn. S&P Global Ratings, the credit rating agency, also downgraded $37bn of Occidental debt to junk status, citing the high leverage.
1;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-08T04:00:29Z;Junk bonds: the rise of ‘fallen angels’;The bond market is being flooded with junk-rated companies and there’s probably more to come;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.One thing to start: Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey has pledged $1bn of his equity in Square, the payments company he co-founded, to fund global relief for coronavirus. The announcement, made on Twitter, said the contribution amounted to 28 per cent of his wealth.Now on to today’s edition . ..In biblical terms, fallen angels are expelled from heaven. In financial markets, fallen angels are expelled from the coveted investment-grade bond bracket and into junk status. As the name might suggest, it’s not quite hell — but tell that to a corporate treasurer looking for cheap financing.For years traders have talked about the number of companies teetering on the edge of their investment-grade status — in bond market speak that means credit ratings of triple B or above — and how difficult it would be for markets to absorb a huge amount of junk debt if that came to be. Investors who hold corporate bonds have certain risk parameters and many of them are not allowed to hold junk-rated debt. So if a company is downgraded from investment-grade to junk, some are forced to sell that company’s bonds. If this happens in a controlled way, ie a handful of ratings downgrades a year, it’s not such a big deal because there are buyers out there who want to hold riskier bonds. You may have seen them referred to as yield-starved investors.But if there are a large number of downgrades in succession, the junk bond market becomes overloaded with too many sellers and not enough buyers — the investment-grade market is six times the size of the high-yield bond market — which causes a host of issues for businesses in need of financing. Until this year, that didn’t seem like such a problem. The last time we saw companies go from investment grade to junk at breakneck speed was the financial crisis. Then the coronavirus outbreak hit.A record $90bn of debt fell to junk status in March, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. And that’s just the half of it, according to Bank of America, which warns that the total for the year could reach $200bn. Trading figures suggest investors are set for even higher tallies with $360bn of triple B rated bonds, the lowest rung of investment grade, trading with yields comparable to that of double B rated debt as of last week. So who has lost their wings so far? Carmaker Ford is the latest addition to a long list that includes Occidental Petroleum, Macy’s and Kraft Heinz. The biggest risk indicator of a company’s downgradability is debt. Or, as Saint Peter might see it, the second deadly sin: gluttony. This is a must-follow trend for financiers around the world and the FT’s Joe Rennison delivers the full story here.WeWork was once the jewel in SoftBank’s start-up crown. Now it’s merely an opposing party in a Delaware lawsuit. A special committee of board members at the troubled office space start-up sued WeWork’s largest shareholder SoftBank, run by Masayoshi Son, pictured below, and its Vision Fund this week for pulling out of a $3bn tender offer agreed last year. That agreement was part of the Japanese group’s rescue deal.The lawsuit in the Delaware court of chancery centred on two key allegations. First, part of the $3bn share buyout had involved WeWork’s joint venture in China in which the Vision Fund held shares.The buyout could not close until the Vision Fund exchanged those shares for stock directly in WeWork. This required minority investors in the joint venture to waive certain rights of first-refusal.WeWork alleges that Son along with his lieutenants encouraged Trustbridge Partners, one of the minority investors, not to do so — thereby giving him an out on the buyout.Second, WeWork is under investigation by the Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and others, which SoftBank has also used to try and back out of the deal.WeWork says in the lawsuit the “investigations were not a surprise, given [Adam] Neumann’s conduct and the company’s loss of billions of value”. It then alleges:“Certain of the investigations concerned statements that SoftBank made regarding its own threats in October 2019 not to fund the warrant when it came due in April 2020.”The “warrant” is the $1.5bn equity investment SoftBank originally agreed to early in 2019.SoftBank will “vigorously” defend itself, a spokesperson said, describing the lawsuit as “a desperate and misguided attempt” to rewrite the tender agreement.“Nothing in the special committee’s filing today credibly refutes SoftBank’s decision to terminate the tender offer,” the Japanese group said, adding that it remained fully committed to WeWork’s success.You can read the lawsuit here. The exhibits, including the communications from SoftBank that sparked the lawsuit, are here. The legal battle comes as the coronavirus pandemic weighs heavily on WeWork’s business. Thousands of its tenants have refused to pay rent or sought to terminate their leases over the past month, including some big businesses such as the cruise ship operator Royal Caribbean. It has exacerbated a rise in WeWork’s vacancy rate, which was already climbing as the company opened a spate of new properties. Occupancy at the start of April has fallen to just 64 per cent, down from the 79 per cent level it reported at the end of September. And as one current employee cautioned DD’s Eric Platt and the FT’s Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, that drop did not yet account for the full economic fallout of the crisis and the surge of cancellations the company was still girded for.We’re offering a free 30-day trial to Coronavirus Business Update, our level-headed briefing on how the epidemic is affecting the markets, global business, workplaces and daily lives.

The Swedish private equity firm EQT Partners has found a way. It’s in exclusive talks with Air Liquide to buy its Schülke unit, which makes alcohol-based hand rubs and hospital disinfectants, at a valuation of about €900m. Sellers had (of course) wanted buyers to offer a “coronavirus premium” over the €1bn price tag that Air Liquide first hoped to fetch when it put the business up for sale last year — catch up on the FT’s story on that here. But that hope has collided with reality. “Nobody moved” when sellers asked them to raise their bid on the grounds that “there’s been a shift in the way people will use these products going forward”, an adviser to another bidder said.It shows you can still just about do a pre-crisis-era type of deal in the age of coronavirus. The valuation of 12 times adjusted ebitda is punchy, and above last year’s European average of 10.9 times. And even with European public debt markets seized up, EQT was able to bring the auction process to an early end with the help of HPS Investment Partners, the private credit group spun out of JPMorgan Chase, which is providing the debt. Maybe this is the future for private equity. Or maybe it’s the sort of thing you can only do when the deal involves the hottest commodity on the planet. Jason New has joined Onex Corporation as co-chief executive to lead the investment management group with Stuart Kovensky. New was previously at Blackstone, where he held a senior role in its GSO Capital Partners hedge fund. Paula Price is leaving her post as chief financial officer of Macy’s after less than two years on the job.UBS has promoted Barry Donlon to lead debt capital markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.White & Case has added Dongho Lee as a partner to its global M&A practice in Seoul from rival Herbert Smith Freehills.Boatload of debt $17bn of demand for $4bn in bonds issued by the world’s largest cruise operator, which is leaking monumental amounts of cash monthly and whose ships have been labelled “floating Petri dishes” due to coronavirus outbreaks? Head scratcher. Luckily DD’s Rob Smith goes into the details behind the demand.

2;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-03-31T21:45:04Z;Bond manager seeks waiver to avoid fire sale of junk bonds;Western Asset asks for more time to offload corporate debt as virus rating downgrades bite;Western Asset, one of the biggest bond managers in the US, is trying to avoid a fire sale of assets from a corporate bond portfolio after several companies hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak had their credit ratings cut to junk.The $460bn investment manager this week requested a waiver from a Fresno County, California public pension fund seeking extra time to get its institutional investment grade credit portfolio in order after the downgrades of Occidental Petroleum and American Airlines pushed it over its limit of junk-rated holdings.Without the waiver, Western would be forced to quickly sell some of the downgraded companies’ debt with no guarantee it could get a good price.“Given the extraordinary volatility, we are asking for an extension of our standard internal three-day fix policy to a 30-day fix window to allow us to remedy the outage in an efficient and prudent manner,” Western said in a letter to the pension fund.The Fresno fund, which has about $190m invested with Western, is set to approve the waiver at its April 1 board meeting. “A forced sale may only be possible at a steep discount to a more reasonable transaction price later,” said plan administrator Donald Kendig.While Western has only breached its 5 per cent junk bond threshold by a percentage point, its situation should provide a warning to investment grade bond managers across the market as large sums of debt have been cast into junk territory.Credit rating agencies have moved swiftly since the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak has crystallised. S&P Global, the largest rating agency, has downgraded more than 200 companies because of the pandemic, with energy groups such as Occidental particularly hard hit by the drop in demand for oil alongside a dispute between big crude-producing countries.Overall, Western manages a total of $14bn in its investment grade credit strategy. The waiver request was first reported by Financial Times Specialist publication MandateWire.Regulators have warned repeatedly in recent years about a build-up of debt on the lowest rungs of the investment-grade ratings ladder, which could lead to market disruptions if a wave of downgrades forces investors to unload securities that no longer fit their portfolio mandates.Carmaker Ford, department store operator Macy’s, packaged foods maker Kraft Heinz and US airline Delta are among those to have lost their investment grade rating this year.Their re-rating as junk has caused painful losses for some bondholders. Occidental bonds that mature in 2029 have halved in value over the past month and changed hands on Tuesday at 47 cents on the dollar. Ford debt due in 2046 has also tumbled precipitously, and was quoted at less than 60 cents on the dollar on Tuesday.

Available every weekday morning.;Your browser does not support playing this file but you can still download the MP3 file to play locally.US lawmakers argue over a fiscal stimulus legislation worth nearly $2tn to help America weather the coronavirus pandemic. Plus, it could be weeks before official data reveals the full impact of the outbreak on the global economy. FT data journalists have compiled a set of alternative measures of economic activity, from restaurant bookings to traffic patterns, to give an early indication of what to expect. And, Occidental Petroleum chief executive Vicki Hollub looks set to keep her job as the embattled oil producer finalises a truce with activist investor Carl Icahn.A transcript for this podcast is currently unavailable, view our accessibility guide.
4;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-03-22T18:16:45Z;Occidental boss set to survive as group finalises deal with Icahn;Activist investor had urged sacking of chief executive Vicki Hollub days earlier;Occidental Petroleum chief Vicki Hollub looks set to keep her job at the embattled oil producer days after Carl Icahn urged her sacking as the company is finalising a deal with the activist investor that would give him two seats on the board, said people briefed about the matter.The truce between Occidental and the billionaire investor, who has been agitating the company's board since he tried to block its $56bn takeover of Anadarko Petroleum last year, seeks to end months of public fighting and shift the focus to reviving the business’ fortunes.As part of the deal being negotiated on Sunday, two close associates of the New York investor, Andrew Langham and Nicholas Graziano, will join the board of Occidental, those people said. An additional board member could be added, who will be selected jointly by Mr Icahn and the existing board, the person added. Mr Icahn, who owns about 10 per cent of Occidental, had sought to remove four directors from the company’s board, and pushed for the company to sell itself. In response, Occidental’s board deployed a “poison pill” to prevent a hostile takeover orchestrated by Mr Icahn.Occidental also announced that board chairman Eugene Batchelder would step down at this year’s board meeting. Late last week it emerged that Stephen Chazen, who was Occidental’s chief executive until 2016 and handpicked Ms Hollub as his replacement, would become the new chairman.Mr Chazen was determined to put an end to the fight with Mr Icahn before taking on the role, said people informed about the matter. However, he was also adamant that Ms Hollub kept her job as part of the truce deal, those people added. One person involved in the negotiations, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, warned that there had been a lot of back and forth between Mr Icahn and the company’s board and added that no final agreement had been reached. Any settlement would likely be announced on Monday after the markets close, the person added. The collapse in oil prices, now less than half their price in early January, has affected the entire US oil sector — but hit Occidental, the US’s biggest domestic oil producer, especially hard. The company slashed its dividend by 90 per cent earlier this month and sharply reduced planned spending for this year. Last week rating agency S&P downgraded $37bn of its debt to junk status, citing the high leverage Occidental has taken on since buying Anadarko for $56bn last summer.Its share price has fallen almost 70 per cent in the past three weeks and its market capitalisation is now less than $10bn, compared with $42bn just before its deal to buy Anadarko in August 2019.

Devastation? Collapse? Wreck? Pick whatever havoc-inducing word you want and it would aptly describe what’s going on in the US oil and gas industry.An oil price war sparked by the confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Russia, together with the repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic, have collapsed oil and gas prices. At long last, restructuring advisers at investment banks such as Evercore, Perella Weinberg, Lazard and Moelis & Company — as well as lawyers at the likes of Kirkland & Ellis and Latham & Watkins — have some distressed companies to sink their teeth into. They’re reportedly “slammed” with emergency work to save energy groups on the brink of default. The US shale industry has been in trouble for some time. Last year most companies were warning that it was hard to operate in an environment where crude oil averaged $57 a barrel. That was before prices collapsed into the low $20s. Many companies have been left waving the white flag. Chesapeake, a pioneer of the US shale energy industry, and smaller rivals such as California Resources and Gulfport Energy, have all hired advisers to help them restructure their debt, the FT reported. Meanwhile, Whiting Petroleum is among other producers to have begun exploring restructuring options. All have seen their equity valuations drop dramatically over the past 18 months, with several multibillion-dollar companies turning into highly indebted businesses and only a few million dollars worth of equity left.Occidental Petroleum, the largest independent oil producer in the US, which made a name for itself by beating out much larger rival Chevron in the race to take over Anadarko Petroleum for $55bn, has also found itself in a pretty ugly spot. People close to Oxy — as the company is known — say it isn't considering a restructuring just yet but several analysts are questioning whether recent measures to prop up the company, including cutting its dividend 90 per cent and slashing capital expenditure, will be enough. Chief executive Vicki Hollub, above, said last week that the actions she took would help the company generate cash in a world where oil trades in the low $30s. But with prices at about $25, there are challenges ahead for the Houston-based group. Even two of the best-known distressed investors have been caught up in the oil and gas market conflagration, DD’s Sujeet Indap reported. Apollo Global Management and Elliott Management this week abandoned earlier plans to refinance the US oil and gas driller EP Energy. The pair were going to invest nearly $500m together with co-investors to recapitalise the Texas and Utah driller. But earlier this week, Sujeet reported that they would pull the escape hatch and not close the deal. It looks like only ExxonMobil and Chevron can say, with a certain degree of confidence, that they’ll be able to survive the current geopolitical onslaught. Eau de toilette has taken on a new meaning at LVMH’s factory outside Orléans where popular fragrances like Christian Dior’s J’Adore are created. Instead of spritzing herself with the custom J’Adore bottle, picture Charlize Theron, who has been the face of the fragrance since the early 2000s, pumping a clear gel into her palms to promote LVMH’s latest product — hand sanitiser. But the product isn't for sale. It's destined for doctors and nurses in Paris hospitals on the front line of the battle against coronavirus.It took LVMH, the luxury group owned by Bernard Arnault, just 72 hours to get the first plastic bottles of hand sanitiser rolling off its production lines.Some of us have barely left our homes, or in extreme cases, changed our clothes in the past three days, yet the 71-year-old tycoon was able to pull together the whole operation within a matter of days. So how did LVMH, a sprawling conglomerate with 76 companies in its portfolio, manage to do this all so quickly? For one, Arnault is decisive. Another reason is that cosmetics manufacturing is actually a close cousin to pharmacy, and the factory equipment could be quickly repurposed — LVMH already had the three main ingredients on hand that are needed to make sanitiser — purified water, ethanol and glycerine.For DD readers facing a personal shortage, here’s a how to make your own. Read the full story from the FT’s Leila Abboud.The IPO market will, eventually, come back. And when it does, it is going to be much more legally hospitable for companies, based on an important ruling on Wednesday from the Delaware Supreme Court.The issue before the justices was so-called Federal Forum Provisions. Blue Apron, Roku and Stitchfix had drafted into their corporate documents language that had forced any securities litigation against them into federal court. Because of a quirk in securities law, certain lawsuits related to misstatements or omissions in IPO prospectuses were increasingly litigated in state courts. Two years ago, DD’s Sujeet Indap told readers about how a state courthouse in San Mateo, California had become a hotbed for such federal disputes.A 2018 lower court ruling in Delaware had concluded that such legal language that forced securities lawsuits into federal court was not permissible since securities law was not within the scope of state corporation law. The Delaware Supreme Court said that the previous ruling was incorrect. That means the next wave of unicorns are free to prevent shareholders from running to state courts where the view was that judges were friendlier to plaintiffs seeking either settlements or big judgments. “The basic reasoning was that Delaware law gives broad discretion for companies to set the terms of their charters, and there is no specific provision of Delaware law that made such a provision illegal or against public policy,” explained Ann Lipton, professor of corporate law at Tulane. Occidental Petroleum's former chief executive Stephen Chazen is returning to the company as its new chairman, the Wall Street Journal reported.British businessman Andrew Gould has resigned from the board of Saudi Aramco.Jonathan Brownstein has joined Greenhill as a managing director in New York focused on financing advisory and restructuring.

6;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-03-19T18:12:52Z;Downgrades to junk are just one sign of an ‘ugly’ credit market;Occidental’s fall from triple B to double B is likely to be one of many;When energy company Occidental Petroleum sold debt in August last year, the possibility of a sharp, severe downturn in both oil markets and credit markets seemed remote. As such, the company raised $1.5bn through a 10-year bond with a coupon of just 3.5 per cent.But that 2029 bond now trades with a yield of over 9 per cent, after its price tumbled to just 65 cents on the dollar: just one example of a ferocious turn in investor sentiment towards corporate credit.Late on Wednesday, Moody’s became the first agency to withdraw Occidental’s top-quality credit rating, cutting $35bn of its debt one notch to “speculative grade”, or junk, while warning of more possible cuts to come. S&P has said that despite the company’s efforts to bolster its balance sheet it may do likewise.The sell-off in credit has been “so quick and dramatic,” said Peter Tchir, chief macro strategist at Academy Securities in New York. “It is truly astonishing.”The investment-grade bond market is broken. This is as ugly as I can remember itThe trend is certainly worth watching. A decade of low interest rates has encouraged companies to gorge on cheap debt, but mostly not to the extent of giving up their precious “investment-grade” credit ratings, which make them eligible to be bought by all kinds of institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers. Instead, companies like Occidental have sat just above the threshold marked junk, with ratings equivalent to triple B.Now, a deepening crisis stemming from the spread of coronavirus, coupled with a global oil rout, means that a vast number of companies will join Occidental in slipping down the ratings ladder. That could prompt fire sales by investors permitted to hold only higher-rated debt.The average yield on the top tier of junk bonds, rated double B, has risen to 7.75 per cent, from a low of 3.63 per cent in January. But about $320bn of triple B bonds trade with a higher yield than that, accounting for almost 10 per cent of total triple Bs outstanding. Investors are effectively pre-empting a slew of downgrades.According to Mr Tchir, it is probably good news that the market has moved ahead of the rating agencies. Downgrades could be less explosive when they do happen, on that basis.But if that full amount does indeed topple into junk, it would increase the speculative-grade market by 25 per cent. Such an expansion would be tough to digest.There is another caveat. Rising yields for triple Bs may not be linked to higher chances of a downgrade, said Hans Mikkelson, a strategist at Bank of America, but something broader, and more ominous.Many investors are trying to cut exposure to corporate bonds, dumping whatever assets they can. That means that even solid, creditworthy companies with ratings a lot higher than triple B are seeing falling prices and higher yields.“The investment-grade bond market is broken,” he said. “This is as ugly as I can remember it.”
7;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-03-16T04:00:28Z;US investors brace for ratings downgrades as turmoil deepens;About $300bn of bonds rated triple B trade with junk-like yields above 6 per cent;As the coronavirus outbreak rips through credit markets, US companies from Occidental Petroleum to Ford are being treated by investors as though they will soon lose their coveted top-quality credit ratings, sending their debt tumbling into the drawer marked “junk.”A cut in rating below investment-grade — marked by the threshold between triple B and double B — indicates a stern warning from the likes of Moody’s and S&P Global for companies to improve their balance sheets. But even before such verdicts have been delivered, investors have been making up their own minds, marking down the value of bonds on the brink of a downgrade.Close to $300bn of bonds rated triple B trade with a yield above 6 per cent, according to data from Ice Data Services released late last week. That is closer to the 6.2 per cent average yield for double B-rated companies than the 3.6 per cent average for the $3.3tn triple B-class as a whole. On top of that, there is another $230bn of triple B debt trading with a yield above 5 per cent.Investors and policymakers have long warned of the risk of a rush of downgrades overwhelming the $1.2tn junk bond market and intensifying a sell-off.“As the probability of a recession rises, so does the potential for downgrades and defaults, leaving us unwilling to wave the white flag for corporate credit,” said analysts at Wells Fargo on Friday.The sharp spike in borrowing costs has raised concerns over the ability of some companies to continue to service their debts.Triple B-rated Delta Air Lines’ bond maturing in 2021 is trading with a yield of 7.9 per cent, for example. Carmakers Ford and General Motors also have debt trading above 7 per cent.Travel and hospitality sectors have come under pressure, with Royal Caribbean Cruises put on watch for a downgrade by S&P Global in the past week.Many energy companies also face potential cuts in ratings, including Occidental Petroleum, which last week tried to shore up its balance sheet by slashing the dividend it pays to shareholders. S&P said that this might not be enough to preserve its triple B rating.
8;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-03-13T15:31:25Z;Occidental moves to thwart activist Carl Icahn;US oil group deploys poison pill as veteran investor agitates for a takeover;Occidental Petroleum has deployed a “poison pill” to prevent a hostile takeover, a day after hedge fund investor Carl Icahn almost quadrupled his stake in the US oil producer and called for its chief executive to be fired. The move escalates the battle between Occidental’s board and the octogenarian activist Mr Icahn, who was opposed to the company’s $55bn takeover of US shale oil producer Anadarko Petroleum last year. Occidental’s shares, which traded below $13 on Friday, have plunged from almost $70 before it bested larger rival Chevron in a bidding war for Anadarko. Investors have fretted about the debt it took on to complete the takeover.On Tuesday, Occidental slashed its dividend by almost 90 per cent as crude prices tumbled in response to a flood of extra supply from Saudi Arabia, which is engaged in a price war with Russia.Mr Icahn took advantage of a new leg down in Occidental shares in the wake of the Saudi-Russian split to boost his stake to 9.9 per cent.“The company is terribly run. They had to cut the dividend. The oil price is again the match that ignited it,” Mr Icahn told CNBC on Friday. “In another culture, the board, the people on the board, would have the dignity to resign.”A poison pill allows a company to issue new shares to dilute any unwanted suitor and prevent them building a major stake. Occidental’s board said on Friday it would give its shareholders the right to receive one new share for each existing share, with the process to begin if any individual investor ends up controlling 15 per cent or more of the company. After disclosing the poison pill, Occidental shares were up 6 per cent in mid-morning trading in New York, outpacing a broader rally in US stocks. In Friday’s CNBC interview, Mr Icahn called the poison pill move “a study of what shouldn’t be done in corporate America” and a “travesty of corporate governance.”Mr Icahn revealed that he had increased his stake on Thursday. In a filing, he predicted takeover bids for the company and said the board and chief executive Vicki Hollub needed to be replaced to ensure those offers would be properly considered.“At that time, we will need a board that will encourage, not discourage, potential bids, and who will allow shareholders to decide whether or not to accept them,” the filing said. Mr Icahn’s filing said he was considering all options for his stake, hinting that he could partner with another company to take over Occidental. Additional reporting by Eric Platt in New York
9;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
10;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-03-12T17:49:53Z;Icahn urges ousting of Occidental chief;Activist investor has almost quadrupled his stake in battered US oil producer;The activist investor Carl Icahn has almost quadrupled his stake in battered US oil producer Occidental Petroleum and called for its chief to be fired, two days after collapsing crude prices forced the company to cut its dividend.Mr Icahn has waged a bitter campaign against Occidental’s leadership since last year, when the company agreed a debt-laden $55bn takeover of Anadarko Petroleum that has become a liability.Mr Icahn’s New York firm disclosed in a filing Thursday that its affiliates had added more than 66m shares to their Occidental holdings, raising his stake to 9.9 per cent from 2.5 per cent. “The Issuer’s CEO and Board unanimously voted to roll the dice and bet the Company by risking stockholder money on a disastrous acquisition. They lost the bet. They have egregiously failed OXY stockholders and should be removed,” the securities filing said. Occidental’s share price had tumbled below $11 before the Icahn filing, from nearly $70 last year before chief executive Vicki Hollub saw off a rival bid from Chevron to capture Anadarko.She had argued the merger would have brought efficiencies and a prime position in US shale oil acreage, but this week’s drop in oil prices to almost $30 a barrel forced the company to reduce its once-sacrosanct dividend by almost 90 per cent. Mr Icahn had previously sought to remove four directors from Occidental’s board. In an attempted olive branch, the company previously announced that board chairman Eugene Batchelder would step down at this year’s board meeting. Mr Icahn suggested Occidental should now itself be sold. “Because of the industry consolidation we believe will occur, we expect strong bids to emerge for OXY. At that time, we will need a Board that will encourage, not discourage, potential bids, and who will allow shareholders to decide whether or not to accept them,” his filing said.Occidental did not immediately response to a request for comment. Shares were up 24 per cent at $14.66 after the Icahn filing was made public.
11;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-03-11T05:00:29Z;Occidental’s $55bn Anadarko deal turns into a nightmare;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.M&A is tough. Mega deals are even tougher. Sometimes they are so hard they end up being disastrous. That’s turning out to be the case for Occidental Petroleum’s $55bn takeover of Anadarko. On Tuesday, Oxy, as the company is known, said it would slash its dividend by almost 90 per cent, the first payout cut since 1991, in a dramatic move aimed at saving the explorer as it seeks to manage the sharp collapse in oil prices following the Saudi-Russia price war. That’s a massive contrast to the euphoria of nearly a year ago. In May 2019, with the backing of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, the Houston-based company successfully managed to fend off its larger rival Chevron in one of the most memorable takeover battles in recent years. It was a huge victory for Oxy’s chief executive Vicki Hollub. Not only did she gatecrash Chevron’s deal, she got the deal done against the wishes of one of the company’s largest individual shareholders, the activist investor Carl Icahn. The promise then, in the company’s own words, was “to realise the full potential of the transaction while maintaining a strong balance sheet, investment grade credit rating and its current dividend”.That promise has now been solemnly shattered. Investors welcomed Tuesday’s move, as Oxy’s stock moved up more than 14 per cent to about $14 a share. But that doesn’t cancel the fact that the overall equity value of Oxy has been gravely hit since the deal with Anadarko was announced in May. Before Oxy publicly approached Anadarko its shares were trading at close to $70 a share. What’s even more dire is the state of the company’s bonds, which plummeted on Monday. A $750m bond maturing in 2049 fell from 88 cents on the dollar to just 64 cents, before staging a muted recovery on Tuesday, rising to 72 cents on the dollar.The change in dividend payout, from $0.79 to $0.11, means the annual payment will shrink from $2.8bn to $400m. Who won’t be affected by all this is Buffett. The 89-year-old investor from Omaha was given preferred shares last year in exchange for $10bn to help Occidental finance the takeover of Anadarko. As part of the financing deal, Buffett was guaranteed that his shares would receive an 8 per cent dividend, and a warrant to buy up to 80m shares of common stock, about 11 per cent of its equity. That means that Buffett will continue to get annual preferred dividends of $800m.Hollub’s plan has been designed for a world where the price of oil goes as low as $30 a barrel. It’s not clear what could happen if the situation gets any worse. Does Chevron come back to buy parts of Oxy? DD’s sources say that is highly unlikely now. To get more on this read the news in the FT here, smart analysis from Lex here and a good Bloomberg opinion on the deal here.While we’re on the subject of megadeals, let’s take a look at private equity. After the 2008 crisis, European private equity lost its appetite for them for a long time (and the US was a bit more cautious, too). Take a look at the chart below: the biggest deals in Europe are clustered in the run-up to the crisis or in the past couple of years. Now, the industry is hungry again. The clearest sign is a €17.2bn deal to buy Thyssenkrupp’s lifts business last month, led by Advent and Cinven. (Side note: dealmakers realised in the final stages of the sale process that the company was still servicing lifts in downtown Wuhan with the city in lockdown over coronavirus. If that’s not resilient revenue, they figured, what is?)Big deals have worked out better since the crisis than before it, the chart on the left below shows. But the biggest deals haven’t always equated to the best returns. In the past decade, deals for companies valued at more than $10bn have returned $1.81 to investors for every dollar they put in, compared to $1.92 for targets below $5bn, according to figures from Cepres. Megadeals have a mixed history. In 2007 a consortium including TPG and KKR bought the Texas power company TXU in a $45bn deal — but it filed for bankruptcy in 2014. On the other hand, Blackstone’s $26bn purchase of hotel chain Hilton Worldwide in 2007, after a rocky path, ended up being one of its most profitable deals. This time round, it’s hard to see the appetite for big deals falling even after a crisis. Buyout groups have raised record-sized funds and have to put them to use. As Bain & Company’s Brenda Rainey puts it: “A small deal, even if it goes really well, is just not going to move the needle.” It’s still too early to tell how long the wild market swings of the past few weeks will last. But it is already shaking up the investment industry, leaving those that bet on bonds or volatility with some big wins.Among the winners are Roy Niederhoffer’s New York-based computer-driven hedge fund, which tries to calculate when markets have become too fearful or too greedy. RG Niederhoffer Capital Management’s flagship diversified fund — one of the world’s oldest quant hedge funds — has gained 37 per cent this year, after losing 28 per cent in 2019 when markets rose.“This is a sad situation that has created the ultimate in conditions for our strategy,” Niederhoffer told the FT. “This is the kind of volatility we haven’t seen since the [global financial crisis].”Go deeper with this just published piece by the FT’s Laurence Fletcher, Ortenca Aliaj and Robin Wigglesworth.

13;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-03-10T21:56:16Z;Occidental Petroleum slashes dividend as oil price rout bites;US oil group takes axe to capital spending plans and aims to cut corporate costs;Occidental Petroleum is to cut its dividend by almost 90 per cent, in one of the most drastic reactions yet seen in the energy sector to the collapse in oil prices and equity valuations this week.It is the first time the company has cut its payout since 1991, a dramatic move aimed at saving it from incurring further trouble and preparing it for a prolonged price slump.“Due to the sharp decline in global commodity prices, we are taking actions that will strengthen our balance sheet and continue to reduce debt,” said Vicki Hollub, Occidental’s chief executive.“These actions lower our cash flow break-even level to the low $30s WTI (West Texas Intermediate), excluding the benefit of our hedges, positioning us to succeed in a low commodity price environment.”Dividend payments will fall in June to $0.11 per share from $0.79, the company said. Talk of the move circulated ahead of the announcement, prompting a temporary suspension of trading in the company’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange.Occidental also announced it would cut capital spending aggressively in 2020 to between $3.5bn and $3.7bn from a planned $5.2bn to $5.4bn and would implement additional operating and corporate cost reductions.Occidental’s stock and bond prices have capitulated in recent trading sessions. The company’s stock price fell 50 per cent on Monday, inching back on Tuesday before trading was halted. Shares resumed trading at $13.29, up 6 per cent after the dividend cut announcement.Warren Buffett, who was given preferred shares last year as part of a $10bn deal to help Occidental finance the takeover of Anadarko, will not be affected by the dividend cut, said people familiar with the matter. As part of the financing arrangement, Mr Buffett was guaranteed that his shares would receive an 8 per cent dividend, and a warrant to buy up to 80m shares of common stock, about 11 per cent of its equity.Occidental bought Anadarko last year in a deal worth $55bn after a bitter takeover battle with much larger rival Chevron. But investors have punished the company for an acquisition that sharply raised its leverage in a bet on rising oil prices.Occidental’s market capitalisation has fallen from about $42bn on the day of its takeover of Anadarko last August to roughly $12bn now.The dividend cut will sting investors who were reassured by Occidental’s leadership that the payouts remained sacrosanct.Ms Hollub told analysts in a recent earnings call that her company’s dividend was “one of the defining characteristics of our company”, adding that returning cash to shareholders through its sector-leading dividend was “an integral part of our philosophy”.But the crash in oil prices following the collapse of the Russia-Saudi oil-output pact last week has sent tremors throughout the US oil patch, worsening the crisis for a sector already wilting under investor pressure and the coronavirus-led slump in global oil demand.Occidental’s dividend decision followed announcements from leading US shale independents Diamondback Energy and Parsley Energy that they would be paring back their drilling commitments and rig counts in the Permian, the US’s most prolific shale field.Chevron recently unveiled plans to sharply increase its US shale oil production, but said in a statement that it was now “reviewing alternatives to reduce capital expenditures” and was targeting $2bn “in improvement”.Analysts expect other companies swiftly to cut their spending plans in the face of the plunging oil price. Artem Abramov, head of shale research at Rystad Energy, said at current prices capex in the US shale sector would fall 70% to about $30bn next year.Occidental did not respond to requests for comment.The company’s bonds plummeted on Monday, another reflection of investors’ waning confidence in the company. A $750m bond maturing in 2049 fell from 88 cents on the dollar to just 64 cents, before staging a muted recovery on Tuesday, rising to 72 cents on the dollar.“It was stunning,” said Christopher Yanney, co-founder of CKC Capital in New York. “We have never seen anything like that ever . . . I’d think they would stay investment grade but you just cannot say in this environment any more.”Charts by Richard Henderson in New York
14;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-03-10T18:15:09Z;Occidental Petroleum: dash for cash;Group slashes dividend in desperate attempt to preserve liquidity;Maybe this is why its shareholders wanted to vote. When Occidental Petroleum sought to acquire Anadarko Petroleum amid a bidding war with larger rival Chevron, Occidental structured the deal in a way to avoid its shareholders having a say in the matter.Occidental was desperate to be the dominant producer in the oil-rich Permian basin and ultimately paid $56bn to clinch the Anadarko deal. But it is not called “bet the company” M&A for nothing. All the talk of synergies and efficiency has given way to what was fundamentally a binary bet on commodity prices. And it is a bet Occidental chief executive, Vicki Hollub, had badly lost.The company on Tuesday slashed its dividend by 85 per cent in a desperate attempt to preserve liquidity. Austerity will sweep the energy sector but Occidental’s mis-steps are purely self-inflicted. Shareholders need to consider whether the current management and board deserve the chance to try for a turnround. Occidental shares have fallen a staggering 80 per cent from their peak 2018 value just before the bidding war with Chevron. By avoiding the poisoned chalice of Anadarko, Chevron is down just a third. Occidental is now burdened not only with a challenged asset portfolio but also $40bn of debt as well as $10bn of preferred stock held by Berkshire Hathaway. The latter pays a juicy 8 per cent coupon. Occidental has sought to sell assets in hopes of netting $15bn. Even that looks unrealistic now the entire oil and gas sector has been derated.Chief executives naturally want to take risk and many thrill-seeking Texan wildcatters have found fame and fortune. But shareholders were leery at the time about the risk/reward potential in a bidding war with Chevron. Activist investor Carl Icahn has been railing about Ms Hollub and the Occidental board for months calling their manoeuvre “unconscionable”. Mr Icahn believes the Anadarko deal was simply a ploy to avoid Occidental itself from being acquired. The irony, of course, is that in its current debilitated state, Occidental itself should be on the auction block. The price will be far lower than it would have been a year ago.
15;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-03-01T17:57:42Z;Wyoming in talks to buy millions of acres of land from Occidental;State governor says purchase of private land would be biggest since the US bought Alaska;Wyoming is in talks to buy millions of acres of land from Occidental Petroleum in what lawmakers say would be the biggest land purchase since the US bought Alaska from Russian tsar Alexander II. The US state is advancing bills authorising the use of state funds to acquire the properties. People involved say the price ranges between $1bn and $3bn. Oil and gas producer Occidental has put the land on the block as it pays down debt from its $55bn acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum in 2019. The company is under pressure, with US oil prices sliding below $50 a barrel and activist shareholder Carl Icahn agitating for change. The land lies on either side of the Union Pacific railroad, which originally received it from the federal government during the frontier era before its sale to Anadarko. “Opportunities like this don’t come along very often,” state governor Mark Gordon and leaders of the Republican-controlled legislature wrote in a column last week. “It’s likely that this would be the largest government purchase of private land since the United States purchased Alaska.” Critics at first panned the 1867 US purchase of Alaska as “Seward’s folly,” after US secretary of state William Seward who negotiated it.Wyoming’s interest in an area this large is also raising questions. The land on offer — more than 1m acres of surface land and 4m acres of underground mineral rights — could deepen the Wyoming economy’s exposure to natural resources. State finances are deteriorating as taxes on coal and natural gas decline. State officials view the land as a potential bonanza for oil and gas extraction, wind and solar farms, power transmission lines, soda-ash mining, livestock grazing and big-game hunting. Houston-based Occidental has confirmed the auction for the acreage, which cuts mostly through Wyoming’s arid southern tier. “While the state has clearly communicated a lot of interest in this asset, it is a competitive process and there’s a large number of qualified participants in that,” said Oscar Brown, Occidental senior vice-president. “The winner of that asset will be one of the largest land and mineral owners in the United States.” Several energy-focused private equity groups and at least two publicly listed exploration and production companies have expressed interest, according to people briefed on the sale process. Shannon Anderson, staff attorney at the Powder River Basin Resource Council, said the Wyoming conservation group was “very concerned about the risk to our state if we spend our savings to acquire this land and minerals that Occidental can’t wait to get rid of”. Mr Gordon first discussed a potential land deal with Occidental chief executive Vicki Hollub last May, at a conference on carbon capture and storage technology held in Jackson, Wyoming, a state official said. The state government owns 3.5m acres of surface land and 3.9m mineral acres. Leases and royalties generate almost $200m in annual revenue for the government, according to its Office of State Lands and Investments. The US federal government owns another 29m acres of land in Wyoming, almost half the total. 
16;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-01-08T05:00:27Z;Warren Buffett: New year, new deal?;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.What would you do with $128bn of cash? The sum is enough to buy all but a few dozen of the companies in the S&P 500, yet billionaire Warren Buffett, below, hasn’t yet been tempted to use that cash to buy a new glittering prize.One of the latest deals Buffett declined to entertain was a multibillion-dollar buyout of famed jeweller Tiffany & Co, which contacted the so-called Oracle of Omaha after it had received a takeover offer from France’s LVMH, DD’s Eric Platt first reported.For the 89-year-old’s investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, it was yet another opportunity it passed on and a reminder that Buffett has been gun shy as valuations of blue-chip US companies have surged in recent years. The last “elephant-sized acquisition” Berkshire clinched was the $32bn takeover of industrial goods group Precision Castparts, which it agreed in 2015. The performance of the sprawling conglomerate has trailed the broader stock market as Buffett has waited on the sidelines. Class-A shares of Berkshire climbed 11 per cent in 2019, far below the 31.5 per cent gain by US stocks with their dividends invested. It marked the company’s worst year against the broader market in a decade. With valuations at record highs, it’s easy to understand why Buffett is hesitant to buy. But the $128bn cash pile, which is now close to a quarter of its market capitalisation, has become a drag as interest rates sit near historic lows. Will Buffett, an ardent value investor, have to change his approach? He’s proven to be flexible in the past and he has already made some concessions. Buffett has softened his approach to buybacks — acquiring Berkshire’s own stock over the past year — and invested in a number of tech companies, a sector long-shunned by the group. Last year Buffett did spot an opportunity to make a $10bn investment in Occidental Petroleum, that pays a handsome $800m annual dividend, much to the chagrin of Carl Icahn. The octogenarian activist hedge fund investor, who is an Occidental shareholder, said that Buffett had outsmarted the energy group’s chief executive Vicki Hollub. Buffett later also bought shares in the company.DD’s Arash Massoudi and James Fontanella-Khan have a video explainer on Buffett’s recent investment history here, including a rare mis-step by the investor in the merger between Kraft and Heinz. As Buffett’s 90th birthday approaches in August 2020, Berkshire investors are also on the lookout for who will replace him. At Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, shareholders were confronted with two possible successors — Greg Abel and Ajit Jain — the two Berkshire vice-chairmen. Todd Combs’ recent promotion to lead Geico, the US car insurance company and one of the most important businesses inside Berkshire, has only raised his profile further. But don’t expect Buffett to hang up his hat just yet. He told the FT back in April 2019: “I’m having more fun than any 88-year-old in the world.”Change is afoot at the world’s largest brewer as Anheuser-Busch InBev prepares to replace its longtime chief financial officer, Felipe Dutra, below. Together with chief executive Carlos Brito, the Brazilian businessman who helped transform the Belgian group into the beer behemoth we see today, responsible for selling one in four beers globally. During his 15-year tenure as CFO, Dutra led the company’s dealmaking spree, swallowing up family-backed beer companies from America to Africa. The strategy of rapid acquisitions followed by aggressive cost-cutting won adulation from investors but bloated AB InBev’s balance sheet. Its 2016 takeover of SABMiller, which left the group saddled with more than $100bn in debt, has given AB InBev a lasting hangover and prompted the brewer to sell assets and shake up its executive ranks. Here’s a graphic from Arash Massoudi and Leila Abboud’s story last year which shows AB InBev’s asset sales since 2016. It doesn’t include the sale of its Australian business to Japan’s Asahi for $11.3bn in July after the failed listing of its Asian operation. A changing of the guard is likely to be part of AB InBev’s 18-month long effort to win back the confidence of its shareholders. The group replaced its chairman in April last year with Martin Barrington, a former chief executive of tobacco group Altria. AB InBev’s share price is still 35 per cent below the level it was in October 2016, when the $79bn deal completed.Bristol-Myers Squibb’s $93bn takeover of rival drugmaker Celgene was one of the first megadeals out of the gate last year, and it proved incredibly lucrative to the long list of financial and legal advisers who structured their transaction.Bristol and Celgene both ranked among the top corporate fee payers to investment banks last year, forking over more than $500m to their advisers, including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase. Bristol sat at the very top of the list, paying roughly $368m to its bankers. It was enough to eclipse Japan’s SoftBank, which last year held the top spot. Data provider Refinitiv estimates SoftBank paid $324m in fees in 2019, down from the heady $924m it spent the year prior.Rounding out the top three is pharmaceutical group AbbVie, which generated roughly $311m in fees for its investment bankers last year. Much of that was tied to its $84bn takeover of Allergan.Overall, investment banking fees fell 3 per cent in 2019 from a year prior to $101.1bn. Refinitiv estimates it’s a three-year low. The declines were driven by lower fees from banks’ M&A, equity capital markets and loan businesses.McDermott Will & Emery has promoted 39 lawyers to partner and four to counsel across its offices in the US and Europe.

17;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-11-15T00:54:49Z;Icahn suffers Occidental legal blow as Buffett buys in;Shale driller has been under pressure from activist alleging mismanagement over Anadarko deal;"Activist investor Carl Icahn was dealt a blow in his campaign against the management of US shale driller Occidental Petroleum, where he has been trying to force his way on to the board in the wake of its deal to buy rival Anadarko.A Delaware judge rejected Mr Icahn’s attempt to force Occidental into disclosing financial records in connection with its acquisition. He had argued that the records would prove the board had mismanaged the company by striking a “fundamentally misguided and hugely overpriced” deal. In a judgment handed down on Thursday, the Delaware Court of Chancery said Mr Icahn had failed to provide any evidence of wrongdoing. “Allegations of mismanagement appear to be nothing more than disagreements with how Occidental’s directors exercised their business judgment,” wrote Joseph Slights, vice-chancellor.The ruling came on the same day that it was revealed that fellow billionaire Warren Buffett had taken an equity stake in Occidental, reflecting a different view of the company’s prospects.Last Friday, Mr Icahn said he had reduced his holding in Occidental from 3.7 per cent to 2.4 per cent, leaving him with a $900m stake. He claimed he could no longer expose more than $1bn to a chief executive and board who, “in my view, have gambled the company to further their own agendas”.Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway held a 0.8 per cent stake as of September 30, according to a regulatory filing. At Thursday’s closing price, that stake was valued at about $292m versus Mr Icahn’s $834m.Occidental’s $55bn takeover of Anadarko put two of the world’s most famous octogenarians at odds. Berkshire provided $10bn of financing for the deal, after Vicki Hollub, Occidental chief executive, visited Mr Buffett in his native Omaha in late-April; Mr Icahn has argued she was taken advantage of by “one of history’s canniest investors”.Last week, Mr Icahn vowed to continue his fight to win board seats despite cutting his stake, saying Occidental could become a name synonymous with “massive corporate disaster” and likening its governance to that of the shared office group WeWork. Mr Icahn has made a series of attempts to force companies to disclose their financial records under the so-called 220 demand he used in the Occidental case. In 2018, he made a similar request to fracking company SandRidge Energy over what he claimed was mismanagement. Occidental shares were up close to 2 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday following Mr Icahn’s legal defeat."
18;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-11-08T21:34:03Z;Icahn cuts Occidental stake but vows to pursue board seats;Activist investor compares shale producer’s corporate governance to WeWork’s;Carl Icahn re-upped his threat to launch a proxy fight at Occidental Petroleum, likening its governance to that of the shared office group WeWork in a new missive attacking its acquisition of rival shale oil producer Anadarko.The billionaire investor said he would continue his fight to add new members to Occidental’s board, even as he cut one-third of his stake in the company.In a scathing open letter to Occidental shareholders, Mr Icahn seized on news this week that Occidental plans to slash capital spending — including by half in the US shale heartland of the Permian Basin — as it pays down debt.“Future growth has been sacrificed in favour of reducing the massive debt pile that Hollub and her board created to acquire Anadarko,” Mr Icahn wrote on Friday, referring to Occidental chief executive Vicki Hollub.“OXY’s corporate governance is so bad that management doesn’t even attempt to defend it,” he added.Mr Icahn said he had reduced his stake in Occidental by 10m shares to 23m, from 3.7 per cent to 2.4 per cent, leaving him with a $900m stake. He claimed he could no longer expose more than $1bn to a chief executive and board who, “in my view, have gambled the company to further their own agendas”.Occidental shares closed at a low for the year on Thursday, but were up 2.7 per cent on Friday.The 83-year-old activist investor is already suing Occidental for access to documents relating to the $55bn takeover of Anadarko earlier this year, which he has previously described as “fundamentally misguided and hugely overpriced”. The parties are waiting for a court ruling after a trial in September.Mr Icahn is seeking to oust four Occidental board members, according to regulatory filings from July. Before he can do that, he needs shareholders to request a special meeting where he can present a so-called consent solicitation.On Friday, he said that Occidental could become a name synonymous with “massive corporate disaster” and “a metaphor for an undisciplined management team” similar to WeWork and Enron.“Sunlight is the best disinfectant,” he wrote, quoting Louis Brandeis, a former associate justice who served on the US Supreme Court. “We agree and believe the OxyDarko Disaster desperately needs some sunshine.”Occidental has already conceded to one of Mr Icahn’s demands by saying it would make some corporate governance changes next year. It did not immediately return a request for comment on the latest open letter.
19;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-11-05T01:22:31Z;Occidental Petroleum to cut capital spending to pay down debt;Oil producer reports quarterly loss after $55bn Anadarko takeover;Occidental Petroleum plans to slash capital spending — including by half in the US shale heartland of the Permian Basin — as it pays down debt amassed in its blockbuster acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.The company on Monday set out a budget for no more than $5.5bn in capital expenditure in 2020, down from $9bn this year. Occidental forecast oil and gas production would grow by 2 per cent in 2020, well below the 5 per cent growth envisaged when it agreed the $55bn Anadarko takeover six months ago.Energy producers across the US shale patch are squeezed between static oil and gas prices and investors seeking better returns. Sceptical capital markets have forced many independent producers to curtail drilling, leading to decelerating rises in output in the world’s largest oil-producing country.Occidental faces additional pressure to repay borrowings used to finance an Anadarko deal that doubled its size when it closed in August. Net debt of $43.9bn as of September 30 was almost six times higher than a year before, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.“While the much lower budget will obviously slow growth in 2020, it points to the company’s discipline amid the backdrop of muted oil prices. And I think it will also alleviate any lingering concerns about the sustainability of the dividend,” said Pavel Molchanov, analyst at Raymond James.Vicki Hollub, Occidental chief executive, engineered the Anadarko purchase after outbidding Chevron. After agreeing the deal she said it would provide “the ability to deliver production growth of 5 per cent” and build on earnings in the first year of ownership.Investors concerned about the value of the deal have sent Occidental’s shares down by more than a quarter since May. Activist investor Carl Icahn sued the company, claiming the deal was “little more than an enormous bet on the price of oil”. The parties are waiting for a court ruling after a trial in September.Houston-based Occidental reported a net loss of $912m, or $1.08 a share, in the third quarter, compared to net profit of $1.9bn, or $2.44 a share, one year earlier. The loss included $969m in costs and debt financing fees from the Anadarko takeover and a $285m write-off of unproved oil leases.Adjusted for items, Occidental earned $93m, or 11 cents a share, well below analyst expectations of 45 cents a share. Occidental’s stock was 0.4 per cent lower at $44.06 post-market trading late Monday.The company noted it had repaid $4.9bn in debt in the third quarter, completed the agreed sale of liquefied natural gas assets in Mozambique for proceeds of $3.9bn and divested stakes in US pipeline company Plains All American for $650m.“We remain committed to the strategy we laid out to our investors, which focuses on deleveraging and returning excess free cash flow to shareholders,” Ms Hollub said.In the Permian Basin, the booming oil region where Occidental is the biggest producer, capital spending was budgeted to fall from $4.4bn in 2019 to $2.2bn in 2020, according to an investor presentation.
20;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-08-06T23:10:38Z;Investors flock to Occidental jumbo-bond sale;Underwriters price $13bn in debt at a lower yield than anticipated;Occidental Petroleum issued $13bn in bonds on Tuesday to fund its takeover of Anadarko, an acquisition that has pitted famed investors Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn against one another.Orders for the 10-part bond sale swelled to $78bn by midday on Tuesday in New York, according to two people briefed on the matter, allowing underwriters to lower the yield on the offering compared with the initial guidance released earlier in the day.The strong appetite underscored investors’ renewed interest in corporate debt amid a global bond rally that has pushed yields for government bonds sharply lower.The 10-year bond priced at 185 basis points above comparably maturing US Treasury bonds, down from the initial guidance of 220bp.This would peg the yield at about 3.56 per cent. Occidental’s current outstanding debt, maturing in 2027, yielded 3.187 per cent as of Tuesday evening. The effective yield on the ICE Bank of America index of investment grade energy debt was 3.52 per cent.The more favourable pricing came even after Moody’s, the rating agency, last week downgraded Occidental’s credit rating to Baa3, the lowest investment grade level.Matt Brill, senior portfolio manager for Invesco, said the US investment grade credit market was set to see an increase in buying by foreign investors facing negative yielding government debt.“Foreign investors are hungry for yield because of the negative yielding rates in Europe and elsewhere, so we think there will be a lot of demand from those investors for new credit issuance,” he said.Proceeds from the deal will be used to finance Occidental’s $55bn takeover of Anadarko. The companies agreed the deal in May after a bidding war involving Chevron, which initially offered $38bn.The Occidental acquisition is set to close later this year and expands the group’s reach in the Permian Basin, a centre of US shale oil production, where Anadarko has drilling rights to 250,000 acres.The purchase was sealed when Occidental secured funding from Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Under the terms of the deal, Berkshire will invest $10bn in Occidental in preferred shares with an 8 per cent dividend, above market rates.The financing arrangement with Mr Buffett’s company was mocked as “stealing candy from a baby” by Mr Icahn, who holds $1.6bn in Occidental stock. In May, Mr Icahn filed a lawsuit against the oil company, claiming the deal was “fundamentally misguided and hugely overpriced”.Occidental shares have traded lower since the deal was announced in May, indicating investors share Mr Icahn’s concerns the oil major overpaid for Anadarko.Chevron had increased its initial $38bn offer to $48bn but declined to raise it further and walked away with a $1bn break fee from Anadarko.
21;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-07-31T22:47:05Z;Occidental forms new joint venture in Permian shale;;Occidental Petroleum has formed a new joint venture to accelerate development plans in the Permian Basin, the centre of the US shale boom, ahead of the expected completion of its $55bn takeover of Anadarko Petroleum.The Houston-based group said it entered into an agreement on Wednesday to form the joint venture with Columbian state-run oil company Ecopetrol to develop 97,000 net acres of Occidental’s holdings in the Permian’s Midland Basin.The deal is worth up to $1.5bn, comprised of $750m in cash at closing and $750m of carried capital, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. Occidental will own a 51 per cent stake in the venture, while Ecopetrol will own the remaining 49 per cent.Occidental won a bidding war in May to buy rival US energy producer Anadarko in a $55bn deal backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which pledged to invest $10bn to finance it.The deal faces pushback from Occidental shareholder Carl Icahn, the activist investor, who has sued the company and launched an effort to replace four members of the company’s board. Occidental chief executive Vicki Hollub asked shareholders in a letter to reject Mr Icahn’s board nominees, saying he “does not understand” the financial benefits of the merger and his nominees would interfere with the company’s ability to integrate Anadarko’s assets.Anadarko shareholders are set to vote on the deal on August 8.The new joint venture came alongside Occidental’s quarterly results, which revealed earnings that exceeded analysts’ forecasts.The company reported net income of $635m for the second quarter that ended in June, compared with $848m in the year-ago period. Core earnings were 97 cents a share, beating forecasts for 93 cents. Revenues rose to $4.48bn from $4.13bn.Occidental attributed the decline in net income to lower realised crude oil prices and $50m in additional costs related to the Anadarko acquisition.Shares in Occidental were up 0.2 per cent at $51.45 in after-hours trading.
22;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-07-23T17:09:22Z;Icahn/Occidental: Sage rage;Shareholders suddenly have chance for a protest vote;Carl Icahn wants to strike while the iron is hot. Mr Icahn has a near 5 per cent stake in Occidental Petroleum, the oil and gas producer. It recently made a takeover move on Anadarko Petroleum for $55bn, in a bidding war that has frustrated Occidental’s shareholders. Its share price is down a quarter since the original deal rumours began. The deal will lumber Occidental with $43bn of debt and another $10bn of preferred stock held by Warren Buffett.Mr Icahn seeks to replace four board members not through the traditional annual proxy process but in an off-cycle, so-called “consent solicitation”. However, now that Mr Icahn’s position has evolved from simply complaining to aiming to join the company, his strategic ideas must also face scrutiny.According to a letter from Mr Icahn this week, Occidental got “taken to the cleaners” by Mr Buffett, the so-called Sage of Omaha, who secured a dividend payment of 8 per cent on his preferred stock along with stock warrants worth perhaps $1bn. This financial engineering allowed Occidental to avoid a shareholder vote on the transaction and also minimises its financial leverage which at roughly 3 times total debt to ebitda leaves it at the edge of a junk rating.Mr Icahn concedes there is nothing he can do to unwind the transaction so his interest in pursuing the board seats is to ensure Occidental wrings out the $3.5bn of annual cost savings it has promised. He also wants a board committee to consider a sale of the company. Occidental argues that its board is full of independent voices that can hold Vicki Hollub, its chief executive, accountable. The oil explorer points out that two of his candidates are employees of his fund.The question then for shareholders is if they simply want to lodge a protest vote against Occidental’s management. For all the fuss, disputes often settle quietly when dissidents like Mr Icahn get a board seat or two. His bluster is easy to wave off. The discontent among Occidental shareholders will not dissipate as quickly.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

23;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-07-22T18:26:18Z;Icahn steps up attack on Occidental over Anadarko deal;In letter to shareholders, activist investor claims Buffett took oil chief ‘to the cleaners’;Carl Icahn renewed his attack on Occidental Petroleum and its chief executive Vicki Hollub on Monday, saying the investor Warren Buffett “figuratively took her [Hollub] to the cleaners” after he pumped billions of dollars into Occidental to fund its $55bn takeover of rival Anadarko Petroleum.Mr Icahn, whose activist investment vehicles have built a $1.6bn stake in Occidental, has stepped up his opposition to the deal since May when he filed a lawsuit against the company and labelled the deal as “fundamentally misguided and hugely overpriced”.In his latest missive, he has criticised Ms Hollub for having limited experience in handling mergers and acquisitions when she agreed a $10bn financing package for the Anadarko transaction involving Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.The deal with Berkshire Hathaway buttressed Occidental as it bid for the company against US oil major Chevron, which had agreed to buy Anadarko for $48bn in April. In return for 80m warrants in the company, Berkshire agreed to invest $10bn in Occidental. But the financing came at a high cost: the $10bn was in the form of preferred shares that pay dividends at a rate of 8 per cent per year, a yield well above the prevailing market rate.“The Buffett deal was like taking candy from a baby,” the billionaire investor said in a letter to shareholders on Monday. “One might say in Warren’s defence that it was almost his fiduciary duty to Berkshire Hathaway to accept it.”The 83-year-old activist investor said he knew of at least one large investor that would have provided financing for the deal without warrants promised to Berkshire Hathaway.At the time Occidental agreed to the financing with Berkshire, it was unclear if Chevron had planned to raise its offer for Anadarko. Chevron, with roughly $9bn of cash on its balance sheet and a market valuation above $215bn, was seen as having far more ammunition than Occidental in any public bidding war.Berkshire’s investment allowed Occidental to lift the cash portion of its bid so it did not need to win approval from its shareholders for the takeover. That was critical in winning the backing from the Anadarko board as it debated the rival offers from Occidental and Chevron, people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.Mr Icahn accused Ms Hollub and Eugene Batchelder, Occidental’s chairman, of acting in self interest at the expense of the company and shareholders. He claimed that the takeover of Anadarko was designed to ensure Occidental’s independence, allowing executives to keep their jobs and “lucrative compensation”.Included in the letter were the estimated compensation packages for both Ms Hollub and Mr Batchelder. As Occidental’s chief executive, Ms Hollub had been paid $40m over the past three years with a weekly salary of $270,000, or more than 100 times what the median Occidental employee makes, according to Mr Icahn. As chairman, Mr Batchelder earned $490,000 a year.Ms Hollub sent a letter to shareholders earlier in the day asking them to reject Mr Icahn’s bid to replace four board members. The investor “does not understand” the financial benefits of the merger and his board nominees “do not possess skills, experience or expertise that are additive or superior to our existing directors,” she said.Mr Icahn has also warned that Occidental’s “risky Anadarko bet” could see the company lose its listing on the New York Stock Exchange.Occidental’s share price has declined by 22 per cent since April when the Anadarko bid was revealed.

25;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-06-26T22:43:32Z;Carl Icahn seeks to oust four Occidental directors;;Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is preparing a campaign to oust four of Occidental Petroleum’s board members, just two days after comparing the company’s management to a “feudal system” and its directors to “feudal barons”.Mr Icahn, whose activist investment vehicles have built a $1.6bn stake in Occidental, said that “the company’s current directors have made a number of mistakes in how and at what cost they pursued the acquisition” in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.The 83-year-old investor is suing Occidental over its $55bn takeover of Anadarko Petroleum, which he said amounted to “little more than an enormous bet on the price of oil”. Mr Icahn called on shareholders to request a special meeting where he can present a so-called consent solicitation.The filing also includes an amendment to lower the percentage of shareholders required to hold a special meeting from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, an initiative that was backed by investors at the company’s annual meeting in May, going against the board’s recommendations.Mr Icahn’s opposition to the tie-up between Occidental and Anadarko sets him on a direct course against Warren Buffett who provided $10bn in financing for the deal, allowing Occidental to bypass a shareholder vote.The activist investor’s bid to overhaul Occidental’s board follows his success at Caesar’s Entertainment, which agreed to be bought by Eldorado Resorts in a $17.3bn deal.Icahn Enterprises became the gaming group’s top shareholder in March with a 15.5 per cent stake, and three of his nominees were recently installed on the board. Icahn had pushed for a sale of the company, which he said would be “a great opportunity for certain investors”.In a statement praising Caesar’s board of directors for acting responsibly, Mr Icahn indicated that Occidental’s shareholders had been treated like “peasants”.
26;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-06-14T04:01:39Z;Has Teneo been playing the oil field?;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;"FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.Two DD events to start: We look forward to meeting those of you who are confirmed to attend the special lunch interview with Barbarians at the Gate author Bryan Burrough on Tuesday. Later that evening, the second London DD Forum event is taking place for members of the club. More info if you are interested in joining here. We’ll be launching a US DD Forum in Q4.We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: the Occidental-Anadarko-Chevron triangle is the gift that keeps on giving.The likes of Carl Icahn and Warren Buffett have been swept up in the controversial deal that saw Occidental Petroleum swoop in to win Anadarko Petroleum from Chevron’s grasp.Now DD readers can add the corporate advisory firm Teneo (remember, don’t you dare call them a public relations group, scroll down in link) to that list. It turns out Occidental and Chevron have the same taste in advisers as they do in oil assets.Teneo had advised Occidental on the potential takeover before Chevron made its offer for Anadarko. It then went on to work on Chevron’s bid for the company. Now, Occidental wants to know whether the high-flying corporate advisory firm shared confidential information it received from Occidental with Chevron.The Texas-based company has launched private arbitration to drill into Teneo’s work with Chevron, angered by the company’s decision to work for its rival bidder.While it’s not unusual for advisers to have multiple relationships in the same industry, they need to manage conflicts of interest. Courting both oil companies may have been a slick move.People close to Teneo, which was founded by former associates of Bill and Hillary Clinton, said Chevron hired the company after it was dismissed by Occidental. Once the firm found out that it had a conflict of interest in the Anadarko matter, Teneo decided to step down.The story of Occidental’s courting of Anadarko has had its fair share of plot twists. From Occidental’s unlikely win over its more cash-heavy rival, to Buffett’s backing of the deal, to Icahn suing the company for disclosures relating to the takeover, it’s difficult to know whether there’ll be any winners in this buyout battle.Get the exclusive details from DD’s James Fontanella-Khan and Sujeet Indap here.From last week: CVC pays $350m for majority stake in TeneoSix years after Daniel Loeb first built a stake in Sony, the activist investor is back for seconds.Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point, has taken a $1.5bn position in the Japanese group, the FT’s Kana Inagaki and Lindsay Fortado report, having walked away from its first campaign with a 20 per cent return on its initial $1.1bn investment.It turns out Loeb left too early. He missed out on a near-tripling in Sony shares in subsequent years having underestimated the company’s ability to turn round its struggling electronics business.Now the activist is back for more, but he’s got different ideas about how the company, famous for its gaming consoles, can unlock value. And it seems he has done a 180 degree turn on Sony’s entertainment business.During the first campaign, Loeb, pictured below, called for Sony to spin off entertainment assets like Sony Pictures Entertainment, drawing the ire of Hollywood actor George Clooney who called Loeb a “carpet bagger”.This time, Loeb is pushing for the company to unlock its true worth as a global entertainment powerhouse by separating its image sensor business. He thinks Sony’s shares are undervalued because of the complexity of its portfolio.If the past is anything to go by, Loeb has a tough job on his hands. He failed in 2013 to persuade the Japanese conglomerate to sell a part of its entertainment business and the investor is now dealing with a much better prepared company.Sony has already hired Goldman Sachs, a PR agency, and formed special communications and investor relations teams to prepare for the new campaign.Round two of the Sony-Loeb tussle comes as corporate Japan contends with an increased wave of activism. At least six of the country’s biggest corporate names, including Toshiba, Lixil and Japan Railways, are wrestling with investor demands for change.The operators of Saks Fifth Avenue would have you believe that the company’s New York City flagship on Fifth Avenue is swimming in money. After all, the company is almost done with a $250m renovation to the store.And then there’s the fact the company imported Parisian hotspot L’Avenue — where Kim Kardashian and Rihanna are known to dine — to the very same location.It’s easy to get a high from all that wattage. But sadly for Saks-owner HBC, investors haven’t been drinking the kool-aid, err peach bellinis. Shares of the company have been sliding for years; slumping nearly 80 per cent from a 2015 high.Chalk it up to all that drama in the retail industry. You know the story: competition is coming from all angles: Amazon and Yoox Net-a-Porter on the ecommerce front; fast fashion groups like Zara and H&M can pump out copycat luxury goods on the fly; and then there’s all that debt that luxury goods purveyors took on earlier this decade.HBC chairman Richard Baker presumably had enough. Earlier this week he and a group of investors (including a WeWork subsidiary) launched a buyout bid for the group. The Saks-owner is already very leveraged up; it is rated deep in junk territory by both Moody’s and S&P Global.So the bidders are hoping a different tact will work with the board (which is being advised by JPMorgan Chase).They’ve offered a takeover bid that, while a juicy premium to where the stock was trading at just before the bid went public, was a fraction of where shares traded over the past three years.The HBC bidders have also agreed to roll their stock into the new venture; thereby reducing the amount of debt they’d need to finance a takeover. If the HBC board accepts the deal, it would offer the proverbial sewing-pattern for other transactions like it.Man GLG has hired Tej Johar as portfolio manager within its European long-short equity team based in London.

27;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-06-13T18:20:18Z;Adviser Teneo faces arbitration over oil deal conflict;Corporate advisory firm had worked for both sides in Anadarko takeover battle;Teneo, the highflying corporate advisory firm founded by former associates of Bill and Hillary Clinton, has been dragged into arbitration after having worked for both sides in the takeover battle for Anadarko, the US oil company.Occidental Petroleum launched the private arbitration case against Teneo after agreeing to buy Anadarko for $56bn, outbidding Chevron, which had offered about $50bn for the owner of large shale oil reserves in the Permian Basin, according to people briefed on the matter.Teneo, which provides services including strategy and communications advice, had worked for Occidental before Chevron made its offer for Anadarko. It then went on to work on Chevron’s bid. The arbitration aims to resolve the question of whether Teneo shared confidential information it received from Occidental with Chevron, said multiple people briefed about the matter.Professional advisers — such as investment bankers, lawyers, and communications consultants — often have multiple relationships in the same industry and need to manage conflicts of interest. Compared with law firms and investment banks, however, communications advisers face lighter regulation.Teneo was started in 2011. Its founders included Doug Band, an aide to Mr Clinton during and after his presidency, and Declan Kelly, a former fundraiser for Mrs Clinton who served as the US economic envoy to Northern Ireland during her time as secretary of state.The firm quickly became known for forging relationships with some of the world’s leading chief executives — and commanding higher fees for its services than its competitors. Teneo recently sold a majority stake to private equity group CVC Capital Partners for more than $350m, valuing the company at more than $700m.Occidental and Teneo declined to comment.People close to Teneo said the firm had acted appropriately and had not shared any of Occidental’s confidential documents with other parties. They added that Chevron had hired Teneo after it was dismissed by Occidental.People close to Occidental said Teneo decided to step down after finding out that it had a conflict of interest in the Anadarko matter. They said Teneo did not disclose what the conflicts were and Occidental only found out that the firm was working for Chevron after its rival announced on April 12 that it had reached an agreement to buy Anadarko.

The redundancies, which will start in June, will be focused on underperforming businesses across the trading, capital markets and advisory divisions. More here.We’ve told you that Occidental Petroleum’s shareholders weren’t very pleased about losing their right to vote on the monster $55bn acquisition of rival Anadarko Petroleum.Unhappy with the costly purchase, disgruntled Occidental shareholders demanded governance changes at the company’s annual meeting earlier this month, making it easier for investors to organise opposition to the board.One investor, however, has taken the matter into his own hands. Billionaire activist Carl Icahn is suing Occidental under the so-called 220 demand over its takeover of Anadarko. He wants access to documents that can prove the Texas-based oil company “botched” the acquisition.How? Well, Icahn has a lot of grievances but he’s particularly unhappy about the $10bn financing provided by the Oracle of Omaha himself.Vicki Hollub,Occidental’s chief executive, and Warren Buffett shook hands on the deal after a “ninety minute” meeting orchestrated by Brian Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America. Buffett scored a generous 8 per cent dividend rate and a warrant to buy up to 80m shares of common stock, plus a $50m signing fee as garnish.Icahn thinks Hollub was outwitted by the legendary investor and invoked a quote by the man himself to say it: “When you combine ignorance and leverage, you get some pretty interesting results.”Hollub’s other attempt to raise cash was another no-no for Icahn. The sale of Anadarko’s African assets to French energy giant Total for $8.8bn was a “botched” attempt to raise cash with no competitive bidding process and little information on their value, according to the filing.And Occidental’s biggest mistake of all, according to Icahn, was not selling itself. The company’s strong presence in the Permian Basin in Texas — a big part of the reason it pursued Anadarko so aggressively — would’ve attracted competitive bids at a premium to its stock price. Now, that’s no longer an option.Icahn is considering suing the company or arranging a special meeting of shareholders but he needs to see the documents first. Based on this: “Fixing the problem rather than litigating over it is probably the better approach here,” we’re guessing he’d prefer the latter.Occidental/Anadarko is the gift that keeps on giving.

Despite a growing body of evidence that burnout, depression and anxiety are costing companies a fortune, employers do not seem to be taking the conditions seriously. An estimated 615m people suffer from depression and anxiety, and according to a recent World Health Organization study, those two issues cost an estimated $1tn in lost productivity every year.However, there are some encouraging signs.Dr Pereira, who trained in psychiatry in Mumbai in the 1980s, and later at the Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital, Oxford university and King’s College London, tells the FT’s Emma Jacobs that he has seen attitudes towards mental health change in recent years.There is growing acceptance, he says, that mental illness has “parity” with physical problems. An increasing number of executives are talking openly about their mental health challenges and are putting in place policies aimed at tackling the taboo.The DD’s James Fontanella-Khan and FT colleague Lilah Raptopoulos have been investigating for several months the way companies deal with mental health in the workplace following a series of suicides at some of the world’s top law firms.

It’s share price has taken a nosedive over the past decade, attracting the attention of the much dreaded activist investors.The UK rail operator, which also owns the Greyhound buses that criss-cross the US and the yellow school buses that ferry American children to school, is the target of Coast Capital Management, a US activist investor with an almost 10 per cent stake in the company.Coast has created a hashtag worthy “Save FirstGroup” website where it calls out the company’s “destructive board” and “unqualified CEO”. The activist fund also has designs on the company’s revival. The usual themes emerge: reduce debt, sell assets, replace the board etc.Ironically, Coast has pushed for FirstGroup to sell its flagging UK rail business to get the company back on track. The Aberdeen-based business has opted to sell its iconic Greyhound coach line instead.It’s a win for Coast. The company believes the transport group can squeeze value from Greyhound’s property portfolio, which is worth far more than the share price indicates, according to James Rasteh, Coast’s chief investment officer.FirstGroup is also exploring taking a different route on its UK bus division and its rail franchise, both of which are struggling to generate the sort of profits the company’s US school bus business has delivered.Chief executive Matthew Gregory, who has led the transport group since November, said the company’s “portfolio rationalisation” will give FirstGroup “leading positions” in its core markets in North America.With FirstGroup’s share price lower than where it was before many of the schoolchildren who use its services were born (late 1990s), the transport company’s journey to a higher valuation may come to resemble a cross-country Greyhound bus trip.Go deeper with the FT’s Lex column.Sign up here to Market Forces, our daily analysis of what’s moving global marketsMorgan Stanley has hired back one of its top dealmakers, Eric Bischof, two years after he left for rival Bank of America, Bloomberg reports.

29;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-05-30T19:31:14Z;Carl Icahn sues Occidental over Buffett-backed Anadarko deal;Activist investor says oil group ‘botched’ financing talks and overpaid for rival;Carl Icahn has sued Occidental Petroleum over its $55bn takeover of Anadarko Petroleum, saying it had overpaid for its rival and “botched” the acquisition by agreeing a pricey financing package from “one of history’s canniest investors” Warren Buffett.Mr Icahn, whose activist investment vehicles have built a $1.6bn stake in Occidental, is seeking access to documents relating to the takeover, which he described in a lawsuit filed on Thursday as “fundamentally misguided and hugely overpriced”.The deal amounted to “little more than an enormous bet on the price of oil”, and said there was a “substantial risk” that Occidental might have to cut its dividend if crude dropped to $45 a barrel or lower, Mr Icahn claimed in the suit.The 83-year-old investor has used a so-called 220 demand, a previously obscure section of the Delaware corporate law code under which shareholders can request documents to investigate matters including mismanagement. The move is an attempt to derail the purchase of Anadarko, which Occidental won in a bidding war against Chevron earlier this month.Mr Icahn said Occidental had botched the financing by striking a $10bn deal with Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which will cost the company $800m per year in dividends on preferred stock. Occidental also gave Berkshire warrants that the lawsuit claims were worth more than a $1bn, and paid Berkshire a $50m signing fee.The lawsuit alleges that the poor dealmaking experience of Vicki Hollub, Occidental’s chief executive, was exposed by Mr Buffett.“Unfortunately for Occidental’s stockholders, as shown by the terms of the Berkshire preferred [stock], a ninety-minute deal ‘negotiation’ with one of history’s canniest investors, is no place to gain M&A experience — at least if you care about protecting your stockholders,” it said.Occidental rejected Mr Icahn accusations and said it would respond to the suit in due course. “Our acquisition of Anadarko will create a global energy leader with a highly complementary asset portfolio and a unique opportunity to deliver compelling value and returns to the shareholders of both companies,” it said in a statement.The company’s shares were close to flat in Thursday afternoon trading.Analysts at UBS said in a note to clients that “we do not believe there is a viable path to derailing the [Anadarko] deal”, unless the companies had made a mistake about their legal requirements, “and even then it is a stretch”.If successful, Mr Icahn’s action would lead to the emergence of further details about a deal that has already proved controversial among Occidental shareholders. The filing also says Mr Icahn is contemplating calling a special meeting of shareholders to ensure that the company “is being run in the interests of its stockholders going forward, and not in the interests of directors and officers who appear to be interested in growth for growth’s sake”.Ms Hollub has insisted that the deal can create significant additional value for shareholders, promising $3.5bn of annual savings in operating and capital costs. Combining Anadarko’s assets with Occidental’s in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico could add $10bn to their value, the company has said, justifying the premium.However, shareholders at the Occidental’s annual meeting earlier this month made clear concern about the deal by backing a proposal to make it easier for discontented investors to organise opposition to the board.A call to cut the percentage of shareholders required to hold a special meeting was backed by investors speaking for 60 per cent of the shares voted.Mr Icahn’s lawsuit accused Occidental of an “even bigger botch” by agreeing that it would sell Anadarko’s assets in Africa to France’s Total for $8.8bn. He has requested documents related to that sale as well as to the negotiations with Mr Buffett, as well as information on whether Occidental’s management considered a sale of the company before the acquisition.Occidental’s biggest mistake was opting to buy a rival instead of selling itself, according to Mr Icahn. The Texas-based company would have attracted “strong and competitive” bids given its prominence in the Permian Basin and it “would have been the stockholder friendly thing to do”, he said.
30;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-05-16T04:00:37Z;US oil: Occidental’s $56bn gamble on finding value in shale;Vicki Hollub’s pursuit of Anadarko will be a test of industry profitability;When Vicki Hollub stood up to speak at Occidental Petroleum’s annual meeting last Friday, she knew she was facing a sceptical audience. After three years as chief executive, she had just agreed the most ambitious move of her career, the $56bn acquisition of rival Anadarko Petroleum, and many investors feared she was overreaching.Buying Anadarko, one of the largest US independent oil and gas groups, with assets around the world from Texas to Mozambique, will double the size of Occidental. It will also saddle the company with debts of around $50bn, in return for a business that has been failing to cover its capital spending from its operating cash flows. Ms Hollub promised billions of dollars worth of cost savings and productivity gains from the deal, but many investors remain sceptical that she can deliver.“It is simply outrageous,” said one top 10 shareholder before the meeting. The deal poses several operational risks as well as putting enormous pressure on Occidental’s balance sheet, he warned. Investors’ lack of enthusiasm for the deal was reflected in Occidental’s share price, which dropped to a 10-year low as Anadarko accepted its offer.Addressing around 100 shareholders in a windowless conference room in the basement of the company’s Houston headquarters, Ms Hollub insisted that the deal was “a unique transformative opportunity” for Occidental. “We will get those synergies” from Anadarko’s assets, she said. “We can operate them better than anybody else. We are the rightful owner.”Although investors had no opportunity to vote directly on the deal, their votes on other issues, including the appointment of Occidental directors, showed clear signs of discontent. The message was clear: if Ms Hollub was so determined to do this deal, she had better make sure it works.There was a bigger lesson: 15 years into the shale revolution, investors across the US oil and gas industry want it to start paying off for them.The surge in US oil and gas production, created by the shale boom, has changed the world. The US acts like a “swing producer”: a source of supply that can respond within months to higher prices by increasing output. As tensions rise between the US and Iran, it provides a reassuring buffer against the threat of an oil crisis. But from its earliest days there have been suspicions that the industry is built on unstable financial foundations.The small and midsized companies that pioneered the advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing that unlocked previously unyielding shale rocks have relied on bank borrowing, and equity and bond sales, to finance growth. A sample of leading exploration and production companies compiled by Bloomberg revealed that total capital spending has exceeded total cash from operations in every year since 2010.That persistent failure to be financially self-sustaining has weighed heavily on the share prices of US oil and gas companies. Since the start of 2017, the benchmark Brent crude price has risen by about 40 per cent, but the S&P 500 exploration and production sector index has dropped by 16 per cent.Ms Hollub says she can do better. Through economies of scale, efficient logistics management and superior geological understanding, Occidental aims to improve the performance of Anadarko’s assets and generate sustained free cash flows for investors.If it can deliver on these promises, it will show the world that the shale industry can have a financially sustainable, long-term future. If it fails, it will sound a warning that shale remains a trap for unwary investors.To win Anadarko, Occidental had to see off its larger rival Chevron, which took some swift manoeuvring, while the two companies had competing bids on the table. Ms Hollub flew to Omaha, Nebraska for a 90-minute meeting with Warren Buffett on April 28, securing a $10bn investment from Berkshire Hathaway that allowed her to rejig Occidental’s offer to include more cash, avoiding the need to put the deal to a vote of her own shareholders.“To get the deal done, we had to have those funds. The timing was critical for us,” she told investors. “I am very happy and grateful to Warren Buffett for being there when we needed him.”In the end, however, winning was relatively straightforward. Occidental made a bid worth around 20 per cent more to Anadarko’s shareholders, and Chevron chief executive Michael Wirth declined to match it. “This was an excellent opportunity for us, but it was not a necessity at any price,” Mr Wirth told the Financial Times. “We simply are not desperate to do a deal.”For Occidental, the hard part is just beginning. It must now prove that its higher bid was justified.The key to making the deal work lies about 500 miles west of Houston, in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the hottest spot in the US shale oil boom. The sparsely-populated landscape of scrubby mesquite bushes has become a maelstrom of activity, as companies have rushed to exploit what are some of the world’s lowest-cost oil reserves. Production doubled in the three years up to 2019, hitting an estimated 4.1m barrels a day of oil in May. It has accounted for about half of the total increase in US oil production since 2016 and the Permian alone produces more oil than any member of Opec except Saudi Arabia and Iraq.Anadarko’s portfolio includes a range of operations, from deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico to an LNG export plant under development in Mozambique. Many of those assets are up for sale, and a deal to raise $8bn has already been agreed with France’s Total for the LNG project and other operations in Africa. Ms Hollub has made it clear that the real prize is Anadarko’s drilling rights on around 250,000 acres of the Permian. Those assets are worth about $17bn, according to Rystad Energy, a research firm. Ms Hollub told the annual meeting that applying Occidental’s knowhow could add $10bn to their value.Already one of the largest producers in the Permian region, Occidental is also one of the biggest holders of drilling rights. Jeff Bennett, senior vice-president in charge of its shale operations, says that three years ago it was “probably at the bottom” in terms of performance. Since then, however, he says the business has been transformed.The company spent a couple of years focused on acquiring and analysing seismic surveys and other data, working out ways to drill wells more precisely. It has since published impressive-looking statistics, purporting to show how that applied science delivers superior performance. The wells it has been drilling in the Delaware Basin, the western section of the Permian, have on average produced 74 per cent more oil and gas than those of Anadarko in their first six months in production.“Six-month production on its own isn’t important,” says Tom Loughrey, at analysts Friezo Loughrey Oil Well Partners, who adds that Occidental has not yet provided enough information to make a proper judgment. “You need to know what happens after a year and three years and 10 years. You can’t conclude from the data Occidental presented that Anadarko is mismanaging its operations.”Still, it is widely accepted that the performance of Occidental’s shale division has improved greatly. Andrew Dittmar of Drillinginfo, a research group, describes Occidental as one of the region’s top-tier operators, alongside EOG Resources and Pioneer Natural Resources. That improvement has enabled Occidental to cut its operating cost per barrel in half between 2014 and the end of last year.“What really pleased me was . . . the speed at which we were able to convert that knowledge that we were developing into ringing the cash register,” Mr Bennett says. “It was remarkable how quickly we were able to mobilise and get that done.”The long lines of heavy trucks thundering through once-sleepy country towns across the Permian region bear witness to how the oil boom is supported by a colossal logistical exercise transporting rigs, pumps and other equipment and supplies.Bringing just one well into production can require 600-700 truckloads of sand, which is pumped underground with water and chemicals to hold open small cracks in the rock so oil can flow out. Occidental has invested in a new facility on a 400-acre site in New Mexico, close to its oil developments, that can store sand brought by train all the way from Wisconsin, meaning much shorter journeys for its trucks.That will now be used to support wells being drilled and brought into production on Anadarko’s acreage, some of which is only about 40 miles away across the border in Texas. A new 68,000 square foot “decision centre”, under construction not far from the sand facility, will be used by Occidental’s scientists and engineers to study wells and work out ways to improve them.But will applying those scientific and logistical strengths be enough to deliver the success that Ms Hollub needs? The results from Anadarko’s Permian business suggest there is room for improvement. In a recent investor presentation, Anadarko said it expected the division to generate enough cash to cover its capital spending by the end of 2020, but that projected date has been slipping.For Ms Hollub, the incentive to make the acquisition work will be sharpened by the $40bn of debt Occidental is having to take on before any asset sales, and by the 8 per cent dividend it will have to pay on the $10bn of preference shares sold to Berkshire Hathaway. If the business fails to perform, or if the oil price slumps again, Occidental’s financial position could quickly look precarious.If the company can achieve in the short term the performance that investors are hoping for, then Ms Hollub will be given the chance to demonstrate that she can deliver even greater benefits in the long term. Occidental is one of the world leaders in using carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery: pumping the gas into reservoirs so more of the crude flows out. It has been running tests of the technology in the Permian, and will conduct more this year, with the possibility of launching a first commercial project there in three years’ time.Shale producers are recovering only between 6 and 8 per cent of the oil in the ground with today’s techniques. If enhanced recovery can increase that to 10 to 14 per cent, as early tests suggest, the consequences for oil production could be enormous.That potential is likely to keep companies coming back to the Permian despite the shale industry’s poor record for investors.“We’re very bullish on the Permian,” Mr Bennett says. “Companies are going to learn how to unlock some of the lower-quality rock and create value out of that. And we think there is another phase of recovery in terms of enhanced oil recovery. The Permian being essentially the swing volume in global supply and demand is not going away.”This article was updated on May 23 with Anadarko and Occidental’s correct revenues for 2018. We apologise for the errorAt Occidental’s annual meeting last week a statement from shareholders welcomed the steps being taken to tackle climate change by Vicki Hollub, the chief executive. The statement was backed by Climate Action 100+, an investor group that encourages companies to cut their emissions.Philip Verleger, an energy economist, says investors’ fears about climate risk and a shift away from fossil fuels explain why many have shunned US oil exploration and production companies.“The momentum is building,” he says. “If I’m running a large pension fund, the last thing I want to do is own many shares in the oil industry.”Occidental, which has expertise in managing carbon dioxide emissions, and aims to cut its net emissions to zero, looks better placed than many of its peers to prosper in those changing circumstances. However, its expansion in shale production, including the Anadarko deal, may have pushed it away from that goal.When carbon dioxide is injected into a “conventional”, or non-shale, reservoir to boost production, in what is known as enhanced oil recovery, the gas generally remains in the rock.The most successful experiments with enhanced recovery in shale, however, have used what is called the “huff-and-puff” method: pumping carbon dioxide into a well, waiting for a while, and then allowing the oil to start flowing out mixed with the gas.The carbon dioxide can be collected again and reused, but the oilfield can be a permanent store for the gas only when production stops, typically after four to six years.Ms Hollub acknowledges that EOR can only be part of the answer to tackling climate change, because there are not enough suitable reservoirs to hold its greenhouse gas emissions.The added difficulties of using the technique in shale suggest its contribution is going to be even more tightly constrained.Give all investors a say in big transactions / From Guy R Jubb, University of Edinburgh Business School, UK
31;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-05-10T17:04:15Z;Occidental shareholders flex muscles after Anadarko deal controversy;Investors defy oil company’s board to demand governance change;Shareholders in Occidental Petroleum voted to lower the threshold for calling a special meeting, making it easier for discontented investors to organise opposition to the board in the wake of anger over the company’s $55bn deal to buy Anadarko.At Occidental’s annual meeting in Houston on Friday, a proposal cutting the percentage of shareholders required to call a special meeting was backed by investors speaking for 60 per cent of the shares voted, in defiance of opposition from Occidental’s board.Fears that Occidental could be overpaying for Anadarko, which have been expressed by some shareholders, were also reflected in significant minorities voting against the appointment of the board’s nominated directors. The appointments were backed by investors representing between 70 and 82 per cent of the shares voted.The meeting, held in a windowless conference room in the basement of Occidental’s headquarters building, drew a relatively small crowd of about 100. Despite some shareholders’ public statements opposing the Anadarko deal, when the company’s chairman asked if anyone in the room wanted to make a comment or ask a question, no one spoke.The asset manager T Rowe Price, which owns about 3 per cent of Occidental, said earlier this week that it intended to vote against the board because of “significant concerns” about the Anadarko deal and anger at being denied a shareholder vote.We will make this work. We will get those synergies. And this is in the end going to be a great thing for our shareholdersBy restructuring the deal to increase the cash component, Occidental cut the number of new shares it must issue to a little less than 20 per cent of its total equity — meaning it no longer needed to submit the acquisition for shareholder approval.Anadarko accepted Occidental’s cash and shares offer on Thursday evening, after Chevron declined to raise its rival offer above the $48bn the companies had agreed last month.At the meeting, Occidental’s chief executive Vicki Hollub set out the case for the acquisition, saying she could see a path to increasing by $10bn the value of Anadarko’s assets just in the Permian Basin of west Texas. “That’s why we had the ability to offer $5bn more [than Chevron],” she said.“We will make this work. We will get those synergies. And this is in the end going to be a great thing for our shareholders.”The investor vote on calling special meetings is only advisory, but companies typically respond to shareholder views on this and similar governance issues.The investor who proposed the rule change said in the proxy filing for the meeting that the move would give shareholders more power to replace directors, highlighting individual board members like Eugene Batchelder, who is retired “and did not serve on any other significant board to keep his skills current”.The investor also complained about “a five-year drought” for Occidental’s share price, noting it had dropped from $91 to $72. Since then it has fallen further, to about $55 on Friday afternoon.Occidental’s board had opposed the proposal, which calls for lowering the proportion of shares needed for supporters to convene a special meeting from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. The board argued that the 25 per cent threshold “strikes an appropriate balance” between shareholders’ rights and the risk that “a small minority of stockholders may trigger the administrative and financial burdens of holding a meeting to address a narrowly supported interest”.About 40 per cent of the S&P 500 companies that are, like Occidental, incorporated in Delaware do not allow shareholders to call special meetings, and of those that do, 63 per cent have a threshold of 25 per cent or higher.
32;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-05-09T23:48:45Z;Occidental wins $56bn Anadarko battle as Chevron bows out;Way cleared for industry consolidation but concerns remain over price paid;Occidental Petroleum has won agreement from the board of its rival Anadarko Petroleum for its $56bn bid, clearing the way for a significant consolidation of the US oil industry, after Chevron dropped its lower competing offer.Anadarko’s board said on Thursday evening that it had signed a definitive agreement with Occidental for a cash and shares deal that it expected to close by the end of the year.Fears that Occidental could be overpaying for the acquisition drove its shares to a ten-year low at $56.33 on Thursday evening, down 6 per cent on the day. Anadarko shares fell more than 3 per cent to $73.39.However, Anadarko suggested it was confident the deal would go through, in spite of the concerns expressed by some Occidental shareholders. Occidental has secured financing for the cash component of the offer, which is almost 80 per cent of the value of $75 per Anadarko share, and it does not need to put the deal to a vote of its shareholders.Al Walker, Anadarko’s chief executive, said in a statement: “We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Occidental that delivers significant, near-term value to our shareholders.”This was an excellent opportunity for us, but it was not a necessity at any price. We simply are not desperate to do a dealEarlier in the day, Chevron said it would not increase its offer for Anadarko Petroleum, walking away from the $48bn deal that the two companies had agreed last month, saying a higher offer was not in shareholders’ interests.Anadarko said it had paid Chevron the $1bn break fee included in their takeover agreement. Chevron intends to return the cash to its shareholders, increasing its planned share buyback from $4bn to $5bn.Vicki Hollub, Occidental’s chief executive, said the deal was an “exciting transaction” that would create a company with “industry leading free cash flow metrics”. She added that the acquisition would further establish Occidental’s ability to deliver annual production growth of 5 per cent through investment in projects with high returns.The company said that it was confident of being able to retain an investment grade credit rating, despite the debt it is taking on to finance the deal. It plans to sell assets worth $10bn-$15bn to help reduce its borrowings if the deal goes through, and has already reached a provisional deal with Total of France to sell it Anadarko’s operations in Africa for a net $8bn.Michael Wirth, Chevron’s chief executive, said: “This was an excellent opportunity for us, but it was not a necessity at any price. We simply are not desperate to do a deal.“The deal we negotiated with Anadarko was a good deal with real synergies and a good strategic fit. But we are not going to chase it to a point where it erodes value for shareholders.”He added that in a capital-intensive commodity business such as oil and gas, success or failure could be determined by how efficiently companies invested, and Chevron was “a disciplined steward of capital”.One of Anadarko’s most prized assets is its position in the Permian Basin, the heartland of the US shale oil boom in west Texas, where it has drilling rights on about 250,000 acres.Chevron has set out plans for rapid growth in the Permian region, taking its production from 391,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the first quarter of this year to 900,000 boe/d by the end of 2023. Mr Wirth said it was still on course to achieve that growth even without Anadarko’s assets.“We don’t need any more rigs or any more land,” he said. Chevron shares rose 3 per cent to about $121 on the day.Andrew Brooks of Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said that as a result of the highly leveraged deal Occidental would probably be downgraded to “a weakly positioned investment grade rating”.Occidental shareholders do not get a vote to decide on the deal after the Houston-based company changed the structure of its offer for Anadarko by adding more cash.Nevertheless, some Occidental shareholders plan to express their disappointment by voting against the company’s board at the annual meeting on Friday.T Rowe Price, which owns about 3 per cent of Occidental, making it the seventh-largest shareholder, told the Financial Times that it intended to vote against the board.“We have significant concerns about the proposed deal,” John Linehan, portfolio manager at T Rowe Price, said on Monday. “Occidental’s management has characterised this deal as a ‘transformational deal’ and we feel that any such deal should be put to a shareholder vote.”He added: “Absent that, our only option is to register our displeasure through our proxy vote at the annual meeting. We feel that Occidental’s actions have left us no choice and our current intent is to vote against the board at the meeting.”
33;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-05-07T17:30:34Z;Anadarko: rough neighbourhood;Highest offer does not necessarily win;In baseball, there is a peculiar informal rule called the “neighbourhood play”. Here, a fielder can get a runner “out” at second base without having to touch the player or the base itself. Based on the umpire’s discretion, the fielder can simply be in the “neighbourhood” of the base with possession of the ball.The M&A version of this tradition may be playing out in the contest over the ownership of Anadarko Petroleum, the US-based oil and gas group. Now that Occidental Petroleum appears to have killed off the tie-up between Chevron and Anadarko, Chevron has the chance to revise its offer. The question is how close Chevron needs to get to the terms offered by Occidental to win. It may not technically need to top the offer of its rival — the usual determinant — to succeed. Occidental is still promising $76 per share for Anadarko, or $38bn in total. However, it has increased the cash portion of that bid to nearly 80 per cent. That has accomplished a couple of objectives. First, it reassures Anadarko’s shareholders, who have been skittish about receiving Oxy shares that have dropped a tenth during the bidding war. Second, Oxy’s investors no longer get a vote to sign off on the issue of new shares. Some of them were disturbed by the risks involved if Oxy doubles in size. The risk of losing that vote was a problem both for Anadarko shareholders as well as Oxy chief Vicki Hollub, who has effectively staked her career on winning and integrating Anadarko.As a part of the financing, Oxy has secured $10bn in preferred stock from Berkshire Hathaway along with $9bn from a planned sale of Anadarko assets around the world to Total. The 8 per cent dividend on the preferred stock was the topic of a Monday analyst call. Ms Hollub said that the company’s cost of issuing new equity was 5 per cent. The incremental three percentage points given to Berkshire chief Warren Buffett was worth it to show Anadarko that Oxy could close a deal with near-certainty, the company claimed.Chevron has a few days to decide if and how it wants to bump its bid. Its current offer is worth just $62 per share, a near 25 per cent discount to the current Oxy terms. Moreover, Oxy is now offering so much cash that the inferiority of its stock in the eyes of many Anadarko shareholders now matters little. Do not expect them to give Chevron much of a neighbourhood discount.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
35;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-05-07T01:45:51Z;Anadarko board backs Occidental’s $55bn bid for oil group;Decision adds pressure on Chevron and angers some of potential acquirer’s shareholders;The board of directors of Anadarko Petroleum has backed Occidental Petroleum’s $55bn bid to buy the oil company after more cash was added to sweeten the deal, increasing pressure on rival Chevron to swoop in with a higher counterbid.The company said on Monday it intended to terminate its merger agreement with Chevron after the board unanimously agreed that Occidental’s new offer of $59 in cash and 0.2934 shares of the company’s common stock per share of Anadarko was superior.This is likely to anger some of Occidental’s largest shareholders. T Rowe Price intends to vote against the re-election of Occidental’s entire board at Friday’s annual meeting. Occidental changed the structure of its offer to buy Anadarko in a way that robs its shareholders of a say in the deal, with it increasing the cash portion of its $76 per share bid.Occidental said on Monday evening that it welcomed the Anadarko board’s endorsement of its new offer, which will now not require a shareholder vote.“We look forward to Anadarko completing the next steps under its existing merger agreement and the prospect of executing our merger agreement with Anadarko to complete this exciting transaction,” Occidental said in a statement.Occidental’s management has characterised this deal as a ‘transformational deal’ and we feel that any such deal should be put to a shareholder voteT Rowe Price has a 3 per stake in Occidental and its plan to lodge a protest vote against the board comes a day after the oil company revised its bid for Anadarko to include a higher portion in cash.Because it will now need to issue fewer new shares, which dilute the ownership of existing investors, the deal has fallen below the threshold at which Occidental must seek shareholder approval.“Based on what we know now, we have significant concerns about the proposed deal,” John Linehan, portfolio manager at T Rowe Price, told the Financial Times on Monday. “Occidental’s management has characterised this deal as a ‘transformational deal’ and we feel that any such deal should be put to a shareholder vote.”He added: “Absent that, our only option is to register our displeasure through our proxy vote at the annual meeting. We feel that Occidental’s actions have left us no choice and our current intent is to vote against the board at the meeting.”Anadarko had initially rejected a $76-per-share offer from Occidental in favour of a lower proposal from Chevron for about $65 per share, because it feared that Occidental’s shareholders might vote against the transaction.Chevron has until May 10 to revise its $33bn bid or submit another proposal, failing which, Anadarko will have to pay a $1bn termination fee to the California-based company.As per rules of the New York Stock Exchange, where Occidental is listed, a company cannot issue more than 20 per cent of it stock without the approval of its investors, which would have been the case under previous proposals made by the oil company.Occidental has been able to change the terms of the deal after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway pledged $10bn to help Occidental finance the cash portion of the deal. Berkshire will get preferred shares that will pay an 8 per cent dividend, plus warrants to buy up to 80m shares of Occidental’s common stock.Mr Linehan had previously expressed his concerns about the Occidental-Anadarko combination in an interview with Barron’s, in which he said that T Rowe thought there was “significant execution risk with the Anadarko deal and it would increase Occidental’s financial leverage significantly as well”.The new deal terms will increase the cash component from about $19bn to about $30bn, putting further strain on Occidental’s balance sheet, with $11bn yet to be financed.If Occidental’s bid is accepted, French energy giant Total will acquire Anadarko’s assets in Africa for $8.8bn, including its liquefied natural gas projects in Mozambique and its oil developments in Algeria, Ghana and South Africa. The proceeds would help Occidental fund the overall deal.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said that if the bid had gone through under the earlier terms it would have left Occidental with “a weakly positioned investment grade rating”. Some analysts said that the new terms would increase the risk of a downgrade to junk status.
36;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-05-06T03:49:15Z;Occidental boosts cash portion of $55bn offer to buy Anadarko;Revised proposal would not require shareholder vote on bid for US shale producer;"Occidental Petroleum has changed the structure of its $55bn offer to buy Anadarko Petroleum, adding more cash in an attempt to boost its chances of winning a bidding war against rival oil giant Chevron for the key assets of the US shale producer.The Texas-based company said on Sunday that it had increased the cash portion of its $76-per-share offer to a level that would allow it to make a bid that does not require the approval of its shareholders. Under the new terms, the offer comprises $59 in cash and 0.2934 shares of Occidental common stock per share of Anadarko.“Our revised proposal does not require an Occidental shareholder vote, which has been repeatedly cited as the explanation for why you previously chose Chevron’s $65 offer over our $76 offer,” Vicki Hollub, Occidental’s chief executive, wrote in a letter to Anadarko. Anadarko shareholders are being offered 0.3869 shares of Chevron and $16.25 in cash for each share.Occidental has covered almost all of its additional cash offer with the promised $10bn investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway through preferred shares that will pay an 8 per cent dividend. In addition Berkshire has been given a warrant to buy up to 80m shares of common stock. The move is likely to anger many Occidental shareholders who oppose the transaction. Several have privately warned the company not to use Mr Buffett’s cash to deprive them of a chance to vote on the terms of the bid for Anadarko. Others have complained that the 8 per cent dividend reserved for Mr Buffett would put additional drain on Occidental's cashflow.“We think there is significant execution risk with the Anadarko deal and it would increase Occidental’s financial leverage significantly as well,” John Linehan, a manager at T Rowe Price Equity Income fund, told Barron’s last week. He added that T Rowe Price had “grave concerns if Occidental tried to avoid a shareholder vote”.In a statement on Sunday night, Anadarko said its board would “carefully review” Occidental’s new offer, but added: “The Chevron merger agreement remains in effect and accordingly the Anadarko board reaffirms its existing recommendation of the transaction with Chevron at this time.”Carl Icahn, the activist investor, has acquired a small stake in Occidental, according to Bloomberg, and people who have spoken to him recently said the New York billionaire was likely to oppose the transaction. The new deal terms, which increase the cash component from about $19bn to about $30bn, will increase the strain on Occidental's balance sheet. Under the previous terms, the net debt of the combined group would have been about $42bn, according to Jason Gammel, an analyst at Jefferies. Moody's, the credit rating agency, said that if the bid had gone through under the earlier terms it would have left Occidental with ""a weakly positioned investment grade rating"", and that the new terms would increase the risk of a downgrade to junk.The new terms make it even more crucial for Occidental, if it wins the bid battle, to achieve the hoped-for $3.5bn in annual costs and capital expenditure savings, and that oil prices do not slump.Occidental on Sunday night published earnings for the first quarter that showed a drop of 9 per cent, which was less than analysts had expected. Earnings per share for the quarter were 84 cents versus analysts’ average forecast of 73 cents. Revenue of $2.35bn was down 4 per cent, but production was up 18 per cent at 719,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Occidental’s revised deal terms followed an announcement by the company earlier on Sunday that it had agreed to sell Anadarko’s assets in Africa to French energy giant Total for $8.8bn. That sale agreement is conditional on Anadarko accepting Occidental’s revised terms. The provisional agreement to sell Anadarko’s African assets, which includes its liquefied natural gas projects in Mozambique as well as its oil developments in Algeria, Ghana, and South Africa, would help Occidental fund the overall deal. Occidental said the deal with Total would deliver on the majority of the $10bn to $15bn of planned asset sales. Total has said it is searching for more resources in Africa, where it has been historically strong, as the energy sector recovers after a multiyear downturn. It has largely bypassed a push into US shale, unlike other big majors, and has doubled down on conventional oil and gas development in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. “These are world-class assets with great upside, and we welcome the opportunity to leverage our expertise in LNG and deepwater developments,” said Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of Total. “We have worked successfully with Occidental for many years and we are committed to execute smoothly this transaction.”"
37;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-05-01T04:00:41Z;Warren Buffett’s Occidental deal is no ‘elephant’ but it helps;Berkshire Hathaway’s $10bn move is straight out of the investor’s playbook;"Warren Buffett is no longer waiting for Godot.After sitting on the sidelines for the better part of three years, the Oracle of Omaha has finally found a multibillion-dollar investment to plough some of Berkshire Hathaway’s $112bn cash into. Berkshire on Tuesday agreed to bankroll part of oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum’s $55bn hostile takeover of rival Anadarko Petroleum in the first major investment by the $700bn conglomerate since it bought Precision Castparts in 2016. The deal was seen as a coup for the billionaire investor and is expected to pay off handsomely for Berkshire. In return for $10bn, Occidental will issue Berkshire preferred shares paying interest of $800m a year for at least the next decade.The capital injection could give Occidental the means to win the backing of the Anadarko board by increasing the cash component of its bid, people familiar with the transaction said, finally seeing off its rival Chevron, which had tendered a lower offer.Another potential advantage: if Occidental switches the offer significantly to cash it will have to issue fewer new shares. That would allow it to avoid having to put the takeover to a vote of its shareholders.Having [Mr Buffett’s] backing gives a little tailwind to the bid because they have been viewed as a bit of long-shot in this processWith at least one major Occidental shareholder, T Rowe Price, already objecting to the deal, and because its shares have slid since news of its interest in Anadarko was revealed, securing shareholder approval may not be straightforward.Companies are required to hold a vote when they issue more than 20 per cent of their outstanding shares to fund a takeover. The Anadarko board wants to know with certainty that the takeover would not run into resistance. Chevron was able to provide that confidence; its stockholders are not entitled to a vote on the matter.“Having [Mr Buffett’s] backing gives a little tailwind to the bid because they have been viewed as a bit of long-shot in this process,” said Ben Tsocanos, a senior energy analyst at S&P Global.It will also provide the ballast should Chevron, which earlier this year had agreed to buy Anadarko for $50bn, counter with a higher offer.For Mr Buffett, the deal partly tackles a problem of what to do with the $100m that rolls into Berkshire Hathaway every day. The company has struggled recently to find what Mr Buffett calls “elephants”, the so-called mammoth deals such as BNSF, the railway, or NV Energy, the electric utility, that formed the core of present-day Berkshire. With Occidental, Berkshire will not exactly snare an elephant — it is not gaining management control — but an investment yielding 8 per cent a year looks good versus returns from a cash pile primarily held in low-yielding short-term Treasuries.Even though Berkshire has not focused on the oil and gas industry, the agreement with Occidental carries a hallmark of Mr Buffett’s most lucrative deals. He has made billions of dollars lending to companies in crisis or in desperate need of capital.During the financial crisis a decade ago, these included Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and General Electric. Companies including Dow Chemical and Wrigley have also turned to Berkshire when financing takeovers, as Occidental has.The preferred shares Mr Buffett often demands in these deals typically pay high dividends, far surpassing the dividends on offer on any of the stocks in Berkshire’s $173bn equity portfolio.For companies that take the money, it is often among the most expensive forms of capital. They are drawn to it, however, because it carries the Berkshire seal of approval, an asset that is impossible to value but that can calm investors’ or regulators’ nerves.“We are thrilled to have Berkshire Hathaway’s financial support of this exciting opportunity,” Vicki Hollub, the chief executive of Occidental, said when she announced the investment on Tuesday.And should Occidental’s stock price climb in the coming years, Berkshire could be handed another multibillion-dollar windfall from the warrants it has received as part of the deal. If Occidental shares return to their peak trading price over the past year, the warrants would add another $2bn in profit to Berkshire. The high price Occidental has agreed to pay Mr Buffett raised eyebrows across Wall Street because the company has previously had access to capital at a far cheaper price. Occidental paid 3 per cent on 10-year debt it borrowed in 2016. Those bonds currently yield 3.47 per cent, in a sign its borrowing costs have risen somewhat.The takeover of Anadarko would require adding debt of some kind, of course, and rating agencies have made it clear the deal would lead to a steep downgrade of Occidental’s credit rating. But even then, the $19bn it was expected to borrow for the acquisition was not foreseen costing 8 per cent.Preferred shares are viewed more favourably than debt by rating agencies, sitting between a company’s bonds and stock in its capital structure, but Mr Buffett’s investment is not likely to make a difference to the credit rating.S&P Global and Moody’s have both said that if the deal goes ahead, Occidental will probably be cut to triple-B, clinging on to its investment grade rating at one of the lowest rungs of the ratings ladder before a company is considered junk. Triple-B debt yields around 4 per cent, according to an index run by Ice Data Services.Dissident shareholders are not always successful in their campaigns. Wellington Management earlier this year sought to block Bristol-Myers Squibb’s $90bn takeover of rival Celgene, but ultimately lost its fight. Occidental is now waiting to see if other investors join T Rowe Price in its opposition to its deal. What concerns shareholders and rating agencies alike is the risk of a prolonged bidding war. The deal as currently structured would leave Occidental with net debt of about $42bn before it conducts planned asset sales. If the money from Mr Buffett tempts Occidental to raise its bid further, the company’s leverage and its cost of borrowing would be higher.“At the end of the day [Mr Buffett’s investment] doesn’t move the needle on any of the credit metrics, which are still very stressed,” said an analyst at one of the rating agencies covering Occidental. “If it leads to a higher price deal then I think we would view them as taking steps backwards.”"
38;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-04-30T17:38:15Z;Buffett backs Occidental bid for Anadarko with $10bn investment;Support comes after US oil group gatecrashed Chevron’s bid with $55bn offer ;Berkshire Hathaway has backed Occidental Petroleum’s ambitious $55bn bid for rival Anadarko Petroleum, pledging to invest $10bn to finance the deal, in a rare move by Warren Buffett into independent shale production.Berkshire has said that if the takeover goes through, it will invest $10bn in new Occidental preferred shares that will pay an 8 per cent dividend, and a warrant to buy up to 80m shares of common stock, about 11 per cent of its equity.Mr Buffett’s commitment was unexpected, because he has generally steered clear of the companies that have led the shale revolution. The deal would make Occidental the third-largest US oil production company, and reinforce its already strong position in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, heart of the US shale oil boom.Vicki Hollub, Occidental’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company was “thrilled” to have Berkshire’s support for its bid. Speculation that Mr Buffett would get involved rose after Occidental’s corporate jet was spotted in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, on Sunday.“We have long believed that Occidental is uniquely positioned to generate compelling value from Anadarko’s highly complementary asset portfolio,” Ms Hollub said. “We look forward to engaging with Anadarko’s board of directors to deliver this superior transaction to our respective shareholders.”Concerns about the cost of the financing, however, drove Occidental’s shares down about 2 per cent to $58.83 in early afternoon trading in New York.Anadarko is on course to accept the offer from Occidental, which gatecrashed its previously agreed $50bn sale to Chevron. At Tuesday’s prices, Occidental’s 50/50 cash-and-shares offer was worth about $74 per Anadarko share, while Chevron’s was worth just $63, with a lower cash component.Anadarko said on Monday that its board had “unanimously determined” that Occidental’s offer would probably be deemed superior to the Chevron deal.However, its bid has raised concerns about the effect on the company’s borrowings, both to finance its offer and as a result of taking on Anadarko’s debt. If entirely debt financed, the deal would leave the merged group with net debt of about $42bn, more than three times its cash flow from operations, according to Jason Gammel, an analyst at Jefferies.Moody’s, the rating agency, warned last week that it expected to downgrade Occidental from A3 to “a weakly positioned investment grade rating” if the acquisition went through.The 8 per cent dividend that Berkshire will receive on the preferred shares looks like expensive financing compared with Occidental’s 10-year bonds, which yield about 3.4 per cent.The warrant to buy Occidental shares has a strike price of $62.50, meaning that it would be in the money after only a modest rise in the shares from their level on Tuesday.Matthew Portillo, an analyst at investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt, said he had been “lukewarm” about the prospect of the Anadarko acquisition boosting Occidental’s earnings and cash flows, even before the announcement of the financing.The cost of the preference shares, he warned, “might eat into some of the free cash flow accretion from the transaction”.He added that if Chevron were to return with a bid pitched at about $73 a share, it would probably be able to win control of Anadarko, because it could make a better case for synergies and had a stronger balance sheet.
39;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-04-30T10:00:25Z;Occidental’s Hollub shows her radical side in fight for Anadarko;Chief’s stance on climate change raises prospect of big additional pay-off in the long term;When Vicki Hollub was starting out in her career in the oil industry in the early 1980s, one of the few women working on the rigs in Mississippi and Louisiana, she helped establish herself through her command of data. Specifically, data on US college football teams playing in the Southeastern Conference, the SEC, which include her own alma mater, the University of Alabama.“I was an avid football fan,” she told a conference at Columbia University this month. “I knew just about every statistic there was for any team playing in the SEC. So I had a way of talking and connecting with the men I was working with, out on location and on the rigs.”Almost four decades later, as chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, she is making the bet of her career on another set of numbers: the data on the performance of Anadarko Petroleum’s US shale operations.Ms Hollub last week launched a bid for Anadarko with an enterprise value of about $55bn, roughly 15 per cent higher than the $48bn valuation given by the deal that its board agreed with Chevron earlier in the month. If she succeeds with that bid, which looks increasingly likely given the higher value of Occidental’s offer, she is going to need to achieve a sharp improvement in the performance of Anadarko’s operations to justify the price.The bid is an ambitious move that fits with what is emerging as a characteristic of Ms Hollub’s leadership: her defiance of expectations. In her plan to transform the company, and in her embrace of action to address the threat of climate change, she has been a much more radical leader than seemed likely when she took over at Occidental three years ago.When her appointment was announced in 2015, there was a widespread sense in the industry that Ms Hollub would be a steady if unexciting chief executive who would bring stability to the company after some turbulent years. Tensions between Ray Irani, chairman, and Stephen Chazen, chief executive, had flared out into the open in 2013, and after a boardroom battle and a shareholder vote Mr Irani was forced out. A long-serving insider — she joined Occidental in 1982 — with a measured and undramatic personal style, Ms Hollub looked like the safe pair of hands the company needed.A lot of people thought that this was a diversity hire, just a PR stunt. They sure know different now“She is unpretentious and thoughtful. There’s no chest-pounding,” said one industry observer. “She doesn’t need to assert herself. She’s a very smart, confident person.”That style has led some in the industry to underestimate Ms Hollub, according to another person who knows her. “A lot of people thought that this was a diversity hire, just a PR stunt,” he said. “They sure know different now.”The performance of Occidental’s shares, which were at about $75 when Ms Hollub took over, and are about $60 today, has been unremarkable. But the company’s operational performance, especially in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, has been more impressive. On average, Occidental’s shale wells in the region have produced 74 per cent more oil in their first six months than Anadarko’s.Michael Wirth, chief executive of Chevron, sniped at that record last week, saying “some operators” put too much emphasis on impressive-looking early results, and missed the fact that “short-term production is not the goal”. Even so, Occidental seems to be doing something right. Over 2016-18 its cost per barrel in New Mexico dropped 23 per cent.Meanwhile, Ms Hollub has been staking out a distinctive position for Occidental on the question of climate change. As many of her peers in the US oil industry have dragged their feet, Ms Hollub has been outspoken about the need to address the threat, and has set a goal of making Occidental “carbon neutral”: capturing greenhouse gases equivalent to the emissions created by its operations and its products.“We feel like that’s the key to [the] sustainability of our business over time,” she told the Financial Times last month. “If you don’t have that, you almost don’t need to be in operation.”Occidental has for a long time been a specialist in enhanced oil recovery, using carbon dioxide injected into wells to increase production. Ms Hollub spotted the opportunity in deploying that expertise to derive a double benefit: storing carbon dioxide in oil reservoirs to reduce emissions while also boosting output.Last year Occidental was one of the first US companies to join the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, an international industry group that works on ideas for cutting emissions. Ms Hollub’s decision that Occidental should join is widely credited with having provoked ExxonMobil and Chevron into signing up as well.Julio Friedmann, an expert on carbon capture at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said there were solid business reasons for her to support action on climate change.“There is no greenwashing involved,” he said. “She is genuinely committed to reducing the carbon footprint of the company’s products and operations, and also committed to shareholder value.”If governments put a price on emissions, so that Occidental can be paid to take the carbon dioxide that it uses for enhanced oil recovery, the economics of its operations would gain a massive advantage. In the long term, that could mean a huge additional pay-off from the Anadarko assets.Ms Hollub has talked about the inspiration she has drawn from the University of Alabama’s highly successful football team, known as the Crimson Tide. The point was to win not just single games, but a national championship, she told Forbes magazine in 2017. “It’s a culture and an attitude of not settling.” She is about to have to demonstrate how far she can live up to that ideal, not just by securing victory in the battle for Anadarko, but by making the deal pay off.
40;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-04-30T04:00:35Z;All greased and oiled up, Anadarko looks set to ditch Chevron;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.One thing to start: Not one to be left out, WeWork’s parent company has filed paperwork to go public, joining the numerous highly valued, privately held tech companies pursuing a stock market listing. Here’s the full story by the DD team.Unsolicited takeover bids, by their very nature, can be difficult to pull off. Why? It takes two to tango. Target companies, particularly in the US, have a plethora of tools to block unfriendly bids, ranging from poison pills to creating governance structures that give a few shareholders the power to thwart unwanted approaches.Of late, though, the bully seems to be gaining the upper hand by appealing to shareholders of the target.The latest example where this strategy paid off is in the $55bn battle for Texas-based Anadarko Petroleum.On Monday, Anadarko said it had restarted talks with its rival Occidental after its board determined that the latest cash-and-stock offer would probably be deemed superior to the deal it agreed with Chevron two weeks earlier.Quick recap:— Early April: Chevron and Occidental both submit bids to Anadarko. Occidental’s initial bid is rejected on the view that the value of the stock component of its bid is less certain than Chevron’s, according to people familiar with the matter.— Week of April 8: Occidental twice lifts the cash component of its bid, but does not hear back from Anadarko, sources said.— April 12: Anadarko announces it has struck a deal to sell itself to Chevronfor $63 a share in a primarily stock deal.— April 24: Occidental publicly makes an unsolicited offer to buy Anadarko for $76 a share. The deal is now split evenly between cash and stock. The price represents a 21 per cent premium to Chevron’s deal. — April 29: Anadarko said it was restarting talks with Occidental over a potential deal.What next?Chevron could come back with a higher offer but as things stand that’s unlikely to be the case, according to DD’s well-informed sources.This change of heart could come at a steep cost for Anadarko. The company will have to pay $1bn to Chevron if it reneges on the deal.Did Anadarko’s board handle the situation badly?Some shareholders are wondering why Anadarko rushed into a deal with Chevron.Anadarko believed that Chevron was a better suited buyer despite a potentially higher bid from Occidental whose initial offer — when the talks were still private — was mainly in stock, sources said. At that time, Anadarko’s board had determined that Chevron’s shares were more valuable in the long term.Once the deal between Anadarko and Chevron was announced, Occidental tabled a new bid with a lot more cash — 50 per cent — which has clearly grabbed their attention. The higher bid will probably relieve any pressure on the Anadarko board.Lex’s take on this is that some shareholders may not even stick around to see how it plays out. Anadarko shares are 55 per cent higher than where they were trading three weeks ago, so the bidding war presents a good opportunity for jittery Anadarko investors to sell now and cash in early.Senior managers at Germany’s Bayer face an uphill battle to restore investor trust after a majority of shareholders voted to back a no-confidence motion against the board at last week’s annual meeting.Such votes are extraordinarily rare but they carry no legal consequence — raising the question of how exactly chief executive Werner Baumann should respond.A brief reminder that Baumann was the mastermind of the company’s $63bn takeover of US agribusiness Monsanto — a takeover that has subsequently unleashed a series of problems for the aspirin-to-crop chemicals group and ravaged its share price. Bayer’s market value has fallen more than €30bn since August.Stepping down from his job is apparently not an option Baumann is considering. He enjoys the full support of Bayer’s supervisory board (for now), and even shareholders who backed the no-confidence motion have made clear they don’t want a change at the top at such a volatile moment.Neither is it clear how much appetite there is among shareholders for radical steps such as a break-up of the group in separate pharma and crops businesses — a move that Bayer has in any case ruled out repeatedly. Hedge fund Elliott is lurking in the company’s share register.DD gets the feeling a public break-up campaign is coming sooner rather than later. If Bayer is forced into a split by its investors, the irony will be that part of the reason why Baumann did the Monsanto deal was to make sure Bayer was safe from a takeover by predators and keep the whole company together.Ultimately, both Bayer and its critics know that the group’s battered shares will only recover if and when the first glyphosate-related legal cases in the US start going its way. And with more than 13,000 cases pending and the first verdict going to appeal only now, that could be a very long wait indeed. That’s what will make the difference for Baumann’s future.

But it’s important to remember that the free-form expression art that is SoftBank doesn’t always destroy value. In fact, it’s around precisely because sometimes Son’s wild bets actually turn out amazing (see Alibaba).But the money is now also starting to flow the other way as the FT’s Kana Inagaki and Siddarth Shrikanth write here.They report: “Armed with cash from the $23.5bn listing of SoftBank’s mobile unit and Japan’s largest-ever corporate bond sale to retail investors, and with Uber’s blockbuster IPO around the corner, Mr Son is finally starting to dispel the notion that his Japanese technology conglomerate is risk-addicted and debt-laden. So flush is Mr Son feeling that he launched a $5.5bn share buyback in February.”That helps explain some of the recent positive share price performance at SoftBank, helping to relieve some of Son’s frustration that his company is not fairly valued by investors.With Uber, Slack and now WeWork looking to list shares, it looks like some of the major US technology companies SoftBank or its near-$100bn Vision Fund have backed will have an opportunity to sell down shares.But it’s not all good news for SoftBank. Its US telecom business Sprint is desperate to merge with larger rival T-Mobile USA as performance continues to weaken. If that deal gets blocked by US regulators, all this good news for SoftBank may be undone.Sign up here to Market Forces, our daily analysis of what’s moving global marketsAndrew Mitchell, a conservative MP and former UK Cabinet minister, has been hired as an adviser at private equity firm Arch Emerging Markets Partners.

41;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-04-29T17:44:58Z;Anadarko bidding war: no-fault break-up;Shareholders can realise a huge premium without delay;In mergers and acquisitions there is no need to wait for the formalities of divorce. On Monday, Anadarko Petroleum confirmed the obvious: it would consider Occidental Petroleum’s unsolicited cash and shares bid for it. Anadarko has yet to officially terminate its signed deal with Chevron. That looks like a formality, however. The Oxy bid is not only at a 21 per cent premium to Chevron’s deal, the former has also offered more cash.Should Chevron bow out and get a $1bn termination fee, questions will naturally arise as to why Anadarko hurried to sign a lowball deal with Chevron. Probably Anadarko believed Oxy’s shares were deemed too risky to hold. But the size of the premium Oxy has offered is difficult for Anadarko’s board to ignore. For the skittish Anadarko shareholder, a bidding war presents a good time to sell.Anadarko on Monday traded at $73 per share. The downward drift in Chevron shares means its deal is worth less than $62. Even after a decline in Oxy’s share price on the day, its offer, over half in cash, is worth nearly $75 per share. Oxy says that it can support a higher bid as it has identified $3.5bn of annual cash savings, nearly double what Chevron has publicly stated.Anadarko’s prize is its vast portfolio in the Permian Basin, the most productive shale oil deposit in America. Both Chevron and Oxy have existing assets there. But Oxy claims a bigger and more complementary position. That means more costs to cut.Oxy needs those benefits to materialise. Its enterprise value of $53bn is below its implied transaction value for Anadarko. If Oxy’s projections are correct, then it will create immense value for both sides’ shareholders. Anadarko holders would own 29 per cent of the new group.But Anadarko shares sit a full 55 per cent higher than where they traded less than three weeks ago. Its shareholders can get a juicy premium, all in cash. No need to wait, then, accept the inevitable and move on.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

42;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-04-29T16:34:14Z;Anadarko set to accept $55bn offer from Occidental;US oil and gas group expects to endorse rival’s latest bid over agreed deal with Chevron;Anadarko Petroleum is on course to accept a $55bn takeover offer from its US rival Occidental Petroleum, which gatecrashed the previously agreed $50bn sale to oil major Chevron. Texas-based Anadarko said on Monday that its board had “unanimously determined” that Occidental’s latest cash-and-stock offer would probably be deemed superior to the deal agreed with Chevron.“The Occidental proposal reflects significant improvement with respect to indicative value, terms and conditions, and closing certainty as compared to any previous proposal Occidental made to Anadarko,” the company said in a statement.If Anadarko endorsed the Occidental offer it would be a rare win for a hostile bid. Anadarko acknowledged last week that it had received a new unsolicited offer from Occidental, weeks after it had rejected takeover advances from the group. Occidental, one of the five largest US oil and gas production companies, offered to pay Anadarko shareholders $76 a share, a 22 per cent premium to the bid from Chevron, which is worth roughly $63 per share. The bid from Occidental was evenly split in cash and stock. Chevron offered to pay $16.25 in cash and 0.39 of its own shares for each Anadarko share outstanding. Anadarko has agreed to pay Chevron $1bn if it backs out of the deal.It is unclear whether Chevron will increase its offer. However, people with knowledge of the oil major’s thinking have previously said it is unlikely to enter a bidding war. Chevron refused to raise its bid when it heard Occidental had offered more than $70 a share for Anadarko earlier in the process.Chevron on Monday indicated it was standing by its previously agreed deal. “We believe our signed agreement with Anadarko provides the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko’s shareholders,” it said in a statement.The Chevron-Anadarko agreement became the subject of scrutiny from US regulators on Monday, with the Security and Exchange Commission filing an order to seize assets of unnamed traders who purchased call option contracts — the right to purchase shares at a pre-agreed price — in Anadarko in the weeks leading up to the Chevron deal.In a lawsuit filed in a federal court in Manhattan, the SEC said they sought the seizure as part of an “insider trading case involving one or more unknown traders” who made $2.5m in “illicit profits” by investing in Anadarko before their shares rose as a result of the Chevron bid.“Defendants’ purchases of the Anadarko calls were highly suspicious, timely, and lucrative,” the SEC alleged in the suit, adding that the investors placed their trades through accounts in the UK and Cyprus.Occidental’s deal would give it assets in the Gulf of Mexico, a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and production in the DJ Basin of Colorado. But the real prize is Anadarko’s shale acreage in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the heart of the US oil boom. Occidental is already a large producer in the Permian region, and argues that the application of its production techniques and the fit with its existing infrastructure means it can save $3.5bn a year in operating and capital costs by combining its operations with Anadarko’s.“This is much more synergistic for us than any other company that might look at this,” Vicki Hollub, Occidental chief executive, said last week.Occidental’s interest emerged within minutes of Anadarko announcing its sale to Chevron on April 12, but analysts warned at the time that they did not see how Ms Hollub could outbid her larger rival. Ms Hollub has promised to sell assets worth up to $15bn if a deal is agreed, in part to win backing from Occidental shareholders who must sign off on the deal. Occidental is expected to try to offload Anadarko’s deepwater operations and its LNG project, which do not fit with Occidental’s existing businesses.Additional reporting by Kadhim Shubber in Washington
43;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-04-25T06:56:14Z;Occidental snubs hostile takeover boutiques in Anadarko bid;Oil group turns to its well-connected BofA and Citi bankers in Houston for its $55bn bid;"When Bank of America and Citigroup turned up at the side of Occidental Petroleum for its hostile bid for Anadarko Petroleum, Wall Street dealmakers were not surprised. Occidental has forged close relationships with both banks, particularly Bank of America, where it has regularly poached high-level talent.But its decision to stick with its longtime bankers rather that tap one of the legion of boutique hostile takeover specialists is a break from some recent high-profile fights; gold miner Barrick, for example, hired Michael Klein and his namesake advisory firm M Klein & Company, for its failed bid for rival Newmont while hedge fund-backed newspaper group MNG Enterprises turned to Ken Moelis’ Moelis & Co for its hostile bid for USA Today-owner Gannett.It is also a reflection of how Occidental has approached the deal — at first hoping to strike a friendly merger before being outmanoeuvred by oil giant Chevron — and how symbiotic its relationship has become with Bank of America, where it has repeatedly relied on high-level talent as part of its strategic decision-making.The job for bankers at BofA and Citi, a team that includes some of the most well-connected advisers in Houston, will be to snatch Anadarko from Chevron’s hands after a takeover was agreed two weeks ago. The price Occidental has offered is $55bn, including debt it would assume as part of the takeover. The eventual price paid could be higher. Chevron is loath to engage in a bidding war, people with knowledge of the company’s thinking said. But it may nonetheless turn up at the bargaining table so it does not lose highly prized US shale oil assets as well as a natural gas project in Mozambique and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico that Anadarko owns.The fight could be brutal and would rank as one of the largest hostile takeovers struck over the past decade if Occidental comes out on top.BofA’s leading role in advising Occidental can be traced back to one of the driving forces behind the transaction: Oscar Brown, a former BofA oil and gas banker, who joined Occidental in 2016 with a mission to help the company’s chief executive Vicki Hollub carry out a transformational deal. $200bnThe value of acquisitions advised on by former Bank of America executive Oscar BrownMr Brown has worked on more than $200bn of transactions as a dealmaker and is “quirky, bright and very aggressive”, a person close to him said. The bid for Anadarko would be the most audacious of his career, the person added. But the BofA relationship dates back far before Mr Brown’s hiring though: former Occidental chief executive Stephen Chazen worked on oil deals when he was a managing director with Merrill Lynch, which was acquired by Bank of America during the financial crisis. Ms Hollub and Mr Brown have been steered by Patrick Ramsey and Purna Saggurti, the co-head of global mergers and acquisitions and chairman of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America, respectively. The two men have been joined by Brad Hutchinson, who co-head’s the bank’s Americas energy investment banking department and whose team last year advised on the $10.5bn sale of BHP’s shale assets to BP. The trio of Bank of America bankers are also flanked by a pair of Citigroup executives: Stephen Trauber and Mark Shafir. Mr Trauber, who is well known in Houston and sponsors a regional travelling basketball team, counts oil refiner Valero among his clients. Al Walker, Anadarko’s chief executive, worked with Mr Trauber when the two were at UBS. Mr Trauber would go on to seal Anadarko’s largest takeover: its $18bn purchase of Kerr-McGee in 2006.While Mr Shafir has not specialised solely in energy deals — he is the global co-head of M&A at Citi — his work on a number of high-profile transactions will prove valuable to Occidental. Mr Shafir led Citi’s work advising chipmaker Broadcom on its attempted takeover of rival Qualcomm, a deal that was ultimately blocked by US president Donald Trump, as well as the reverse merger that saw Dell go public late last year.The Occidental board also counts a former Citi executive among its ranks. Carlos Gutierrez, who joined the Occidental board as a director in 2009, was previously vice-chairman of Citi’s institutional clients group.If Occidental is successful in its bid, Bank of America and Citi will be in line for a lucrative payday. Dealogic estimates fees on the deal could reach $170m, which will be split with the advisers to Anadarko. Another $100m-plus could be earned to finance the transaction, should Occidental tap corporate bond markets to fund the cash portion of its offer. Bridge financing would add millions more in fees. The deal would also represent a significant win for the two banks, as US rivals such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have worked to solidify their hold on the advisory business. Citi and Bank of America have ranked either fourth or fifth in global M&A advisory assignments in each of the past four years, according to Dealogic. While still early in the year, the work for Occidental could help Citi claw back market share and edge itself into the top three for the first half of 2019.On the competing side Chevron is being advised by some of Wall Street’s best known dealmakers. That includes Credit Suisse’s Greg Weinberger, an adviser to some of the world’s largest energy groups, and Scott Barshay, a partner at Paul Weiss, who has advised General Electric, IBM and Harris Corporation on deals worth a total of nearly $100bn in recent months. Both Chevron and Occidental have found veteran Evercore energy bankers Dan Ward and Will Hiltz, together with Goldman Sachs’ head of natural resources Suhail Sikhtian, sitting at the opposite end of the negotiating table with Anadarko.The Anadarko board must now decide if the bid from Occidental is superior to the deal it has agreed with Chevron, and then whether or not to engage with Occidental. Anadarko’s advisers have been studying their next move after Occidental submitted two offers and never heard back from its target."
44;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-04-25T00:02:05Z;Occidental grasps at Permian Basin prize with Anadarko bid;$55bn offer exposes balance sheet risk as US oil companies battle for assets;Assets in the Permian Basin are the US oil industry’s equivalent of the Iron Throne in the TV show Game of Thrones: they are the prize that everyone covets. Occidental Petroleum, already the largest holder of drilling rights in the Permian region, on Wednesday made its play to expand its territory, launching a hostile $55bn bid for Anadarko Petroleum, in an attempt to break up the agreed $50bn takeover by Chevron that it had announced on April 12.The contest is likely to be won by the side that is the most effective in convincing shareholders that it would be the best owner of Anadarko’s Permian assets.For Vicki Hollub, Occidental’s chief executive, the bid was a characteristically bold move, and a challenging one. She has to make the case for the deal not only to Anadarko’s investors, but also to her own. Under the terms of its offer, which is 50/50 cash and shares, Anadarko’s shareholders would end up with about 29 per cent of the combined company, and a deal that size requires investor approval.The ambition of the bid, which would make Occidental the third-largest US oil production company, fits with Ms Hollub’s reputation, according to Robin West, managing director of the Center for Energy Impact at the Boston Consulting Group.One of very few women holding senior roles in the industry, she has also stood out with her support for action to address the threat of climate change, setting a goal for the company ultimately to cut its net carbon emissions to zero.What we want people to understand is that the value by far is in the development of shale. This is much more synergistic for us than for any other company“She thinks big about climate change and the company’s licence to operate,” Mr West said. “And she also thinks big about her strategy for the company.”Initially, analysts’ and investors’ reactions to her interest in Anadarko indicated they thought her ambition had gone too far.Reports of Occidental interest in Anadarko emerged just minutes after the announcement of its agreed takeover by Chevron. The news immediately hit Occidental’s share price, which then continued to decline, slipping 7 per cent between April 11 and Tuesday. Paul Sankey, an analyst at Mizuho, described Occidental’s bid as “a very bad idea”, adding: “Nobody really supports what they are doing.”One key concern for investors is the impact on Occidental’s balance sheet. Its offer is half in cash, and it would also take on Anadarko’s borrowings, raising the net debt of the combined group to $42.3bn, or more than three times its annual cash flow from operations, according to Jason Gammel of Jefferies.Occidental intends to cut that debt burden by selling $10bn-$15bn of assets, and Anadarko has plenty of operations that it would be happy to offload, including deep water oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico and a liquefied gas export project in Mozambique, neither of which fit well with Occidental’s existing businesses.But if oil prices were to collapse again, that debt burden could become a serious problem. Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said on Wednesday it was putting Occidental under review for a possible downgrade.If the bid succeeded, Moody’s said, “a multiple notch rating downgrade should be expected”, with the company likely to emerge “with a weakly positioned investment grade rating”.In the face of these worries, the onus is on Ms Hollub to show that the deal makes sense. Her pitch is based on what she says Occidental can do with Anadarko’s assets in the Permian Basin, the thumping heart of the US shale oil boom.Chevron said it expected quickly to achieve synergies of $2bn a year from savings on operating costs and capital spending across all of Anadarko’s operations. Occidental said it could save $3.5bn a year, essentially all coming from the Permian Basin.“What we want people to understand is that the value by far is in the development of shale,” Ms Hollub told the Financial Times. “This is much more synergistic for us than for any other company.”She has some evidence on her side. Occidental’s record in the Permian is impressive: it has drilled 4 per cent of the wells in the basin, but 23 per cent of the top 100 wells with the highest production in their first six months.Andrew Dittmar of Drillinginfo, a research firm, said Occidental could be “justifiably proud” of its achievements in the region, and it was reasonable for Ms Hollub to think she could improve the performance of Anadarko’s assets.However, he said, Chevron could also expect to do better than Anadarko, which has not been among the top tier of operators.Moreover, Chevron “does have some more natural overlap” of its assets with Anadarko’s in the Permian region, even though Occidental’s are also close, he added. Chevron also owns the mineral rights for some of the areas where Anadarko has leases, meaning it will have lower total costs for developing those areas.In short, Mr Dittmar concluded, the case for Occidental obviously being the best owner for Anadarko’s assets is not as clear-cut as Ms Hollub suggests.Anadarko on Wednesday afternoon issued a statement saying its board would “carefully review Occidental's proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company's stockholders”. If Occidental’s offer remains significantly higher than Chevron’s, it will be difficult for Anadarko’s directors not to recommend it.Persuading Occidental’s shareholders to support the deal, however, still looks like it will require some work. By the close of trading on Wednesday, Occidental’s shares were down just 0.6 per cent on the day at $62, suggesting some of investors’ initial consternation could be wearing off.But backing Ms Hollub would be a big bet on her and on the sustained success of the Permian Basin, which would be jeopardised by another oil price crash. In takeover battles, as in Game of Thrones, what looks like victory can often expose you to greater risk.
45;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-04-24T18:04:05Z;Anadarko/Occidental: shale storm;Anadarko has a dilemma on its hands;The most entertaining moments of The Bachelor or Bachelorette reality series is not when the betrothed are chosen. Rather it is when the jilted awkwardly refuse to accept their fates and try to get another shot. That dynamic is now playing out in Texas oilfields as Anadarko Petroleum suddenly has to weigh the overtures from Occidental Petroleum. On Wednesday it gatecrashed Anadarko’s sale to Chevron with a $55bn bid. There may be a bidding war for Anadarko with its shareholders eventually emerging as the biggest winners. Still there are real questions about the company’s process in picking a partner.The nominal value of Occidental’s bid is $76.00 per share, half in cash and half in stock. The deal signed with Chevron two weeks ago was at a value of $65 per share, 75 per cent in stock (implying an enterprise value of $50bn). Occidental in a letter to the Anadarko board said it had made three acquisition proposals for the company. It accused it of not even responding to the last one, just before accepting the Chevron proposal. The rub of the competing bids is, of course, just how Anadarko feels about the prospects of each suitor’s shares since so much of the consideration is to be paid in stock.Chevron said it believed it could generate $2bn in operating expense and capital expenditure savings. Occidental has upped the ante, talking about $3.5bn in cash synergies. These are just numbers on a page but what is clear is that Occidental, which has an $54bn enterprise value, takes on more financial risk as it is levering up its balance sheet. Occidental shares in the one year before the Chevron/Anadarko deal was announced were flat while Chevron shares were up a tenth.Of even more concern to Anadarko shareholders is that Occidental shares have dropped nearly a tenth, as rumours of Occidental’s interloper bid have circulated in the last two weeks.Occidental wonders why Anadarko agreed a $1bn termination fee in its Chevron deal. While not unreasonable, it becomes an impediment for any counterbid. The good news is that there is plenty of time for topping bids to emerge and shareholders will ultimately make the decision. But whatever one makes of Occidental’s paper, its bid is at a sharp premium. That would have deserved more attention before a termination fee complicated the calculus. Unfortunately, blockbuster M&A unfolds quickly and is unscripted, unlike some reality television.
46;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-04-24T15:22:10Z;Occidental launches $55bn hostile bid for Anadarko;Attempt to stop takeover by Chevron as battle over prized US shale assets intensifies;Occidental Petroleum has launched a hostile $55bn bid for Anadarko Petroleum, in an attempt to stop its planned acquisition by Chevron, starting a takeover battle for highly prized US shale oil assets.On Wednesday morning Occidental, one of the five largest US oil and gas production companies, announced it was making a cash-and-shares offer worth $76 per Anadarko share, a premium of roughly 22 per cent over the value of the bid from Chevron.The decision to go hostile came after Anadarko spurned two offers from Occidental earlier this month and plumped for Chevron’s lower bid. In a strongly worded letter to Anadarko’s board, Vicki Hollub, Occidental’s chief executive, said it was “surprised and disappointed” that directors had rejected its proposals two weeks ago.The Chevron cash-and-shares offer was worth about $63.50 per Anadarko share at Wednesday’s market prices.Occidental’s intervention raises the prospect that there could be a bidding war for Anadarko. However, Chevron is seen as unlikely to attempt to offer more than Occidental, as its board is uncomfortable with taking on further risk, according to two people close to the company. Chevron has already refused to raise its offer once, when it was told by Anadarko that Occidental was offering “more than $70 per share”.We think the bid is a very bad idea. So does pretty much absolutely everyone we talk toAnadarko’s board rejected the offer from Occidental on the grounds that there was too great a chance that the deal could not be completed, people familiar with the situation have said.The offer made public on Wednesday was split 50:50 between cash and Occidental shares. The Chevron deal had a higher share component, with just $16.25 in cash.In a bid to win over the Anadarko board, Occidental twice raised the cash portion of its offer, first lifting it to 40 per cent of its offer and then to 50 per cent.But Occidental never heard back from Anadarko after its initial bid — made before the deal with Chevron was signed — had been rejected, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Ms Hollub wrote in her letter to Anadarko’s board that it was “unfortunate” that they had agreed to pay a $1bn break fee in the Chevron deal, “without even picking up the phone to speak to us after we made two proposals during the week of April 8 that were at a significantly higher value to the transaction you were apparently negotiating with Chevron”.Occidental will need to secure approval from its investors for the deal, and had been talking to some of its top 20 shareholders over the past week in an effort to shore up support, said a person briefed about the meetings. Ms Hollub said on a call with analysts that she was “highly confident” that she would be given the backing she needs. She later told the Financial Times that when the company had spoken to a few large investors on Wednesday morning to explain the details of its plan, the reaction had been “OK, we get that now”.However, the initial market reaction was to send Occidental’s shares lower. Soon after the market opened they were down about 4 per cent at $59.81.Paul Sankey, an analyst at Mizuho, wrote in a note: “We think the bid is a very bad idea. So does pretty much absolutely everyone we talk to.”Jason Gammel of Jefferies wrote that the deal could be “highly accretive” to Occidental’s cash flows next year, but warned: “We do expect the company is more susceptible to an oil price downturn until such time as the balance sheet is brought into better condition.”Occidental plans to sell $10bn-$15bn of assets if it succeeds in taking over Anadarko, to reduce its borrowings, and Ms Hollub said it had already been fielding calls from potential buyers. One asset that looks likely to be up for sale is Anadarko’s Mozambique project to export liquefied natural gas, a sector in which Occidental has no assets or expertise. Anadarko’s assets in the Gulf of Mexico are also likely to be sold.Like Chevron, Occidental has focused on the appeal of Anadarko’s assets in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the heart of the US shale oil boom.Ms Hollub said the critical factor for making a success of the deal would be the efficient development of those shale assets, which would require a total investment of about $150bn.“We are the best performer in the Permian Basin, and we have the ability to execute on this development . . . better than anybody else,” she said.
47;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-03-20T05:00:41Z;Chief aims for Occidental Petroleum to be ‘carbon neutral’;Shale producer pins hopes on enhanced oil recovery using captured greenhouse gases;"In the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the racing heart of the US shale oil boom, there is generally not too much soul-searching about the implications for the climate of their production. The availability of truck drivers and pipeline capacity for transporting the oil to market are much more pressing concerns.Occidental Petroleum, the fifth-largest US oil group by market capitalisation and the holder of the largest net acreage of drilling rights in the Permian, is an exception.Like its rivals including ExxonMobil and Chevron, Occidental is one of the key participants in that production boom. In the past three years it has more than doubled its Permian shale output, and it expects to double it again to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the next five years. But at the same time, the company is committed to reducing its carbon footprint.“I’m thinking about the long term for our shareholders,” Vicki Hollub, Occidental chief executive, told the Financial Times in Houston.“We believe if you’re not addressing these [climate] issues today, you’re going to be behind the game.”Ultimately, she wants Occidental to be “carbon neutral”: capturing greenhouse gases equivalent to all the emissions arising from its operations, its supply chain and the use of the oil and gas that it produces.“We feel like that’s the key to sustainability of our business over time,” she said. “If you don’t have that, you almost don’t need to be in operation.”The way Ms Hollub plans to square that circle is by using carbon dioxide that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere from factories and power plants. Injecting the gas into oil reservoirs helps squeeze out more crude, a practice known as enhanced oil recovery or EOR, and it leaves the carbon dioxide underground rather than in the atmosphere.The technique is already well-established for “conventional” oil produced from vertical wells. Occidental has been running pilots of EOR in horizontal shale wells, and Ms Hollub describes them as “technically successful”.Now the company is working on a plan for a full-field development using EOR for shale in the Midland Basin, on the eastern side of the Permian, which could start production in 2021.We want to be the company that’s producing the last barrel of oilThe basic arithmetic looks appealing, in terms of both production and emissions. Occidental estimates that today it is extracting about 11 per cent of the oil in place in its shale reserves; Ms Hollub hopes EOR can raise that to 17 or 18 per cent. At the same time, each molecule of oil produced releases less carbon dioxide when burnt than was injected into the reservoir to extract.The company still faces some formidable challenges, however, in scaling those successful pilots up to a full oilfield. “There is a vast amount of shale,” Ms Hollub said. “To make it work, [being] able to design the surface facilities and infrastructure needed to do that is key.”Standard EOR uses carbon dioxide from natural sources, extracted by drilling wells. To have a positive impact on emissions, Occidental needs to use carbon dioxide created by human activity. In November it invested in a company called Net Power, which is developing an innovative gas-fired power generator that emits a pure stream of carbon dioxide suitable for EOR. It is also exploring plans for sourcing carbon dioxide from industrial facilities including ethanol and steel plants.A big problem is that centres of industry and population with factories and power plants tend to be a long way from the oilfields in the wide open spaces of west Texas. As Ms Hollub admits: “A very long pipeline is going to be needed.”However, carbon capture, use and storage is one of the few climate-related technologies that has been able to win support from Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration, and government support could make Occidental’s plans viable.Reform of a tax credit known as 45Q last year created a benefit of $35 per tonne for carbon dioxide captured and used for applications including EOR. “That really made it possible for us to start to put this strategy together here in the United States,” Ms Hollub said.Further legislation, called the “Use It” act, which includes a range of measures intended to expedite the construction of carbon-dioxide pipelines, has been making progress in Congress with bipartisan support.Ms Hollub said: “With the combination of those two things, this becomes certainly an economic venture for us.”As she acknowledges, using carbon dioxide for EOR “can’t be the whole solution” for the climate threat. The world simply does not have enough suitable oil reservoirs for all the greenhouse gases that it emits.Still, Ms Hollub argues that to achieve the Paris climate agreement goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures to “well below” 2C, using carbon dioxide for EOR is one of the technologies that “has to happen”.It is also, she adds, essential for the future of Occidental. “We’re here for the long term,” she said. “We want to be the company that’s producing the last barrel of oil. And that barrel of oil has to be from CO2-enhanced oil recovery, because that’s the lowest emission barrel possible.”"
48;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2019-01-09T12:33:18Z;Chevron and Occidental invest in CO2 removal technology;Canadian start-up is able to capture CO2 from the air and use it to make synthetic fuel;Oil majors Chevron and Occidental Petroleum are taking a minority stake in a Canadian start-up that has developed technologies to suck carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and use it to make synthetic fuel.The deal marks the first significant investment by energy groups into the technology, known as direct air capture, which pulls carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by using chemicals and fans.Carbon Engineering, a Bill Gates-backed start-up based in Squamish, British Columbia, said the new investment was part of a $60m fundraising round that would help it design and build commercial-scale plants. The company has not disclosed its valuation.The investment comes at a time when the oil and gas industry is racing to find ways to reduce carbon emissions while also maintaining its core business model, producing and selling fuel. Part of the answer could be “negative emissions”, which refers to a range of technologies that reduce the level of carbon dioxide in the air.“Negative emissions are increasingly essential in the various scenarios for how we address climate change,” said Steve Oldham, chief executive of Carbon Engineering. “It’s infeasible that we all stop using fossil fuels overnight.”Unlike more traditional methods of carbon capture, which rely on pulling carbon dioxide out of a smokestack or from close to the source of emissions in an industrial process, direct air capture sucks carbon dioxide from the air.The process has long been thought to be too expensive to be deployed on a large scale, but a paper published last year in scientific journal Joule using data from Carbon Engineering’s pilot plant suggested it could cost as little as $100 a tonne of carbon dioxide extracted.Carbon Engineering also uses carbon dioxide to produce synthetic fuels that can substitute for gasoline, jet fuel or marine fuel and be used in the same engines without modification, according to the company.Even though these fuels produce carbon dioxide when burnt, they are considered low-carbon fuels because they are made using carbon dioxide that came from the atmosphere in the first place.The investment in Carbon Engineering is only the second public deal made by Chevron’s Future Energy Fund, following its investment last year in ChargePoint, an electric vehicle charging company.“We are interested in looking at innovations around carbon capture,” said Barbara Burger, head of Chevron Technology Ventures. The fact that Carbon Engineering uses carbon dioxide to make synthetic fuels is an area of particular importance, she added, pointing to Chevron’s significant downstream business.Occidental said it was particularly interested in exploring atmospheric carbon extraction to complement its enhanced oil recovery operations, which inject carbon dioxide into old wells to maximise their production.

50;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2018-09-20T14:02:40Z;Exxon and Chevron join industry climate change group;Companies have come under pressure from investors on efforts to address global warming;ExxonMobil and Chevron, the two largest US energy groups, have joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a group of companies supporting curbs on greenhouse gas emissions.The move is the latest sign of how pressure from the public and investors is forcing the industry to address the threat of global warming.Occidental Petroleum, the Texas-based oil group, is also joining the initiative, which was launched in 2015 with European companies including Royal Dutch Shell and BP making up most of its members.The new arrivals mean OGCI members provide about 30 per cent of global oil and gas production.Exxon and Chevron declined to join the initiative when it started but both companies have since changed their chief executives. Darren Woods replaced Rex Tillerson at the head of Exxon at the start of 2017 and Michael Wirth replaced John Watson at Chevron in February.The companies have come under pressure from investors to disclose more about the potential implications for their business of policies to limit global warming. They have also faced legal action from US states and cities over their contribution to the harm caused or threatened by rising global temperatures.Mr Wirth said that Chevron was joining the OGCI “to work constructively on addressing the risks of climate change”.Mr Woods said developing affordable solutions to address the threat would “take the collective efforts of many in the energy industry and society”.He added that Exxon’s mission was to meet a dual challenge, “to supply energy for modern life and improve living standards around the world while minimising impacts on the environment”.Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of Total, the French oil and gas group that was one of the initiative’s founder members, said on Twitter that the addition of the three US companies to the initiative “gives us more impact to lead the industry’s response to climate change”.Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in the Clinton White House, said that concerns over legal liability are a key reason why the oil majors are joining the climate group now.“When you begin to see the cost of extreme weather events to the public and private sector made worse by climate change, I think you are seeing big oil palms sweat,” he said. “Congress appropriated $130bn last year in emergency appropriations, that is real money.”With the oil groups now publicly committed to curbing greenhouse gas emissions, it could also provide a political boost for advocates of a carbon tax, whose proponents include former Fed Chair Janet Yellen as well as several Republican members of the House of Representatives.Members of the OGCI, which include Saudi Aramco and China National Petroleum Corporation, agree to support the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, which set an objective of keeping the increase in global temperatures since pre-industrial times to “well below” 2C.They also each contribute $100m to the initiative’s investment fund, which puts money into technologies including carbon capture, utilisation and storage, reducing methane leaks from their operations, improving energy efficiency and cutting emissions from transport.“Industry innovation and collaboration have a critical role to play in addressing climate change, and Occidental is excited to join OGCI’s efforts to create a lower-emissions world,” said Vicki Hollub, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum.She described Occidental as “the industry leader” in using captured carbon dioxide to improve oil recovery from reserves, adding that the technology “has the potential to help achieve global goals for reducing emissions”.
51;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2018-06-10T23:01:24Z;Legal & General to step up activism over climate change;Asset manager to vote against chairman of companies slow to tackle global warming;Europe’s second-largest fund manager will vote against reappointing the chairmen of eight global companies, including Occidental Petroleum, Subaru and China Construction Bank, in protest at their slow progress in moving to a greener economy.In a sign of how investors are worried about the impact of global warming on their returns, Legal & General Investment Management said its £5bn Future World fund range would also sell out of the companies over their response to climate change.Across the rest of its funds, the UK-based asset manager said it would use its vote at annual meetings to signal its frustration with the chairmen of the eight companies, which include food retailer Loblaw Companies, utilities business Dominion Energy and financial and logistics company Japan Post.The British fund manager is best known for its passive funds, which track an index, meaning it cannot easily decide to sell in and out of holdings.“There has been a lot of conversations about climate change,” said Meryam Omi, head of sustainability and responsible investment strategy at LGIM. “But the speed and urgency hasn’t been in place and we wanted to inject that. We have a real chance to tackle this issue.”“We wanted . . . an impactful way of changing company behaviour and making sure everyone steps up,” she said.Investors are becoming concerned that measures to tackle global warming could leave some companies nursing large losses. A study led by academics from the University of Cambridge this month warned that by 2035 a decline in demand for fossil fuels could leave them falling sharply in value. It forecast that between $1tn and $4tn could be wiped off the global economy in fossil fuel assets alone.In 2015, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, also warned that investors faced “potentially huge” losses from climate change action. The Pope warned major oil company heads on Saturday that there was “no time to lose” to address the “challenge of epochal proportions” in global warming.Last year, LGIM wrote to more than 80 of the world’s largest companies across sectors it believed were most exposed to climate change, including energy and banks.It said three-quarters of the companies contacted responded to its initial letters. But others failed to engage, including China Construction Bank and Rosneft Oil.LGIM criticised Occidental for the US oil and gas group’s absence of plans to report total emissions, as well as its lack of ambitious carbon targets, while it said Japan Post and Loblaw had either zero or poor climate disclosure. It said Sysco Corp, the food retailer, lacked a climate change policy.It added that Dominion Energy, China Construction Bank and Subaru scored badly in several categories it used to rank companies’ preparedness for climate change, including business strategy.China Construction Bank, Dominion, Rosneft, Loblaw, and Subaru did not respond to a request for comment. Japan Post could not be reached for comment.Occidental did not comment on LGIM’s decision, but it had “positive engagements” with its shareholders while developing its 2018 climate report. “We are continuing to progress our strategy and focus to be a global leader in CO2 emission reductions through geologic sequestration and believe our engagements are critical to our success.”Sysco also gave no comment on the fund house’s decision but said it took its “responsibility as a good corporate citizen” seriously. “We have a long standing commitment to energy and waste management and sustainable agriculture practices, with continual enhancements to the programmes,” it said.LGIM praised food manufacturer Nestlé for its clear, public statements on climate change. It also commended Equinor, the Norwegian group previously known as Statoil, for publishing its total emissions, French oil major Total for its “2 degree strategy” and miner BHP Billiton for disclosing the earnings impact of various climate change scenarios.
52;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2018-05-02T04:00:43Z;Scepticism over ‘value’ comeback despite energy surge;Investment strategy gains are over-reliant on one sector, reflecting little broader shift;Energy shares were the top US market performers over the past month but the move has not been enough to renew faith that “value” investing is on the way back.The S&P 500 value index nudged ahead of its “growth” investing counterpart during April, with gains of 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively.But analysts were nonetheless reluctant to declare a shift in market dominance between the two diverse styles of investing — the gains in April were not supported by other key sectors considered to be classic value plays.Value investors look for companies trading at a discount to their future cash flows or break-up value while growth investing entails buying companies that offer the hope of above-average growth but often trade with a larger price tag.“Value is working but not because of any macro investor preference for cheap stocks,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek. “Rather, it comes down to sentiment about energy stocks and the near-term direction of oil prices.”The energy sector gained more than 9 per cent in April to lead the S&P 500. Energy companies account for 12 per cent of the S&P 500 Value index, only second to financials at 25 per cent.Investors embraced the shares of energy companies with Andeavor (being bought by Marathon Petroleum), Newfield Exploration, Valero Energy, Occidental Petroleum and Pioneer Natural Resources among the top performers in the S&P 500 in April.“At the same time I had the energy story, I had industrials falling and financials were flat,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank.“Given the size of financials within the value groups, it is financials that have to move to have a sustained rotation from growth to value,” he added.Financial shares fell 0.5 per cent in April and industrials lost 2.9 per cent. Tech eked out a 0.03 per cent rise.Consumer staples, which make up 11 per cent of the value index, were the worst performers in April, dragged down by losses at stocks of Philip Morris, Kraft Heinz and Procter & Gamble.Value beat growth in March as well, and six out of the past 12 months based on S&P 500 indices, but remains a long-term laggard in performance to growth.“Value in a broad sense has been underperforming for over a decade,” said Tim Edwards, managing director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It is not supposed to guarantee returns in the short term but people have begun to question how much patience do you need.”Sharp gains for the shares of high-growth technology companies, particularly a handful of large groups known as the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) have helped to propel growth investing styles in recent years.But tech shares have stumbled this year on concerns about privacy and heightened regulation.Tech accounts for 41 per cent of the S&P 500 growth index, while energy is also in the index but accounts for just 0.3 per cent.
53;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2017-10-15T04:43:32Z;BlackRock and Vanguard’s climate change efforts are glacial;The engagement excuse on global warming is wearing thin, writes Attracta Mooney;BlackRock, a large investor in companies that rely heavily on fossil fuels, does not seem a likely environmentalist.But one year ago, the world’s largest asset manager issued a stark warning about global warming. “Investors can no longer ignore climate change,” said the fund house, which oversees $6tn in assets.The New York-listed company argued that even if one did not agree with the science, investors could not disregard the “swelling tide of climate-related regulations and technological disruption”. Investors, it said, needed to act to protect their portfolios.Yet just a few months later, BlackRock appeared to forget its own warning. Throughout the year to June 2017, the fund house repeatedly voted against resolutions at annual general meetings that called on companies to provide more clarity about how they might be affected by climate change.According to Proxy Insight, the data provider, BlackRock voted against so-called scenario-planning climate change resolutions, which are typically put forward by shareholders and often not supported by management, at 14 oil and gas companies, including Southern Company, Noble Energy and Hess. It backed the measures at just two, the big oil majors ExxonMobil and Occidental.In most cases, the resolutions asked that companies annually assess how they might be affected by measures to limit temperature rises to 2C, in line with the 2015 Paris agreement.BlackRock is not alone in its inconsistent voting. JPMorgan and Vanguard, which have also warned of the risks posed by climate change, failed to back resolutions at 14 companies, but supported them at two. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-largest fund house, supported resolutions at eight oil and gas companies, abstained at five and voted against at three, according to Proxy Insight.This patchy record makes little sense. If a fund house believes climate change could hurt stocks over the longer term, it seems sensible that investors should demand as much information as possible on these risks at all companies.Investors with inconsistent records typically explain the difference in their voting record as “engagement”. Big investors often speak to management privately during the year, and particularly before AGMs, and will try to use their influence to change company policy behind the scenes.This is BlackRock’s explanation for its voting record. It says it takes “climate change seriously and engages with relevant companies”.“We do vote for shareholder proposals on climate when we think our engagement has not led to the change we seek,” BlackRock told FTfm. “We don’t decide how to vote based solely on our views on the issue under consideration. Our vote reflects our assessment of the company’s response to our engagement in light of the long-term financial impact.”But almost two years after the Paris agreement, the excuse of engagement is wearing thin. Climate change will not just affect a few, it has the ability to alter entire sectors radically. And secret discussions will not drive the sector-wide disclosure that is required.As Carolyn Hayman, who co-chairs Preventable Surprises, a lobby group, says: “We are talking about systemic risk from climate change that will effect the whole economy worldwide. [Investors] have a fiduciary duty to understand this.“A case-by-case approach doesn’t get the sector-wide change that is really needed. No one but the people engaging can know what the impact of engaging is. [This] requires a top-down approach rather than company by company.”The climate change issue is here to stay. Even with the US withdrawing from the Paris agreement, governments show few signs of slowing down their drive to limit global warming — including France and the UK, which will both ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040.Investors will of course continue filing resolutions at a wide variety of companies over climate change. But it is now up to the world’s biggest investors to put their vote where their mouth is. A couple of high-profile protest votes that generate nice headlines is no longer good enough.As Ms Hayman says: “A lot of investors are very concerned and are voting against management in really large numbers [on climate change resolutions]. It’s time for Vanguard and BlackRock to get with the project.”Attracta Mooney is the FT’s investment correspondent
54;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2017-10-01T16:19:29Z;Top investment groups push for action on climate risks;BlackRock and others demand disclosure at US energy companies, analysis shows;Large investment groups including BlackRock and Vanguard have stepped up pressure on US energy companies to address the risks associated with climate change, despite the Trump administration’s lack of action to address the threat.An analysis of shareholder votes at this year’s annual meetings showed investors have taken a more active role in pushing for information on climate risks, often voting for improved disclosure against company board recommendations. In votes at seven of the largest US energy companies this year, the 30 largest investors switched their votes to support disclosure on climate risk a total of 38 times, having opposed similar resolutions in 2016, according to ShareAction, a campaign group. The data come from regulatory filings compiled by Proxy Insight, an information service. The increasingly assertive position taken by large investors had its most significant impacts at ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum, two of the largest US oil groups. There was majority support for proposals calling on the companies to publish regular reports on the possible impact on their businesses of policies to address the threat of climate change. In both cases, BlackRock and Vanguard, the world’s two largest fund managers, voted to support the proposals. Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Standard Investments, the largest active manager in the UK, said the group backed motions calling for climate-related disclosure because it wanted to “encourage greater ownership of the risks of climate change at board level”. As an index investor, you can hold all the companies in your portfolio to the same standard. You don’t need regulationState Street Global Advisors has been one of the most active large fund managers in pushing boards to take account of climate change. Rakhi Kumar, its head of environmental, social and governance investments, said that with holdings in about 10,000 companies worldwide, the group could have a very broad influence. “As an index investor, you can hold all the companies in your portfolio to the same standard. You don’t need regulation,” she said. Many investors have been stepping up their engagement with companies over climate change, generally seeking more transparency on the potential risks to earnings. BlackRock, for example, identified climate risk disclosure as one of its five investment stewardship priorities for 2017-18. However, there have been some wide variations in fund managers’ votes on climate-related issues. In “key climate votes” this year as assessed by the 50/50 Climate Project, another group that works with investors on the issue, BlackRock voted for relevant proposals 9 per cent of the time and Vanguard 15 per cent, compared to 61 per cent for State Street. BlackRock said its approach was to “engage primarily through direct dialogue but [we] will exercise our right to vote against management recommendations where we do not see sufficient progress.” Ms Kumar at State Street said the group used both “vote and voice” to persuade boards to assess climate risk. Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 Climate Project, said he expected investors to seek better explanations from fund managers when they decide not to support climate-related resolutions. “Large fund managers with poor voting records on climate risk can expect public challenges on the dichotomy between their engagement priorities and voting practices,” he said.Demand side remains wedded to fossil fuels / From Carolyn Hayman, London, UK

At the peak of the oil boom, Chinese state-owned firms’ willingness to pay far more than other bidders for oil deposits and mines was legendary, as executives answered Beijing’s political goal of guaranteeing energy security with direct investments in natural resources, writes the FT’s Lucy Hornby.Since then the steady slide in oil prices to below $50/bbl has left many of those Chinese purchases deep in the red. Sinopec has suffered operating losses of $550m over the past three years on Argentine assets purchased from Occidental Petroleum in 2011 for $2.45bn, according to an internal company audit.At oil prices of $60/bbl or less Sinopec stands to lose $2.5bn over the life of the project, the audit found. As of the end of 2015, with prices hovering below $40/bbl, projected losses reached $2.9bn. It was first reported by respected Chinese magazine Caixin this week. Sinopec said on Friday that rather than being “a slap in the face” the audit served the function of a “woodpecker” in identifying problems.“At the moment, the Argentine project has met some difficulties in its operation. However, overseas oil and gas mergers and acquisitions are very complicated and high-risk deals,” the statement said. “No one would have thought that the oil price could drop from more than $100/bbl to $40/bbl.”The company disputed the $2.5bn loss projection, saying: “What if the oil price picks up again soon?”Sinopec’s Hong Kong-listed arm reported an operating loss of Rmb21.9bn on its upstream oil and gas business in the first half of this year, although better returns from refining and marketing kept it profitable overall. It reduced crude production by 11 percent in the first half due to lower prices.About two years ago Sinopec began an internal review of its overseas acquisitions to figure out which were profitable at lower prices. The process has revealed that it spent billions for underproducing fields in Angola, among other issues. Its rivals have also run into difficulty with expensive assets, including CNOOC’s oil sands in Canada, and very low production for China National Petroleum Corp’s controversial investments in South Sudan amid renewed conflict there.Additional reporting by Luna Lin and Benedict Mander"
57;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2016-08-28T16:27:59Z;Cost reductions help US shale oil industry pass first real test;Companies respond to price plunge with dramatic cost-cutting;The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote, “That which does not kill me makes me stronger.” It could be the motto of the US shale industry.Ever since the shale boom started, there have been critics arguing that it was all too good to be true. Sceptical analysts warned that the industry would collapse like a house of cards if oil and gas prices fell.This summer has brought the strongest evidence yet that they were wrong. Since prices began to fall two years ago, some shale producers have wilted, and dozens have folded. Many others, however, have been tempered by adversity. The second-quarter earnings statements from US exploration and production companies earlier this month showed some remarkable cost reduction numbers — not aspirations, but achieved results. Pioneer Natural Resources said it had reduced its production cost per barrel by 26 per cent since last year. Devon Energy said costs were down 40 per cent from their peak.Some of the fall came from lower prices in the supply chain. Pioneer’s contracts for steel tubes and cement ran out last year, and its new contracts cost 30-35 per cent less.Other cost reductions arose from internal innovations in well design, drilling and completions. EOG Resources, for example, is saving money by running drilling and cementing operations on multiple wells at the same site simultaneously. Continental Resources said it had cut the time needed to drill a well in the “Stack” shale oil area of Oklahoma by 44 per cent since last year.The cost cuts achieved by driving down suppliers’s rates could be reversed in a recovery, as staff, rigs and pumps for hydraulic fracturing are put back to work. Dave Lesar, chief executive of Halliburton, the oilfield services group, argued last month that its businesses serving US shale producers “will likely be the first and deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages”.But savings achieved through efficiency gains will be permanent. Vicki Hollub, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, told analysts that about 80 per cent of its savings in the Permian Basin of west Texas came from improved well design and drilling techniques, lower materials costs and enhanced logistics.The savings mean that US shale reserves, which a few years ago were in the upper-middle section of the global cost curve, now include some of the world’s lowest-cost sources of new oil, according to Wood Mackenzie, the research company.Meanwhile, the view that shale production will always need a sustained inflow of capital is fading, as companies cut spending to live within their means. In the second quarter, 58 leading E&P companies covered by Bloomberg reported total capital spending that was just $2.7bn greater than their operating cash flow, compared to a $9.7bn deficit in the equivalent period of 2015.Falling costs have made it possible for activity to rise even as spending has shrunk. As Mr Lesar puts it, the industry is “getting back to business”.Last week there were 316 rigs drilling the horizontal wells used for shale oil, up 68 from the low point in May, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group.This increase has come even though US crude has never been above $52 per barrel though that time, and at one point was below $40.In 2015, the recovery in rig use had a false start. It got going when US crude was about $60 per barrel and evaporated as oil slipped lower in the second half of that year. The cost cutting done since then means that this year’s upturn is more likely to be sustained.The pressure on costs and capital spending remains intense. US crude production dropped by 800,000 barrels per day between April 2015 and May 2016, and is still in decline. Companies including Marathon and Continental have indicated that US crude needs to recover to about $60 before they would be happy to make the investments they need to increase production. Pioneer and EOG, which are projecting robust growth at prices around $50, are unusual.However, the fall in US oil output is now gentler than seemed likely in the spring. Some companies, including ConocoPhillips, Continental and Pioneer, have even raised their guidance for expected production.The shale oil industry, born at the end of the last decade, has still not yet been through a complete cycle of rise, fall and recovery. With no precedents, there was inevitably uncertainty about how it would respond, and that has not been dispelled completely. But the industry has now faced its first real test. So far, it is passing.ed.crooks@ft.com

Oil and gas producers are big winners on the index this year, up 12 per cent — propelled by higher energy prices.Oil is on track for its biggest monthly gain in seven years with both West Texas Intermediate and Brent, the international benchmark, up over 20 per cent in April.Prices have rebounded from below $27 per barrel in the early weeks of the year — a 13-year low — on hopes that falling US production will help counter the ongoing oversupply and high crude oil inventories.Exxon, the world’s fourth-largest company by market capitalisation, released first-quarter results on Friday. Revenues were down 28 per cent while earnings fell 63 per cent year on year.The declines were less than expected and shares rose 1.9 per cent to $89.77, before closing up just 0.5 per cent at $88.45. Exxon’s shares were already up this week, despite the downgrade by Standard & Poor’s of the company to AA+.Market sentiment did improve when the US major showed restraint in increasing its dividend by just 3 per cent, the smallest rise in nearly a decade.In contrast, Chevron doubled expected losses.

59;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

For much of the industry, though, the outlook has hardly brightened at all.The North American shale boom of the past decade was driven by real technological progress but also a rapid accumulation of debt. Now the boom has gone but the debt remains, and it will hang over the sector for many years to come.Oil and gas: Debt fears flare upRosneft runs to stand still amid oil crashSaudi Arabia loses oil market share to rivalsUS crude has risen from about $26 a barrel in February to about $37 on Monday. Over the same period, the S&P 500 exploration and production companies index has increased about 23 per cent, and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch high-yield energy bond index has risen 26 per cent.For many US oil and gas companies, however, financial pressures are still growing. Hedges that helped support revenues are being used up; banks are expected to reduce many companies’ borrowing facilities in the round of reserves revaluations now under way, and bond markets have been closed for all but the strongest groups.The rebound in oil makes a big difference to some companies and not much difference at all to many others, according to Jeff Schlegel of Jones Day, the law firm.“There are companies where the price could go to $50 and it still wouldn’t help,” he says.In mid-2014, as US oil prices began to fall from a peak of $107 a barrel, the industry had a cost structure and a debt burden that were manageable if crude stayed at about that level. Since then, production expenses have been driven down as companies have struggled to stay afloat. Productivity has kept rising, and service companies’ profit margins have been crunched.Chesapeake Energy, for example, told investors at a conference last month that it had cut the cost of drilling a well in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas from $5.9m in 2014 to an expected $4.2m this year. Every other company has a similar story.The process of restructuring the industry’s debt burden, however, is only just beginning.Steven Woods of Moody’s, the credit rating agency, says the entire US oil industry is under financial stress with prices at today’s levels.“At $40, the industry doesn’t work,” he adds. “Companies can’t earn an adequate return on capital.”Some companies, though, are more stressed than others. It is no coincidence that the four US exploration and production companies that sold bonds in the first quarter were some of the largest and most secure in the sector: Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Anadarko Petroleum and EOG Resources.There have also been 17 US oil and gas producers that have held share offers this year, raising a total of $10.6bn, the second-highest tally of any quarter on record, according to Dealogic. They were typically ones with assets that have attractive long-term potential, including Pioneer Natural Resources, with its shale position in the Permian Basin of west Texas.Those companies with access to the capital markets may be able to hang on and wait for the eventual upturn. But many do not have that option. The gulf between the stronger and the weaker companies is widening.“The longer this goes on, the more you will see companies either filing for bankruptcy or selling all their assets,” says Dewey Gonsoulin of Bracewell, the law firm.Last week brought another string of companies approaching default on their debts. SandRidge Energy, an Oklahoma-based gas producer, said it had hired advisers to look at a possible bankruptcy, and warned there was “substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern as it is currently structured”.Privately-held Chaparral Energy said it was considering bankruptcy, Ultra Petroleum missed a $26m interest payment and Goodrich Petroleum said it would enter bankruptcy as part of an agreed restructuring.Attempting to avoid the same fate, US oil and gas companies cut their capital spending by about 40 per cent last year on average, and are planning for a further 50 per cent reduction this year.The number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the US has dropped 77 per cent since September 2014, falling a further 14 last week to 450, the lowest level since the data were first collected in 1940.As a result, US oil production has started declining, too. The drop has been modest but it is expected to continue through the year. Although there are a few exploration and production companies still forecasting growth in 2016, most expect their output to fall.When the oversupply in the global oil market that has been depressing prices finally ends, and crude starts to rise again, more US production will become commercially attractive once more. A price of $60 a barrel looks like a critical level in terms of stimulating a revival in drilling. Occidental told investors recently that just 14 per cent of its potential shale well locations in the Permian Basin would be economic to drill with oil below $50 a barrel, but 40 per cent would be viable below $60.The rate at which those potentially profitable opportunities are drilled will depend on how much money companies have to spend. For now, the inflow of new capital from private equity is sluggish.Merger and acquisition activity, which could reallocate assets to companies that have the financial resources to develop them, has also been slow, dropping to its lowest quarterly level for at least a decade.Bitter experience, including the shortlived rally in crude prices in the first half of last year, has taught investors to favour caution.“Growing for growth’s sake worked in a world of $100 oil. It doesn’t work now,” says Brad Carpenter at Cantor Fitzgerald.Espen Erlingsen of Rystad Energy, a consultancy, says the guiding principle among the shale companies now is to cover their capital spending from their cash flow.To stabilise total US production and stop it falling, oil would need to be about $40 to $50 a barrel, he adds. To go back to the boom years of 2012-14, when the US was adding about 1m barrels a day of additional supply every year, oil would need to be more than $80.The shale revolution will not be reversed; in fact, the technology is continuing to advance. But every revolution needs to be followed by a period of consolidation, and this one is no different. The high-growth period of the industry’s history is over, perhaps for a long time.This is the fourth part of a Financial Times series entitled Oil: Lower for longer, looking at the consequences of the prolonged decline in crude prices."
61;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2016-02-03T00:58:53Z;Standard & Poor’s cuts ratings of US oil and gas groups;Chevron hit and shale producers are downgraded to junk;Standard & Poor’s has cut the credit ratings of some leading US oil and gas companies, including Chevron, the country’s second largest, as a result of the agency’s lowered expectations for long-term crude prices.The decisions show how the plunge in oil and gas since the summer of 2014 is hitting not only the highly indebted exploration and production companies that borrowed to finance their growth during the US shale boom, but also the more financially conservative independent companies and even the large international oil groups Chevron and ExxonMobil. Three leading shale oil and gas producers, Continental Resources, Southwestern Energy and privately held Hunt Oil, were downgraded from investment grade to “junk” status. Exxon, the largest US oil group and one of only three companies in the country with an AAA status, was put on watch for a possible downgrade of the rating. S&P said it would decide on Exxon within 90 days.The moves follow the agency’s announcement last month that it would be using lowered long-term oil and gas price expectations to calculate ratings. Its new projection is that both international benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate crude will average $40 this year, $45 next year and $50 from 2018 onwards. In December 2014, S&P was using a long-term Brent price assumption of $85. The agency said on Tuesday that the scale of the reduction in its price expectations meant that even investment grade companies were affected. It added that it expected many of those companies to continue to cut capital spending and raise their productivity, but “these actions, for the most part, are insufficient to stem the meaningful deterioration expected in credit measures over the next few years”. The agency said it would assess Exxon’s “financial policies and strategies for mitigating the potential impact of the downturn”, as well as look at its 2015 results. Exxon reported a 50 per cent drop in earnings for 2015, a smaller decline than for rivals Chevron and BP, and is cutting capital spending sharply, but its net debt rose by $10.6bn during the year to $35bn as it borrowed to pay its dividend. Ratings for Chevron as well as EOG Resources, Apache and Devon Energy, three large independent oil and gas producers, were cut but remained investment grade. Ratings for Hess, Marathon Oil and Murphy Oil, three other leading independent US exploration and production companies, were cut to BBB-, also still investment grade but just one notch above junk. ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, was also put on watch for a possible downgrade within 90 days. S&P said this would depend on the company’s ability to achieve cost savings and asset sales, and to cut capital spending without hurting production rates. There was good news for four others, however: Occidental Petroleum, EQT, Cimarex Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources were affirmed at investment grade ratings. The moves follow S&P’s announcement on Monday that it had cut Royal Dutch Shell’s rating by one notch to A+ from AA-, and put a negative outlook on other large European oil companies including BP, Statoil and Total.Yields on investment grade energy bonds, which move inversely to their price, have climbed rapidly as oil tumbled over the past year, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The yield on the US bank’s energy index had risen to 5.36 per cent on Tuesday, more than 1.9 percentage points above its low last April. The spread of the yield on the energy index above US government bonds has widened to its highest level since the country started to emerge from recession in 2009.
62;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2016-01-26T15:30:23Z;Phibro bought by former Wall Street banker;Simon Greenshields’ Energy Arbitrage Partners acquires commodities trading brand;"A former Wall Street banker plans to resuscitate what was once the most powerful name in global commodities trading: Phibro.A partnership founded by Simon Greenshields, previously global co-head of commodities at Morgan Stanley, has acquired the Phibro LLC name and what remains of its business from Occidental Petroleum after its operations wound down last year. He declined to disclose terms.“Phibro at one point was the largest physical commodity merchant in the world,” Mr Greenshields told the Financial Times. “It was a fantastic business that they built. We think the roots are strong. We think we can go back and we can get their business back on track and return Phibro to a position of strength.”Established in 1901, Phibro for decades had a fearsome presence in markets from crude oil to cocoa. In 1980, Phibro’s $23.7bn in revenue ranked it the 15th largest US company. The following year it bought Salomon Brothers, the investment bank that became part of Citigroup.Citigroup sold Phibro to Occidental in 2009 amid controversy over a potential $100m pay award to its star oil trader and erstwhile chief, Andrew Hall. Phibro lost $10m as its trades were being wound down in the first quarter of 2015, an Occidental securities filing showed. Occidental said the acquirer “purchased any and all use of the Phibro name”.Mr Greenshields left Morgan Stanley a year ago after more than three decades at the New York investment bank. He helped build Morgan Stanley into half the reigning commodities “duopoly” on Wall Street, alongside Goldman Sachs. In its best year, 2008, the Morgan Stanley commodities group generated about $3bn in revenue for the bank, according to a report by a US Senate committee.Several banks including Morgan Stanley have shrunk commodities operations in the face of regulatory pressure and disappointing returns.“Our strategy is acknowledging the fact that the banks are constrained; the products and services are not as comprehensive as they once were; that there’s a void. And we’re seeking to fill that void,” Mr Greenshields said.We think we can go back and we can get their business back on track and return Phibro to a position of strengthEnergy Arbitrage Partners, started by Mr Greenshields, has acquired Phibro’s name and also its intellectual property, information technology, customer base and historical data.The new Phibro would initially focus on North America, controlling assets such as fertiliser plants, biodiesel refineries and “virtual pipelines” of containerised energy shipping.The company, to be based in Stamford, Connecticut, would then pursue trading and marketing opportunities around these assets.Mr Greenshields said he was in discussions with investors to add capital to the venture, but declined to disclose them. He and his partners follow others who have left commodities desks at Wall Street banks to develop private merchant businesses such as TrailStone, led by former Deutsche Bank traders, and HudsonField, established by a former Goldman Sachs oil derivatives head.The Phibro venture comes after commodity prices crashed to the lowest levels in more than two decades. Mr Greenshields said Phibro intended to trade around the relative values of commodities, such as prices for oil in different places, rather than make up or down bets.“I think the opportunity today is probably the best I’ve seen for the kinds of things that we want to do, and what we want to do with the Phibro name. We want to return Phibro to its merchant roots,” Mr Greenshields said."
63;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2015-04-27T13:49:58Z;Oil companies seek lasting cost cuts after crude price plunge;Drive for reduced bills from suppliers and better tax deals with governments;"As oil companies grapple with the consequences of the plunge in the value of crude over the past nine months, some are coming to a paradoxical conclusion: they may be better off when prices are low than when they are high.This response to a 45 per cent drop in the price of their principal product might sound delusional. Oil has always been a business for optimists, but there are genuine reasons for the leaders of large international oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Total and BP to feel positive about the outlook.The crude price crash has unleashed a concerted push by oil companies to reconfigure their own organisations, and reset relationships with suppliers and governments.Above all else, there is a new found vigour to cut companies’ costs. When oil prices were high and rising, being cost-effective became less of a priority than making sure that the oil would keep flowing. Not any more. “The industry was chasing barrels; now it’s chasing efficiency,” says Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of IHS, the research group.If oil rebounds to, say, $80 per barrel, the companies could be more profitable than they were when it was $110.Even when crude was at those higher levels the financial performance of the large international oil companies was unimpressive.The average return on capital of the largest European and US oil companies dropped from 21 per cent in 2000 to 11 per cent in 2013, even though the average price of benchmark Brent crude rose from $29 to $109 per barrel over that period. Cost increases more than offset the rise in revenues.Under pressure from dissatisfied investors, big oil companies had begun to take steps to tighten capital discipline and improve returns even before last summer. The collapse in oil prices has galvanised those efforts.Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of France’s Total, told the IHS CeraWeek oil industry conference in Houston last week: “We have to take this challenging period as an opportunity to clean up our industry.”In Total’s case, that means lowering the price level at which revenue covers costs from $110 to $70 a barrel.Mr Pouyanné says the whole company understands the importance of what they are doing. “It’s much easier, I can tell you, to mobilise at $50 per barrel than it was last year at $100 per barrel,” he adds. “Sometimes the executive committee had the impression we were not totally listened [to]. Today I am.”Other companies are undertaking similar exercises. Stephen Chazen, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, told the same conference: “You’ve got to be able to survive not just at $60, but maybe less.”The simplest way for oil production companies to cut their costs is paying less to their suppliers. The large companies have been calling in all their suppliers, demanding cuts in rates, and the pressure on service companies is being reflected in large job cuts, with 20,000 going from Schlumberger, 10,500 from Baker Hughes and 9,000 from Halliburton.More fundamentally, companies are changing the way they design and run their projects to make them more efficient.Project costs can be significantly reduced by measures such as maximising the use of standardised designs, says Christian Brown, president of oil and gas at SNC-Lavalin, the Canadian engineering group.Eldar Saetre, Statoil’s chief executive, says the company is working with its suppliers to develop standardised equipment for use on the seabed, which could be put down like modular blocks.Total says that in its case the focus on costs has already started to pay off. Last year it planned a project called Kaombo in the deep water off the coast of Angola, budgeted at about $12bn to $13bn. When the bids came in from contractors, the cost had soared to $20bn, but following an “intensive optimisation exercise”, Total managed to get that back to $16bn. That was more than it had originally hoped, but low enough to give the project the go-ahead.Other companies have also been “recycling” projects, in the industry jargon: delaying them for reappraisal and seeing if they can be delivered at a lower cost.BP last month won some of the regulatory approvals it needs for a revised lower-cost version of its planned Mad Dog 2 development in the Gulf of Mexico, a joint venture with BHP Billiton and Chevron.Another shift in oil companies’ favour is that some countries are offering them better treatment to attract investment.The UK government last month announced a sharp cut in taxation on North Sea oil and gas profit, reversing a rise introduced in 2011. Iraq’s government has said it plans to revise its contracts with foreign oil companies to make the terms more attractive.There will be lags, lasting years in some cases, before the effects of all these changes work through. They will not last for ever, either, says Kaam Sahely of Vinson & Elkins, the law firm. “You lock in rates for a period, and then as the market recovers there will be creep,” he says.Even so, the opportunity to increase profits as the oil price recovers is real, executives and analysts say.“These lower costs could give oil companies a chance of regaining the higher returns that they enjoyed 15 years ago, before the price run-up of the past decade,” says Jamie Webster, also of IHS.The shock treatment of lower oil prices may turn out to be just the therapy the industry needed.If the big energy groups are plotting a wave of takeovers in the wake of Royal Dutch Shell’s £55bn offer for BG Group, they are hiding it well.Investment bankers are talking up the prospects of further deals. However, the view among senior industry executives is that, for now, any consolidation looks unlikely to match the transformative round of dealmaking in the 1990s that created today’s “supermajors”.“Never say never, but it’s not a big focus,” said Mr Pouyanné of Total at last week’s IHS CeraWeek conference.“If the price remains low for a long enough period, then there will be some opportunities, because the value of companies will diminish . . . First, let’s see if the price remains low.”His comments were typical. Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, said: “I don’t see the forces at work for lots of consolidation unless the oil price stays down for some time.” Claudio Descalzi, Eni’s chief executive, talked of a “window of opportunity”, but saw no need for acquisitions.The plunge in the price of Brent crude, from more than $115 a barrel last summer to about $65 now, will almost certainly lead to takeovers. The question is on what scale.Behind the scenes, Houston was buzzing with rumours of possible tie-ups. One was ExxonMobil snapping up US-based Anadarko Petroleum’s Mozambique assets. A move for the whole of Anadarko, giving Exxon more onshore US exposure and Gulf of Mexico output, was also mooted.UK-based Tullow Oil, with its sizeable Africa presence, was cited as a possible target. As was Kurdistan-focused Genel Energy, led by former BP chief executive Tony Hayward.Megamergers, though, are thought unlikely. The main issue for the majors, having suffered several years of patchy exploration success, is how to add to their reserves. It is asset quality, more than potential cost savings, that they will be looking for in acquisitions. The reason Shell bid for BG is the latter’s liquefied natural gas reserves and deepwater oil.By this measure, BP would be attractive to both Exxon and Chevron. But probable UK political opposition to a US takeover will act as a deterrent.Do not expect a flood of deals just yet. The fall in oil prices, while steep, has been shortlived. And companies’ share prices, particularly those of some US independents, have started to rebound.Until crude stabilises, buyers and sellers will remain well apart. The full effects of a sustained price drop, moreover, could take two years to be felt.Even heavily indebted companies can still access capital markets relatively cheaply thanks to historically low interest rates. As long as that remains the case, few will feel forced to find a partner."
64;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2015-03-31T18:31:51Z;Oil reserves: no thaw yet;Largest companies have begun to run down their inventories;Following a chilling nine months , the oil majors are hoarding their cash flow, preparing for a barren period by cutting capital spending and trimming expenses. These companies have already struggled to replace their oil reserves, which deplete each year with production. The problem will only worsen as exploration spending by the majors declines.According to BMO Capital, half of the six largest oil companies have failed to add to their reserves over the past three years. In other words, they have begun to run down their inventories. BP has only replaced 90 per cent of what it has used over the past three years, and Shell has done even worse. Chevron has not done much better, replacing 99 per cent of its reserves. And all that happened in a period when the Brent oil price averaged $106 a barrel.Bernstein anticipates that investment in oil and gas production worldwide will fall a quarter this year. Thus, assuming the energy companies still want to increase their inventory, perhaps another route to higher reserves would be through acquisitions of projects or even entire companies. After all, the share prices of smaller exploration and production companies have collapsed. UK-listed exploration and production companies have lost a fifth, while those in the US have fallen a third, since last summer.Unfortunately for potential buyers, exploration and production company share prices have stopped falling this year, partly because these companies can still raise capital. Valuations now look high. Whereas Shell trades near 10 times 2016 earnings, midsize explorers such as US listed Occidental Petroleum, which could add a fifth to Shell’s reserves, trade at about twice that. That is well above the 25 per cent premium seen a year ago.Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy, believes the oil price implied by these high valuations is $80, well above the current $55 level. That will chill hopeful buyers indeed.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
65;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2015-03-17T17:53:37Z;Socar hires UK-based oil trading team from Phibro;Azerbaijan state group expands presence in London market;"Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil company Socar has expanded its operations in London and has hired traders from Phibro, the trading group that Occidental Petroleum is shutting down.Socar on Tuesday said it had recruited Phibro’s London-based team to build on the Azeri group’s presence in the crude oil and refined products trading business in Europe, Africa and Asia.“Following Occidental Petroleum’s announcement in late 2014 of its intention to pull back from proprietary trading of crude oil, Socar Trading took the opportunity to recruit Phibro’s London trading team and increase significantly its presence in the London oil market,” the company said.In recent years, national oil and gas companies of smaller, resource-rich countries have set up trading arms in key hubs as entry points to international commodities markets.Oil producers from Gulf states and former Soviet Union members, which traditionally sold commodities through longer-term contracts, have been among those doing so.Established in 2007, Socar Trading has its headquarters in Geneva, has big offices in Singapore and Dubai and a smaller presence in other cities around the globe.“Until now, Socar only had a representative desk in London but now they have a fully-fledged London operation that will use the credit lines of Socar Trading,” said a spokesperson.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingThe new team, which starts in London on Tuesday, will primarily handle crude oil, but will branch out into refined products as well, he said.Phibro’s trading business was expected to be wound down by the end of this month.“It has long been our company strategy to expand our geographical presence and to diversify our trading portfolio,” said chief executive Arzu Azimov in a statement.In recent years, the trading arm of the state-owned oil and gas company has become active in European and Asian products trading, as well as Iraqi Basrah crude.The group said it aimed to treble its oil and products volumes sales in the five years to 2016.Last year, Socar hired traders from rivals Trafigura and Arcadia to form part of this team, the spokesperson said.“A trading arm for a national oil company is beneficial in order to build up knowledge about oil and product flows, changing customer demand, investment opportunities, competitive behaviour and of course to manage risk,” said Roland Rechtsteiner at consultancy Oliver Wyman. “But scale is key in order to compete.”Oil and gas account for more than 90 per cent of the Azerbaijan’s exports and three-quarters of government revenues.As Azerbaijan has sought to boost crude exports and drive revenues, Socar has come under fire in recent years for allegedly giving preferential treatment to companies with obscure ownership structures.The company has denied such allegations from bodies such as Global Witness."
66;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2015-02-02T14:42:13Z;Rise and fall of a commodities powerhouse;Phibro, the former trading house that once owned a Wall Street bank, to close after 114 years;Phibro is to be dismantled, ending a 114-year-long run for a former giant of the commodities markets that started in a Hamburg living room and became rich enough to take over a Wall Street investment bank.The trading house’s business will be wound down in the first quarter, owner Occidental Petroleum said last week. Occidental had bought the former Philipp Brothers in 2009 from Citigroup.The decision to close comes as crude and other commodities scrape multiyear lows. Andrew Hall, Phibro chief, is an inveterate oil bull, renowned for making huge gains on bold bets that prices will rise. “He never goes short,” Stephen Chazen, Occidental chief executive, once said.Under Citi, Phibro was a profit engine that never suffered a losing year. But under Occidental it became a victim of listless oil markets followed by what Chris Stavros, chief financial officer, called “sharp commodity price movements” as crude plummeted to below $50 per barrel.At its pinnacle in 1980, Phibro had $23.7bn in revenue, which ranked it the 15th largest US company at the time and was more than Occidental’s net sales last year. In 1981, it acquired Salomon Brothers, the bond trading powerhouse.The Salomon deal generated unaccustomed headlines for the powerful company. Phibro used a combination of discretion and aggressiveness to move “beach sands from Australia to Rotterdam, copper concentrates from the Philippines to Japan, cocoa from Brazil to Germany” and some 150 other commodities from tungsten to wax on any given day, according to a company history by Helmut Waszkis.Phibro was a template for companies such as Glencore and Vitol that today dominate the commodities trade. It was an early adopter of oil swap derivatives, said Paul Newman of the broker ICAP. It pioneered lending to producers in exchange for the right to market their output.“They were an extremely well organised and powerful enterprise,” said David Messer, chief executive of Freepoint Commodities, a US-based trading house.Julius Philipp started as a metal merchant in 1901 from his family’s Hamburg flat. In 1909, his brother Oscar moved to London where he founded the first company named “Philipp Brothers” at 118 Leadenhall Street. In 1914, one of Oscar’s apprentices opened an office in New York. Julius Philipp remained in Hamburg until the rise of the Nazis forced his family to move to Amsterdam. He died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1944, according to the Waszkis company history.He never goes shortThe New York office eventually became Philipp Brothers headquarters. For decades it was run by German-Jewish immigrants who cultivated talent by hiring lehrlings, or apprentices. “A trader lives by his wits,” Ludwig Jesselson, Phibro’s longtime chief, used to say.The inflationary 1970s were go-go years for Phibro. With access to oil from places such as Iran and Nigeria and relationships with refiners, the company increased profits more than tenfold. It helped create the petroleum spot market, where tankers change hands at a moment’s notice. “They knew twice as much as you did about anything. They knew about where any drop of oil was at any point in time,” said Michael Cosgrove, who brokered oil deals for the company.In 1979-80, when crude prices doubled following the fall of the Shah of Iran, Phibro made $1bn trading oil, said Al Kaplan, former president of Phibro’s energy unit.“We basically controlled the oil world,” said Mr Kaplan. “It was quite amazing. We had very good people. There was no price dissemination, so we used to tell people what the price was.”Phibro became a proving ground for senior figures in the commodities industry including the late Marc Rich, the trader and pardoned fugitive who made a stormy exit in 1974. The company Rich founded became Phibro’s bitterest rival and the foundation of Glencore.Mr Hall joined Phibro from BP in 1982. In his bullishness he clashed with Mr Kaplan. One afternoon in the 1980s, Phibro sold millions of barrels of Brent crude in a large flurry of transactions, recalled Mr Cosgrove, the former broker. In the same phone call in which Phibro had sold the barrels, its trader suddenly said he now wanted to buy multiple cargoes instead.“Al just sold six cargoes short and went home and Andy walked in and decided to flip the book long,” the trader told a stunned Mr Cosgrove.Commodities slumped in mid-1980s and so did Phibro’s profits. Soon Salomon executives grabbed control of the combined company and stripped Phibro from the parent’s name.“The acquirer never knew what hit it. The acquiree dominated almost from day one. A total mismatch,” Michael Bloomberg, the former Salomon partner who became a financial technology mogul and New York mayor, wrote in a memoir.After Mr Hall took charge of Phibro’s energy unit in 1991, the company shifted away from moving physical cargoes and into trading paper derivatives. With his wealth he bought troves of contemporary art and a castle in Germany located near a settlement called Astenbeck, after which he named his $4bn hedge fund. Controversy over a potential $100m pay award to Mr Hall after Citi had been bailed out by taxpayers prompted Phibro’s sale to Occidental.Mr Hall carries on with the hedge fund and remains a stubborn bull. In a recent letter to investors he acknowledged oil’s dive but predicted prices in the $70-$80 per barrel range over the longer term.“There have been two constants of the oil market,” he wrote. “The first is that demand always grows. The second is that supply from existing resources always falls because of depletion.”——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Story of Phibro’s demise is a lesson in how it all went wrong / From George Thomas
67;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2014-02-14T21:51:37Z;Occidental shares surge on Californian spin-off;;US energy producer Occidental Petroleum was among the biggest risers on the S&P 500 on Friday after the company said it would spin off its Californian assets into a separate company.Occidental has faced calls from Wall Street to split its US business from its international operations, with analysts valuing the assets at a range of between $19bn to $22bn. The shares gained 3.8 per cent to $95.76.Campbell Soup shares rose almost 5 per cent to $43, as weakness in its beverage business was offset by stronger demand for its soups and sauces as customers looked to warm up during an unseasonably cold winter. However, its US beverage business struggled because of flagging demand for its V8 vegetable juice drinks.Acquisitions also helped generate a boost in Campbell’s net earnings, which rose 70 per cent to $318m, or 75 cents a share. Net sales rose 5.5 per cent to $2.3bn.Denise Morrison, chief executive of Campbell, said the group remained “focused on strengthening our core business and expanding into higher-growth spaces as we reshape our portfolio to improve Campbell’s long-term growth trajectory.”JM Smucker, which makes jams and peanut butter, found itself among the food sector companies out of favour. The company’s shares closed down 3.5 per cent at $91.81, after falling as much as 6 per cent, as the Ohio-based business cut its profit forecast for the current financial year as its spreads business struggles.Investors sent Weight Watchers on an unwanted diet after the company’s latest results underlined the challenge they face from a still tepid US recovery and the explosion of free apps that allow people to track their calorie consumption.The company lost more than a quarter of its market value after forecasting that profits this year would be between $1.30 a share and $1.60 a share, well short of the $2.73 a share analysts forecast.Weight Watchers shares closed down almost 28 per cent at $22.10.The company admitted that “the commercial weight loss category continued to be impacted by increasing consumer trial of activity monitors and free apps”.Shares in apparel brands company VF Corp fell 5 per cent to $56.85 after it reported a 10 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, which fell short of lofty expectations. The 2013 diluted earnings per share were up 28 cents at $2.17 a share, while the company projected a range for 2014 earnings of $3 to $3.05.Shares in Interpublic were shunned after the advertising agency’s profits were dragged down by a weaker performance in Europe. Michael Roth, the company’s chairman and chief executive, admitted that “our results in Europe fell short of expectations, which had a major impact on overall profitability”, as Interpublic took a $60.6m charge to restructure the business. Its shares fell 3.8 per cent to $16.48.Online real estate listings provider Zillow tumbled 10 per cent to $80.96 after it reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit as marketing expenses rose. The company said it would also start a campaign this year to target customers using mobile devices.Cliffs Natural Resources shares rose 5.8 per cent to $23.16, after the iron ore and coal miner, which is battling calls for a break-up from an activist investor, reported better than expected earnings, thanks to lower costs and higher iron ore prices.US stocks overall rose modestly by Friday lunchtime, as investors overlooked the latest soft economic data which was affected by bad weather.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 126.8 points or 0.8 per cent to 16,154.39, the S&P 500 gained 8.8 points or 0.5 per cent to 1,838.63, and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.3 points or 0.08 per cent to 4,244.Volume was thin after the snowstorm that battered the US east coast on Thursday and ahead of the Presidents Day holiday on Monday, when markets will be closed.
68;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2013-10-18T14:02:58Z;Occidental plans Middle East stake sale;;Occidental Petroleum, the US oil and gas group, plans to sell a minority stake in its business in the Middle East in order to focus on its North American operations and reduce its exposure to political risk.It also announced plans for possible sales of smaller assets in the US, and said it would use the “significant” proceeds to buy back shares.Stephen Chazen, Occidental’s chief executive, said the planned disposals were the “first formal steps in our effort to streamline the business, concentrate in areas where we have depth and scale and improve overall profitability”.He added: “Our goal is to become a somewhat smaller company with more manageable exposure to political risk”.The sale of a stake in Occidental’s Middle Eastern operations is part of a trend of midsized US oil companies seeking to reduce their international exposure to concentrate capital and management time on the domestic energy boom.Apache of the US said in August it was selling a 33 per cent stake in its Egyptian operations to Sinopec of China for $3.1bn.Chinese companies, which are active in acquiring oil and gas assets worldwide, are likely to be among the leading contenders for the stake in Occidental’s business.Occidental said on Friday that, following a strategic review, its board had backed the plan to sell a stake in its Middle East and north Africa division, which operates principally in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman, in a “financially efficient manner”.The business also has assets in Libya, Iraq and Yemen.The company said this year it was looking at a possible sale or spin-off of the Middle East operations. Ray Irani, the chairman who was voted off the board by shareholders in May, had been seen as a defender of retaining the entire Middle Eastern business, which is one of the largest of any US oil group’s operations in the region.Occidental had proved reserves of 929m barrels of oil equivalent in the Middle East and north Africa at the end of last year, and production of 263,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first half of 2013.There are also US assets being put up for sale, in the Rocky Mountain region and the Bakken shale of North Dakota, with proved reserves of 211m barrels of oil equivalent at the end of last year, and production of 66,000 boe/d in the first half of 2013.Occidental is also selling a stake of approximately 10 per cent in the general partner of Plains All-American Pipeline, an oil and gas pipeline group, for $1.3bn, following the partnership’s stock market flotation this week. It will retain a stake of about 25 per cent in the partnership.Mr Chazen said Occidental’s strategic review was still under way, and it would “continue to consider additional strategic alternatives for the company to maximise total returns to our shareholders”.
69;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2013-09-30T20:44:23Z;Washington worries hit US energy stocks;;US energy stocks were part of a broad pullback on Monday as investors took guarded positions hours before a possible shutdown of the US government.The energy sector fell 0.8 per cent as all 10 major areas of the S&P 500 traded lower.ExxonMobil dropped 1 per cent to $86.04, Chevron fell 0.9 per cent to $121.50, ConocoPhillips moved 1.1 per cent lower to $69.51, and Occidental Petroleum fell 1 per cent to $93.54.The budget impasse in Washington weighed on investors, with 370 of the S&P’s 500 stocks trading lower. However, the breadth of the selling was worse than the depth, with the benchmark index off 0.6 per cent to 1,681.55.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also broadly lower, down 0.8 per cent to 15,129.67 with 38 of the 30 blue-chips in negative territory. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.3 per cent to 3,771.48.Utilities avoided the worst of the selling, with the sector down only 0.1 per cent. The area typically performs better during periods of high risk due to stable share prices and high dividends.Micron Technology, which has been one of the strongest stocks on the Nasdaq in 2013, was off 0.9 per cent to $17.47. The semiconductor manufacturer has been the subject of increased short interest, which has doubled since July with about 83m shares currently on loan, according to data from Sungard’s Astec Analytics.Retailer JC Penney continued its recent descent to break below the $9 level for the first time in more than two decades. Shares in the company closed 2.5 per cent lower at $8.82.A downgrade from Morgan Stanley sent restaurant chain Panera Bread lower, as the broker slashed its rating to “equal-weight” from “overweight”. Panera shares lost 3.4 per cent to $158.53.Manufacturing group Johnson Controls was also hit by a Morgan Stanley downgrade to “underweight” from “overweight”. The company’s shares lost 2.4 per cent to $41.50.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals was one of the best performers on the day, up 2.4 per cent to $312.87 after the company received a price target increase from Oppenheimer to $300-$310. The company also received positive support last week from analysts at Goldman Sachs and BMO Capital Markets.Although selling was relatively muted, Wall Street’s fear gauge – the CBOE Volatility Index – spiked 10.2 per cent to 17.03. Commonly known as the Vix, the index tracks the implied volatility of S&P 500 contracts.The day’s move put the Vix at its highest level since late August, and was a sign that some investors are gearing up for a rocky period of trading in the short term.Investors have seen a government shutdown before, said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade, but are also concerned about whether the forthcoming jobs report will be released.“I think what traders are concerned about is, will we get an employment report on Friday?” Mr Kinahan said. “If it does not come out, do you want to carry some of this protection for another week? So the Vix could have some interesting moves depending on what happens that way.”Mr Kinahan added that similar government stand-offs have coincided with a rally once the politics are sorted out. That helped account for the day’s muted selling and higher Vix, along with some optimism that a solution could help send markets higher.“I think people are not as taken in with ‘Oh my God, this is a disaster’ as they have been in the past,” Mr Kinahan said. “Fingers crossed that it’s short-term pain, long-term gain.”
70;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Circus ringmaster of the investment world;;Bill Ackman, the activist hedge fund manager, aimed high when he trained his sights on Bob McDonald. The Procter & Gamble chief executive was a member of the US boardroom elite who headed the largest consumer goods company in the world by sales and sat on numerous other corporate boards.Neither Mr Ackman nor P&G said pressure from the hedge fund manager had played a role in his departure, but after a year of sustained criticism from the vocal activist, Mr McDonald had gone.Influencing big companies is becoming Mr Ackman’s trademark. In recent years he has played a role in the management shake-ups in companies including JC Penney and Canadian Pacific Railroad*.After he offered a withering critique of P&G at a conference this month, a group of peers described him as the PT Barnum of the investment world, a circus ringmaster whipping up publicity and opinion to his cause as he marches into town.Previous victories for his Pershing Square fund included ousting half the board from Canadian Pacific Railroad, installing the industry veteran Hunter Harrison to lead a turnround of one of Canada’s most venerable businesses. Shares in the railroad company have risen 85 per cent over the past 12 months.However, some of his work has not gone as well – as was the case at JC Penney, a fading department store that allowed its largest shareholder, Mr Ackman, to hand pick the man to revitalise the business.His choice, Apple executive Ron Johnson, was ejected this year as sales collapsed in response to his radical measures. Mr Ackman helped to reinstall his predecessor Mike Ullman, who has set about restoring confidence in the company.At Herbalife Mr Ackman has argued that the nutritional supplement direct seller is an illegal pyramid scheme and so worthless. He announced a $1bn bet that the share price would fall in December, but investors have since sided more with the company’s argument that it is a legitimate business, and shares in the group this week were trading at their highest level since mid-November.Last year, Mr Ackman’s rival Dan Loeb waged a campaign that led to the ousting of Scott Thompson as head of Yahoo last year and the appointment of Google veteran Marissa Mayer installed to lead the lumbering internet company.Similarly Carl Icahn, a bitter opponent of Mr Ackman, this year led a campaign to force out Aubrey McClendon as chief executive from the company he founded and dominated, struggling natural gas group Chesapeake Energy.* This article has been amended from the original to exclude the reference to Occidental Petroleum. Mr Ackman and Pershing Square had no involvement in the departure of Ray Irani, the executive chairman of Occidental.
71;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2013-05-03T22:57:33Z;Investors vote Occidental chairman off the board;;The chairman of Occidental Petroleum, the US oil and gas group, was voted off the board by shareholders following reports of disagreements over strategy in its leadership.Ray Irani, who was Occidental’s chief executive for 20 years before becoming executive chairman in 2010, won the support of investors holding just 150m shares at the company’s annual meeting in California. He was opposed by the holders of 478m shares.He was replaced by Edward Djerejian, a former US ambassador to Syria and Israel, who has been an independent director of the company since 1996.Mr Djerejian will be an independent rather than an executive chairman, reflecting a shake-up in the company’s corporate governance announced last month.With a market capitalisation of $73bn, only about $1bn less than ConocoPhillips, Occidental is the fourth-largest US oil company. ExxonMobil and Chevron are the largest.Mr Irani’s exit had been on the cards since Occidental announced last month that Steve Chazen, chief executive, would be staying until the end of next year.A statement in February that the board had begun to search for a replacement for Mr Chazen sparked protests from some investors, who praised the chief executive and called for him to stay.Occidental last month denied that there was a “fight at the top”, but sources with knowledge of the company told the FT there had been a dispute between Mr Chazen and Mr Irani over whether to spin off Occidental’s operations in the Middle East, which account for about 40 per cent of the group’s oil production and 35 per cent of its gas production.The departure of Mr Irani, who built the company in its present form and had particular responsibility for the Middle East, will strengthen expectations that that business will be sold, spun off or put into a joint venture.Mr Chazen sounded open to those ideas on a call with analysts last month to discuss first-quarter results, saying splitting the company was “something we consider all the time.”He added that contract terms in the countries where Occidental operated – which are principally Qatar, Bahrain and Oman – meant that a demerger would probably be easier than a sale.Some investors have argued that Occidental will earn better returns by focusing on its US operations, which include a leading position in the Permian basin of west Texas, seen as one of the most exciting regions in the country’s renewed oil boom.On a day when most oil companies’ shares rose because of increased economic optimism and a higher price of crude, Occidental outpaced the sector by rising 3 per cent to $90.76.
72;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Occidental Petroleum to keep Steve Chazen as chief to end of 2014;;Occidental Petroleum is to keep its chief executive in place until the end of next year, increasing the likelihood that the US oil group will try to spin off its Middle East operations.The company said in February that it had appointed headhunters to find a replacement for Steve Chazen, who took over as CEO in 2010. Earlier this month the board denied reports there was a “fight at the top”, with Mr Chazen under pressure to go from Ray Irani, his predecessor, who stayed on as executive chairman.On Monday, Occidental said that Mr Chazen would stay until the end of 2014 “with the board’s full support”. Mr Chazen said that he would “look forward to calling on Ray for advice, counsel and help in advancing the company’s business interests”.The company also announced an overhaul of its corporate governance, including a commitment to change the chairman every five years, and a prohibition on former chief executives serving as chairman in future. The moves, which follow pressure from some shareholders in support of Mr Chazen, could accelerate plans to sell or spin off Middle East operations, which have been considered by the company.Some people close to Occidental said that a dispute between Mr Chazen and Mr Irani over the future of those assets contributed to the mixed messages over the company’s leadership.Mr Chazen has pushed for a split, these people say, while Mr Irani wanted to keep the group together. Mr Irani, who was picked to lead Occidental by his predecessor Armand Hammer, and who served as chief executive for 20 years, was given specific responsibility for the Middle Eastern operations in the 2010 shake-up of the company’s leadership.In 2012, the Middle East provided 40 per cent of Occidental’s crude oil production and 35 per cent of its gas.During a conference call last week to discuss first-quarter earnings, Mr Chazen said that splitting the company was “something that we consider all the time”. He said that valuing the two pieces separately made sense, and that the US portion could trade favourably among a peer group of comparable companies.But “valuing the international standalone is really more complicated, because there’s not a lot of good comps,” he said.He also implied that Occidental’s poor share price performance could make a divestment more likely. The stock has fallen 5 per cent over the past 12 months, lagging behind both the S&P 500 index and the oil and gas sector.“We’ll look at everything but obviously, with a lower stock price, things that might not have worked before might work now,” Mr Chazen said. “That isn’t any kind of forecast or anything. It’s just sort of a tautology.”First Pacific Advisors, an Occidental shareholder, wrote in an open letter this month that Mr Chazen should stay, in part because he “understands the trade-off between risk and reward” and doing business in the Middle East was becoming “less attractive”.It added: “We prefer the less risky focus on domestic assets because doing business in the Middle East has changed – less attractive today than it has been in the past and will likely be even less attractive in the future.”Occidental’s shares closed 1.4 per cent higher on Monday to $87.86.
73;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2013-04-14T18:42:46Z;On Monday: Rumblings in energy reflect investor shift;Shareholder activism has hit half a dozen leading US oil and gas companies;US oil investors are revolting. In the past year, shareholder activism has hit half a dozen leading oil and gas companies, forcing asset sales, shaking up boards and, in some cases, displacing chief executives.Chesapeake Energy, Sandridge Energy, Transocean, Hess and Occidental Petroleum have all seen shareholders flex their muscles in varying ways. Transocean and Hess are facing critical investor votes at their forthcoming annual meetings.In part, this rising pressure on boards simply reflects the general upsurge in activism that has become a prominent feature of the US corporate landscape over the past year or so. Yet there are also specific features of the oil and gas business which make it particularly prone to increased shareholder militancy, and which carry some potentially important implications for the industry’s future.One obvious attraction of oil and gas companies for activist investors is that they have real assets that can be sold to release value. Chesapeake built up the best position in US shale gas and oil assets of any company, although it burdened itself heavily with debt to do so. Hess is one of the leading companies in the Bakken shale of North Dakota, the heart of the new US oil boom, a position that was not fully reflected in its share price. Elliott Management, the hedge fund, has been pushing Hess to sell assets more quickly.Another reason for activists to take positions in oil and gas companies is that they are long-term businesses, where decisions may not pay off for many years, creating opportunities for a quicker pay-off by focusing on short-term returns. At Transocean, the offshore drilling contractor, the activist investor Carl Icahn is pushing for the company to pay a dividend of $4 per share, when its board has said the most that would be reasonable is $2.24. He argues that improved capital allocation – higher debt and less investment to support low-margin contracts – will improve returns, while the board says his plan would “potentially [generate] temporary returns at the expense of the company’s ability to operate successfully and create sustainable value over the long term.”A third feature of the oil and gas industry is the entrepreneurial nature of most of its companies, which has created many powerful chief executives with only weak oversight from their boards. Aubrey McClendon, the former chief executive of Chesapeake who stepped down at the beginning of the month, had fuelled concerns about corporate governance for years, but the situation came to a head only after Reuters reported that his undisclosed personal borrowings were secured by his stakes in the company’s wells.Tom Ward co-founded Chesapeake with Mr McClendon, but then left to lead Sandridge Energy, where he had similar problems with his investors. The company has agreed to add four directors nominated by TPG-Axon, another activist, to its board. Mr Ward is expected to leave.Hess is slightly different in that John Hess, the chief executive, is the son of the company’s founder Leon Hess, but Elliott raised concerns about weak board oversight. The company has now proposed a new slate of directors.Occidental is different again, in that shareholders have been speaking out in support of Stephen Chazen, the chief executive, against reported attempts to remove him. According to these reports – denied by the company – Ray Irani, the chairman, has been trying to force out Mr Chazen.While the details of these situations may vary, there are two principal themes with implications for the future of oil and gas that are common to them all. One is that we are still in the midst of the turbulence created by the shale oil and gas boom. In some cases, as in the spectacular success Mr Icahn has enjoyed with his ownership of CVR Energy, a refining company that benefited from the cheap US crude generated by shale production, the effects have been positive. In others, such as the collapse of Chesapeake’s cash flows caused by the slump in the natural gas price, they have been negative. Either way, the US industry is still reconfiguring itself to reflect these new realities.The other common theme is that, at least for a while, we may be entering a world in which the remorseless upward march of commodity prices that characterised most of the previous decade can no longer be relied upon. Although they have doubled over the past year, US natural gas prices are still less than a third of their peak in 2008. Oil is closer to its previous high, but rising production in North America and possibly other countries such as Iraq may well curb future price rises, for a few years at least.If shareholders want superior returns, they are going to have to work for them.Ed Crooks is the FT’s US industry and energy editor.

74;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2013-04-08T19:41:31Z;Occidental denies fight over Chazen heir;;The board of Occidental Petroleum on Monday denied there was a fight at the top over a successor to current chief executive Stephen Chazen.The statement by the board came in response to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal that said the company’s former long-serving chief executive and current chairman, Ray Irani, was trying to push 66-year-old Mr Chazen out.The board said all decisions regarding chief executive succession planning were made over many meetings by the independent directors alone. “Dr Irani did not attend, and did not play any role in these meeting deliberations,” the statement said.It added that the chairman would retire as planned at the end of 2014, and that Mr Chazen would stay on as chief executive until a replacement was designated.With operations in the US, the Middle East and Latin America, Occidental is one of America’s most highly regarded companies and its fourth-largest oil producer. It was built by Armand Hammer, the legendary industrialist, who ran it for 33 years until his death in 1990 at the age of 92.Mr Irani, who succeeded Mr Hammer, stepped down in 2010 following a wave of criticism about the size of his pay. The year before he had earned a salary of $52.2m, almost double the pay of Rex Tillerson, chief executive of ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil company, making him one of America’s most lavishly compensated bosses. He was replaced by Mr Chazen, who was at the time Occidental’s president and chief operating officer.The Journal report said that, ahead of a February board meeting, Mr Irani and directors who support him pushed a plan to dismiss Mr Chazen and replace him with a former Occidental executive who left in 2004.Other board members reportedly rejected the proposal. Instead, after the meeting, the board announced its plan to search for a successor to Mr Chazen, a former investment banker at Merrill Lynch.Mr Chazen has been praised for increasing Occidental’s oil and gas production, but has also been criticised for rising operating and capital costs, and the poor performance of its shares, which have fallen about 14 per cent since the start of 2012.Monday’s statement said the independent directors had concluded that “now is the time to seek new leadership to be in place for the longer term”, and had retained a search firm to help find a successor to Mr Chazen.In the statement, Mr Chazen said he was “not aware” of any differences between himself and the board over company strategy. “I did not ask to leave at this time, but I respect the board’s decision to seek a new generation of leadership,” he added.

At the beginning of this year, the board of the Mexican state oil monopoly, Pemex, approved a doubling of its VCM plant in a $556m joint venture with Mexichem.Those who back reforms at Pemex will note that the state company had already announced a doubling of the plant’s capacity more than a decade ago. Despite huffing and puffing that included a $74m tender and seemingly endless, yet fruitless start-up procedures, however, the net result was that not an ounce of additional VCM was ever produced.Related reading:

76;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2013-03-12T23:58:44Z;Ecuador to US: no more investment protection for you!;;"After winning re-election last month, Ecuador’s firebrand president, Rafael Correa, vowed to deepen his socialist revolution and make it irreversible.He is already taking steps: this week he presented a bill asking lawmakers to terminate an investment protection treaty with the US.The measure — which has a good chance of passing given that his party has a majority in the new Congress that will be inaugurated in May — would prevent US companies in Ecuador from filing for arbitration.Correa has been at odds with foreign companies and investors since he first took office in 2007. He defaulted on $3.2bn in foreign debt in 2008 — which Ecuador subsequently bought back at 35 cents to the dollar — and forced oil and telecommunications companies to redraft contracts.His anti-American rhetoric and feelings are well known. He closed a US military base soon after taking office for the first time. Then, after winning a third term in February, he said arbitration tribunals were “pimping by benefiting transnational corporations.”“Ecuador is not an easy woman going around trying to seduce. It is a sovereign country, the rules are clear. If foreign investment wants to come, welcome,” he told beyondbrics last month at the presidential palace in Quito. “[But] I will not be seducing anyone to come.”Aside from China — currently one of the Andean country’s major investors — and Venezuela, it might be hard to seduce others even if he tried.According to Reuters, Ecuador, which is the smallest of the Opec members, has signed 23 investment protection treaties. Foreign companies have filed 39 arbitration requests at the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, or Icsid, a World Bank body that conducts arbitration between governments and businesses.While Ecuador is no longer a member of Icsid, having pulled out of the body four years ago. But it still has to abide by Icsid rulings for issues raised before 2009.Last October, the body ordered Quito to pay $1.77bn in compensation to Occidental Petroleum, or Oxy, after Ecuador terminated its operating contract in May 2006 — before Correa took office. The government appealed the ruling.Ecuador has two other outstanding cases before Icsid related to the confiscation of assets – one was filed by a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips of the US, and one by Perenco of France.In addition, The Hague’s Permanent Court of Arbitration said last month Ecuador must take measures to suspend enforcement of an $18bn ruling against Chevron for polluting the Amazon. Some legal analysts believe the Andean country might have to pay compensation to Chevron if it fails to obey that order.Correa said the lawsuit could bankrupt Ecuador. He protests that the case hinges on an investment treaty with the US that came into being in 1997 — even though Texaco (the original plaintiff) left Ecuador in 1992. Chevron inherited the case when it bought Texaco in 2001.Correa is looking for back-up on this. The ALBA bloc of leftwing countries – some of them very rich in natural resources – will meet in Ecuador next month to discuss a common strategy against lawsuits from foreign companies, potentially creating a body to audit investment treaties and arbitration mechanisms.“We are going to answer regionally. Individually, they can step on our countries and impose their abuses,” Correa said during his Saturday media address. “Regionally, we are imposing conditions to these transnational corporations.”Related reading:

77;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2013-02-01T17:42:34Z;Oil companies: earnings, schmearnings;High price per barrel on its own will not rescue profitability;"Big Oil is upstream with a broken paddle. The most striking feature of the 2012 results announced so far by the world’s biggest oil companies is the sluggishness of their upstream operations – the bits that explore for, extract and ship oil and gas. Even America’s mighty ExxonMobil is struggling. Its 2012 earnings report on Friday showed its upstream earnings were 13 per cent down on 2011. Chevron’s were down 4 per cent, while ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum saw falls of about 15 per cent. Shell’s were flat. Given the strength of the oil price, that may seem odd.The problem is volume. Companies generally failed to produce more oil and gas in 2012 than they did in 2011; in some cases production was down. Exxon’s was nearly 6 per cent lower, Occidental’s was up about 5 per cent and most others had a flat year. (BP and a handful of other big groups have yet to report 2012 numbers.) Moreover, the near-term outlook is not much better. ConocoPhillips says its 2013 production is likely to be about 1.5m barrels of oil equivalent a day, a shade lower than 2012 and 2011.Countering these trends will be tough. It is a question not just of production but of productivity. The fact is it costs more to get oil out of mature, declining wells than out of newer ones. Exploration costs and capital expenditures are rising so returns on investment are falling. Chevron’s return on capital employed fell from 22 per cent in 2011 to less than 19 per cent last year; ConocoPhillips saw its returns decline from 13 per cent to 11 per cent.Oil companies need more than a high oil price if they want to reverse the trend of falling profitability. Expensive exploration plays will need to succeed too. This is where the going is toughest and where the toughest get going. In the end, everything flows from upstream.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
78;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2012-12-03T12:13:50Z;Texas crude glut sparks oil price swings;;Mark Merritt is selling some of the world’s cheapest crude oil.His company, Fasken Oil & Ranch, is an independent producer in Midland, Texas, with about 1,000 wells around a patchwork of oilfields known collectively as the Permian basin. Using techniques pioneered in the shale revolution, the company has trebled Permian output in three years.The production boost should be positive. But Mr Merritt is not alone: Texas oil output has surged to a 24-year high of 2m barrels a day, overwhelming pipeline infrastructure and creating a glut of West Texas Intermediate oil in the Midland producing hub. The surplus has driven the price of WTI there to a record discount to Cushing, the Oklahoma town that serves as the pricing point for the benchmark.“Yesterday there was a $10 differential of Midland WTI to Cushing [WTI]. That puts us at about $75 a barrel, approximately,” Mr Merritt, director of oil and gas of Fasken, said last week.The same day the cost of Brent crude, considered the global oil benchmark, was $110 a barrel, making Mr Merritt’s oil one of the global energy market’s best bargains.The price differences between Midland and Cushing, from where WTI is shipped around the US, matter. First, they offer a huge arbitrage opportunity for physical traders and pipeline companies. And if the discount persists, it means less revenue for drillers, potentially reducing investment and, over time, slowing production growth. Fasken is joined in the Permian by listed companies such as Occidental Petroleum, Chevron and ExxonMobil.The differential also affects the cost of WTI traded in the futures market of the New York Mercantile Exchange, which uses Cushing as its delivery point. Cushing has a glut of its own, depressing WTI relative to Brent in a problem traders call the “ Cushing syndrome”. Now, they are starting to talk about a “Midland syndrome”. Through complicated supply contracts, the differential between Cushing and Midland even affects the price of Mexican and Venezuelan oil exports.Since 1984 and until earlier this year, the price difference of WTI between Midland and Cushing rarely exceeded 50 cents a barrel – representing the fee traders paid to ship oil over roughly 500 miles of pipelines.But as production has surged in Texas, the Midland discount to Cushing has widened, hitting a record $19 a barrel in November. At that level, it was economical to put the crude in trucks and drive it to market, traders say.The hefty discount partly reflected lower demand for WTI due to the closure for maintenance of the 146,000 b/d Borger, Texas refinery operated by Phillips 66 and CVR Energy’s 70,000 b/d refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma. Andy Lipow, an oil consultant in Houston, says: “Takeaway capacity, being both pipelines and refineries, is quite tight. When either of those have a problem then crude oil backs up into the Permian basin and the price comes under pressure.”As the discount has widened, price volatility has risen sharply, forcing executives and traders to pay attention to daily movements, instead of focusing on monthly or even quarterly averages as they used in the past. “In a market where you used to see 10-cent swings in a day, you are seeing an average of more than $5 swings per day, often much more,” says a senior Houston-based oil trader.At the moment, few pipelines leave the desolate Permian basin for the Cushing hub. “Infrastructure is simply not there,” says Amrita Sen, oil analyst at Energy Aspect, a London-based consultancy.The Basin pipeline, owned by Plains All American Pipeline, runs from the Permian to Cushing, with capacity of 450,000 b/d. Centurion Pipeline, a unit of Occidental, has 365,000 b/d capacity. Sunoco Logistics also has crude pipelines leading from west Texas. But production is now growing faster than pipeline capacity.The situation should improve by the middle of next year with the opening of new pipelines linking the interior region with the refining hub on the US Gulf of Mexico coast. Magellan Midstream is reversing the 60-year old Longhorn pipeline to move crude from west Texas to near Houston. Sunoco Logistics is building the Permian Express pipeline, linking west Texas with Nederland, near Houston.Mr Merritt is waiting eagerly for the new lines. “We hope to see some relief,” he says. “In the meantime, things may get worse before they get better”.
79;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2012-10-06T00:32:00Z;Ecuador vs US oil: Quito loses a round;;Ecuador and its state-owned energy groups have gotten the better of a string of US oil companies that sought to profit from the country’s reserves, but Friday one struck a blow back.The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, a World Bank body that conducts arbitration between governments and businesses, ordered Quito to pay $1.77bn in compensation to Occidental Petroleum, or Oxy.The Andean country terminated Oxy’s operating contract in May 2006 and handed its local operations over to state-owned energy company Petroamazonas after accusing the US group of having sold a part of an oil field without proper authorisation to Canada’s Alberta Energy Corp.Oxy at the time was Ecuador’s largest oil investor, extracting around 100,000 barrels of crude oil a day. But then-President Alfredo Palacio was under pressure from indigenous groups in the oil-rich Ecuadorean Amazon to expel the company for allegedly exploiting natural resources with no benefit for poor local communities in the jungle region.Oxy though said it had complied with its obligations and filed a request for arbitration. Diego García, the country’s attorney general, said earlier this week that Ecuador was willing to pay Oxy up to $417m but that the company was demanding nearly $3.4bn, according to Reuters.The ICSID’s award is bigger than the headline number. “Ecuador is ordered to pay pre-award interest on the above amount at the rate of 4.188 per cent per annum, compounded annually from May 16 2006 until the date of this award,” the ruling said.Rafael Correa, the current president, has been swift to respond. “We are used to address these kinds of abuses,” he told reporters at the presidential residence on Friday, adding, “Obviously we will appeal this ruling. We will ask for the annulment of the ruling.”Ecuador, like Evo Morales’ Bolivia and Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela, is actually no longer a member of the ICSID after having pulled out of the body in 2009, but Correa’s comments suggest Quito may still be willing to abide by the ICSID’s rules.Ecuador is now the lowest producing member of Opec, with output of about 500,000 barrels a day. Under Correa, spats with US energy groups have continued apace.A unit of Noble Energy lost control in 2010 of a gas field in the Gulf of Guayaquil to state-run Petroecuador after the company refused to change its production-sharing contract to a new service agreement. Correa’s administration has also lent support to private plaintiffs who won a local $19bn judgment against Chevron over environmental damages at a field that has been run exclusively by Petroecuador since 1992 but which used to involve Texaco, now part of Chevron.

The benchmark US index briefly dropped beneath 1,400 for the first since last Friday’s close, and was in slightly negative territory for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5 per cent to 13,126.14 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 3,104.96.Apple broke through the $620 mark to an all-time high of $621.45 in the morning session, before ending the day at $617.62, for a gain of 0.5 per cent. Investors brushed off reports of an embarrassing iPad launch in Australia, where the group was forced to admit the product was incompatible with local 4G wireless networks, as Australia’s consumer watchdog said it would take Apple to court for misleading statements.Tyco International, the US industrial conglomerate, was among the biggest risers on the benchmark US index, adding 4.3 per cent to $55.81.The Swiss-based parent company of Tyco Group said it would merge its flow controls business with Pentair, the water filtration and thermal management company, in an all-stock deal that values the unit at about $4.9bn, including debt. Shares in Pentair rose 15.1 per cent to $46.32 on news of the deal.Medco Health Solutions, the pharmacy benefits manager, rose 3.2 per cent to $71.22 after it said its $29.1bn takeover by rival Express Scripts might be completed as early as next week. Shares in Express Scripts climbed 1.3 per cent to $53.89.Goldman Sachs ended the day flat at $126.36, despite reports that the company had settled a dispute with a union pension fund over its board structure that could have resulted in the removal of chief executive Lloyd Blankfein from his other role as chairman of the bank.Investment banking rival Morgan Stanley fell 2.3 per cent to $20.24, but commercial lenders Bank of America and Citigroup both climbed, as the financial sector of the S&P 500 eked out a gain.Google, the second-most heavily weighted stock on the Nasdaq, climbed 1.4 per cent to $655.76 as analysts at Citigroup raised their price target for the online search provider to $750.“Google shares are flat year to date, materially underperforming the S&P 500,” said Mark Mahaney at Citigroup. “A series of overhangs related to the rise of social networks, the pending Motorola Mobility acquisition and mounting regulatory scrutiny – as well as a big [fourth-quarter miss] – have all been behind the underperformance.“But near-term checks, new proprietary segment analysis and a highly-attractive valuation all lead us to reiterate our ‘buy’ [rating],” he added.Yelp, the business reviews website, rose by as much as 15.6 per cent early in the session as investors’ appetite for the tech stock soared. At one point shares in Yelp, which went public on March 2, were trading at twice their initial offer price of $15, but the stock pared gains drastically in the afternoon session, ending the day up just 1.6 per cent at $28.09.Shares in Annie’s, the Californian organic food producer and retailer, popped 89 per cent to $35.92, the day after its IPO, which had priced shares at $19.
81;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2012-02-29T20:59:44Z;Nasdaq and the markets;What we make of this latest burst of prosperity depends how it is measured;Technical analysts, market psychologists, and other practitioners of the financial black arts are having a busy winter. One supposedly significant milestone after another falls: Dow hits 13,000, the Nasdaq’s 2007 high, Apple’s $500bn valuation. But there is a non-voodoo message here too – we’ve simply had a serious rally.A little reflection would not hurt. What we make of this latest burst of prosperity depends heavily on how it is measured, and it pays to avoid complexity. So take a highly liquid and transparent group of companies from a range of industries: the 50 biggest US companies by market capitalisation. The members of this sample have added $1.2tn in market cap since many indices bottomed on October 3 last year, a 23 per cent gain, according to Capital IQ. The gains have been very evenly spread. Yes, Apple is a large contributor, but strike it out and the remaining 49 are still up 22 per cent. Only one of these 50 companies has not notched up gains during the rally: Amazon, burdened with both a dizzying valuation and declining margins. And the best performers of the 50 are diverse. The likes of Citigroup, Comcast, Occidental Petroleum, Walt Disney and Home Depot have risen by more than 40 per cent. If one sector stands out, it is the banks – the six in the sample grew their market caps more, in aggregate ($167bn) than Apple did ($150bn).The underperformers have more in common. They are mostly defensive stocks. Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Bristol-Myers Squibb all had single-digit percentage gains. They would have lagged even if their performances were adjusted to include their considerable dividends. If holders of these sedate names are feeling regret, it will probably be replaced by a sense of relief if the winter of our market content is made unglorious summer.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
82;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2012-01-25T22:26:43Z;Conoco to cut North American gas output;;"ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group by market capitalisation, has said it plans to cut its North American gas production this year as it shifts to more profitable oil reserves, becoming the latest group to announce output reductions after gas prices fell to a 10-year low.The company suggested that a high single-digit decline in its US gas production was possible, following a 9 per cent drop last year. It made the prediction as it reported a 38 per cent rise in underlying earnings for the final quarter of 2011, thanks to the rise in oil prices.The boom in shale gas production and weak demand caused by the sluggish economy and warm weather have sent US gas prices plunging. On Monday, one of the largest gas producers in the US, Chesapeake Energy announced a planned production cut of 8 per cent, which was interpreted by analysts as an attempt to stabilise the market.Like Chesapeake, Conoco said it was diverting drilling rigs away from gas and towards oil reserves such as the Eagle Ford shale and Permian Basin, both in Texas. Of the 35-40 rigs that Conoco had running in the “lower 48” states, it said, fewer than five were drilling for gas, and production was likely to continue to decline.The plan is to shut about 4 per cent of its North American gas production, but the company added that there were limits to how far its gas output could fall. About two-thirds of its gas comes as a byproduct from wells for oil or natural gas liquids, which earn much higher returns and so are worth keeping open.Of the remainder, Jeff Sheets, Conoco’s chief financial officer, added: “We have partners on a lot of that production as well, and partners have different views about shut-ins, with most of our partners not wanting to shut in and lose the cash flow.”Two other US companies also said on Tuesday that their gas production would be difficult to cut. Steve Chazen, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil US oil group by market capitalisation, told analysts that the current price of gas at about $2.50-$2.60 per million British thermal units was “not sustainable”.However, he added “[the] bulk of our gas is associated gas and comes off with the oil. Not much I can do about cutting that back.”Similarly, Continental Resources, which has delivered spectacular growth in its oil production in the Bakken shale of North Dakota, said this year it expected 28 per cent growth in its “dry” gas output – which accounts for only about 10-15 per cent of its total production – because it will come from wells drilled for oil and other higher-value liquids.In its fourth-quarter results statement, Conoco said it was on track to spin off its downstream refining and marketing operations into a new company, Phillips 66, as planned, in the second quarter of this year, possibly in May.Conoco is splitting to allow the two sides of the group to focus on their own businesses, and plans to sell $5bn-$10bn worth of assets this year. It also has a $10bn share buy-back programme.Its oil and gas production fell 8 per cent to 1.6m barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, hit by the Libyan civil war and disruption in China following an offshore oil spill from a platform it part-owns.However, a rise in the average price of Conoco’s oil sales from $78.76 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $109.31 in the equivalent period of 2011 lifted underlying earnings in its exploration and production division 27 per cent to $2.35bn.In refining and marketing, profits fell 3 per cent to $201m; a better performance than for some of Conoco’s rivals. Chevron, the second-largest US oil group, has warned that its fourth-quarter earnings, released on Friday, will show its refining business was “near break-even” in the period. Tesoro, one of the largest US refiners, has warned of a possible fourth quarter loss.Conoco confirmed the planned ramp-up in its capital spending on exploration and production, from $9.3bn in 2010 to $12.7bn in 2011 and an expected $14bn this year, Capital spending in refining and marketing was just $994m last year, down from $1.26bn in 2010.The impending break-up of the company continues a drive to increase shareholder value that began in 2010, when Conoco launched a programme of asset sales and share buy-backs. Since then, it has raised $10.7bn from disposals, including $9.5bn from the 20 per cent stake in Lukoil of Russia, and bought back shares worth $15bn.The benefit of that showed in an effective rise in underlying earnings per share of 53 per cent."
83;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2011-09-19T19:16:43Z;Lost in the sands;Effort to revive Libya’s oil industry will have global consequences;"The first thing Jamid Ahmad did on returning to the Zelten oilfield was to check on the well known as C-1. The 27-year-old mechanic last saw it in February, when he and fellow workers fled the National Oil Company-owned desert facility 450km south-west of Benghazi in the early days of uprising against Colonel Muammer Gaddafi.Following several months during which the abandoned field was controlled by troops loyal to the dictator, Mr Ahmad found the well partially covered in sand but otherwise apparently intact. “This is not just about oil,” he says, his relief evident as he checks that the valves remain as firmly closed as he left them. “This is about the history of Libya.”The C-1 well commands a special place in Libya’s oil industry. It was the country’s first well to pump oil in commercial quantities when production started in September 1961, with output of 20,000 barrels a day. Fifty years later, almost to the day, a pressure gauge at the top of the well reads little more than zero. But the apparent lack of damage suggests Zelten should be able to restart production soon.The story is different elsewhere. Nearby fields as well as Libya’s main export terminals on the southern Mediterranean shores – all visited by the Financial Times this month – showed visible signs of damage, likely to take months to fix. Even in Zelten, the accommodation complex lies ransacked and electricity remains off, hampering the return of workers.Mr Ahmad himself, having checked his room and found that the Gaddafi army took the few valuables he left behind, went home again. His return is crucial not just for the north Africa nation, for which oil revenues are the only significant source of income. They are also significant for the global economy, as higher Libyan production would push oil prices down; and for an energy industry always in search of fresh crude reserves.The revolution has delivered a big setback for the country’s oil industry. It will take months, if not years, to recover to pre-war levels. But in the medium term, the end of the Gaddafi regime also provides an opportunity. Libya has for years punched below its potential, hampered by lack of investment as its leader diverted funds for other causes and his personal use; sanctions preventing the return of US companies; and an exodus of engineers to other countries in the region. But executives and officials believe the country, which boasts Africa’s largest reserves, could produce much more oil in the next two decades if the new ruling class pursues the right policies. In 1969, the year Gaddafi gained power, Libya produced nearly as much as Saudi Arabia – 3.1m b/d and 3.3m b/d, respectively – a clear sign of its potential.The Libyan revolution has rewritten the who’s who of its oil industry. For years Shokri Ghanem, the Gaddafi-era prime minister who became head of the National Oil Company, controlled all the sector’s levers. But since his defection in May, and the rebels’ victory in Tripoli in August, new figures have taken charge.The most prominent is Ali Tarhouni, the finance, economy and oil minister in waiting. The former economics professor, returning from a long exile, has little experience in the energy industry and insiders say he is likely to relinquish his nominal control to Abdel Rahman bin Yezza in a reshuffle. Ahmed Omar Shakmak – based in the eastern city of Benghazi, previously the rebels’ stronghold – is deputy oil minister and the senior official receiving most visiting industry executives. Two weeks ago, it was Italy’s Eni; last week, Repsol YPF of Spain.Nuri Berruien, newly-elected chairman of the National Oil Company, is the most senior official in charge of producing, refining and exporting the black stuff. The 65-year-old petroleum engineer was about to retire, just before the start of the revolution six months ago, from a senior position at the Arab Gulf Oil Company (Agoco), an NOC subsidiary, but is now busier than ever trying to restart Libya’s oil industry. He, too, is based in Benghazi, although NOC headquarters were in Tripoli before the revolution.Under Ahmed Majbri, the newly- appointed chairman (previously employed in the company’s finance department), Agoco has already started production at Sarir and Messla. Both of the country’s easternmost oilfields fell under rebel control in the early days of the revolution.As a member of the ruling National Transitional Council’s oversight committees for finance, economy and oil, Mustafa el-Huni is another official crucial to the oil industry. Although there are four others on the committee, he is seen to be in charge of oil affairs. He was vice-chairman of the National Oil Company in the 1980s, and observers say he could play a central role in shaping Libya’s long-term energy policy. He has already spoken in favour of splitting the NOC into two or three companies and devoting more attention to the development of the natural gas industry.Libyan oil is far more important for the global economy and the oil industry than appears at first glance. Before the uprising began, it supplied about 1.6m b/d – a mere two per cent of global output, roughly the same as Italy’s consumption, according to the International Energy Agency, the western countries’ oil watchdog. But the headline figure is deceptive. Libya produces a particularly high-quality crude, sought after by western refiners for its low sulphur content, which helps meet strict new environmental rules for petrol and diesel. Precise figures are hard to come by, but industry executives estimate that the country is one of the leading producers of low-sulphur oil, accounting for roughly 10-15 per cent of global output. Moreover, Libya’s proximity to Europe reduces transport costs.As Libyan production dried up, refiners raced to find high-quality alternatives, driving up prices. Brent, which is a global benchmark, surged to a two-year high of $127.02 a barrel in early April. That, in turn, has contributed to higher inflation, which has pushed monetary authorities, including the European Central Bank, to raise interest rates.The disruption to supply caused by the war forced an extraordinary response from Saudi Arabia, which raised its production to nearly 10m b/d, the highest in 30 years. However, Saudi crude is medium-quality oil so, while the kingdom was able to cover the volume lost, it was unable to bridge the quality gap. As the market for high-quality oil continued to tighten, driving up prices, the IEA ordered the release of members’ strategic reserves – only the third time it has done so.Coupled with a slowdown in global oil demand growth, and the effect of the IEA’s mandated release of strategic stocks, the anticipated return of Libya to the oil market is exerting downward pressure on prices. Brent has fallen to $110 a barrel. But hopes could be getting ahead of the reality on the ground. The country is producing only about 160,000 b/d from its easternmost fields, Sarir and Messla, of which only about 100,000 b/d would be exported – less than one-tenth of prewar levels.However, Nuri Berruien, the new chairman of the National Oil Company, says flows could reach the critical 1m b/d level in about six months. And, he adds, “in 15 months we can reach the prewar level of 1.6m b/d”.The pace of the industry’s reconstruction is crucial to the global oil market and, by extension, the global economy. Some of the leading companies rely heavily on Libya – among them, Eni of Italy, Repsol of Spain, Total of France, OMV of Austria, Wintershall of Germany, and US-based Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Hess and Marathon. Eni and Repsol, the largest investors in the country, have already sent senior executives to Benghazi, the eastern stronghold of the former rebels, to discuss their return.Yet some of their number say security fears threaten a speedy return. “Safety is paramount to the big international companies and it would take time for them to feel the country is OK,” says Anders Nilsson, Benghazi-based head of Condrill, a Swedish drilling company. Today, while there is a consensus that bringing Libya back on tap will be tough, interviews in Benghazi reveal disagreement among the new oil establishment emerging from the rebel ranks, executives and diplomats about how long that process will take.The most immediate challenge is not war damage but looting. When Gaddafi loyalists fled some of the largest oilfields and terminals, they took all they could: cars, trucks, power generators, pumps and other equipment. Local gangs – and rebels in some cases – took whatever remained. Besides requiring considerable new investment, this has created a further problem: logistics. Oil workers need food and sleeping quarters in often remote desert facilities. They have neither.Then there is the damage that is not immediately visible. Officials may be relieved to see light or no surface damage in fields such as Zelten; but they worry about possible, as yet undetected, problems underground. Oil wells need constant maintenance and, after six months of stoppage, facilities hundreds of meters below the sands, could have suffered lasting damage. “Electrical submersible pumps that sit at the bottom of wells deep underground must be lifted to the surface and cleaned regularly, which is especially important in Libyan wells, given the waxier nature of the crude there,” says Ed Morse of Citigroup. In the worst case scenario, companies would have to redrill the wells, says Yousif Al Gheriani, head of the 17th February Committee for oil and gas, which groups workers in eastern Libya.Another problem is the oil reservoirs themselves, above all in the most mature fields of the Sirte basin, near Col Gaddafi’s home town – still the scene of violent conflict – which had been pumping since the 1960s. To force the crude oil out of the reservoirs, engineers maintain pressure by injecting them with water or natural gas. After six months of stoppage, the first task for the arriving crews will not be to start production but to re-establish pressure.But Libya’s output is almost worthless if it cannot be exported to the global market. And officials are discovering that some of their ports have fared worse than the oilfields. Libya has six main terminals, of which at least two – Es Sider and Marsa el Brega – are heavily damaged.All these factors could slow Libya’s return to the international market. Given time, the country has the potential to rebuild the industry and exceed former production levels. But years of US-imposed sanctions, plus Col Gaddafi’s refusal to invest in the NOC, means it pumps less than African nations with a smaller geological endowment. Officials say the NOC’s old target of increasing production to 2m b/d by about 2015 is no longer on the table.Industry executives say Libya is not as big a prize as Iraq. There, oil companies – from New York-listed ExxonMobil to Chinese state-owned enterprises – have fought hard to win contracts to develop the industry and boost production from about 2.8m b/d to as much as 6m b/d by 2020. But they acknowledge that the African country has the potential to as much as double its production in the next two decades. Ross Cassidy of the Wood Mackenzie consultancy says today’s leadership “may take Libya into a new era where its natural resources are used more effectively for the benefit of the broader population”, seeking investments to achieve its full production potential of about 3m b/d. For that, it would need to open up fully to international companies with the financial and technical expertise to recover more from mature oilfields.The big prize could lie, however, in another hydrocarbon: natural gas. Libya has been slow in developing its gas industry, particularly when compared with neighbouring Algeria. In 1971, it became the second country – after Algeria – to export supercooled liquefied natural gas using tankers. But the development of the industry has been slow – again partly because of US sanctions, but also because of Col Gaddafi’s lack of interest. Exports, nonetheless, have grown significantly in the last few years, since the opening of the Greenstream underwater pipeline to Italy. Still, Libya exported just 349bn cubic feet of natural gas in 2010; the figure for Algeria was more than 2,000bn cu ft. “Gas was fully ignored during the Gaddafi’s years,” says Mustafa el-Huni, the National Transitional Council member in charge of energy affairs. That will now change, he says. Again, international expertise will be required to build – and finance – the costly plants to export the product.However, much of the future of Libya’s hydrocarbon industry will depend on people such as Mr Ahmad. Looking out over the desert at Zelten, opening his arms as if to embrace the dozens of oil wells scattered across a vast landscape of rolling dunes, he says: “Look at this. Gaddafi used to own it. This is now ours. We will work hard for it.”"
84;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
85;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2011-09-05T16:07:53Z;Colossal task ahead for Libya’s new oil chief;;Six months ago Nuri Berruien was anticipating his retirement from one of the subsidiaries of Libya’s National Oil Company. But the start of the civil-war put paid to his plans.Now the 65-year old petroleum engineer is busier than ever as the newly appointed chairman of the state-owned NOC.“I have a national duty,” he says at the company’s small offices in Benghazi – for months the rebels’ stronghold. Its Tripoli headquarters are not yet considered safe. “The oil industry before the revolution was operated under the worst bureaucratic and corrupted regime.”Mr Berruien’s task is colossal. Before the war, Libya pumped 1.6m barrels a day of high quality crude oil, sought after by European refiners because of its low sulphur content. Now output has fallen to zero.The fall of Muammer Gaddafi’s regime after 42 years could see Libya producing 100,000-300,000 b/d in the next couple of months, from fields in the east – under rebel control since the start of the civil war – and offshore fields in the Mediterranean. But ramping up output to pre-crisis levels will take more than a year under the most optimistic scenario, Mr Berruien acknowledges.The first task for Mr Berruien and his team is to improve security enough to get thousands of workers, scattered across Libya, back to their jobs in remote areas of the country’s oil-rich desert. Even today, after the fall of Tripoli, skirmishes continue in oil areas in the west, and some oilfields are mined.The workers’ return will also be hampered by extensive looting at desert compounds. Vehicles, for example, have been taken away by gangs or used by Col Gaddafi’s army.“We have started to clear the mines. But it will take time,” says Mr Berruien.Lars Nylin, head of Countermine, a company that specialises in landmines removal and is already in Benghazi, says it could take up to 18 months to clear mines and booby traps laid by Col Gaddafi’s forces around the country’s oil infrastructure.However, Mr Berruien says local staff are willing to live for a while in the desert in precarious tent camps until construction companies can rebuild their compounds and supplies – from air conditioners to television sets – arrive.When workers return, they will need to check more than 2,000 oil wells, some deep in the Sahara desert more than 1,000km from the coastline. Even if the wells appear intact, six months of inactivity could have damaged them. “We know that some of the wells will come back [into production] and others will be dead,” Mr Berruien says.He is particularly worried about the wells with submerged pumps, used in the most mature fields such as those of the Sirte basin, which accounts for two-thirds of the country’s production. “We know many pumps will fail,” he says. In those cases, NOC will have to drill new wells, which will mean waiting until spare parts arrive and, most likely, will require the help of foreign contractors yet to return to Libya.“The next step is to build up production, but that will require foreign oil companies’ support,” he says, referring to previous joint ventures between NOC and companies including Eni of Italy, Repsol of Spain, Total of France, OMV of Austria, Wintershall of Germany, and US-based Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Amereda Hess and Marathon.But simply rehabilitating the oilfields would not put Libya back into the global oil market. Pipelines and oil export terminals are another – and bigger – problem. Col Gaddafi’s forces mined a key pipeline hub connecting some of the country’s biggest oilfields with the terminals of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, the most important. And the oil terminals themselves have suffered, particularly their state-of-the-art control rooms. Mr Berruien says he is confident most of the damage can be repaired, however.Overcoming all the obstacles would return Libya to its prewar level of 1.6m b/d in about 15 months or so.But the big prize lies ahead. Mr Berruien firmly believes that the country, which holds Africa’s largest oil reserves, will be able to find new oilfields and boost its production above that level over the next five years.
86;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2011-07-14T19:57:52Z;Shrink-to-grow strategy at heart of Conoco break up;;For years, Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, believed that bigger was better. He oversaw the original merger between Conoco and Phillips that created one of the world’s five largest oil and gas companies. And then he kept on buying.Yet by early 2009, the US economic downtown had exposed the flaws in this strategy. ConocoPhillips disclosed a net loss of $31.8bn in the last quarter of 2008 after a $34bn writedown, together with 1,300 job losses.Praveen Kumar, finance professor at the University of Houston, explained that rising commodity prices had disguised the structural changes taking place in the oil and gas industry. Gaining access to hydrocarbon reserves was becoming ever harder with maturing fields, the rise of resource nationalism and tougher competition from national oil companies.The biggest international companies were scrambling to buy whatever they could, whether it was oil sands in Canada, deepwater fields off the Brazilian coast or shale gas in the US. But all these assets were more expensive to develop and had longer lead times. It had become harder for ConocoPhillips to keep up with its much bigger peers.Mr Mulva duly revised his strategy. First, he stopped buying assets. Then he decided to sell some, fixing a goal of $17bn of disposals by 2012.Now he has chosen to hive off ConocoPhillip’s refining and marketing operation so that the company can focus on exploration and production.“ConocoPhillips has been restructuring its portfolio in an attempt to release shareholder value for the past 18 months,’’ said Fraser McKay, senior corporate analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy. “This is by far the most dramatic event of that period.’’Shareholders have rewarded Mr Mulva for each of his decisions. The shrink-to-grow strategy caused the ConocoPhillips share price to outperform its peers over the past year. The decision to split the company into two new entities led its shares to surge to on Thursday.But Mr McKay cautioned that this did not mean other big oil companies would follow suit. “You’ve got to look at it holistically – a company’s size, scale and the number of businesses it has,’’ he said. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all model.’’That said, Marathon Oil hived off its refining operation two weeks ago – and was rewarded with a surging share price.But analysts note that Marathon and ConocoPhillips were among the smallest of the big integrated companies. The biggest players may have assessed the case for hiving off their refining and marketing operations, but this does not mean they will do the same.“BP has been looking at this,” said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. “But although Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron have rationalised their portfolios, they are staying in the refining business.”These companies continue to believe in the synergies of being in both key segments of the oil business, he said.If they shrink too much, companies risk losing the hedges provided by diversified portfolios. This is particularly important for the exploration and production business, which is exposed to multiple risks, notably the volatility of commodity prices, environmental accidents and the expropriation of assets by foreign governments.The biggest benefit from splitting, said Mr McKay, was allowing companies to focus more clearly on the needs and investments of individual entities. And investors favour this option, he said, because it enables them to decide for themselves how much exposure to refining they want versus exploration and production.The challenge for ConocoPhillips, as an independent, will be its reduced size. Yet Barclays Capital estimates that it will still have more than twice the proven reserves of Occidental Petroleum and Apache, its new peers. Meanwhile, its refining operation will be the second biggest among US independents.“This will be `the super-independent’. But the key to a successful independent is the ability to grow,’’ said Mr West. “Eventually Conoco will have to grow the business.”
87;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;ConocoPhillips unveils break-up plan;;ConocoPhillips, America’s third largest integrated oil company, will hive off its refining assets to focus exclusively on exploration and production.ConocoPhillips announced on Thursday that it will split into two publicly traded entities, spinning off its refining and marketing business by the first half of next year.ConocoPhillips shares rose 7.5 per cent after the announcement. Shares in Marathon Oil have also surged since it announced a similar plan two weeks ago.This marks the second attempt by Jim Mulva, chief executive, to restructure the company, following an earlier acquisition spree. ConocoPhillips is the smallest of the six oil majors.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mulva argued that the company’s refining operations were a drag on the upstream division, especially in the face of increased competition from state-owned oil giants. “[The split] is a result of more and more competition,” he said. “The opportunities to continue to grow as we have in the last ten years have changed dramatically [for the worse].”“The downstream business is really struggling as an industry and the model is all about taking out costs and finding efficiencies,” said Jim DeNaut, Nomura’s head of investment banking for the Americas. “That is very different from the …growth that is going on in the upstream part of the business.”The restructuring will transform ConocoPhillips into a “super independent”, with what Barclays Capital estimates will be more than twice the proved reserves of Occidental Petroleum and Apache, its new peers.The spun-off refining operations will be slightly smaller than Valero Energy’s, making it the US’s second biggest independent refiner.“The cost of upgrading refineries and the potential environmental liabilities …can become a significant drain on capital that could otherwise go to growing the upstream business,” said Michael Hill, Nomura’s global co-head of natural resources.The formal separation of ConocoPhillips is expected to take place in the first half of next year, after which Mr Mulva will retire.Under the terms of the present plan, no shareholder vote would be needed for the separation to proceed. Instead, it would be subject to regulatory approvals and a final decision from the board.ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, has a global portfolio of exploration and refining assets, including a joint venture in the North Sea’s Britannia oilfield.
88;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2011-03-23T23:50:28Z;Britain pulls embassy staff from Yemen;;Britain has withdrawn part of its embassy team from the Yemen capital of Sana’a with “immediate effect” and urged other British nationals to leave ahead of protests expected on Friday.“In light of the rapid deterioration in the security situation in Yemen and the high risk of increased tension in Sana’a and likely protests on Friday 25 March, which might result in violent clashes, part of the British embassy team in Sana’a is being temporarily withdrawn, leaving a small core staff in place,” the Foreign Office said.The withdrawal coincided with news that international oil companies had also started to evacuate staff from Yemen as the escalation of violence threatens the country’s main source of revenue. Austria’s OMV, Norway’s DNO and Occidental Petroleum of the US all said they were pulling expatriate employees out of the country amid political turmoil that on Wednesday forced the president to offer to resign within a year.The moves came as secretary of state Hillary Clinton said the US was “both publicly and privately” making its views known and was still aiming for a “peaceful solution” in the troubled country.But when asked about the two countries’ co-operation on counterterrorism and US assistance to the government of Yemen, Mark Toner, state department spokesman, said: “Assistance is going to continue.”Officials said most international groups in Yemen were withdrawing expatriate staff from the most volatile area of the country, the northern area of Marib.Oil production was still largely unaffected, they said – although the flow of oil from some fields has been halted owing to an explosion at a pipeline last week.Reuters reported that Yemen LNG, the consortium that manages Yemen’s gas production, warned customers of possible curtailments. Total, the largest shareholder in Yemen LNG, did not comment.Yemen accounts for only a small proportion of global oil and gas supplies but the country’s location means the decision will rattle nerves in the oil market. The withdrawal is a sign that the effects of Middle East unrest on the hydrocarbons industry are edging ever closer to Saudi Arabia, the world’s main oil producer. The price of crude has jumped to more than $115 a barrel since unrest first affected the region.Samuel Ciszuk, Middle East energy analyst at consultancy IHS, said: “If forces are being deployed to the heartland of northern Yemen and potentially sucked into a civil war between the main tribes there, international oil companies might quickly find themselves in a physically very vulnerable position.”Ed Meir, senior analyst at MF Global, a brokerage, said Yemen did not matter much in terms of the global oil equation but “the fact that the unrest is taking place in a region responsible for one-third of the world’s oil supply is causing understandable alarm among investors”.The evacuation of oil company staff in Yemen follows the near total shutdown of oil production in Libya, the world’s 12th-largest exporter. Production fell sharply a few days after the oil companies withdrew.Yemen produces about 260,000 b/d, says the International Energy Agency, only 0.3 per cent of the global total, of which more than half is consumed domestically, and 6.7m tonnes of gas a year. That is tiny compared with neighbouring energy giants such as Saudi Arabia or Qatar but energy is Yemen’s most important industry. Hydrocarbons account for 30 per cent of gross domestic product, three-quarters of government revenues, and more than 90 per cent of foreign exchange earnings, according to the US Department of Energy.Additional reporting by Matthew Kennard in Washington
89;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2011-03-20T22:22:53Z;Oil companies fear nationalisation in Libya;;Western oil companies operating in Libya have privately warned that their operations in the country may be nationalised if Colonel Muammer Gaddafi’s regime prevails.Executives, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the rapidly moving situation, believe their companies could be targeted, especially if their home countries are taking part in air strikes against Mr Gaddafi. Allied forces from France, the UK and the US on Saturday unleashed a series of strikes against military targets in Libya.“It is certainly a concern. There are good reserves there,” said one executive at a western oil company with operations in Libya. “We have lost some of our production [because all operations have stopped] but our bigger concern is what will happen to the exploratory work as that gives you a future rather than the immediate impact,” he added.Most of the world’s large international oil companies have producing assets in Libya, including Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total, and Italy’s Eni, which is the largest single investor there. Germany’s Winstershall – a unit of BASF – and OMV of Austria are also present.The country is the world’s 12th largest oil exporter, and the escalating violence there has triggered a jump in prices to nearly $120 a barrel. More than half of Libya’s oil was exported to Italy, Germany and France last year.“International oil companies will find themselves in a precarious position in Libya going forwards, with both the government side and the opposition now pressuring IOCs [international oil companies],” Samuel Ciszuk, senior Middle East energy analyst at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note. “Libya’s regime has a history of treating IOCs as extensions of their home governments, which ultimately risks damaging European and US-based companies”.Shokri Ghanem, the chairman of the Libya’s state-run National Oil Corporation, warned on Saturday that western companies, which have repatriated their staff due to the crisis, should send their employees back to work or risk seeing new oil and gas concessions awarded directly to rivals from China, India and Brazil. The three countries have all stayed neutral throughout the conflict and abstained from Thursday’s United Nations Security Council resolution 1973.Mr Ghanem said Libya had no intention of breaking its existing commitments with foreign oil companies already operating in the country but warned that “we do hope they in turn will honour their agreements with us”.“If they do not then we are forced to talk to others,” he added. Libyan production has fallen 75 per cent to 400,000 barrels a day since the withdrawal of employees by western companies and “could reach a halt”, he warned.The UN has widened its economic sanctions against the regime of Mr Gaddafi, including for the first time the oil sector. In addition to the no-fly zone and threat of air strikes, UN resolution 1973 also stipulates freezing the assets of the National Oil Corporation.While Libya’s state-owned National Oil Company controls the majority of the country’s oil production, international oil companies are key for sustaining output through joint ventures. The National Oil Company is also in full control of at least two of its subsidiaries, its wholly owned Sirte Oil, a joint venture with US-based Occidental Petroleum, and Waha Oil, a joint venture with American oil companies ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Hess.
90;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2011-02-27T16:41:44Z;Assessing risk in dash for resources;BP and BHP have little choice but to look to new frontiers;In the late 1990s oil merger boom, bankers used to say it was easier to find oil on Wall Street than in the ground. Today that adage still holds true.More than $93bn (£58bn) of energy and power deals have been announced so far this year as companies worldwide compete for scarce natural resources to feed surging demand.Last week, BP announced a $7.2bn tie-up with India’s Reliance Industries to help explore Indian deepwater fields, only weeks after agreeing a $16bn share-swap with Rosneft, the Russian state oil company, while BHP Billiton paid $4.75bn in cash for Chesapeake Energy’s shale assets.These deals have one thing in common: risk.Unable to expand their more traditional activities in the face of regulatory and political obstacles, large companies such as BP and BHP have little choice but to look to new frontiers and unfamiliar business lines.After all, BHP only became interested in shale gas after three other deals that made more strategic sense were blocked.Vedanta’s $9.6bn attempt to buy a controlling stake in Cairn India tells a similar story. Not only does the London-listed resources group have no previous experience in oil and gas, but the deal has been delayed by a dispute with the Indian government over royalty payments.These experiments are expensive and companies may want to look at history before they carry on spending shareholder cash.The recent boom in unconventional gas dealmaking is eerily similar to the industry’s 1982 rush into synthetic fuels. In desperation for growth, companies charged into major projects with insufficient knowledge of the economic, environmental and technological problems.The boom came to a dramatic end as estimated construction costs kept escalating and oil majors were forced to scrap huge projects worth billions of dollars.Exxon abandoned the $5bn Colony shale oil project in Colorado – which had widely been seen in the US as a trailblazer for synthetic fuel production.At the same time Occidental Petroleum, Standard Oil of California and Gulf Oil, among others, announced deferrals, delays or outright withdrawals from such ventures.At the time, Exxon’s chief executive likened trying to forecast oil demand, supply and price to trying to paint the wings of an aircraft in flight.Oil and gas companies can no longer paint by numbers when doing deals. But with so much uncertainty about the geopolitics of energy, too many brushstrokes in the wrong direction and there is a danger they end up with a lot of Jackson Pollock.lina.saigol@ft.com
91;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2011-02-17T22:43:45Z;Ties remain strong between US and Bahrain;;“Anything you want on land, sea or air, we can do it.” This is how Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa summed up his support for US policy when he met General David Petraeus, one of the top US army officers, in May 2009.Diplomatic cables from US officials in Bahrain obtained by WikiLeaks and seen by the Financial Times describe how King Hamad, dressed in military uniform, recounted his time in the US Army Command and Staff College at Fort Leavenworth.Underlining the close relations between the US and Bahrain, which could be shaken if his government is overthrown by protests, the king ordered some prime beachfront land to be made available to the US army for family recreation. “It’s the least we can do for these men and women who work for the security of the region,” the king is quoted as saying. Bahrain is home to the Fifth Fleet, the central source of US naval power in the Gulf region, and officials said Bahrain’s king had relied heavily on US equipment and training to build up its own defence force.US diplomats in Manama seemed to underestimate the potential for political unrest. One cable said: “The Bahrain of today is a far cry from the Bahrain of the 1990s. Political parties operate freely …street protests are significantly fewer and less violent.”There is little doubt about the benefits for the US of its friendship with Bahrain. “King Hamad is committed to fighting corruption and prefers doing business with American firms because they are transparent,” said one cable.US companies have won a string of contracts in the country, including Gulf Air’s purchase of 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners.Bahrain’s decision to unleash tear gas and rubber bullets on sleeping demonstrators could indicate the rising power of the ruling family’s more reactionary faction, analysts say.Though outwardly more unified than many Gulf royal families, there are different camps within it who differ on how to deal with the “Shia problem”.The reformist camp is said to include the jocular foreign minister, Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad al-Khalifa, and the Cambridge University-educated crown prince, Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa.Though also concerned about the possible Shia ties to Iran and Iraq, and extremist groups such as Hezbollah, the reformists have in general favoured engaging with the moderate Shia parties.Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, the prime minister for 40 years, has long been seen as the head of the family’s reactionary, pro-Sunni wing.

The project cost is put at $10bn.Occidental beat competing bids to develop Shah from ExxonMobil, Shell and Total, but the price it has been able to extract from the Abu Dhabi side was not disclosed in Thursday’s announcement.Gas from the Shah field, which lies approximately 180km south-west of the city of Abu Dhabi, is difficult and costly to extract, as it has a high content of hydrogen sulphide.But the gas is badly needed in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates because of spiralling energy demand and the need to reinject to maintain oilfield pressure. Gas from Shah is non-associated, or separate from an oilfield.The UAE is pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy in the petrochemical, steel and aluminium industries. However, Abu Dhabi has grown used to cheap, subsidised gas.It pays $1.25 per million British thermal units, a common industry measurement, to Qatar for gas from the Dolphin pipeline. This price is estimated to cover only a quarter of the estimated price of sulphur extraction from Shah.Conoco is understood to have agreed terms under which it was to have been paid $5 per million Btu to extract the gas. Analysts speculated this week that Abu Dhabi would have to pay as much as $8 in current market conditions.Abu Dhabi has managed to make some progress in developing Shah. In May last year Adnoc awarded Saipem of Italy three contracts worth about $3.1bn for a gas processing plant, sulphur recovery and product pipelines, while South Korea’s Samsung Engineering won a $1.5bn contract for the utilities and off-site package.Adnoc awarded a $463m gas gathering package to a consortium of Spain’s Técnicas Reunidas and Punj Lloyd of India. The agreement with Occidental involves “several gas gathering systems, construction of processing trains to process one billion cubic feet per day of gas,” the UAE state news agency said.It had been hoped that Shah would start producing gas around 2013, with a production target for gas sales of between 500m and 700m cubic feet per day.
93;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2011-01-17T17:57:44Z;Abu Dhabi wrestles with gas dilemma;;When Conoco­Phillips announced last April that it was ending an agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to produce sour gas from the Shah field, one of the toughest hydrocarbon deals in the Middle East was back on the table.The US company signed an agreement in 2008 to develop Shah, 180km south-west of Abu Dhabi city, beating competition from Royal Dutch Shell and Occidental Petroleum. The total project cost was estimated at about $10bn.But as Conoco’s withdrawal illustrates, Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates’ capital, faces one of the trickiest gas development dilemmas in the region.Gas is vital to the diversification that the UAE hopes will decrease reliance in the long term on hydrocarbons and boost employment opportunities.But the supply-demand equation for gas is particularly tight. This is because of spiralling electricity consumption, caused by a growing population and demand in the petrochemical, steel and aluminium industries, combined with the need for substantial reinjection of gas into oilfields.Almost half of Abu Dhabi’s daily gas output, or 3.3bn cubic feet a day out of a total of 7.8bn cu ft, is reinjected. Power demand in the UAE is surging at roughly 2 gigawatts a year.But Shah gas is difficult and costly to extract as it has a high content of hydrogen sulphide.Samuel Ciszuk, senior Middle East and North Africa energy analyst for Global Insight, says Conoco and Adnoc agreed a price of about $5 per million British thermal units for treatment of the Shah gas, “which obviously proved to be too low”, he says.An energy expert working in the UAE downstream sector says that Abu Dhabi was “shocked” by the $5 per million Btu original terms set by Conoco. But these prices were still not enough to keep the third-largest US oil company in the game.At the same time, Abu Dhabi has grown used to gas supply budgets at the $1.25 per million Btu it pays Qatar for the use of the Dolphin pipeline. This price is estimated to cover only a quarter of the putative price of sulphur extraction from Shah.Four bidders – Exxon­Mobil, Shell, Total and Occidental – are now seeking to replace Conoco as lead developer of Shah. But it remains to be seen if the 30 per cent sulphur content can be extracted economically and, if so, what price Abu Dhabi is willing to pay.“The area does not have a gas supply crisis – it has a gas pricing crisis,” says Morten Frisch, senior partner at UK-based Morten Frisch Consulting.Mr Ciszuk adds: “Other IOCs [international oil companies] are going to demand higher prices [than Conoco], but will keep a tight lid on any numbers leaking out.”The difficulty in marketing the excess sulphur produced by Shah is another problem.“There is no global price for gas. Most Middle East governments are not willing to do what the rest of the world has done: pay a price that at least encourages exploration,” says Philip Weems, Singapore managing partner for law firm King & Spalding who was based in Dubai for three years.Gas from Qatar via the Dolphin pipeline is “very, very discounted”, he says. “The old deals were done on a political rather than a commercial basis.”Such is gas’s importance to oilfield development that Abu Dhabi’s oft-touted plans to increase daily oil production to about 3m b/d have never materialised. The reinjection supplies of gas simply do not exist.The UAE has also failed to obtain further supplies from Qatar or Iran.Qatar has placed a moratorium on more exploitation of its gas reserves which makes it unlikely that it will supply the UAE further at original Dolphin price levels. It also prefers to sell on global markets to recoup heavy investment in its international liquefied natural gas supply chain.Iran, hard pressed to supply its domestic market competitively, is no longer regarded as a serious participant, says Mr Weems.“[The Shah] project is more than two years delayed,” says the downstream expert in the UAE. “Still, Adnoc sees the treatment cost as too high to finally approve. They are waiting for costs to fall, but they will have no choice.”The government must step in to make a decision for Adnoc, he believes, biting the bullet by paying about $8 per million Btu.A lawyer acting for the government of Abu Dhabi refused to comment. In the meantime, Abu Dhabi and its putative partners have no choice but to continue negotiating to reach a mutually acceptable deal.
94;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-12-17T18:27:21Z;Total and Suncor in oil sands alliance;;France’s Total and Canada’s Suncor Energy have formed a partnership to help both groups develop their projects in the Alberta oil sands.Rick George, Suncor’s chief executive, said on Friday that the deal would give his company access to Total’s global reach while the French energy group would benefit from Suncor’s well-established oil sands development technology.Suncor has been operating in the oil sands for more than four decades and is one of the biggest producers.“Together, we will be able to pool our manpower and capital resources and bring our collective strengths to bear to manage these projects,” Mr George said.Under the deal, Total will acquire a 49 per cent stake in Suncor’s planned Voyageur upgrader, which processes the bitumen-like oil sands into crude oil. The facility, Suncor’s third upgrader, is expected to have a capacity of 200,000 barrels a day.Total will also increase its stake in the long-stalled Fort Hills oil sands project from 20 per cent to 39 per cent.Suncor’s interest in Fort Hills will fall from 60 per cent to 41 per cent. The remaining 20 per cent is held by Teck Resources, the Vancouver-based metals group.Meanwhile, Total’s interest in the Joslyn project will drop from 75 per cent to 38 per cent, with Suncor acquiring a 37 per cent stake. Occidental Petroleum holds 15 per cent of Joslyn.Suncor will operate the Fort Hills project, and Total will oversee Joslyn.The two companies have agreed to press ahead in tandem with construction of a mine at the Fort Hills property as well as the new Voyageur upgrader, with both scheduled to come on stream in 2016. The slide in crude oil prices since mid-2008 and rising operating costs in the oil sands had brought the viability of the two projects under closer scrutiny.As part of the deal announced on Friday, Total will pay Suncor C$1.75bn (US$1.73bn) in cash.Yves-Louis Darricarriere, head of Total’s exploration and production unit, said that the partnership “will allow us to strengthen our portfolio of Canadian oil sands assets, opening new opportunities to develop this strategically important energy resource”.Total has been one of the most active foreign players in the oil sands, with a series of acquisitions in recent years. Besides the projects covered by the deal with Suncor, it owns 50 per cent of two other projects, known as Surmont and Northern Lights.
95;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-12-12T20:44:40Z;China taps into Argentina’s oil prospects;;When China’s largest oil producer looked overseas 14 years ago for places to invest, it settled on the then-untapped riches of Sudan.That investment, in 1996, kicked off a string of deals in Africa, as Chinese state-owned oil companies snapped up resources in countries often deemed untouchable by western companies.But today the Chinese oil majors are sending their money in a different direction: Latin America, which has dominated headlines this year for upstream oil and gas deals. Chinese oil companies have spent more than $15bn in upstream deals there this year – and industry executives say there is more to come.“There is not a single CEO of a major oil company in Latin America, not one, who has not been approached by the Chinese,” says an M&A banker at a western bank.Last week’s decision by China Petrochemical Corp to buy Occidental Petroleum’s operations in Argentina for $2.45bn has underscored the trend. The deal came on the heels of Cnooc and Bridas’s agreement to pay $7bn for BP’s 60 per cent stake in Argentina’s Pan American Energy.Earlier this year, Cnooc invested $3.1bn for a 50 per cent stake in Bridas, a private energy company, describing the deal as a “beachhead in Latin America”.The shift towards the region is happening partly because China’s oil groups are increasingly confident of competing against their western peers in mergers and acquisitions. Some of China’s earliest overseas oil deals, such as in Sudan, were negotiated on a government-to-government basis, a far cry from a modern corporate boardroom setting.“Five or 10 years ago the Chinese [oil] companies were buying assets by negotiating directly with a limited number of countries, and there’s a certain shifting perception now,” says Gavin Thompson, head of north-east Asia for consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “They are operating in the real world now, alongside all these other companies who have been doing this sort of thing for far longer in terms of international growth and deals.”Argentina and Brazil have benefited from the trend. This year, when a share in the Peregrino oilfield off the coast of Brazil went up for sale, at least two Chinese oil companies joined the bidding fray. The state-owned chemicals group, Sinochem, emerged victorious with its $3.1bn offer, even though it had less than a decade of offshore drilling experience.Argentina’s oil industry has seen the deal as a key sign of confidence at a time when many western oil groups are put off the country’s onerous tax regime and heavy state regulation, and are hoping that it will boost upstream investment. China’s oil majors can afford to take longer-term bets than some of their western peers, thanks to state support at home and access to cheap credit.One senior Cnooc executive admits: “Argentina has a tough fiscal regime. But that even happens in Australia.” Cnooc is betting Argentina’s energy tax policies may change soon. “We see some encouraging signs that it is going in the right direction,” the executive adds.The announcement by YPF, the former Argentine state monopoly controlled by Spain’s Repsol, of a huge 4,500bn cubic feet discovery of tight gas in the province of Neuquén – equivalent, if confirmed, to a third of Argentina’s current gas reserves – is only likely to intensify Chinese interest.Argentina has potentially rich oil and gas reserves offshore, but investment in exploration overall has been constrained by price controls.BP’s stake in Pan American Energy, while money-making, was seen as peripheral to the British company’s operations for this reason.“China is probably the only country that would actually buy in [to Argentina], because of the political pricing system there,” says Laban Yu, oil and gas analyst at Macquarie in Hong Kong.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………Mineral resources provide additional attractionIn 2004, China’s investments in Argentina added up to a mere $12.9m, according to Julián Peña, a lawyer who sits on the board of the Argentine-Chinese Chamber of Commerce, writes Jude Webber in Buenos AiresBy 2009 that had grown tenfold to $136.7m. This year has seen a series of energy deals, including last week’s decision by Sinochem to buy Occidental Petroleum Corp’s operations in Argentina for $2.45bn. And earlier this year, China promised to invest a further $10bn in Argentina’s rail network.The bulk of China’s interest has been in energy, but the country is also hungry for other resources in which Argentina is rich, including minerals and fertilisers. It is investing some $600m in urea production in Tierra del Fuego in southern Argentina, and Shandong Gold has also reached a deal to explore for gold in the northern province of La Rioja.“Argentina has huge mineral potential – there is a large percentage of the country which is unexplored,” said Damián Altgelt, head of mining executives’ chamber CAEM. He said the legal regime in the sector was “quite favourable” despite Argentina’s often unpredictable politics.China is a big customer for Argentina’s agricultural commodities and is planning a $100m project in the southern province of Río Negro to grow soyabeans for domestic consumption. It has also invested in the Belgrano Cargas railway line which is vital for Argentine soyabean transport, and has fishing ventures.“China has been sending committees and groups of Chinese officials constantly for the last few years. They are making a lot of effort to understand how things work here,” said Juan Duggan, a lawyer whose firm, Hope, Duggan & Silva is active in negotiations with China.China is involved in bidding for port and dredging operations in the construction of a new port in the city of La Plata near Buenos Aires.
96;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-12-11T02:04:47Z;Occidental sells off Argentine venture;;Occidental Petroleum is quitting its investments in Argentina, where political difficulties have hampered growth, to move aggressively into US shale oil and conventional gas.Among a series of moves announced on Friday, the US company said it was buying oil and gas properties in South Texas and North Dakota for about $3.2bn. That announcement came after China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, also known as Sinopec, said it has agreed to buy Occidental’s Argentine operations for $2.45bn.The news came as the US group is looking to re-balance its operations to focus on its traditional business of enhanced oil recovery – using new techniques to extract more oil from mature fields – and increase its investment in shale gas.“These transactions will be immediately accretive to our earnings, return on capital employed and cash flow after capital. With these new acquisitions and without Argentina in our asset mix, achieving both our short-term and long-term average annual production growth outlook of 5-8 per cent will be more certain and will generate higher returns,” said Ray Irani, Occidental chief executive.“In light of our outlook for improved free cash flow, the board has agreed to increase our common dividend rate by 21 per cent from 38 cents per quarter to 46 cents per quarter effective with the April 15th payment,” he added.It also said it was boosting its stake in pipeline operator Plains All American’s general partner to approximately 35 per cent and acquiring the remaining 50 per cent joint venture interest in the Elk Hills power plant.Occidental expects all of the transactions to be completed no later than the end of the first quarter of 2011.The South Texas assets will be purchased from Royal Dutch Shell for about $1.8bn. Shell has owned and operated the properties for many years. With this sale the Anglo-Dutch oil company has reached its target of raising $8bn from disposals a year ahead of schedule.Occidental has a history of buying mature assets and squeezing more fuel out of them with new technology.Occidental’s deal to sell its Argentine assets to Sinopec comes less than two weeks after China’s previous multibillion-dollar acquisition in the Argentine energy sector – China National Offshore Oil Corporation and local partner Bridas agreed to make a joint $7bn purchase of a stake in Pan American Energy at the end of November.Sinopec said in a statement that the acquisition of Occidental’s operations would “prove significant in cementing economic ties and boosting trade between China and Argentina”.Latin America’s rich resources are increasingly of interest to China.
97;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-12-10T20:21:56Z;Shell hits $8bn disposals target;;Royal Dutch Shell has reached its target of raising $8bn (£5.1bn) through disposals a year ahead of schedule, after agreeing to sell some of its gasfields in South Texas to Occidental Petroleum for $1.8bn.The Anglo-Dutch oil major planned to raise between $7bn and $8bn through sales of non-core assets by the end of 2011.Shell is among a number of oil majors selling assets as part of an effort to improve the quality of reserves and increase investment in exploration and acquisitions.Recent disposals announced by Shell include part of its holding in Woodside Petroleum in Australia for just over $3bn and the sale of refining assets in Sweden and Finland for about $1bn. The company is also selling onshore acreage in Nigeria and further refining assets in Europe.“We are concentrating our investment on the most promising growth opportunities and that means taking a hard look at existing assets like our fields in South Texas, where we have been active for more than 50 years,” said Marvin Odum, director of upstream for Shell in the Americas, in a statement.The sale to Occidental, announced on Friday, involves predominantly mature fields, which produce more than 200m cubic feet a day.Shell’s North American onshore gas business remains a growing part of its portfolio. Earlier this year it acquired acreage in the Eagle Ford area of South Texas and bought the majority of East Resources, a private company with significant holdings in the highly prospective Marcellus Shale gas area in the eastern US.The company last year produced 810m cubic feet of natural gas from onshore assets. With acquisitions in 2010, the Shell portfolio includes about 40,000bn cubic feet of natural gas resources, the energy equivalent of nearly 7bn barrels of oil.Peter Voser, Shell chief executive, hinted at potential disposals in North America at the time of the East Resources deal in May.“The opportunity now is to consolidate our tight gas portfolio, divest from non-core positions across North America, and to invest for profitable growth, by deploying Shell’s technology and capabilities on a large scale,” he said.Oil companies are looking at new sources of gas, such as extraction from shale rock, as many conventional fields reach maturity.The emergence of shale gas, which has only become economically viable in the past five years as a result of technological advances, has transformed the North American energy market.Shares in Shell rose 0.91 per cent to £20.49 in London. Occidental shares were up 1.57 per cent to $92.50 in New York.
98;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-11-22T17:26:34Z;Companies hold out over Ecuador’s oil plan;;Ecuador’s negotiations with five foreign oil groups are expected to go down to the wire on Tuesday, the deadline for the companies to accept a demotion to service-provider status or leave the country.President Rafael Correa told state media at the weekend that two of the five foreign oil companies were holding out. “We’ve lost a pair of companies, what a shame,” he said. “Service contracts will be signed with a majority of companies. Maybe a couple that want to leave the country will have their concessions terminated.”Previously, Wilson Pastor, Ecuador’s oil minister, had said “99.9 per cent” of companies were ready to accept a new oil law, which will see the state take control of 100 per cent of the country’s oil resources and remunerate operators for their investments and production.The five oil companies are Brazil’s Petrobras, Repsol of Spain, Italy’s Eni and China’s PetroOriental and Andes Petroleum.Mr Correa’s comments fuelled rumours that Ecuador TLC, a unit of Petrobras, was planning to pull out of the country, although the company has declined to comment.The Chinese companies have voiced concerns about “a lack of transparency” in the negotiations and threatened to seek international arbitration if necessary.Ecuador has withdrawn from ICSID, the World Bank international arbitration facility, and from bilateral investment protection treaties with the UK and Germany, but it still has a treaty with China.A spokesman for Repsol said that negotiations were ongoing and the company would evaluate the talks once they concluded.Given Ecuador’s 2009 seizure of oilfields operated by France’s Perenco and the 2006 takeover of fields operated by Occidental Petroleum of the US, the companies are taking seriously Mr Correa’s threat to force them out of Ecuador if they do not agree to terms.Mr Correa has said companies will be compensated for their assets should they leave and that Petroecuador and its unit Petroamazonas will be able to take over foreign-run fields if the companies leave Ecuador.But the president, a US-educated economist, faces budgetary pressure in the face of falling oil production, reduced flows of foreign investment and the difficulty of seeking credit because of the country’s 2008 default on $3.2bn in foreign debt.Foreign oil companies have invested as little as possible throughout the negotiations over new contracts, and crude output to August fell 2.6 per cent in annual terms.
99;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-10-19T22:03:02Z;Occidental ahead 29% in quarter;Strong 6.5 per cent production growth;Occidental Petroleum recorded strong 6.5 per cent production growth in the third quarter to push net profit up 29 per cent to $1.2bn.The production growth translated into 751,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day – the highest ever produced by the US’s fourth biggest oil company.Daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 705,000 barrels of oil quivalent in the third quarter of 2009.The rapid production growth, combined with high oil prices, enabled the company to report earnings per share of $1.47, far above analyst expectations of around $1.35 a share.Occidental’s volume growth was primarily in the Middle East/north Africa, with smaller increases in Argentina and the US.Analysts are anticipating it will maintain the pace, given its international holdings, as well as an important find in California last year.Last July, Occidental announced the biggest oil find in California in 35 years, a field some analysts estimate could hold 1bn-2bn barrels and mark the start of a new era of exploration in the US.
100;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-10-15T01:11:41Z;Occidental overhauls pay structure;;Occidental Petroleum has overhauled its pay practices for top executives following a barrage of investor criticism for the lavish compensation package awarded last year to Ray Irani, its longtime chief executive.Mr Irani will step down as chief executive in May, Occidental said Thursday, and will be replaced by Steve Chazen. Mr Irani’s 2009 pay of $52.2m prompted an outcry from key institutional shareholders, including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System.Mr Chazen, president and chief operating officer, and other top executives will be paid under a new structure meant to bring Occidental’s compensation practices in line with those of its peers. The new plan was among several reforms announced on Thursday by the board after shareholders objected to Mr Irani’s pay and his failure to step down after reaching retirement age of 75. The board said Mr Irani had agreed to retire as chief executive at the May 2011 annual shareholder meeting. He will remain executive chairman, focusing on corporate strategy, Middle East operations and international business development, but under the new, reduced pay structure.Two board members who have passed retirement age – John Chalsty and Irvin Maloney – will also step down.“These initiatives are an excellent example of how shareholders and a proactive board of directors can work together to solve complex governance issues,’’ said Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at the Calstrs.Calstrs and Relational Investors, which own 1.24 per cent of shares outstanding, have been pressing for the changes for months.“The board feels that we have been very responsive,’’ said Spencer Abraham, chairman of the compensation committee.Last year Mr Irani earned almost double the salary of Rex Tillerson, chief executive of ExxonMobil, the US’ biggest oil company.The new pay programme, which applies to all senior Occidental executives, relies heavily on performance-based total shareholder return incentives.They are measured against a 12-company peer group. If Occidental performs in the bottom 25 per cent of its peer group over a three-year period, the chief executive will not receive any TSRI-related compensation.Maximum pay-out of TSRIs will occur only if Occidental’s cumulative three-year TSRI performance ranks first and outperforms the S&P 500.The most Mr Irani could receive under this plan would be $20m. Under the previous system, he could have received $90m on a $1.3m salary and a bonus of $2.2m.The base pay and bonuses for Mr Irani and Mr Chazen will only be narrowly adjusted in their new roles.The rest of the long-term incentives will be tax-qualified restricted shares, with a minimum vesting period of three years.
101;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-10-14T02:50:40Z;Occidental set to replace chief;;Occidental Petroleum is moving to replace Ray Irani, chief executive, whose $52m pay package last year made him one of the most lavishly compensated executives in corporate America.Occidental is expected to name Steve Chazen, chief operating officer and president, to replace Mr Irani, whose pay came under heavy criticism from some prominent institutional shareholders.Sources close to the talks told the Financial Times that the board had met on Wednesday to vote on the proposal and that the meetings were expected to continue on Thursday.The proposal to replace Mr Irani was widely expected to be passed.Mr Irani is expected to retain his position as chairman of Occidental, the fourth-largest oil group in the US. Mr Irani is 75, the retirement age for the company directors, but the board waived the age limit for him and two other directors.Two key institutional shareholders, Relational Investors and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, have said they would seek to replace at least four directors at Occidental’s 2011 annual meeting, underlining investor unhappiness with Mr Irani’s pay and combined power in the two top jobs.The move will be seen as a victory for shareholder activists.CalSTRS in the past had criticised the Occidental board for setting up “a giveaway programme where tens of millions of dollars of pay is not truly at risk”.Richard Kline, Occidental spokesman, declined to comment.
102;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-10-01T23:05:10Z;BP to cut assets in Gulf of Mexico;;BP is looking to reduce the number of operatorships it holds in the Gulf of Mexico as part of a move to cut its capital spending and rebalance its portfolio of assets in the wake of the Macondo oil spill.The UK oil group produces from more than 20 deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico and is the biggest operator in the region, as well as the largest licence holder.Until the accident on April 20, the US was BP’s principal strategic focus but the company faces a challenge to restore its reputation.It plans to raise up to $30bn (£19bn) from asset disposals within the next 18 months and has said it will cut capital spending by about 10 per cent this year to raise funds to help pay for the costs of the spill.Analysts have said it would make sense for BP to realise some of the value of the licences it holds in the Gulf of Mexico and people familiar with the matter confirmed BP was considering reducing the number of operatorships it holds there.Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, told the Financial Times earlier this week that while there might be some asset sales in the US, it would remain an area of strategic focus.BP declined to comment but on Friday confirmed it has relinquished its operatorship at Tubular Bells, a deepwater field discovered in 2003 and about 135km southeast of New Orleans, to Hess, the US company.Hess will pay $40m for an additional 20 per cent stake, raising its holding to 40 per cent.BP will retain a 30 per cent stake.BP had said in March it intended to make a final investment decision on the field later this year.BP is making progress with its asset sales. The company has so far raised almost $10bn, notably from a $7bn sale of onshore gas assets in the US, Canada and Egypt to Apache, the US independent oil and gas group.Apache had been in talks with BP about taking a stake in its Alaskan fields but that deal foundered.BP is considering an alternative plan which would see it transfer the operatorship of the Prudhoe Bay field to one of its existing partners, and then selling a stake.Analysts said Apache and Occidental were potential buyers of the stake.BP has been in talks with TNK-BP, its Russian joint venture, about several asset sales.A formal offer for BP’s assets in Venezuela and Vietnam could come as early as next week.Tony Hayward, who resigned as chief executive of BP after the spill, is joining the board of TNK-BP.BP’s shares rose 3 per cent to 440.9p on Friday.
103;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-09-05T21:43:57Z;BP revives bid to sell Alaskan assets;;BP has revived the sale of its fields in Alaska after failing to dispose of them to Apache of the US earlier this year. The UK oil group is hoping to sell part of its stake in Prudhoe Bay, the giant Alaskan field, according to banking sources.BP had been in negotiations with Apache, a US independent oil and gas group, to sell it half of its 26 per cent stake in Prudhoe Bay as part of a package of assets. That deal, however, became too complex and Apache finally agreed to pay $7bn for onshore gas assets in the US, Canada and Egypt.Apache is still seen as a buyer by industry bankers, who also cited Occidental, a US group, as another potential suitor. It is not known whether BP would be willing to sell the entire stake, which would include the operatorship of the field.BP remains in talks with its Russian venture, TNK-BP, to sell its assets in Venezuela. TNK-BP is understood to be willing to look at other assets offered for sale by BP, including those in Vietnam.The disposals are part of BP’s plan to raise up to $30bn from asset sales to help pay for the Gulf of Mexico spill. BP declined to comment on the details of its asset disposal programme.The company will this week publish its internal report into the causes of the April 20 accident by Mark Bly, its group head of safety and operations. The report is the first of several into the spill.BP said in July that it did not believe it was grossly negligent – a charge that would need to be proved if the company were to be fined the maximum of $21bn under the Clean Water Act in the US.BP revealed on Friday that its bill for cleaning up after the spill had reached $8bn.At the weekend the company recovered a vital piece of equipment from the seabed.The blow-out preventer, the stack of valves designed to prevent oil and gas from escaping but which appeared to have failed, has been taken into custody by the US Department of Justice as evidence in its own investigation into the accident, BP said in a statement on Sunday.Thad Allen, the US national incident commander, said on Saturday that the installation of a new blow-out preventer had “basically secured” the Macondo well.“I am pleased to announce that this well does not constitute a threat to the Gulf of Mexico at this point,” the retired Coast Guard admiral said.
104;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-08-30T21:01:30Z;Dodd-Frank act presents companies with a PR minefield;;"Is a chief executive’s job 19 times more valuable than that of the US president and hundreds of times more valuable than the average worker in his or her company?Such comparisons might seem invidious to high earners such as Larry Ellison of Oracle, who made $85m last year – according to Equilar, an executive pay research firm – or Ray Irani of Occidental Petroleum Corp, whose $31m pay last year triggered shareholder unrest.But company chiefs are set to face a fresh wave of unflattering publicity over the many multiples of their average employee’s take-home pay that they deem themselves to be worth.A little-noticed provision in the mammoth Dodd-Frank financial reform act will force companies to disclose regularly the ratio of the median annual pay of all their employees to that of their chief executive.The measure raises potential public relations problems for some of the US’s biggest companies, as well as significant administrative burdens. The published ratios will vary significantly but some may look alarmingly unfair to the eyes of the average small shareholder.The $1,025,000 median salary of an S&P500 chief executive last year, according to the Equilar analysis, is 25 times the $40,174 that official statistics show was paid to the average US private sector employee. The chief executive’s $7.5m median total pay package, including bonuses and stock options, is 187 times that average private sector pay and some 19 times President Barack Obama’s basic $400,000 salary.The value or otherwise of such comparators in assessing boardroom remuneration has long been argued. Business fears the new disclosure requirement will simply add confusion to an already-emotive debate.The provision was inserted into the Dodd-Frank bill “at the last minute, with no discussion and not based on any particular problem”, says Charles Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware. He categorised the pay ratio as a “thrill disclosure” that would generate headlines without offering meaningful comparisons.“This is a political disclosure, as opposed to an economic disclosure, and that’s the problem,” Prof Elson adds.Lawyers caution that the formula mandated by the act has some seemingly perverse consequences, in terms of factors that will produce a low ratio – an apparent but potentially misleading sign of a company without excessive executive remuneration.“It will favour companies that outsource and use independent contractors, and those that use
franchised rather than company-owned stores, since these relatively low paid jobs will not count towards the median tally,” says Richard Susko, a partner at law firm Cleary Gottlieb.Many of the crucial factors affecting the ratio have been left to the discretion
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has to draw up the regulations to implement the new rule. The act does not specify whether non-US employees need to be included in the total, the treatment of subsidiaries and affiliates, the date on which the pay needs to be calculated each year or the exchange rates to be used.Business groups say they want to work with the SEC to try to craft a “consistent and digestible” measure. “The big concern we have is that a lot of work and clarification needs to be done on this,” says Larry Burton, chief executive of the Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of the biggest US companies.But whatever the SEC decides, the regulation is expected to create a potentially significant administrative burden. George Paulin, chairman and chief executive of the pay consultancy Frederick W Cook & Co, predicts that the “procedure will be so complex that you will have to hire someone whose sole job will be to manage the preparation of the CEO pay ratio”.Additional reporting by Francesco Guerrera"
105;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-07-23T18:47:17Z;Bankers overpaid by $1.6bn during crisis;;Citigroup, Bank of America and 15 other bailed-out financial services companies overpaid their top executives by $1.6bn during the height of the financial ­crisis, according to a review by the White House’s ­special master on Wall Street compensation.Kenneth Feinberg, who was appointed last year by Barack Obama, president, to oversee the pay policies at the companies that received the greatest government support, began in March his latest inquiry into top executives’ compensation from late 2008 to early 2009.While the payments were legal at the time, Mr Feinberg said on Friday, they would have fallen foul of restrictions the government set for participants in its troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).Citi topped the list on excessive pay, thanks in large part to the compensation of several star employees at the bank’s Phibro commodities trading unit, people familiar with the matter said. Citi sold the business to Occidental Petroleum last year.“Getting our compensation structure right is a priority for us,” a Citi spokeswoman said. “Since the crisis, we have done a lot of work to make sure it is performance-based and we look forward to reviewing the special master’s recommendations.”The other companies cited by the special master were: American Express, American International Group, Boston Private Financial Holdings, Capital One Financial, CIT Group, JPMorgan Chase. M&T Bank, Morgan Stanley, Regions Financial, SunTrust Banks, Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, PNC Financial Services Group, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo.While Mr Feinberg no longer had the authority to police compensation at those that had paid back the government’s investment, he used a “look back” provision in the statute to ask for more information about their pay during a window between the start of the Tarp and when new restrictions on executive pay took effect.Mr Feinberg reviewed what the 419 companies that received government assistance before February 2009 had paid their top 25 executives. The institutions were required to submit details on employees who earned more than $500,000.Eleven of the 17 companies cited by the special master have repaid the government for its assistance during the crisis. And, while Mr Feinberg conceded that none of the retention awards, bonuses, golden parachutes and other payments that appear excessive today was “contrary to the public interest”, he proposed the companies adopt a new policy that would supersede pay guarantees granted to executives.Mr Feinberg implored companies to give their boards’ compensation committees the right to restructure, reduce or cancel payments to executives during times of crisis.In October, he had moved to slash the 2009 cash compensation of the top executives at the seven companies within his jurisdiction by an average of 90 per cent from a year earlier.In December, Mr Feinberg took aim at a second tier of managers, setting a $500,000 salary limit for hundreds of employees at the companies that were still under his thumb. The White House last month appointed Mr Feinberg as administrator of BP’s fund to pay claims from the oil company’s devastating spill. He will leave his current post as “pay tsar” in August.
106;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-07-12T18:16:46Z;Volatility spells headache for hedge funds;;A hedge fund founded by former Citigroup star energy trader Andrew Hall has lost money for a second straight month as broad concerns about the economy have weighed down specialised commodity markets.Mr Hall’s Astenbeck commodities fund reported a slide of 2.2 per cent in June, according to a report to investors. After a 10 per cent fall in May the fund has lost 11.8 per cent this year. “We feel frustrated with our performance and that we have not been able to capitalise on significant moves within what is for the time being a range-bound market, meanwhile losing money on core positions,” Mr Hall said in a letter to investors.Mr Hall is head of Phibro, the oil and gas trading unit that Citi sold to Occidental Petroleum last year under government pressure over his potential $100m pay package. Astenbeck, which he formed in January, manages about $2bn, according to an investor document. The fund is planning to close to new investors on August 1, according to an investor. Astenbeck declined to comment.Energy hedge funds have endured a tough 2010, struggling to gain a foothold in choppy markets and hit by a few surprise price jumps. Through May, the HFRX Commodity Energy Index was down 2.3 per cent, according to Hedge Fund Research.Oil has traded between $70 and $80 a barrel since early June. Nymex August West Texas Intermediate yesterday lost 84 cents to $75.25 a barrel, while ICE August Brent was 76 cents lower at $74.66. Crude has lost 14 per cent from this year’s peak in early April, despite signs of growing demand, as investors fled risky assets and contemplated slower growth.Mr Hall told investors the third quarter should bring a big seasonal increase in oil demand, a potential boost for prices. “However, global macro concerns may swamp these considerations for the time being.”“It is now clear that the strong pace of cyclical recovery has slackened, giving rise to fears of a double dip,” he added. “The precedents for this are few and far between. But these are unusual times.”Elsewhere, industrial commodity markets fell yesterday after a run of gains, highlighting the volatility that is giving hedge funds a headache.Base metals were hit by China’s latest trade data. Although the data showed strong exports, indicating robust demand outside of China, imports of key commodities such as copper and iron were significantly lower. Unwrought copper imports fell 17 per cent in June from May, in part due to a seasonal slowdown, although analysts pointed out that imports of copper scrap actually rose.Nonetheless, copper for delivery in three months fell 1.5 per cent to $6,645 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange, while aluminium dropped 1.4 per cent and zinc was 2.4 per cent lower.Daniel Brebner, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said value was beginning to emerge in some of the metals, but cautioned: “Prices are likely to remain under pressure over the next couple of months at least.”CBOT July soyabeans gained 1.5 per cent to a fresh six-month high of $10.42 a bushel on the back of China’s record imports of 6.2m tonnes in June.
107;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-06-01T23:35:10Z;BP attempts fresh plug of Gulf leak;;BP moved to control the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by attempting to fit a cap over the valves that were meant to prevent oil and gas from leaking out, the company’s chief executive said on Tuesday.Tony Hayward was speaking as the Obama administration stepped up pressure on the company with the announcement of a criminal investigation.Talking to the Financial Times in Houston, Texas, his base throughout the crisis, Mr Hayward said BP’s attempt to plug the leak with a “top kill”– pumping in heavy drilling fluid – had been “executed flawlessly from a technical point of view”, but had failed because of problems with the condition of the well.The latest attempt to tackle the spill involves trying to fit a containment cap over the failed blow-out preventer – the stack of valves on the seabed intended to stop oil and gas leaking out.Engineers from BP and other companies in Houston and out in the Gulf were using remote-controlled submarines to work on the first stage of that exercise: cutting away the broken pipes from the top of the blow-out preventer to allow the cap to be fitted.BP’s urgent need to stop the leak was demonstrated on Tuesday by the steep fall in its share price, in the first day that UK and US markets were open since the top kill failed.Investors’ concerns are now focused not so much on the direct cost to BP as on the damage to its position in the US, which accounts for about 40 per cent of its business.Analysts’ estimates of the potential direct costs to BP – for the clean-up and potential damages – now range up to $20bn.Jason Kenney of ING suggested a possible maximum cost of about that level, although his “best guess” remains about $5bn-$6bn.Jon Rigby of UBS estimated a cost of about $18bn to BP, which he described as “enormous but still containable”. The company is expected to make profits of about $20bn this year alone, while the spill costs will be spread over several years.More worrying for investors is the threat of BP losing its position in the US, the country that provides about 40 per cent of its profits.Energy is always a highly politicised industry, and relations between BP and the White House have been soured by the disaster.BP is the largest oil and gas producer in the Gulf of Mexico, and had hoped that its efforts in deep-water drilling in the region would be one of its main sources of growth. If the company is prevented from acquiring any more licences, or from drilling on acreage that it has already acquired, then that growth will come more slowly, if ever.The prospect of that pressure on BP’s future revenues has fostered speculation that the company could be a takeover target.A bid would be ferociously complex, and likely to run into problems with the competition authorities. BP’s board and many shareholders would also resist any attempt to sell the company on the cheap.Potential buyers are also likely to be scared off by the uncertainty over BP’s potential liabilities.Dougie Youngson, an analyst at Arbuthnot, was among those speculating on Tuesday that BP could be a target. “This situation has a real possibility of breaking the company,” he wrote.After the Piper Alpha disaster in the British North Sea in 1988, Occidental Petroleum, the platform’s operator, sold all its oil and gas assets in the region.No one is suggesting that BP is at all close to pulling out in the same way. But the prospect that the company’s business could become much more difficult in the US for many years to come is likely to continue to unsettle investors.
108;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-04-28T13:28:18Z;Conoco pulls out of Abu Dhabi gas project;;ConocoPhillips is pulling out of a multibillion dollar joint venture to develop a gas field in Abu Dhabi as part of a restructuring aimed at shoring up its balance sheet.The withdrawal is a significant setback for Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, as the Shah onshore gas field is critical to its plans to meet soaring energy demand.“The Shah gas field will be a world-class project that will develop a key resource for Abu Dhabi and the region, and it was a difficult decision not to participate in a project of this importance,” said Ryan Lance, Conoco senior vice-president.Conoco started to restructure after investors began pulling back from the company at the start of 2009, when it announced a $34bn writedown on the reduction in the value of its assets due to falling commodity prices. It also announced 1,300 job cuts and said it would end its strategy of acquisitions.Conoco has since begun to pull out of planned projects. Last week, Conoco said it was withdrawing from a project to build a 400,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Saudi Arabia with Saudi Aramco, the kingdom’s state oil company.The US company signed an agreement to develop the Shah field in 2008, beating competition from Royal Dutch Shell and Occidental Petroleum. The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company held a 60 per cent stake in the joint venture, with Conoco the remaining 40 per cent. It has been estimated the project would cost about $10bn.The emirate, which is home to more than 90 per cent of the UAE’s oil and gas reserves, is expected to keep the project alive because of its importance to its energy strategy. But it will now have to decide whether to develop it alone or look for another international partner.Shah, a so-called sour gas field, is seen as an important test of the emirate’s ability to develop its gas resources, much of which has a high content of hydrogen sulphide. This makes it highly corrosive, as well as expensive and technically challenging to develop.The project has already suffered delays, but it was hoped that Shah would start production in 2013, with a target for sales gas of between 500m and 700m cubic feet per day.At the beginning of 2007, the UAE had proven gas reserves of 214,000bn cu ft, the world’s fifth largest. But, as with other nations in the oil-rich Gulf, the UAE faces gas shortages as its population grows and its emirates embark on highly ambitious development plans. The UAE is already a net importer of gas, importing 2bn cu ft per day from Qatar.
109;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-03-03T18:11:02Z;Citi beefs up commodities business;Hiring spree planned to boost number of traders and bankers;Citigroup is planning a hiring spree in commodities over three years, boosting the number of traders and bankers by 40 per cent, as it seeks to regain impetus after last year’s sale of its Phibro oil trading unit.The move to boost the bank’s front-office staff by 100 people to about 335 comes as rival banks expand heavily in commodities in a move that signals the profitability of dealing in raw materials.JPMorgan, for example, is aggressively building through acquisitions, including its recent $1.7bn purchase of RBS Sempra, while Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and Société Générale are growing organically.Stuart Staley, the newly-appointed global head of commodities at Citi, said the bank was sticking to organic growth, but added: “The sale of Phibro has freed up considerable capacity for us to expand.”He told the Financial Times the disposal would enable the bank to “invest in building out a client-facing oil business”.Citi sold Phibro to Occidental Petroleum, the US oil company, after Andrew Hall, its star oil trader became a controversial symbol of high Wall Street compensation. US government pressure over a potential $100m pay package in 2009 for Mr Hall forced Citi to part with Phibro.For years Citi ran two independent and sometimes competing operations in raw materials: its own global commodities unit and oil-focused Phibro. The split slowed the bank’s commodities unit expansion, particularly in oil.Mr Staley said the US power and natural gas business was nowadays the bank’s “most mature area” in commodities, a situation he promised to change. “The largest areas of potential growth for our platform are in oil and metals markets,” he said. Citi already has a very active desk dealing in dry bulk freight, although it has lost momentum in coal after several traders left.Mr Staley, 43, will relocate from Houston to London next month to head the bank’s new effort to fight for a slot in the commodities business, traditionally dominated by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital. JPMorgan has climbed to the fourth position after its string of acquisitions.Bankers say there is strong competition for top slot among the second-tier banks, with Citi battling with, among others, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and BofA-Merrill Lynch. Citi does not disclose revenues of its commodities business, but rival bankers say they were about $500m last year.Mr Staley suggested the bank would need to build up scale in each sector to compete. Previously regional markets were becoming global while the relationship between different commodities was increasing,” he said.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
111;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-02-15T23:32:07Z;Citi sells Phibro after government pressure;;Citigroup has sold its controversial commodity unit Phibro to Occidental Petroleum for a cut price after intense pressure from the US government over the compensation of its star trader Andrew Hall, according to people close to the situation.The sale, announced yesterday, underlines the influence the authorities are exerting on companies that rely on taxpayers’ money and raises concerns over government interference. Citi has received $45bn in federal aid and has ceded a 34 per cent stake to the government.The divestment of Phibro, which has been with Citi or predecessor companies since 1981, enables the bank to redeploy the billions in capital the unit needs for trades but deprives it of a big profit engine.Occidental said its net investment in Phibro would be $250m but Citi executives said the oil group would pay about $500m, equivalent to the book value of the unit. Analysts said that was still low for a unit that averaged profits of $200m a year since 1997 and made $600m last year.Government officials and Citi executives said the decision to sell Phibro came after “intense discussions” with Kenneth Feinberg, the administration’s pay tsar. Mr Feinberg is vetting pay at companies receiving “exceptional” government support.Amid public anger at Wall Street pay, Mr Hall’s contract, which totalled about $100m in 2008, became unacceptable, a Citi executive said. Under the deal, Mr Hall and other Phibro traders have agreed to delay receipt of their 2009 pay.
112;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-02-15T23:32:07Z;Phibro’s Hall builds on history to launch new fund;;The former Citigroup star energy trader who became a symbol of high compensation on Wall Street is raising money for a hedge fund named after a village near his 1,000-year-old German castle.Andrew Hall, head of Phibro, the oil and gas trading unit that Citi sold to Occidental Petroleum last year, has formed hedge fund group Astenbeck Capital Management.Placement agents have been drumming up business on behalf of Mr Hall and other senior Phibro managers, seeking a minimum of $25m (£16m) each from investors, according to people familiar with their presentation.Mr Hall will run it in parallel with Phibro – a highly successful unit that places oil, gas and other commodities bets with Occidental’s funds. “Andy Hall is out there selling his wares,” said one investor. Mr Hall declined to comment.Astenbeck already has $1.4bn under management, including more than $700m in pooled commodity funds and a two-year track record under Citi, according to hedge fund investors with knowledge of the situation.Mr Hall owns 80 per cent of the firm, with Occidental controlling the remaining 20 per cent, these people said. Astenbeck’s commodity fund lost about 6 per cent last month, according to people familiar with the results.Phibro’s deeper push into managing outside money comes as Wall Street banks such as Citi face a government proposal for a US ban on proprietary trading and sponsorship of hedge funds.Occidental, an independent oil producer with operations from Colombia to Yemen, faces no such restrictions.Phibro has been trading on behalf of large investors in two oil funds since 2007, when it was an autonomous unit inside Citigroup. However, at the time, the funds were not set up as separate entities and Mr Hall did not have a direct stake in them, people close to Citi said.US government pressure over a potential $100m pay package for Mr Hall in 2009 forced Citi to part with Phibro.Astenbeck, the name of a settlement near Mr Hall’s sprawling German castle, Schloss Derneburg, replaces Phibro as manager for outside funds, according to a person familiar with its presentation.Occidental has said that Phibro’s trading will be separate from the company’s energy trading operations, though Occidental employees will oversee Phibro risk controls.
113;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-01-25T03:25:30Z;Hopes high for Chevron turnround;;Analysts will be looking for confirmation of a turnround at Chevron when the big US oil companies report their fourth-quarter 2009 financial results this week.After years of lacklustre production, which fell from 2.6m barrels per day of oil-equivalent production in the fourth quarter of 2007, to 2.5m in the same quarter in 2008, analysts are expecting the fourth quarter of 2009 to be a turning point for the second-biggest oil company in the US.James Neale, analyst at Credit Suisse Global Energy, says: “We expect the company to deliver over 9 per cent year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter, which is almost unprecedented for a supermajor.”However, the production growth may not be reflected in the group’s results, as weak refining and marketing sales are expected to bring down the entire sector. Indeed, warnings from Chevron this month have led Credit Suisse to revise down fourth-quarter 2009 forecasts by 12 per cent, from $1.97 earnings per share to $1.73.Among the other big US oil groups reporting this week, ConocoPhillips, the US’s third-biggest, will report on Wednesday, Occidental Petroleum on Thursday, Chevron on Friday and Exxon on February 1.Chevron, nonetheless, has had a good year. It reached peak production at its Agbami project in Nigeria, estimated to hold 1bn recoverable barrels of oil equivalent. In the Gulf of Mexico, its Blind Faith field reached production capacity in March 2009, and its Tahiti project achieved first oil in May 2009.In Brazil, Chevron’s Frade project achieved first oil in June 2009. In Angola, its Tombua-Landana project achieved first oil in September 2009.On top of that, Chevron obtained key approvals in 2009 to move forward with its massive Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Australia, which will provide longer-term growth.It expects first oil in 2010 from Perdido in the Gulf.“They are now on track,’’ says Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. Indeed, PFC notes Chevron has gone from having the lowest margins of the three US supermajors in 1999 to the largest margins in 2008.“Chevron’s per barrel margin in 2008 was over eight times what it was in 1999,’’ said Antonia Bullard, PFC senior director.
114;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2010-01-05T16:04:39Z;Occidental breaks away from the pack;;"Stephen Chazen, president of Occidental Petroleum, likes to tell the story of a university professor who in 1968 urged him against entering the oil industry, insisting he would not have a full career before supplies ran out.As if to illustrate how wrong that professor was, Occidental in July announced the biggest oil find in California in 35 years, a field some analysts estimate could hold 1bn-2bn barrels and mark the start of a new era of exploration in the US.The California-based oil company would only say it had found 150m-250m gross barrels of oil equivalent reserves in a part of Kern County it would not specify, using techniques it declined to reveal.Occidental, the fourth biggest US oil company, has made enhanced oil recovery its focus amid estimates that two-thirds of the world’s oil remains in the ground. Much of it was once considered inaccessible or uneconomical to extract, and it has long been routine for the majors to stop pumping once the easy oil was out.“We work the assets harder than the typical major,” Mr Chazen says. “Our objective is to acquire oil fields that require work to get more oil out of the ground. It is a philosophically different approach.’’Doing so effectively, with everything from steam to carbon dioxide forced down into wells, has elevated Occidental to fourth-largest oil and gas company in the US, based on market capitalisation.More than a quarter of Occidental’s oil and gas production comes from the Middle East-North Africa region – where the company has been an active investor for more than four decades – leaving it with the sixth-biggest position among global oil and gas groups. It is present in Libya, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Yemen.The group also has a presence in Argentina, Bolivia and Columbia, but it is the California field generating the excitement.Doug Leggate, analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says Occidental is poised for a period of growth, lifting oil and gas production almost 45 per cent within five years.“Longer term, opportunities have emerged that extend the growth outlook further, anchored by the recent discovery in California that we view as a potential game changer for the stock,’’ Mr Leggate says.Fortune Magazine’s 2009 survey of the “most admired companies’’, ranked Occidental top in mining and crude oil production, and in the world’s top 10 in the use of corporate assets, management quality, financial soundness, and long-term investment. It is hard to compare Occidental to peers in the industry because it is several times larger than the typical independent but significantly smaller than a major.Like a major, it has little exploration risk because it buys known fields that other companies did not have the technology or expertise to tap once the easy oil has been recovered.It also pays a rising dividend and boasts an “A” credit rating by all major ratings services.Occidental can also boast very little debt (its debt to capital ratio is 9 per cent, among the lowest in the industry).Like an independent, it has no refining or marketing business and a focused international scope, representing almost 40 per cent of Occidental’s production. It moves quickly to acquire assets. “We write cheques quickly,” Mr Chazen says.Most are for small fields or plots of land from individuals; so small that they do not require disclosure. This allows Occidental to average between 40-45 acquisitions a year, quietly bulking up on assets with good production potential given improving technology. The company is forecasting 5-8 per cent annual production growth to 2012.“We believe that Occidental’s momentum, strong balance sheet and high oil leverage will lead it to outperform peers over the next 12 months,’’ says Thomas Driscoll, energy analyst at Barclays Capital.Ben Dell, senior analyst at Bernstein Research, said in a recent report on exploration and production companies that Occidental breaks away from the pack with consistently lower than average search and development costs.“Its peer group-leading returns and low debt have made it a darling of investors, who see the company as one of the only safe places in the exploration and production space,’’ he says.The company carefully chooses where to invest: California, Texas, New Mexico and Colorado in the US, which provided 60 per cent of Occidental’s production in 2008.The company is more focused on oil – 75 per cent oil to 25 per cent natural gas – in spite of the rush to develop natural gas projects.It also has no interest in renewables, which Mr Chazen says have nothing to do with its expertise in oil and gas production.“Shareholders can take the dividends we pay and buy Chinese solar stocks,’’ Mr Chazen says. “There’s no real good substitute for oil. Forty years from now, there is still going to be a vibrant oil industry.’’"
115;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-12-15T22:51:14Z;Exxon’s deal for XTO may open floodgates;;Exxon’s move to acquire XTO Energy for $41bn sets the stage for a round of mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector, where the world’s top five super-majors alone are holding cash reserves of over $75bn.Such activity has been constrained during the past 18 months because of uncertainties over carbon legislation, as well as the economic downturn and credit squeeze. Many industry observers expect business will continue to be slow for a while.PFC Energy, the consultancy, projects it will take until 2013 for global exploration and production capital spending to return to the 2008 peak of nearly $460bn, and the possibility of a double-dip recession could postpone this further.Nonetheless, analysts, consultants and energy companies are forecasting that deals across the energy industry will pick up in 2010, as the pressures of the past year continue to build. Several big companies have already said that they would shed assets, and some smaller companies are growing increasingly distressed.“The main driver for such M&A activity lies in the cash strength of probable acquirers – super-majors, Asian national oil companies and large independents,” says Jim Dillavou, a partner leading energy M&A transaction services at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm.“The world’s top five super-majors have cash reserves of more than $75bn, so the capacity is there for much greater M&A activity,” he says. “We have a lot of impatient buyers waiting for assets to come on the market.”In October, ConocoPhillips, the third largest US oil company, outlined plans to sell $10bn in assets over the next two years, including its 9 per cent stake in the Syncrude oil sands project in Canada.In November, Devon Energy, one of the biggest independents, said it wanted to sell its Gulf of Mexico and international assets for up to $7.5bn to pay down debt and focus on the high-return US and Canadian onshore assets.Executives say the market is swinging towards the buyer, with cash-rich oil companies in no hurry to spend their money and a lot of assets available, with more expected in 2010.Stephen Chazen, president and chief financial officer at Occidental Petroleum, the US’s fourth biggest oil and gas production company, says acquisitions by his company have “picked up sharply” in the fourth quarter of 2009.The sellers are individuals or small natural gas producers whose hedges for higher US natural gas prices are running out, with no sign of a return to the record high of $13.694 per million British thermal units seen in 2008. Many overextended themselves as prices rose to that record and have been barely hanging on as prices fell this year to a 7.5-year low.But deals of the size of XTO have been scarce, with overall transactions down about 50 per cent from June 2008 to June 2009, according to Jon McCarter, leader of transaction advisory services for Ernst & Young’s Americas Oil & Gas Centre.Negotiations began to pick up in July and August, leading Mr McCarter to expect a gradual increase in completed deals in 2010. One difficulty is disagreement on valuations, which has been compounded by uncertainty surrounding carbon legislation.Joe Stanislaw, head of the JA Stanislaw group, an independent advisory consultancy, said: “People don’t understand the full impact of carbon and the timing of legislation, whether it will come into effect over five or 10 years.”While Holli Nichols, chief financial officer of power producer Dynegy, said consolidation makes sense, given the benefits gained through scale and reducing duplicative efforts. But it remains hard to do a deal.“With these uncertainties out there, it’s hard for boards and CEOs to pull the trigger,” she said.

Shell will partner Petronas, which was one of the most active companies in the auction.Also on Friday, CNPC, the Chinese state oil company, plus Total of France and Petronas, won the right to develop Halfaya, another sizable field.In June, BP became the first western oil group to be allowed back into Iraq in more than 30 years, reversing the nationalisation of Iraq’s oil industry in 1972.Iraq’s cabinet has since ratified the agreement and BP, together with China’s CNPC, are soon to begin repairing and developing Rumaila, Iraq’s biggest oil field. All the other deals still await ratification.In November, ExxonMobil, which won the rights to the West Qurna 1 field development, became the only US company to lead a winning bid, while California’s Occidental is the only US group to have won a deal as a junior partner.Chevron, the US’s second biggest oil company, has been absent, even though it had studied Iraq’s oil fields closely and was expected to bid. Insiders say the group was hampered by its conservative, risk-averse board.ConocoPhillips, the US’s third biggest oil company, which was expected to bid with Lukoil on West Qurna 2, was also absent. Analysts point out that Conoco­Phillips is struggling more than its peers financially.Companies have promised within a decade to boost Iraq’s oil production by at least 8.5m barrels a day to 11m b/d, more than Saudi Arabia produces.
117;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-12-11T22:29:12Z;Shell wins Iraq oil ‘gold rush’ auction;;Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch energy company, won the right to develop Iraq’s giant Majnoon oilfield on Friday, beating the French major Total, which had long coveted the prize.An Iraqi oil executive called the auction, which marked the re-entry of foreign companies 37 years after the nationalisation of the country’s entire oil industry, a “second gold rush”.It came in spite of bomb attacks in Baghdad on Tuesday, which claimed more than 100 lives, and amid widespread uncertainty over Iraq’s political stability.Six years after Saddam Hussein’s overthrow, the auctions were a step towards Iraq regaining its place as a large oil producer in the Middle East.Shell accepted a very low fee of $1.39 a barrel and promised to boost the Majnoon field’s production to 1.8m barrels a day, far higher than the 700,000 minimum level set by Iraq’s oil ministry. The field currently produces just 46,000 b/d.This auction included five fields and will continue on Saturday.Together with the three agreements signed at the first auction, Iraq has won commitments from oil companies that, within a decade, should boost the nation’s production from 2.5m b/d to nearly 10m b/d, more than 12 per cent of today’s global production.“The international oil companies have raced each other to the bottom to get to Iraq’s reserves,” said Raad Alkadiri, an analyst at PFC Energy. “The Iraqis have got to be glowing after this round.”Shell will operate the Majnoon project and hold a 45 per cent share. Petronas, Malaysia’s state oil company, will hold 30 per cent and Iraq will hold the rest.Shell had already won the right to help ExxonMobil repair the giant West Qurna 1 field, which was part of the first auction.In the two-day period that began at the oil ministry on Friday, Iraq will auction the rights to develop 10 of its biggest and largely undeveloped oil and gas reservoirs. Only three are currently producing.Several of the fields did not draw winning bids, including the East Baghdad and Eastern fields. Iraq also rejected bids by Sonangol, Angola’s state oil company, to develop Qayara field.Samuel Ciszuk, an analyst at IHS Global insight, said companies were scared by the security risks at the East Baghdad field, near the capital.“This shows that the tight Iraqi terms only really work at the vast southern megafields, and nowhere near compensate for investment in higher-production-cost fields, where the uncertainty as to whether Iraq will manage to build connecting pipeline infrastructure in time is much higher, and the reservoir geology is less well known,” said Mr Ciszuk.The one other field awarded so far was Halfaya, which went to CNPC of China, Petronas and Total. CNPC, together with BPof the UK, won the right to develop Rumaila, Iraq’s biggest oil field, in the previous auction.The consortium promised to boost the production of Halfaya, which has 4.1bn barrels of reserves, to 535,000 b/d from 3,000 b/d on Saturday for a fee of $1.40 a barrel.Other companies that showed interest in Halfaya included Norway’s Statoil, Lukoil of Russia, India’s ONGC, Oil India, Eni of Italy, Occidental of the US, Korea’s Kogas, China’s Cnooc and Sonangol.Five more fields will be auctioned on Saturday, including West Qurna 2, which Russia’s Lukoil has been aiming for since it tried, and failed, to reach a deal with Saddam Hussein’s regime while UN sanctions were still in place.Adam Sieminski, analyst at Deutsche Bank, noted that geologists believe Iraq’s oil reserves could rival those of Saudi Arabia and its production could be twice its current rate in five years.“Fields in Iraq like West Qurna and Majnoon are world-class and they are undeveloped. That kind of return seems worth some risk if you think you can manage it,” he said.The newfound confidence is based on the belief that modern technology will squeeze far more oil out of Iraq’s fields than was previously thought possible.Colin Lothian, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the industry consultant, said: “Iraq’s reserves lie in a few huge fields that have not been fully explored since the early 1970s.“Iraq’s current reserves estimate is based on old data, production rates and exploration and is a very conservative estimate. It will rise significantly in the next decade.“The potential exists that Iraq could rival Saudi Arabia but much will have to happen before that.”
118;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-11-29T17:23:57Z;Comparing pay – a tricky, but worthwhile exercise;;Comparing the compensation of chief executives is a complicated business that rarely wins friends for those who undertake it.Proxy statements that US-listed companies must send to the US Securities and Exchange Commission are long and sometimes barely comprehensible, even to the expert.Often companies that use the highest number of pages to explain how closely linked their pay is to performance actually provide shareholders with the least information.Carol Bowie, head of the Governance Institute at RiskMetrics, the investor advice firm, says figuring out how some companies arrive at their compensation packages can be “extremely difficult, if not impossible”.“Very often the pay outliers have great difficulty explaining their pay programmes,” she said, adding: “Often, the less complex the pay programme of a company, the more reasonable the size of the compensation.”Cash bonuses that are not part of the SEC’s summary compensation can distort the value of an executive’s compensation package. This is the case with the performance-related bonus of up to $89m that Occidental Petroleum last year awarded Ray Irani, its long-time chief executive and one of the industry’s most generously compensated individuals.One of the biggest challenges is choosing one yardstick with which to measure all the chief executives, regardless of the size of their company or the type of work they do.The Financial Times’ list includes 35 energy companies that range in market capitalisation from $1.8bn to $359bn and uses data from January 1 to December 31 2008.The companies are global energy groups, US onshore natural gas producers, refiners, and providers of equipment.The group includes companies that are largely owned by a national government and those that are still run by their founders. Some chief executives have been at the helm of their companies for more than a decade, while others arrived during 2008.As shareholders and regulators have pushed companies to link pay to performance, compensation packages have grown and become more complicated, with the value of stocks and stock options dwarfing the value of a chief executive’s yearly salary.Assigning a value to the stocks and options is tricky. Ultimately the value of much of the package will depend on the company’s share price at a future date and on whether future performance measures are met.Equilar, the company that compiled the compensation data for the FT, reports equity awards in the year they are granted and uses the widely accepted Black-Scholes method when grant-date values are unavailable.In contrast, the Corporate Library, another source of compensation data, looks only at realised value, which has shown oil industry executives earning huge amounts in 2008 as they took advantage of high oil – and therefore also stock – prices and cashed in on awards they were given throughout their tenure.In spite of all these hurdles, measuring pay and performance is a worthy endeavour because compensation packages provide “a window into the soul of a board”, as several shareholders interviewed by the FT put it.Guy Jubb, head of corporate governance at Standard Life, the UK equity fund manager, notes: “Remuneration policies provide non-executive directors with one of the very important levers with which to influence the behaviour of executives.”Shareholders argue that re-establishing the power of those levers has become particularly important since the financial meltdown in 2008, which was widely seen as having been caused by the excessive risks taken by powerful executives unchecked by weak non-executive directors and toothless shareholders.Within the energy industry, shareholders in 2008 signalled their disapproval of pay packages at BP and Royal Dutch Shell in non-binding votes.In the US, shareholders have less power to voice disapproval but have begun to lobby the SEC vigorously for a greater degree of control over the nomination of individual board members.This focus on pay makes identifying a good-value chief executive more critical and in doing so highlights the pay trends within one of the world’s most lucrative and important industries.It also means that the new insights generated by such an exercise – imperfect as it may be – far outweigh the risk of creating new enemies.
119;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-11-29T17:00:54Z;Southwestern’s Korell is industry’s best-value chief;;Southwestern Energy, the small US natural gas producer, has delivered 4,374 per cent shareholder return in the past decade, more than any other US company its size.The man behind Southwestern’s success is Harold Korell, who ran the company from 1999 to 2009, and who tops the Financial Times’ list of best-value chief executives in the oil and gas industry.The ranking of 35 companies covers 2008 and measures compensation against one year shareholder return – a metric important to investors – and return on capital employed, which measures how efficiently a company is run.Many of the boards at other companies have been far less disciplined about pay or have lower performance thresholds than Southwestern, which caps its bonus and links it closely to performance.Men such as Aubrey McClendon of Chesapeake Energy, Ray Irani of Occidental Petroleum, Eugene Isenberg of Nabors Industries and Bob Simpson of XTO, like Mr Korell, are all either founders of successful energy companies or executives who have turned round ailing ones.But, unlike Mr Korell, their compensation packages have grown to tens of millions of dollars a year, in spite of faltering returns in 2008.Mr Korell is quick to point out that he is not exactly poorly paid and he has accumulated a lot of wealth in Southwestern shares. But his 2008 pay of $7m is the eighth lowest among the FT’s group of 35 executives and the fourth lowest among US executives.Much of Southwestern’s success lies in having been one of the first companies to enter today’s hottest sector of the industry: extracting gas from the hard shale beds found in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Pennsylvania.Southwestern recognised the potential of the Arkansas Fayetteville shale in 2002. A local geologist looking through old well data decided to find out out why the sandstone reservoirs of Fayetteville had yielded much more gas than anyone had thought possible.The answer was that the gas had come from the seemingly impermeable layer of shale above the sandstone.“Oil and gas is first found in people’s minds,” Mr Korell says. “If that one individual had said, ‘well that’s just the way it is, I will not investigate further,’ we would never have gotten here.”Alone in its knowledge, Southwestern spent the next two years secretly buying the rights to drill in 575,000 acres of the Fayetteville shale, thus cheaply procuring one of the best asset bases of any US energy company. It was a huge bet at the time.“We scooped the market on that one,” Mr Korell says, a hint of mischievous delight creeping into his otherwise deadpan delivery.Mr Korell distils the company’s continued success to a simple mathematical formula so ingrained in its culture that it hangs on the façade of its office buildings and on a necklace worn by his wife, Patricia.The equation came to him in the autumn of 1999, during a meeting with a small, deeply frustrated team of Southwestern executives who were wondering whether to pack it all in.“We were not healthy. No one wanted to own our stock,” Mr Korell recalls. The company’s shares were doing so badly, he says, that the total value of Southwestern’s assets was greater than the market capitalisation of the company.He remembers uncapping a black marker to write: R squared over A is V+, in what he calls a type of epiphany. In other words, the right people doing the right things by wisely investing the cash flow from Southwestern’s assets creates value, he explains.The mantra remains the company’s central tenet and Southwestern even owns the formula’s copyright.The goal, Mr Korell says, is to achieve $1.30 in present value for every $1 Southwestern invests.The idea appears simple and echoes the disciplined approach of ExxonMobil.It is widely seen as the most successful large integrated oil company, and its chief executive, Rex Tillerson, ranks sixth on the FT’s list of the best-value CEOs, in spite of making almost $24m in 2008, the fifth-highest compensation on the list.But many companies across the oil and gas industry focus more attention on production growth than capital or compensation discipline.Benjamin Dell, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, ranks Southwestern as the best among its peers in finding and developing natural gas cheaply.“[Mr Korell] gets well paid and delivers a tremendous return,” Mr Dell says.
120;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-11-23T23:08:20Z;Eni stakes out its future with two deals;;Eni’s move into Uganda and its recent deal to help Iraq develop one of the country’s biggest oil fields looks set to determine the focus of the Italian energy group well into the next decade.Neither of the deals is final and both still need the approval of their respective host governments. In the case of Uganda, the deal to buy assets from Heritage of the UK could still be pre-empted by Tullow, the partner in the field.But if the deals go through, Eni will have in just a few months mapped out ventures that will take the best part of a decade and a total of more than $30bn to complete.“Big companies with big production need big projects. At least two [like these] every 10 years,” says Claudio Descalzi, Eni’s head of exploration and production.But the deals come at a difficult time for Eni, whose recent peer-beating growth in oil and gas production and reserves has come through acquisitions rather than drilling and therefore also at a significant financial cost.Eni is one of Europe’s cash-poorest international oil companies.It has gearing of 42 per cent, compared to 20 to 30 per cent for most of its peers, and is the only one to have had to cut its dividend earlier this year.At the same time, Eni, which is 30 per cent owned by the Italian government, is under investigation by Brussels which alleges that the company is abusing its dominant position in gas distribution in Italy.Sanctions include forcing Eni to sell off three of its gas pipelines and a large fine of hundreds of millions of euros.Given those challenges, Paolo Scaroni, Eni’s chief executive, is well aware of the need for the company to prove itself in exploration and production, the key operational area that defines any oil company’s success.The issue is becoming increasingly critical for Eni as it faces the imminent loss of operational leadership of the Kashagan field, its flagship project in Kazakhstan that has been dogged by operational set backs, delays and disagreements.Eni’s arrival in Uganda will mark the country’s turning point from a playground of intrepid oil explorers – so-called wildcatters – to its development into an oil producer.For Eni, the Heritage deal is only the start of what it hopes will become its most important sub-Saharan operations.But the process will not be quick or easy, especially because Eni is unlikely to have enough cash to buy into the adjacent fields, belonging to Tullow, that lie next to those it is acquiring from Heritage.Uganda’s oil lies in an inopportune location, in a national park far from the nearest market or port. This is why Eni put together a full development plan and ran it by the Ugandan authorities, months before it signed its deal with Heritage.Mr Descalzi says Eni has outlined plans to build a refinery, rehabilitate one of two rail lines and eventually build a pipeline together with the government and other oil companies operating in the Lake Albert region.The pipeline would connect the fields to the east coast of Africa and could cost $5.5bn to build.Eni has also been quietly negotiating with the Democratic Republic of Congo, securing areas on the other side of Lake Albert that lie next to those in Uganda.“This is unique, fresh potential. There is no other opportunity like this,” says Mr Descalzi, adding: “We will be in a strong position with the refinery and transportation. We can lead this new area in terms of oil and gas.”But while Eni’s aim is to thrust Uganda into the league of oil exporters, it is also planning to help Iraq, with its established oil infrastructure, to develop the giant Zubair field.Other oil executives wonder where Eni will find the money – $20bn for Iraq alone – and the workforce to manage the projects.In October, Eni – together with Kogas of South Korea and Occidental of the US – agreed a deal with Iraq’s oil ministry to boost the production of Zubair, Iraq’s fourth-largest oil field, from 200,000 barrels a day to 1.125m barrels a day within the next seven years.At the time of the deal, Mr Scaroni admitted that going ahead in Iraq would mean that Eni would have to forgo other ventures. He said: “Because we are going to Iraq, it means we will not be doing other things.”Uganda, with which Eni was negotiating even as it signed its deal with Iraq, was never going to be one of the company’s sacrifices.Instead, the two new projects will define whether Eni can truly claim parity with larger rivals such as BP, Total and ExxonMobil, or whether it is merely punching above its weight because of its network of gas pipelines and a government that sees the company as its national energy champion.
121;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-11-04T16:33:49Z;Iraq: Baghdad starts to rebuild its oil industry;;Earlier this year, industry executives flocked to Baghdad for the chance to win the right to develop the country’s vast fields.But only BP, the UK energy group and its partner, CNPC of China, walked away with an agreement and the auction was branded a shocking failure by politicians and industry executives.But as summer turned to autumn, international energy companies and Iraq’s oil ministry made renewed attempts to find common ground. Last month their bilateral discussions began to yield results.Oil prices have now spent enough time around the $70 a barrel mark that few executives fear they will again fall back to the lows of $32 a barrel, which they hit following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the onset of the global economic downturn.The more certain investment climate has prompted companies to return to deal-making, and mergers and acquisitions have again been popping up around the globe.The renewed confidence in the global market for oil and financing has also borne fruit in Iraq. In October, Baghdad secured its second big oil deal this year as Eni of Italy, Korea’s Kogas and Occidental of the US agreed to develop the Zubair field.Once the companies gain cabinet approval, they will, for the first time since Iraq nationalised its oil industry 40 years ago, have the opportunity to work in the country with the world’s third largest oil reserves.Hussain Shahristani, Iraq’s oil minister, laid out his ambitious plans last month.“What we expect from the first bid round and what we hope for from the second round is that Iraqi production will be between 10m and 12m barrels a day,” he said, “and this will make Iraq equal to the world’s biggest oil producers.”The opportunity to help quadruple Iraq’s total production of about 2.5m b/d is all the sweeter because almost every one of the world’s big international oil companies is struggling to expand.In the past few years they have been losing that battle as 80 per cent of all oil fields remain out of their reach, guarded by the countries that own them.For Iraq, the need to boost its most important revenue stream has become critical, especially since falling oil prices have burned a large and worrying hole in the national budget.This is one important reason Baghdad finally got its political act together to auction off the right to develop the fields, says one UK diplomat who has spent time corralling private investment for the country.But at its auction in June, Iraq insisted it would pay only $2 a barrel to oil companies once they had boosted a field’s production to its maximum plateau. One after the other, Mr Shahristani sent oil executives back to reconsider their bids. Only BP and CNPC, the Chinese state oil company, proved willing to bend to Baghdad’s wishes.Their prize was the right to develop Iraq’s biggest field. The giant Rumaila field is believed to hold 65bn barrels of oil, 20bn of which are thought to be recoverable. BP and CNPC pledged to increase its production to 3m b/d from about 1m b/d.Executives working for BP’s competitors scoffed at the company’s brazenness, but no one was entirely sure who had been more foolish: the companies that had walked away from the biggest prize in decades, or the company that was willing to reduce its fees by half to get a toe-hold in the most import oil patch to open up since the fall of the Soviet Union.Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, staunchly defends his decision to return to the Rumaila field, which BP discovered in 1952.He told Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, the industry newsletter: “We understand the rocks. We are confident that the returns from this investment will be compatible with other opportunities in our portfolio. That means a 15-20 per cent return.”The details about each of the contracts remain undisclosed, making any accurate comparison between BP’s June agreement and Eni’s October accord impossible.Iraq says Eni agreed to accept $2 a barrel after Mr Shahristani clarified other parts of the taxation. Eni sees it differently. The Italian oil company believes Baghdad made concessions on taxes that significantly improved the overall profitability of the projects, which it believes will require a total investment of about $20bn.Either way, Eni has promised to boost production at the Zubair field from 200,000 to 1.1m b/d and Iraq is now well on its way to beginning the rehabilitation of its most important industry.Meanwhile, other oil companies, including Lukoil of Russia and ExxonMobil of the US, are now also back at the negotiating table.It is critical that any agreements signed in the coming months remain in force, even if next year’s Iraqi elections mean a change in power.Unfortunately, that is far from assured because Iraq still lacks a hydrocarbon law, largely because it has failed to agree critical payment issues with the Kurdistan regional government.But Mr Shahristani has driven a hard bargain with the oil companies and the next government will hardly be able to argue credibly that the country is being fleeced by foreigners. If it does derail the process, BP, Eni and their peers will be bitterly disappointed, but the far greater loss, will be that of the Iraqi people, who desperately need the additional revenue so they can begin to rebuild their country.
122;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-11-02T06:24:22Z;The Squeeze;;"The Squeeze: Oil, Money and Greed in the 21st Century
By Tom Bower
HarperPress £20, 448 pages
FT Bookshop price: £16The Squeeze begins with a bang: the sound of Tom Bower blowing a hole in his own credibility. In only the second paragraph of the preface, he suggests a shaky grasp of the workings of oil markets and of Opec, the producers’ cartel, and fails dismally in an attempt to get inside the head of Ali Naimi, Saudi Arabia’s veteran oil minister.It is a testament to Bower’s journalistic skills, and to the great story he has to tell, that he manages to steady the ship after torpedoing it so early in the journey. For the most part, The Squeeze is a gripping and convincing account of the turbulent story of the global oil industry over the past decade.Daniel Yergin’s dazzling book The Prize remains the definitive history of oil in the 20th century. But while the world waits for Yergin to pen a sequel, Bower has stepped in smartly to fill the gap.The events he covers are scarcely less dramatic than those described in The Prize, including the ascent of the oil price to record highs, the power grab by leaders such as Vladimir Putin and Hugo Chávez, and the downfall of corporate chiefs such as Lord Browne of BP and Sir Philip Watts of Shell. Bower’s book has the advantage of being scorchingly topical.Think of the most important events in the global oil business of the past couple of months: BP’s giant oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico; ExxonMobil’s troubled attempt to take a $4bn stake in a big field off the coast of Ghana; and Citigroup’s sale of Phibro, its commodities unit, to Occidental Petroleum. For all of them, The Squeeze provides the fascinating story behind the headlines.A former reporter for the BBC’s Panorama programme and a celebrated chronicler of wickedness and folly in previous books on ­Robert Maxwell and Conrad Black, among others, Bower has found no such targets in the oil business. His treatment of the reserves misreporting scandal at Shell, which was exposed in 2004 and cost Watts his job, is remarkably fair-minded.Lee Raymond, former chairman of Exxon, is one possible contender for the role of the book’s bad guy, but even he is guilty of no more than iron-clad self-confidence and a blinkered focus on making money for his shareholders.Indeed, an unlikely hero emerges in the shape of Lord Browne, who left BP in disgrace in May 2007 with both his competence and his integrity under question. Bower is no apologist for Lord Browne; “slightly-built [and] soft-spoken” are probably the kindest epithets he uses. He is unsparing in his assessment of the chief executive’s contribution to a culture at BP that put an inadequate emphasis on safety, highlighted after a 2005 explosion at the Texas City refinery in the US, which killed 15. However, time and again Lord Browne’s strategic vision and tactical ruthlessness are shown to be critical in securing advantageous positions for BP in the US, Russia and Azerbaijan.In that, as in much else, Bower’s judgment is spot on. He is particularly good on the mechanics of modern computer-assisted oil exploration, a gambling game where the chips come in the form of $100m wells. There is also an amusingly perceptive depiction of the difference in culture between Exxon, where the uniformly white-shirted executives are “akin to the Stepford wives”, and BP, which was “founded on disobedience and survived by maverick deeds”.Apart from the cartoonish view of Ali Naimi, there are other slips that speak of poor editing. Saudi Arabia’s giant Ghawar is an oil field, not a well; Carol Browner, not Browning, was the administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency under President Clinton.But overall, The Squeeze provides a first-rate account of where the oil industry is now, and some useful pointers as to where it is going.For the paperback, though, it would be wise to lose the preface.Ed Crooks is the FT’s energy editor"
123;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-10-13T18:22:22Z;Eni wins Iraq oil field deal;;Iraq has given a consortium led by Eni, the Italian oil group, the right to develop its giant Zubair field, in a deal that signals the country’s desire to attract more of the world’s biggest oil companies 40 years after nationalising its oil industry.Tuesday’s breakthrough, which needs cabinet approval, came after Iraq sweetened its terms following the failure of a June auction. It could lead to further foreign investment in a country with the world’s third-largest oil reserves.As part of the agreement, the Iraqi government told the Eni consortium to drop Sinopec, the Chinese state-owned oil company, as a partner.Baghdad has vowed to block Sinopec from its oil resources because of its entry into Kurdistan, the oil-rich semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq. In June Sinopec agreed to a C$8.3bn (US$7.2bn) takeover of Addax, which had a stake in the Kurdish Taq Taq field.Eni and its minority-share partners – Kogas of Korea and Occidental of the US – are only the second group of international oil companies to enter Iraq since it nationalised its industry four decades ago. BP and CNPC were the only companies willing to accept Iraq’s tough fiscal terms in the country’s June auction.Paolo Scaroni, Eni chief executive, told the Financial Times: “Zubair is one of the most important oil fields in the world. It is one of very few that is capable of producing more than 1m barrels a day. Because we are going to Iraq, it means we will not be doing other things.”Mr Scaroni said the project would boost the field’s production from 200,000 barrels per day to 1.125m b/d within seven years.Under the agreement, Eni and its partners will receive $2 for each barrel over 1.125m bpd they are able to pump from the field, which holds reserves of 4bn barrels and is Iraq’s fourth-largest. In the first bidding round, Eni – like many of its peers – refused to accept the $2 payment. Eni had asked for more, but agreed on $2 after Baghdad sweetened other terms that raised the overall value of the contract.Iraq is in talks with other companies that walked away in June. Lukoil of Russia on Tuesday confirmed that it and US partner ConocoPhillips would restart discussions for Iraq’s West Qurna field on Wednesday. Royal Dutch Shell said it was still in talks with Baghdad.

The estimated rate has been revised lower from 2.6 per cent at the start of the year, then minus 17.2 per cent at the beginning of April, and minus 20.9 per cent at the start of July.“The Financials sector (+58 per cent) is anticipating the highest earnings growth rate for the quarter, while the materials (-65 per cent), energy (-65 per cent), and industrials (-45 per cent) sectors are expecting the lowest,” say analysts at ThomsonReuters.While a negative quarter would extend Corporate America’s current run to nine consecutive quarterly profit declines, much attention will focus on an expected rebound in earnings next year.As a result, guidance from companies looms as being the key driver of sentiment for equities.“The most critical news is likely to be centred on initial guidance to next year’s business activity and its impact on the bottom line,” says Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.“With Street consensus bottom-up earnings growth projected to climb 26 per cent to 27 per cent year over year in 2010, there is not that much room for conservative outlook statements which may be deemed disappointing,” said Mr Levkovich.ThomsonReuters estimates earnings growth rates for the S&P 500 of 192 per cent for the fourth quarter, which benefits from an easy comparison with the fourth quarter of 2008. That is followed by a 34 per cent rise in earnings for the first quarter of 2010.The positive start for equities on Monday was also a function of various brokerage upgrades.Shares in MasterCard rose 0.7 per cent to $216, and Visa gained 1 per cent to $73.70, after they were upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” by Credit Suisse. The bank’s price target for MasterCard was raised from $210 to $255, while Visa was increased from $70 to $84.“An improvement in spending volumes should translate into improving revenue growth in the coming quarters which will increase investor confidence in a higher long term earnings growth rate,” said the bank. “Moreover, the secular shift from cash to plastic continues.”Over at UBS, shares in Advanced Micro Deviceswere raised from “neutral” to “buy” and th chipmaker closed up 0.4 per cent at $29.85.UBS also upgraded Amgen to a “buy” from a “neutral” rating. The stock rose 0.2 per cent to $59.51. Shares in Infosys dropped 0.8 per cent to $47.37 and pared an early rise after Wells Fargo upgraded the company. Abercrombie & Fitch rallied 2.3 per cent to $35.63 after the retailer was upgraded to a “buy”, while Occidental Petroleum rose 1 per cent to $80.31, in spite of being reduced from “buy” to “hold” by Citigroup. The bank lowered the target price for Oxy from $82 to $74.Meanwhile, KB Homes dropped 7.8 per cent to $15.17, after the home builder said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating possible accounting and disclosure issues.Shares in Google were up 1.7 per cent at $525.02. The company announced that Arthur Levinson had resigned as a member of the its Board of Directors, effective immediately."
125;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-10-12T15:13:49Z;Phibro folly;;Only someone just emerging from a lengthy coma would have swallowed Citigroup’s explanation for the sale of its Phibro commodities unit as “consistent with Citi’s core strategy of a client-centred business model”. Not unless that business model involves intentionally losing money.The sale was all about reconciling public anger with banker pay and an ironclad contract with head trader Andrew Hall for a $100m bonus. The sale price, said to be about Phibro’s net asset value of $250m, would have been a steal even at the height of the financial panic. Coming at a time when markets, including those for commodities, have recovered, purchaser Occidental Petroleum was in the right place at the right time – a fortunate beneficiary of political interference. Even for such a volatile business, the unit could easily have gone for $2bn or more based on its average earnings of $371m in the past five years. That is a pro rata opportunity loss of $600m for US taxpayers based on their 34 per cent stake in the lender because it was too embarrassing to pay someone a bonus that he will be paid anyway.Sadly, this is far from the only case of political pressure to do the right thing resulting in financial losses. Consider pay restrictions at AIG that have led to an exodus of staff, degrading the value of the government’s $85bn investment. Or how about banks in Europe that have received state aid being discouraged from calling subordinated bonds when cheaper financing options are available, purely to avoid the appearance of moral hazard?Doing the right thing and appearing to do the right thing are often very different. Had some official in Washington bravely spoken up to say that it was cheaper to hold their noses and pay Mr Hall than give away his whole unit in a sweetheart deal he or she might have committed career suicide. The massive cost of the financial crisis is being compounded by political cowardice.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
126;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Citi to sell Phibro unit to Occidental;;Citigroup has sold its controversial commodity unit Phibro to Occidental Petroleum for a cut price after intense pressure from the US government over the compensation of its star trader Andrew Hall, according to people close to the situation.The sale, announced on Friday, underlines the influence the authorities are exerting on companies that rely on taxpayers’ money and raises concerns over government interference. Citi has received $45bn in federal aid and has ceded a 34 per cent stake to the government.The divestment of Phibro, which has been with Citi or predecessor companies since 1981, enables the bank to redeploy the billions in capital the unit needs for trades but deprives it of a big profit engine.Occidental said its net investment in Phibro would be $250m but Citi executives said the oil group would pay about $500m, equivalent to the book value of the unit. Analysts said that was still low for a unit that averaged profits of $200m a year since 1997 and made $600m last year.Government officials and Citi executives said the decision to sell Phibro came after “intense discussions” with Kenneth Feinberg, the administration’s pay tsar. Mr Feinberg is vetting pay at companies receiving “exceptional” government support.Amid public anger at Wall Street pay, Mr Hall’s contract, which totalled about $100m in 2008, became unacceptable, a Citi executive said. Under the deal, Mr Hall and other Phibro traders have agreed to delay receipt of their 2009 pay.
127;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-10-09T20:34:41Z;Wall Street ends week on a high note;;Wall Street on Friday recorded its first full week of consecutive gains since November 2006 after strength in technology stocks added to this week’s rally.International Business Machines rose 3 per cent to $125.93 after Barclays upgraded computer hardware companies, saying storage and server demand was picking up.Google also rose 0.4 per cent to $516.25 after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock, citing a potential rebound in advertising. The market initially opened lower as investors mulled over comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, who said late on Thursday that the central bank could tighten monetary policy as the economic recovery takes hold.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,071.49 and the Nasdaq gained 0.7 per cent to 2,139.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per to a high for the year of 9,864.94. Over the course of the week, the S&P rose 4 per cent - its biggest weekly gain since July. The Dow rose 3.4 per cent and the Nasdaq was 4 per cent higher.Positive economic data, the weak dollar and rising commodity prices pushed stocks higher this week. After Wednesday’s close, Alcoa set a positive tone for the third-quarter earnings season by posting a profit and, on Thursday, leading US retailers reported their first monthly sales gain since September 2008.Bruce Shalett, founder of the Wynston Hill Capital boutique investment bank, said: “There’s reason to feel cautiously optimistic. The retail data that came out resonated very positively with investors who are hoping upon hope for reasons to believe that the recovery is sustainable.”Citigroup was in focus on Friday after confirming it would sell its controversial Phibro commodities business to Occidental Petroleum. Occidental said its net investment in the business would total about $250m and the deal is expected to help deflect political anger over a potential $100m pay-out for its star trader Andrew Hall. While financial stocks were broadly up, Citi shares lost 0.4 per cent to $4.63.Government-backed mortgage lenders also weighed on the sector. Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said late on Thursday that the mortgage groups might need further aid from the US Treasury. Fannie Mae was down 4 per cent to $1.43 and Freddie Mac lost 3.9 per cent to $1.71.Shares in both companies fell on Wednesday, in spite of a broad rally in the financial sector, after reports suggested they were working on a programme to help independent mortgage banks get access to short-term credit for home loans.Retreating commodity prices hit mining and industrial stocks in early trading on Friday.Newmont Mining suffered further after speculation that the company could be preparing a hostile bid for Australia’s Newcrest Mining. Newmont shares were down 1.1 per cent at $46.50.Chevron said late on Thursday that higher oil prices would lead to significantly better profits in the third quarter than the previous one. The shares were up 1.8 per cent at $72.76.Such optimism did not spread to its rivals and ExxonMobil trailed the market, gaining 0.3 per cent to $69.927. ConocoPhillips lost 1.2 per cent to $50.78 after announcing it would temporarily shut down parts of its refinery in Texas for maintenance.A flurry of deal activity helped lift sentiment. Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues, announced it had bought I-Flow for $324m. Kimberly-Clark gained 0.3 per cent to $59.23, while shares in I-Flow, which sells surgical products such as catheters, rose 7 per cent to $12.58.Sunrise Senior Living, the retirement home group that warned this year of possible bankruptcy, agreed to sell 21 of its assisted living communities to an affiliate of rival Brookdale Senior Living for $204m.Sunrise shares rose 44.6 per cent to $4.77.
128;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-10-09T18:28:38Z;Phibro deal brings welcome relief to Citi;;Occidental Petroleum’s deal to acquire Citigroup’s in-house commodities unit solves regulatory problems for the bank and could add a group of savvy arbitrageurs to an oil company not known for its trading prowess.It marks the latest episode in an exodus of specialised commodity trading talent from banks coping with greater government say over compensation.Oil groups such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total were able to blunt the slide in crude prices earlier this year through extensive oil-trading operations, taking advantage of extensive storage and shipping assets to exploit idiosyncrasies in the futures prices.Occidental, based in Los Angeles, “has not been an aggressive trader, and has not been an aggressive hedger”, said Ben Dell, energy analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. “This is a significant break with company strategy and will come as a major surprise to investors.”Phibro’s departure from government-backed Citi will probably relieve the bank from criticism over a potential $100m pay-out to star trader Andrew Hall . Occidental said Mr Hall and other employees would remain with the company, adding that senior management plans to make a “significant investment” in the group.“There obviously was some pressure from the government” to sell, said Stephen Chazen, Occidental’s chief financial officer. “[Citi] called and asked if we were interested.’’ He called Occidental’s existing trading business “sizeable”.The move could shelter Citi from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US regulator that is threatening a crackdown on energy market speculation. Citi is also under Federal Reserve oversight for the risks associated with Phibro’s oil and natural gas trading.If the CFTC imposes new limits on speculators’ participation in futures markets, “by moving over to Occidental, Phibro essentially will probably not be subject to any of these”, said Phil Verleger, an energy economist and longtime acquaintance of Mr Hall. Over the past five years Phibro had earned an average of $371m annually, Occidental said.The split from Citi is the latest evidence of a trend in which commodities traders are walking out of Wall Street banks to join trading houses, oil groups and hedge funds amid the regulatory clampdown on bonuses, reversing a flow of traders joining banks between 2003 and 2008.“Who wants to be trading commodities in Wall Street where a regulator is going to set your salary?” said the head of oil trading at a major commodities bank.Bankers said that traders from banks with large commodities business – including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital or Deutsche Bank – had left their positions to join the leading independent oil trading companies such as Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura, Gunvor and Mercuria.BP and Shell have also recruited traders from investment banks. Noble Group, the Hong Kong-based trading house, has been taking a “significant number” of traders from banks as it builds its oil trading business, headquartered in London. George Stein of Commodity Talent, a New York-based headhunter group, said there was no question “looming compensations …have triggered a move of commodities traders from banks into trading houses and hedge funds that were less likely to come under regulatory scrutiny”.The deal signals the latest ownership change for Phibro, which bought Salomon Brothers in 1981 for $554m, later becoming part of Citigroup. The controversy over Mr Hall’s pay was also not Phibro’s first. Marc Rich, the commodities trader and later fugitive who was pardoned by President Bill Clinton, left Phillips Brothers in the early 1970s after being unhappy with his share of the company’s profits, taking with him other top executives.
129;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-09-03T22:15:01Z;Oil groups face Libya ultimatum;;Libya will require all foreign companies to appoint Libyan chief executives to their joint ventures.The move will be seen as another step in the creeping nationalisation of the country’s oil industry.A government directive instructs all companies with foreign participation to appoint Libyan heads, according to a foreign oil executive and a western diplomat. All foreign companies, including those which are involved in oil production, operate as joint ventures.The move will raise concerns among foreign investors.“This is not good for the Libyan economy,” said the western executive. “Companies which are here will stay but if you are still deciding you will think twice.”The directive underlines the contradictions of Muammer Gaddafi’s Libya, which uses the lure of business opportunities to further its political ambitions but also puts obstacles in the way of foreign companies.It comes at a time of political uproar in Britain over allegations that Scotland’s release of the convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi was linked to commercial considerations. Scottish and British officials deny the charge.The executive said his company received the directive last month but has been unable to ascertain how it will be applied and whether the oil industry will be exempted.“The usual way is at least for the general manager to come from the [foreign] company which pays the costs,” said an oil executive. “Exploration is paid for 100 per cent by the foreign partner. It is very difficult to believe that international companies will agree to a Libyan general manager.”A spokesman for the state-owned National Oil Corporation said on Thursday that he was not aware of the directive.Libya has the largest proven oil reserves in Africa and since international sanctions were lifted in 2004, it has attracted dozens of oil companies.There have been four bidding rounds in recent years but over the past two years Libya has also progressively introduced tougher conditions.The oil executive pointed to a string of decisions over the past two years confirming a trend towards a kind of covert nationalization. There was a directive last year stipulating that the deputy general managers of joint ventures should be Libyan.Then there was the renegotiation of contracts when oil prices rose – Eni SpA, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Repsol YPF, Petro-Canada and Total have all agreed to halve their production shares in return for contract extensions.According to oil executives, companies which have not renegotiated contracts are coming under “indirect pressures” to do so.A ban on offshore engineering for all oil and gas projects was introduced in April. This means that international companies have to establish teams of design engineers in Libya rather than use their own design units.Another regulation obliges operating companies to favour local suppliers of oilfield equipment and services over foreign firms.From Libya’s point of view the measures were intended to offer training and employment opportunities to locals but companies said they found them cumbersome and costly.Analysts said there was also a political dimension to these decisions in a state that proclaims itself a socialist country.“The measures announced over the last two years have been intended to reassure domestic critics concerned that the opening-up to international investment could undermine the foundations of the system,” said Jon Marks, editor of African Energy.Colonel Gaddafi, the country’s leader who celebrated 40 years in power this week, remains uncomfortable with the liberalisation of the economy and has raised the possibility of nationalising the oil industry but officials are adamant that will not happen.For international companies operating in Libya , such statements are part of a continuing atmosphere of uncertainty under which they operate.Most of the oil companies which have entered Libya in the past five years have so far failed to make sizeable discoveries. ILower oil prices have added to the pressures on companies which have accepted harsher fiscal terms.
130;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-05-26T04:25:08Z;Libya: Promising prospects remain unrealised;;Although Libya’s promise as a vastly underexplored oil producer remains undimmed, experts say it is unlikely to meet its target of 3m barrels a day by 2012-2015.The results of exploration undertaken by foreign companies since international sanctions on Libya were lifted in 2004 have so far yielded few sizeable finds.While this may change over the longer term, experts argue that, for the moment, Libya’s best hope of increased volumes lies in field redevelopment and enhanced oil recovery projects.“The biggest impact on oil production will come from the application of secondary and tertiary recovery techniques,” said Wood Mackenzie, the research and consultancy firm, in a report in November.Libyan oil production peaked at 3.3m b/d in 1970, but after the introduction of UN and US sanctions in 1982, production fluctuated between 1.1m and 1.5m b/d.One of the main reasons for the drop was that US companies left and most of the oil majors stayed away, depriving the country of crucial technology, particularly that needed to improve yields in maturing fields.But since the removal of sanctions, foreign companies have piled into Libya, lured by the promise of the biggest proven reserves in Africa.The country has held four licensing rounds, giving out dozens of contracts and renegotiating older ones to bring them in line with new fiscal terms.“In 2005, Libya was one of the industry’s hottest prospects,” says Craig McMahon, lead Middle East and North Africa analyst at Wood Mackenzie.“Companies that offered the most aggressive fiscal terms won the exploration licences. There was a feeding frenzy, which resulted in some exceedingly tough terms being agreed. Only when oil prices rose did some of the most aggressive bids start to look potentially economical.”Output rose to 1.9m b/d in 2008, but the target of 3m b/d is “unrealistic in the short term” according to Wood Mackenzie.In the past 18 months, National Oil Corporation, the Libyan state-owned company has finalised contract extension agreements with Eni, Petro-Canada, Occidental, Repsol-YPF and Total resulting in the pledging of significant development budgets.Wood Mackenzie says the contract extensions have the potential for “a large increase in production”.But NOC approvals of companies’ redevelopment plans have been slow to come, holding up the potential increases in output.“Very little is happening,” says Mr McMahon. “The reason is that National Oil Corporation has not yet sanctioned the development plans.”He says that the main reasons for delays are funding pressures within NOC and a reluctance on Libya’s part to increase production at a time of lower oil prices and demand.“Production in 2009 has actually been cut as a result of the reintroduction of Opec constraints.”Mr McMahon and others say that the current situation leaves companies frustrated, especially given the large signature bonuses companies paid to extend the duration of their licences.John Hamilton, a Libya specialist on Africa Energy, an industry newsletter , says that leading companies with established exploration or production agreements, such as ENI, Shell, Total and BP, can afford to continue with their plans in Libya.However, there is pressure on a number of US and Asian operators whose exploration licences will expire next year, several of whom have not made significant finds.One of the largest companies that may have to decide whether to negotiate extensions with NOC or scale down its exploration is Occidental Petroleum, which has had limited success at five licences acquired in 2005, although it also has other exploration and redevelopment agreements with NOC that will expire in 2037.“Some companies are worried that NOC wants to tighten the terms of future exploration agreements,” says Mr Hamilton. “This is causing concern, as, in most cases, they haven’t made the discoveries they hoped for, and in the current climate it will be hard to justify reductions in their stakes.”So far only Verenex of Canada and RWE Dea of Germany have made significant discoveries.But Mr McMahon believes it is unlikely that companies will abandon Libya.“There are a lot of press reports about companies scaling down operations,” he says. “But those who have sizeable possessions there have all paid large signature bonuses. They may well review the size of their Libyan operations but their commitment to the country will remain.”
131;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2009-04-30T00:08:53Z;Mubadala appoints former BP executive;;Mubadala, a state investment vehicle of Abu Dhabi, on Wednesday said it had appointed a former BP executive to its oil and gas division in a sign of the company’s growing ambitions in the sector.Steve Peacock, who was BP president Middle East and South Asia, takes over as chief operating officer for Mubadala Oil and Gas, with the company seeking to become a ”globally competitive oil and gas exploration and production company.”Mubadala is wholly owned by the Abu Dhabi government and has been one of the oil-rich emirate’s more active investment vehicles, with a portfolio that straddles an increasingly broad range of sectors, from finance to aerospace and real estate.Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi, Mubadala’s chief operating officer, on Wednesday said the company was expecting to more than triple its assets of AED54bn over the next five years.Energy has been one of the core areas of the company’s investments. Earlier this week, it announced a venture with Occidental Petroleum and the National Oil and Gas Authority of Bahrain to develop a field in Bahrain, and its hydrocarbons assets stretch from Africa to the Middle East and South East Asia.Mubadala released its first annual report last week which showed that in 2008 it invested Dh22bn.Its assets increased by 40 per cent last year, while its revenue rose from Dh1.8bn in 2007 to Dh6.7bn.But this was offset by sharp declines in oil prices and stock markets, which resulted in impairment charges of Dh8.8bn, contributing to the overall loss of Dh11.8bn.The company also recently announced it is setting up a medium-term bond programme.
132;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2008-07-29T18:21:13Z;Should a CEO’s health be secret?;;"Steve Jobs’ health came under scrutiny recently after the Apple chief executive’s gaunt appearance at the company’s developer conference revived memories among observers of his battle with pancreatic cancer in 2004. An analyst subsequently inquired after the CEO’s well-being on a conference call. The company has said that its founder is merely suffering from a common bug. To what extent should any chief executive feel obliged to divulge health details to investors? Is it simply a private matter? And what is the best response when such questions are raised?THE ACADEMIC
Frank Partnoy
The controversy about Mr Jobs illustrates a gruesome reality: a company’s share price includes the value of an insurance policy on the CEO’s life. If Mr Jobs died unexpectedly, Apple’s share price would plummet. Even worries about his cancer cause a price decline because of the increased chance of his untimely demise. For most companies the opposite is true. Academic research shows that most shareholders make money when the CEO dies unexpectedly. The share price goes up because shareholders believe a new CEO will add value, or in some cases because they are unlikely to bilk the company as much. The classic example is Armand Hammer, the head of Occidental Petroleum, whose share price rose by half a billion dollars the day he died. The rule for CEO health disclosures should be the same as that for any inside information: disclose material facts you know or abstain from trading in the company’s shares. The disclosure obligation should be high for CEOs who are very good, such as Mr Jobs. But it should be even higher for CEOs who are very bad. Ironically, average CEOs have a better claim to privacy, because fewer people care about their health.

If an executive so intimately entwined with a business is close to stepping down, for whatever reason, then the market will take a view. But individuals, however high-profile, have the right to protect their own privacy. No one wants to see a run on the stock price on the back of unsubstantiated rumour. But nor does anyone need to intrude into an individual’s personal circumstances. The role of the board is crucial here. They have a responsibility to protect shareholders from the influence of untoward speculation and need to be certain of the facts before appropriate decisions and relevant announcements can be made. If an individual dominates a company and its board so completely, then clarity can sometimes be compromised. Of course, demonstrating the breadth of the management team is important for any company, particularly one with a strong figurehead.

Ben W. Heineman, Jr
A CEO’s health issues should be disclosed when they will significantly affect her capacity to lead the corporation. This can be the result of a sustained inability to function or a life-threatening illness or some combination of the two – factors that would influence a reasonable investor in making an investment decision or that are likely to move the stock. These are, of course, the general materiality standards under US and EU securities laws. But the regulators have not sought to define when CEO health events require disclosure. No matter. Such disclosure should occur either because of a careful interpretation of the law or because good governance requires it. CEOs are public figures. They should waive any privacy limitations imposed by law or by personal preference. Apple’s obfuscatory answer to questions about Steve Jobs’ health is exactly the wrong way to go. In light of serious medical issues in the past, Apple should say that his illness has recurred or that it has not.

Joel Kurtzman
Here is a little test to determine whether the illness of a leader of a public company should be disclosed. If the company were family-owned and the CEO were the owner’s son or daughter, would the illness be serious enough to tell the old man? If the answer is yes, then the company should inform its shareholders. Individuals have a right to keep their personal life private. But when they have senior roles in public companies their responsibilities change. Investors entrust them with money and rely on them to produce results. As part of the bargain leaders are paid well but give up some of their rights, among them the right to absolute privacy. While the details of an illness should remain personal, the ability of a senior executive to lead the company is more than personal. Therefore it should be made public. For shareholders, a CEO who is seriously ill is not much different from one who is under indictment or otherwise hobbled in their capacity to carry out the job. When that happens it is time to tell the owners so they can make plans.

133;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2008-06-29T23:33:17Z;Who’s who: Some leading lights in the power business;;"Sérgio Gabrielli
President, PetrobrasAs the head of the national oil company in the country that is attracting the most excitement from the global industry, Sérgio Gabrielli is in a uniquely influential position.Recent exploration in the deep waters off Brazil has stoked hopes that there is a huge oil resource waiting to be tapped in a country that is, compared with many oil-rich nations, a relatively easy place to work.In a recent FT interview, however, Mr Gabrielli said Brazil needed to change the laws governing the oil industry, to reflect its expected emergence as a powerful oil producer and capture more of the proceeds for the government.Those changes could make Petrobras, which already has the leading role in Brazil’s deep-water exploration, even more dominant. The Brazilian government has a minority stake in Petrobras’s equity, but a majority of the voting shares.An economist, Mr Gabrielli worked as an academic and was the chief financial officer of Petrobras before becoming chief executive in 2005. His masters degree is in “fiscal incentives and regional development”: an appropriate qualification for his role in the future of the Brazilian oil industry.Paolo Scaroni
Chief executive, EniPaolo Scaroni has had the most active year of any of the big western oil company chiefs. Eni has been on an acquisition spree, investing in assets from the Gulf of Mexico to Russia, and buying Burren Energy, a UK-listed oil independent active in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Turkmenistan.At the same time, he has been polishing Eni’s reputation as the company prepared to tackle political challenges that the other oil majors balk at: renegotiating its contracts in Libya,signing a deal to develop what could be a huge oil sands deposit in Congo, and even proposing a significant new investment in Venezuela, the majors’ bête noire since president Hugo Chávez seized control of the industry.Amidst all that, Mr Scaroni managed to secure reappointment for a second three-year term, following speculation that the Italian government, which decides the nominations for the job, might refuse to put him forward. One rumour in Rome was that he would be made to carry the can for the troubles of the huge Kashagan project in Kazakhstan, where Eni is the operator of the first phase. But he has survived, and the talks about the future of the project continue.Shokri Ghanem
Chairman, Libya’s National Oil CorporationAt a time when most resource-rich countries are becoming more difficult for international companies, Libya is an exception, and Shokri Ghanem, chairman of the country’s national oil company, is leading that strategy.At the same time as Libya has been welcoming new investment from foreign companies such as ExxonMobil and BP, however, it has been tightening contract terms for companies that have been in the country for many years such as Eni of Italy, Occidental of the US and OMV of Austria.Mr Ghanem, 65, was educated in Libya and the US, where he took his PhD in the 1970s. He worked as a civil servant in the petroleum ministry and as an academic and, for eight years until 2001, was head of the research division at Opec’s headquarters in Vienna.He took over at the NOC in 2006. He also represents Libya at Opec, where he has been one of the most eloquent exponents of the view that the oil producers’ group should not be blamed for high prices. He told Reuters recently: “The easy, cheap oil is over; peak oil is looming.”Rex Tillerson
Chairman and chief executive, ExxonMobilAs chairman of ExxonMobil, you have to be prepared for some personal criticism, and Rex Tillerson has suffered his share.Long the least popular of all energy companies for many environmental campaigners because of its attitude to alternative energy and the threat of climate change, Exxon under Mr Tillerson has trimmed its position from the uncompromising stance taken by his predecessor, Lee Raymond.However, the company has come under fire from some shareholders, most notably members of the Rockefeller family, descendents of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Exxon’s ancestor company Standard Oil.The criticism went directly to Mr Tillerson’s role at the head of the company: the dissident shareholders wanted, among other things, the appointment of an independent chairman to set the strategic direction for the business. A 30-year Exxon veteran, who has been facing battles from Venezuela to Kazakhstan, Mr Tillerson was never likely to concede meekly. When the issue came to a vote at Exxon’s annual meeting in May, support for splitting the jobs actually dropped. It won 39.5 per cent of the vote, down slightly from the 40 per cent vote for the same proposal made the previous year.Tony Hayward
Chief executive, BPThe newest chief executive among the international oil companies is facing the biggest challenge.Tony Hayward took over at BP just over a year ago, following the turbulent end to the tenure of Lord Browne, his superstar predecessor. Mr Hayward quickly identified structural and operational changes as his priority, to improve the efficiency of BP’s operations. He has, however, been thrown into an urgent strategic problem by the increasingly bitter row with BP’s Russian partners in TNK-BP.That company, a 50:50 joint venture between BP and the Alfa-Access-Renova group of Russian tycoons, is vital to BP’s production, reserves and growth prospects, and Mr Hayward and AAR are locked in a battle to control it.The safety of a merger with one of the state-controlled energy companies, Gazprom and Rosneft, would be the best possible outcome for BP; a long drawn-out battle that weakens TNK-BP’s performance would be the worst.If Mr Hayward manages to secure that more favourable outcome, he will have well and truly earned his spurs.Lars Josefsson
Chief executive, VattenfallAlthough energy executives are accustomed to talking about the dangers of climate change and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Lars Josefsson got there first, and remains one of the pre-eminent voices on the issue. He is an adviser to Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, who has been a powerful force in shaping European policy.As chief executive of Vattenfall, the Swedish state-owned power company, Mr Josefsson is an articulate advocate of low-carbon energy: both renewable and nuclear. He points out that electricity is the form of energy that is most readily made emissions-free, whether through renewables such as wind, solar and hydro power, nuclear, or coal and gas-fired power plants that capture and store their emissions.His own company still emits a large volume of carbon dioxide from its fossil-fuel plants, and will continue to do so for as long as carbon capture technology is not in general use.Nevertheless, he says, “it is conceivable that all of Europe’s power generation can be virtually emissions-free by 2050”."
134;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2008-05-21T21:49:56Z;Ecuador’s oil chief quits as output dips;;The president of Ecuador’s state-owned petroleum company has resigned after new figures promised a fresh decline in oil production from Opec’s newest member.Fernando Zurita, a naval admiral who was appointed by Rafael Correa, Ecuador’s leftist president, in November to stamp out alleged corruption and tighten security at Petroecuador, blamed the expected shortfall on the failure of Venezuela’s state-owned PDVSA to deliver an oil rig.On Monday Mr Zurita revealed Petroecuador would only be able to produce 172,000 barrels of oil a day this year, down from a previous estimate of 185,000 b/d.The country’s central bank reported last week that average oil production for Ecuador’s overall oil industry dropped to 508,000 b/d in March, falling back to the level of last August after a temporary peak.The problems in Ecuador, one of the US’s top 10 oil suppliers, reflect production difficulties across the region’s main oil exporters. Production in Mexico and Venezuela has been stagnating or declining in recent years, according to figures from the Energy Information Administration, the US government’s energy watchdog.The contribution to Ecuador’s gross domestic product from its oil industry shrank by 9 per cent last year. In 2006 Alfredo Palacio, Mr Correa’s predecessor, revoked the contract of Occidental Petroleum, at the time the biggest foreign investor.Foreign oil companies have been reducing investment in Ecuador amid erratic policy moves by Mr Correa. The president has stopped short of calling for nationalisation but has demanded renegotiation of contracts with foreign oil companies including Spain’s Repsol YPF, Brazil’s Petrobras, and Chinese-owned Andes Petroleum since he came to power last year.At present foreign oil companies share revenues with the Ecuadorean government up to per-barrel caps that are well below current oil prices. Mr Correa would like this to be switched for a system whereby foreign oil companies were paid a fixed sum for the extraction of oil, while the government would reap any oil-price windfalls.Mr Correa has twice stunned the industry in the past eight months, first by raising windfall taxes on oil from 50 per cent to 99 per cent last October, then last month by pulling the plug on an agreement with the companies negotiated by Galo Chiriboga, his energy and mines minister.“If it weren’t for that [last policy change] we’d have signed new deals with the oil companies by now,” a senior ministry official said.Companies are lining up to fight the windfall tax. Quito newspaper El Comercio on May 14 reported that two – Perenco of France and Burlington Resources of the US – had gone to the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Dispute, joining Occidental and City Oriented, a small US-owned oil producer that has decided to leave Ecuador.
135;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2008-05-15T03:20:23Z;Oil and gas: Battle to exploit hidden riches;;When the United Arab Emirates is listed among the world’s top 10 oil producers, the UAE’s name could easily be substituted for that of Abu Dhabi.The emirate – which is the nation’s capital – is home to about 95 per cent of the UAE’s proven oil reserves and 90 per cent of its proven gas reserves.But, like other countries in the region, rising drilling and riggings costs, combined with shortages of skilled personnel and equipment, are affecting Abu Dhabi’s expansion plans.The emirate embarked on a multibillion-dollar programme a few years ago to increase oil production to 4m barrels a day, through the development of new and old fields, by the end of the decade. However, tight market conditions have meant delays seem inevitable.Abu Dhabi’s current production is around 2.6m b/d.“Things are moving more slowly than planned, mainly because of the tight markets in labour, services and materials,” says Ross Cassidy, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie.Officials say 4m b/d is still the target, with the ambition to reach it as quickly as possible, but there is a recognition that it will “take as long as it takes”.A report by the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London said in April that the UAE would boost oil production by more than 10 per cent to 3m b/d in 2012 – below earlier targets – as part of Opec plans to manage resources.The UAE has proven oil reserves of about 97.6bn barrels, according to the US’s Energy Information Administration, the fifth largest in the region, and there remains scope to increase production at numerous underdeveloped fields.Abu Dhabi is also one of the few Gulf countries where international companies are able to be fully operational. However, although there is no income tax in the UAE, oil companies remain an exception and pay 50 per cent or more, making for tight margins of an estimated $1 per barrel.The 75-year-old onshore and offshore oil concessions granted to foreign companies are set to expire in 2014 and 2018 respectively. Little has been said publicly about negotiations as the international oil companies try to get a better deal when the concessions are renewed.Another area where Abu Dhabi is seeking to expand is with non-associated gas. The UAE’s gas reserves are estimated to be the fifth largest in the world, with proven reserves of 214 trillion cubic feet.A significant development expected this year is the award of a $10bn sour gas contract by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) to develop the Shah field.The notoriously secretive company has kept its cards close to its chest, but ConocoPhillips said in April it expected to be “working” on the project. Royal Dutch Shell and Occidental had been viewed as frontrunners during the months-long negotiations.“Hopefully, there will be an announcement that we will be working together in the next month or two,” Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, told the FT in Houston.“ConocoPhillips’ win was a surprise as the industry expected Shell or Occidental to win,” said Mr Cassidy. “The company’s sour gas experience and aggressive bid perhaps gave it a competitive edge over its rivals, but it remains a very challenging project.”Yet there have also been difficulties with Abu Dhabi’s gas expansion plans.Officials had initially put the development of the Bab and Shah fields out to joint tender, hoping the two would eventually produce 3bn cu ft a day towards meeting rising demand for power generation and energy intensive industries.But the development of the Bab field has been delayed, mainly because of the scarcity of specialised equipment needed for the sour gas project. The lead time for some equipment is 18 months to two years, experts say.Adnoc elected to re-tender just for Shah as it is less complex and has higher liquid yields, analysts say.A large portion of Abu Dhabi’s gas is sour gas, which requires expensive and complicated production techniques to reduce high levels of toxic hydrogen sulphide.In an attempt to help the emirates meet soaring demand for gas for power generation, water desalination and industry as the UAE’s economies expand, a project called Dolphin, that imports 2bn cu ft a day from Qatar to Abu Dhabi, went online last year. That was a landmark because it was the first export pipeline within the region, said Mr Cassidy.But plans to increase its capacity to 3.2bn cu ft a day are unlikely to materialise any time soon because of a moratorium Qatar’s North Field until 2010.Occidental Petroleum of the US and Total of France are Abu Dhabi’s partners in Dolphin, which carries gas from Qatar’s North Field gas reservoir to the UAE and Oman.“It seems hard to believe there’s a gas supply shortfall,” says Mr Cassidy. “But gas is needed to support oil production as well as meet domestic demand and the whole region is facing supply pressures.”
136;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2008-04-22T21:25:19Z;ConocoPhillips nears Abu Dhabi deal;;ConocoPhillips expects to announce in the “next month or two’’ that it will be working on Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s $10bn sour gas project.“We’re working very hard on this project,’’ Jim Mulva, Conoco’s chief executive, told the Financial Times. “Hopefully there will be an announcement that we will be working together in the next month or two.’’The contract has been under negotiations for months, with Royal Dutch Shell and Occidental Petroleum reported as front contenders at the end of last year. However, in recent months Occidental has been advised it is not a finalist.Winning the gas contract would be a boon at a time when international oil companies, such as Conoco, are having difficulties accessing new resources amid growing nationalism in oil-rich countries.High oil prices have made the project economic and United Arab Emirates is looking to international oil companies to help, given the experience they have with such difficult projects.Much of the gas will be used to meet the increasing needs of the United Arab Emirates amid its rapid economic development.The country is estimated to have more than 200 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, making it the world’s fifth-largest holder of gas reserves. Securing this contract would put Conoco in a strong position to win others in the UAE.Mr Mulva’s comments are the furthest Conoco has gone to confirm still officially unconfirmed reports from the UAE that it was going to get the contract.And while Mr Mulva would not say specifically that Conoco had won the contract, his comments reflect unconfirmed reports by the UAE that the company was in the final running.“We expect to be working with Adnoc,’’ Mr Mulva said. “It’s an important project for Adnoc, and it’s an important project for ourselves.’’Separately, Mr Mulva would not give specific details about talks in another part of the world, Venezuela, where it took a $4.5bn writeoff last year after the government seized control of its assets in a nationalisation of the energy sector. The company is attempting to recover those losses.“We’re trying to determine the value of the investment made,’’ Mr Mulva said. Once Conoco and Caracas agree to the value, he said, they can determine how the country could reimburse Conoco.“I’m always an optimist,’’ Mr Mulva said. “I would like it sorted in 2008.’’During the interim, Conoco continues to buy oil from Venezuela, where Mr Mulva routinely meets officials in what he describes as a “very cordial relationship’’.
137;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2008-03-04T23:20:54Z;Ecuador seeks private oil field developers;;"Ecuador’s state-owned oil company, PetroEcuador, wants private-sector contractors to develop four fields in the Amazon basin, backing off from plans to involve government-controlled majors from Asia and Latin America in the projects.The tender for the fields is planned to go ahead towards the end of the first quarter, once environmental reviews and production estimates are completed. The company expects winning bidders to invest about $1bn (€660m, £500m) in the fields over the coming three years.“There are three companies in the market that can do what we want”, including Franco-American group Schlumberger, and Halliburton and Baker Hughes of the US, said Fernando Zurita, the navy admiral at the helm of PetroEcuador since November, in a recent meeting with journalists.Despite the six-year boom in the oil industry, Ecuador has failed to ramp up production. The industry contracted by 9 per cent on the year in 2007 after the previous administration stripped the US-based Occidental Petroleum of its concession and handed it to an ill-prepared PetroEcuador.President Rafael Correa had previously said he wanted to enlist the likes of China’s Sinopec and Indonesia’s Pertamina in the fields. But the idea was dropped following a lengthy meeting with PetroEcuador officials in January, said Mr Zurita. “The plan to involve foreign state-owned oil companies will not go ahead.”Officials at the oil services companies say they have been discussing the terms under which the tender could work in the Auca, Lago Agrio, Libertador and Shushufindi fields, which PetroEcuador says hold 2.4bn barrels of crude.Regarding the mature fields, “PetroEcuador’s plans are very ambitious. It would be better to start with one field for a year and proceed from there”, said one
official under condition of anonymity.In a similar scheme, PetroEcuador officials on behalf of the government are negotiating changes in oil contracts with the six main private-sector companies. Rather than sharing in the revenue, the government wants to pay Chinese-owned Andes Petroleum, France’s Perenco, Spanish-Argentine Repsol-YPF, Brazilian Petrobras and US-owned City Oriente for extracting oil.“Under current conditions, it is reasonable for the government to look for these terms,” said an official at a US oil company that no longer works in Ecuador.The government is impatiently trying to change the rules of the game in order to benefit from the high oil price. Mr Correa recently gave the companies a deadline of Saturday to agree to new terms. If the companies preferred to leave, the government would compensate them for their investments made so far, he said.If it manages to meet its production targets for the year, Ecuador will also need to wrestle a higher quota out of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets on Wednesday, or break its 520,000 barrels a day allotment just months after rejoining the cartel.In December, Ecuador produced 531,700 barrels a day, and by the end of the year, PetroEcuador will have a daily output of about 306,000 barrels, including the former Occidental block’s targeted 107,000 barrels.Occidental’s assets have been passed to PetroEcuador unit PetroAmazonas, maintaining its private-sector structure despite state ownership. That would allow it to retain both operating efficiency and qualified engineers, said Mr Zurita.Despite flirting with the private sector, however, Mr Correa will not allow any private capital into the state oil sector, Mr Zurita said."
138;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2008-01-27T22:30:49Z;January 28: Partying like it’s 1999;;Doing a bit of light shopping in Fortnum and Mason’s on a recent trip home, this correspondent was interested to hear the well-groomed couple next to him speaking Brazilian Portuguese. It was neither the first nor last such sighting. Middle and upper class Brazilians, flush with the power of their steadily strengthening currency, are travelling and spending as they haven’t done for years.It is reminiscent of the days before the real’s crash in 1999. Then, shopping trips to Miami were the in thing. Now it is London, Paris and Vienna. But such high-rolling tourism and a taste at home for imported goods, along with other factors such as greater remittances by multinational companies, are turning Brazil’s current account surplus into a deficit.Cause for concern? Many investors think not. Brazil, like other emerging markets, is far better placed to ride out global turmoil now than it was in the aftermath of the Russian and Asian crises of the late 1990s.But there are other warning signs. Inflation is creeping up. The central bank has stopped cutting interest rates, and market lending rates are rising. In the first three weeks of this year, foreign investors withdrew R$4.5bn from the São Paulo Stock Exchange.As one market economist commented to the FT recently, public policy in Brazil is largely irrelevant. What has delivered low inflation, cheap credit, more jobs and rising prosperity is a combination of two external factors: commodity prices and liquidity.As both those factors become a real and present cause for concern around the world, Brazilians – both individuals and the government – might wonder whether profligacy is the best response. A change in global conditions might even prompt Brasília to deliver the tax, pension and other reforms it has chosen not to implement during recent years of prosperity. But don’t bet on it.Jonathan WheatleyMexico’s reshuffleA lot has been said and written about Juan Camilo Mouriño’s appointment this month to the post of Mexico’s interior minister in President Felipe Calderón’s government. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the Spanish press has jumped on the fact that the 36-year-old economist was born in Madrid and that his family is owner of Celta de Vigo, the Spanish football club. More surprising, though, is the fact that most media have focused one-dimensionally on his appointment in the context of the war against drugs.The problem is that to view his move in these terms alone is to overlook the fact that Mr Calderón appointed Mr Mouriño mainly because he felt he was the person with the best chance of brokering a reform of Mexico’s energy sector.The thorny issue of energy reform is now without doubt the biggest priority of the Calderón government. In the coming weeks, it hopes to present Congress with a proposal that would, at the least, patch Mexico’s falling oil production. But to do so it needs the co-operation of the other political parties.In that sense, Mr Mouriño is an inspired choice. In his previous position as head of the President’s office, he had already shown his ability to forge contacts with the opposition forces in Congress. And it is no accident that on the day he was appointed to the post of interior minister, he met not only Beatriz Paredes, head of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), but also Germán Martínez, the new head of Mr Calderón’s National Action party (PAN).Mr Mouriño has congressional experience and, significantly, used to head the Congress’s energy commission. More important, the parties and their leaders will know that Mr Mouriño has the confidence of the president. That is not enough to guarantee the smooth passage of an energy reform through Congress. But it is a good start.Adam ThomsonVenezuela’s new fx lawVenezuela’s new foreign exchange control law, which comes into force on Monday, is designed to reduce the amount of dollars that Cadivi, the government agency responsible, dishes out at the official 2.15 Bolivar rate.Officials insist that the law’s measures – which include a ban on publishing any exchange rate other than the official one - will cause the gap between the official rate and the parallel rate (currently around 5 Bolivars to the dollar) to narrow.It will not work, however. In fact, the gap is only likely to widen further this year, since restricting access to cheap Cadivi dollars will cause demand for black market dollars to rise, in turn spurring on inflation – already one of the highest rates in the world.True, the other option - attempting to satisfy demand for dollars at the official exchange rate - would be a drain on central bank reserves. But if the currency was valued more realistically (it is reckoned to be some 30 to 50 per cent overvalued) all this would cease to be a problem. As things stand, however, an exchange rate adjustment doesn’t look likely any time soon.In the meantime, it is clear that the new measures amount to no more than legal tampering.Benedict ManderEcuador’s imageEcuador has justified its decision to revoke 587 mining contracts on the grounds that the companies affected – which include Canada’s Ascendant – have not paid annual fees.Whatever the legal rights and wrongs, Friday’s decision – just like the much bigger one involving Occidental of the US a couple of years ago - will do little to improve business sentiment in a country sorely in need of inward investment. Neither for that matter will President Rafael Correa’s announcement on Saturday that foreign oil companies will have just 45 days in which to negotiate new contracts with the government.That is not to say that Mr Correa is headed irreversibly towards the imposition of a radical nationalist regime, along the lines of developments in Venezuela and Bolivia. There have been plenty of signs recently that the government really does want to attract foreign companies to help it develop commodity exports. In the mining sector, for example, the authorities are apparently keen to overhaul an antiquated law within the first half of this year. In the oil sector, they are seeking to attract up to $1bn in investment from oil service companies such as Halliburton and Schlumberger to help the state oil company, Petroecuador, increase the productivity of several mature fields. Plans to restrict involvement to the state-owned companies of friendly governments have been quietly abandoned.Yet, if the government is to be successful in these aims, Mr Correa and his ministers need to moderate their rhetoric and worry a lot more about the image they are creating. Their raw materials may be attractive, but Ecuador should remember that foreign investors have plenty of other options. As things stand any investor examining Latin America’s potential is much more likely to commit resources to countries such as Peru, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, a fact borne out by recent statistics on foreign direct investment.Richard LapperBad news for bureaucratsIt is a shame that José Serra, one of the founders of Brazil’s centrist opposition PSDB, is probably best known for his two successive failures to win the presidency (last time, he failed even to get the PSDB candidacy). But he has also won fame as an able and even ground-breaking public servant. It was while he was health minister, for example, that Brazil won landmark victories against pharmaceutical companies and brought affordable treatment for HIV to the masses, halting Brazil’s Aids epidemic in its tracks.Now, as state governor of São Paulo, he is waging war on bureaucracy – one of the most deeply entrenched and obstructive aspects of Brazilian life. Measures announced last week, for example, will remove the requirement for signatures on most official documents to be recognised and stamped by public notaries. It is the first of a series of measures to be introduced by next year which, it is hoped, will reduce the average time taken to open a new business in the state from 152 to 15 days.Mr Serra began tackling bureaucracy during his previous job as mayor of São Paulo city. As a result of that work, a new anti-bureaucracy agency opens in the city on Tuesday. One of its first tasks will be to reduce the number of stages companies must go through to qualify for public works from 400 to a target of 70, many of them to be undertaken simultaneously.It is all further evidence that, even if Brasília is incapable of delivering the structural reforms needed to speed growth, better management at the local level can help get the country’s famously enterprising citizens to work, creating jobs and paying taxes. The federal government should take a closer look.Jonathan Wheatley
139;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2007-12-17T18:35:34Z;National Oilwell to buy Grant Prideco;;National Oilwell Varco on Monday agreed to buy Grant Prideco for $7.5bn in cash and stock, in a deal that unites the two Houston-based oil services companies amid a wave of consolidation in the sector driven by high oil prices.National Oilwell is paying $58 per share for Grant Prideco, composed of $23.20 in cash and the rest in shares, valuing the group at a 22 per cent premium over its closing price of $47.46 on Friday.The combined group will have a market capitalisation of about $32bn, supplying technology and equipment such as pipes for oil and gas drilling to the world’s largest energy groups.The deal comes on the heels of the $18bn merger announced in July of GlobalSantaFe and Transocean, two of the oil services sector’s largest companies, which raised pressure on rivals to respond.“We are delighted with the way this transaction advances our strategic goal of providing more products and services to our customers. We believe Grant Prideco’s product range will add new growing market segments to National Oilwell Varco and benefit our customers’ needs worldwide,” said Pete Miller, National Oilwell chief executive.The companies said that the deal would add to National Oilwell’s earnings and cash flow in 2008, assuming cost-savings of $40m.But investors appeared unconvinced by the deal, sending National Oilwell shares down 6.5 per cent to $72.38 in morning trading. National Oilwell merged with Varco in a $2.5bn deal in 2004 and has seen the value of its shares more than treble since then.While the deal is a sign that mergers and acquisitions activity by strategic buyers remains possible despite the credit squeeze, the market reaction suggests that shareholders could be sceptical about companies spending on acquisitions in an environment of tight lending and uncertainty over the economy.Also in the US energy industry, Plains Exploration & Production agreed to sell a portfolio of assets in the Permian Basin, Texas, and New Mexico to rivals Occidental Petroleum and XTO Energy for $1.75bn.Although high oil prices have driven consolidation among suppliers to the large US energy groups, there has been relatively little deal activity among the large US oil groups.Goldman Sachs advised National Oilwell and Credit Suisse advised Grant Prideco.
140;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2007-07-17T18:39:54Z;Basell buys Lyondell for $12.7bn;;Basell, the Dutch chemicals group, on Tuesday offered $12.7bn in cash to buy larger rival Lyondell and cement its ambition to become a global leader in a business being transformed by consolidation and new entrants.Houston-based Lyondell would triple Basell’s annual revenues to $34bn, with a range of commodity products such as polypropylene and polyethylene, supplemented by one of the largest US oil refiners.The agreed deal comes a week after Basell, which is controlled by the US industrialist Len Blavatnik, was outbid in the auction of US-based Huntsman.Hexion, the chemicals group controlled by Apollo Management, broke up Basell’s effort to diversify its commodity-based business with a $6.5bn offer.Basell also lost out to Saudi Arabia’s Sabic in the sale of General Electric’s plastics business.However, Mr Blavatnik – whose interests include real estate and a stake in Time Warner, responded with an even larger acquisition in an effort to drive synergies from its largely commodity-based chemicals business and diversify into the high-margin refining sector.Mr Blavatnik’s Access Industries’ holding company is offering $48 a share for Lyondell in an agreed deal that values its target at a 20 per cent premium to its close on Monday and 48 per cent above its level in May, when Basell first disclosed its interest.Lyondell shares climbed 17 per cent to a record high of $46.85, though remained below the offer price.However, analysts signalled that the “land grab” for raw materials and US refining capacity could yet trigger a counterbid, notably from large oil companies.Lyondell has cleaned up its balance sheet through asset sales – though Basell will assume about $6bn in debt – and signalled in May that it was open to potential offers.Access, which created Basell from the commodity chemicals operations of BASF and Royal Dutch Shell in 2005, was keen to improve its downstream business and access to raw materials through the Huntsman deal.Lyondell will provide a similar role in creating a more vertically integrated business and supplies for its plastics and synthetic material products.Analysts had long viewed the two groups as complementary, with Lyondell’s strength focused in the US and Basell focused on Europe, though both have big operations in Asia.Basell acquired a small stake in Lyondell in May, together with an option to boost the holding to 8.3 per cent by acquiring the remaining shares held by Occidental, the US-based oil group.
141;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2007-07-09T22:30:04Z;Ecuador threatens Petrobras;;Ecuador threatened on Monday to expel Petrobras, the Brazilian state oil company, for breaking the terms of its operating contract.The warning comes a year after Quito kicked out Occidental, the US oil company that was the biggest foreign investor in the country, on similar charges. The government seized $1bn of the company’s assets, prompting Occidental to file a claim against Ecuador at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.It also comes at a time when Hugo Chávez – Venezuelan president and a close ally of Rafael Correa, the Ecuadorean president – is seen by many to be challenging Brazil for influence in South America.Last week Mr Chávez gave Brazil a three-month deadline to approve Venezuela’s membership of the Mercosur trading bloc.“We will probably have to think about cancelling the contract with Petrobras,” Xavier Garaicoa, Ecuador’s attorney-general, said in a television interview.Mr Garaicoa added that “a simple analysis from a legal point of view” would suggest that Petrobras had been operating in the country illegally. His comments came after an official report recommended revoking Petrobras’s right to operate in Ecuador.Jorge Alban, the country’s acting energy minister, has yet to decide on a course of action but the report and the attorney-general’s statement has made the Brazilian state company’s possible expulsion more likely.Mr Alban has refused to rule out the possibility of cancelling Petrobras’s contracts. The company – which extracts about 36,000 barrels a day – has denied any wrongdoing.
142;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2007-05-13T17:39:35Z;May 14: Brazil’s one-way currency;;"Brazil’s enduring export boom continues to drive the Brazilian real’s appreciation against the US dollar. For the past month it has been nudging the R$2.00 barrier and is expected to break it at any moment, reaching its highest level against the dollar in more than six years (on Friday it closed below R$2.02). As the central bank mops up exporters’ dollars on the foreign exchange market, its dollar purchases should be expected to slow down the real’s progress. But a distortion in Brazil’s foreign exchange markets is actually helping the real on its way.This is because the spot market is limited to a small number of accredited banks, while the futures market has no such restrictions. The spot market, therefore, is much less liquid, meaning that central bank intervention has an exaggerated impact on the exchange rate.Although the real has strengthened against the dollar over the past four years, investors have consistently expected it to weaken in the future. The year-end rate, for example, is currently expected to be about R$2.08. So investors bringing dollars to Brazil to buy reals and invest them in high-yielding local debt accept that part of their profit will be lost to real depreciation when they exit the trade. When the central bank buys dollars on the spot market – devaluing the real and reducing the difference between the spot and future rates – it reduces that currency risk. The attractiveness of investing in reals then becomes such that dollars flood onto the spot market to take advantage. Instead of weakening the real by buying dollars, the central bank ends up boosting it instead.If the central bank were fending off such speculative flows alone, its job might be easier. But since currency flows are overwhelmingly trade driven, there is not much it can do. Expect the R$2.00 barrier to fall soon.Jonathan WheatleyTrade tangosTwo steps forward, two steps back for freer trade in Latin America. On the one hand, an agreement on Capitol Hill last week that should allow Peru and Panama, and, potentially at least, Colombia to gain congressional approval for bilateral trade deals with Washington. On the other, moves by Ecuador and Bolivia that weaken the rights of investors and reduce the possibility that either country will be able to convert temporary US trade concessions into more permanent trade pacts.The Democratic congressional majority and the Bush administration revived the bilateral trade deals for Panama and Peru by including provisions guaranteeing labour rights as well as giving both countries greater leeway to use generic drugs. The US pharmaceutical industry which fears that this latter modification could set a precedent will lobby hard but it now seems likely that both deals will win congressional approval. The future of the Colombia FTA, however, is a lot more problematic, mainly because of Democrat concern about the killings of local labour organisers in Colombia and alleged links between rightwing paramilitaries and government supporters. President Álvaro Uribe will return to Washington in June to continue pressing for a breakthrough.Ecuador and Bolivia, meanwhile, are doing themselves long-term damage by pulling out of investment treaties. In the latest move Ecuador may announce this week that it is withdrawing from a bilateral investment treaty with the US, following its establishment last week of a commission to analyse the issue. President Rafael Correa is partly doing this in response to a case brought against it by Occidental, the US oil company expelled from the country last year, at the World Bank’s International Center for Investment Disputes (ICSID). Occidental is asking the ICSID to order Ecuadorian authorities not to sell installations it seized after intervening last year until there is a decision on the case. The Center will rule on the matter in the next couple of months.Bolivia’s government has already said it wants to withdraw from the ICSID. It faces the threat of arbitration from two companies: Telecom Italia over the government takeover of Entel, its Bolivian subsidiary; and Glencore, the Swiss commodities trader, over the government’s seizure of the company’s Vinto tin smelter. In practice, the moves will not affect investment made under the existing rules, but both countries risk deterring much-need foreign investment, as well complicating any future renewal of their trade preferences under the Andean trade protection and drugs eradication legislation. There may be short-term political gain for Mr Correa and Mr Morales, but Ecuador and Bolivia will end up losing out, especially of their bigger and wealthier neighbours are able to seal long-term trade pacts.Hal WeitzmanEcuador: listen for the crunchIt is make-your-mind-up time for Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa on Tuesday when a $30.6m coupon on its 2012 global bond issue falls due. During his election campaign the leftwing leader frequently threatened to restructure Ecuador’s debt burden. Last time a payment fell due, he dropped big hints about not paying but ultimately paid in full and on time. This time, he has said nothing but debt markets are still wary: spreads on the country’s credit derivatives have widened sharply.Ecuador’s international financial reputation remains in the doldrums and Mr Correa has not helped matters by the way he has settled personal scores at the World Bank. Meanwhile, data out last week should worry the government: they showed Ecuador had turned a $442m trade surplus for the first quarter of 2006 to a $181m deficit for the first three months of this year. That is largely down to falling oil exports, which dropped 17 per cent in March from the same month last year.Hal WeitzmanRisk appreciationWhen Petrobras, Brazil’s government controlled oil group, was forced to sell its refineries in Bolivia at less than face value last week, analysts were quick to identify the deal as one more symptom of the increasingly unsafe environment for investment under the Bolivia government and other like-minded regimes in the region.But while Petrobras licked its wounds, Braskem, a petrochemicals company, was busy dusting off plans for a $1.5bn petrochemicals plant in Bolivia, on the shelf since president Evo Morales announced the nationalisation of the country’s hydrocarbons industry on May 1 2006.One reason was a previous setback for Petrobras in February, when Bolivia forced it to start paying for the higher value gases that form part of the natural gas mix. Previously, Petrobras had been paying for the relatively low-value methane that forms most of the mix and doing nothing with the butane and other gases useful to the petrochemicals industry that accompanying it out of the ground. With Petrobras now looking for a market – and somebody to build a gas separation plant – Braskem has spotted its opening.But Bolivia is not the only unstable environment to attract Braskem and its parent, Odebrecht, a construction group with a history of taking on projects in hotspots around the world. The two are currently involved in projects in Venezuela, for example. Investors looking for a play on the upside of the region’s mounting political risk might fancy a punt.Jonathan WheatleyVenezuela: look before you leapA couple of weeks ago Hugo Chávez announced with great fanfare that Venezuela would withdraw from the IMF. But it looks as though he hadn’t assessed all the implications. Clauses on sovereign bond contracts stipulate that Venezuela must remain a member of the Fund. By leaving the institution Venezuela would be entering into a technical default, enabling bondholders to demand to be paid in full immediately.In practice creditors would only do this if their bonds were trading below face value. However, leaving the IMF could also carry other financial costs. For example, credit rating agencies might downgrade Venezuelan bonds making the issue of new debt more expensive.One solution might be for Venezuela to negotiate the removal of these clauses from its bond contracts. But that too would still carry a cost, perhaps as much as $500m. Consequently, Wall Street analysts reckon that Mr Chávez will simply back off from his threat, and hope no one will notice. Indeed, two weeks on and still the IMF has received no formal notification of Mr Chávez’s stated intentions. It would not be the first time that his bark has proved to be worse than his bite.Benedict Mander"

US crude has risen 20 per cent since dipping below the $50 level in mid-January, with colder weather boosting demand.Speculators’ gross short positions on crude are close to record highs and hedge funds rushed to cover those position after Occidental Petroleum declared force majeure on oil and gas supplies from the Elk Hills field, one of California’s largest, on Thursday. ICE March Brent fell 11 cents to $58.67 a barrel on Friday, up 0.9 per cent over the week.Colder weather has also supported demand for heating oil and natural gas.

Nymex March heating oil gained 2.5 per cent at $1.726 a gallon.Gold smashed through resistance at $660 a troy ounce, surging to $665.70, helped by a second day of buying by the Quadrica fund.Investors shrugged aside news that the International Monetary Fund was considering selling 400 tonnes of bullion as, though the plan would displace some European sales under the central bank gold agreement, it would not result in more net selling. Gold traded at $665.10 a troy ounce late in London on Friday, up 2.6 per cent this week.Platinum hit $1,203 a tonne as strike action at South Africa’s Modikwa mine looked set to enter its third week after negotiations reached deadlock.

Alberto Acosta, energy minister, said on Wednesday that the case was not admissible because Ecuador had not agreed to it.

The energy group was the laggard and ended 1.7 per cent lower, leaving it down 7.5 per cent for the year.The recent slide in oil prices is potentially good news for consumer spending and a boon for broad stock prices say analysts. But as the fourth-quarter earnings season got under way, investors kept the broad averages trading inside narrow ranges.“The one overwhelming constant since 2003 among investors has been perpetual worry and a lack of confidence,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “Earnings are a concern. But $50 oil is much better for the the vast majority of companies than $80 oil.”Technology shares led the market higher after the broad averages were lower in the morning.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,459.33, helped by gains in semiconductor stocks and Apple, up 4.8 per cent to $97.Apple set a new all-time high of $97.80 in early trade as it built on the surge which followed its unveiling on Tuesday of its new iPhone product. The shares have gained 14 per cent so far this year.Shares in Marvell Technology, a chipmaker used by Apple for the iPhone jumped 5.8 per cent to $20.88.On earnings, Alcoa, the aluminium producer, provided some cheer. Its shares rose 6 per cent to $30.23 after it reported profits of 74 cents a share, beating estimates of 65 cents.Companies start reporting results in earnest next week and analysts expect average earnings growth of 9.6 per cent for the fourth quarter. Earnings have grown above 10 per cent for the past 13 quarters.Alcoa helped staunch losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which turned positive by mid-afternoon and closed 0.2 per cent, or 25.56 points higher at at 12,442.16.A drag on the Dow was IBM, 1.2 per cent weaker at $98.89 after a broker downgrade and Exxon Mobil, off 1.5 per cent at $70.99, andAnalysts at Citigroup pointed to several US energy companies as the most leveraged to oil prices. These included Conoco­Phillips, down 3 per cent at $64.53, Occidental Petroleum, down 1.2 per cent at $43.13, Hess, 1.5 per cent lower at $47.50, and Chevron, which fell 1.7 per cent to $69.41 after it lowered fourth-quarter earnings expectations.In deal news, US Airways Group raised its offer for Delta Air to $10.2bn.

Wall Street analysts had been expecting larger cuts, and the stock lost 3.4 per cent to $19.31, making it the biggest faller in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Other chipmakers followed Intel lower. Advanced Micro Devices fell 6.5 per cent to $24.53, and Broadcom lost 5.4 per cent to $27.48. In spite of the falls, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index is still up 15 per cent in the past six weeks.General Motors was one of the rare bright spots, adding 2.4 per cent to $31.17, after it increased the warranty on its vehicles to 100,000 miles.Ford Motor also gained, jumping 1.9 per cent to $8.55, its highest level since the beginning of February. The rise came after the carmaker announced after the closing bell on Tuesday that Bill Ford was stepping down as chief executive and would be replaced by Alan Mulally of Boeing. Ford and GM were the day’s best performers in the S&P 500.At the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent, or 12.99 points, at 1,300.26, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.7 per cent, or 37.86 points, at 2,167.84.

148;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2006-06-26T15:49:18Z;James Altucher: Mergers that go forward in reverse;;I have written before in this space and in my recent book, SuperCash, about the rising popularity of reverse mergers. Reverse mergers are merger transactions that take place between a public company with little or no assets and a private company. The public “shell” then assumes the name and operations of the private company. Essentially, the reverse merger is an initial public offering for that private company.Some of the more famous reverse mergers were Turner Broadcasting and Occidental Petroleum. In the 1990s, when there were three times as many investment banks and a ton of venture capital money being thrown at any company with no earnings or even revenues, reverse mergers took on a bad name for two reasons.First, any company worth anything was doing an IPO the traditional way (through a mainstream bank). And second, the rubbish that was left was going public through the reverse merger process and then getting pumped and dumped by the unscrupulous.The situation is different now, with many legitimate companies choosing to go public through a reverse merger rather than paying exorbitant fees to banks and lawyers for a traditional IPO.Pacific Ethanol is a recent success story in the reverse merger world. The company merged into empty shell Accessity Corporation on March 24 2005. Right before the merger it completed a private financing – selling 7m shares at $3 a share. They did a Pipe (private investment in public equity) transaction in November 2005 with none other than Bill Gates, selling 5.25m units of convertible debt that could convert into shares at $16 a share and paid 5 per cent interest.The stock now trades at $22.74 after completing a further $145m Pipe transaction, where it sold stock at $26.38 a share.Another ethanol play that just went public via a reverse merger is Xethanol, which went public recently when it merged with bulletin board company Zen Pottery Equipment. This past week they began trading on the American Stock Exchange.Other than Pacific Ethanol, the most newsworthy reverse merger in the past few years was when Bob Sillerman bought the rights to Elvis Presley’s media properties and merged them into the shell Sports Entertainment. The company now trades as CKX.When that reverse merger happened a friend of mine was trying to buy the stock at about $1 (1,000 per cent higher than the day before) and I told him he was crazy. The stock then went past $20.Since reverse mergers, almost by definition, are hardly followed by the research departments of the big investment banks, there are opportunities in finding these companies shortly after their merger and focusing on the ones with the best earnings or revenue growth prospects.I recently met Steven Dresner, a partner at the Strategic Alliance Fund, a hedge fund focusing on (among other things) reverse mergers. His publication, the Reverse Merger Report, is a good resource. I asked him why there was such a sudden flurry of interest in reverse mergers. He said: “The certainty these alternative IPO transactions provide – in terms of not having to be concerned an underwritten offering will be pulled – has created a new primary market for securities of high-quality companies.”Some of the recent ones I am looking at include Foldera, which makes web-based organisation software, web-based e-mail, instant messaging, and other collaboration software for companies. The private company merged with public company Expert Systems in February 2006, changing its name to Foldera and its symbol to FDRA. Expert Systems was a defunct golf products maker. Foldera, which is pre-revenue, traded as high as $9 a share after the reverse merger, down to $3.05 last Friday. That gave it a $300m market cap.Another interesting web company to go public through the reverse merger process is Wall Street Direct, which completed a reverse merger in January 2006 with Financial Media Group. Wall Street Direct owns WallSt.net, which provides interviews with CEOs online. The company has a $46m market cap and since the reverse merger its shares have traded from 70 cents to $1.90.Many private and profitable Chinese companies are also looking to go public in the US markets by merging into empty and clean shells. (“Clean” in this context means there are no pre-existing liabilities or shareholder lawsuits left over from the prior public entity). Zhongpin, a food processing company in China recently got “acquired” by empty shell Strong Technical which then changed its name to Zhongpin and changed its ticker to ZHNP. The company has five food processing plants in China. Sales were $73m in 2005, and the company is aiming for $110m in 2006.Reverse mergers have been a successful way of breaking through the IPO oligopoly established by the first-tier banks. When the stats come out several years from now, my guess is that post-IPO results for reverse mergers will far surpass those of companies that went public through the traditional route
149;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2006-06-25T21:03:17Z;US military sees oil nationalism spectre;;Future supplies of oil from Latin America are at risk because of the spread of resource nationalism, a study by the US military that reflects growing concerns in the US administration over energy security has found.An internal report prepared by the US military’s Southern Command and obtained by the Financial Times follows a recent US congressional investigation that warned of the US’s vulnerability to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez’s repeated threats to “cut off” oil shipments to the US.The Southern Command analysis cautions that the extension of state control over energy production in several countries is deterring investment essential to increase and sustain oil output in the long term.“A re-emergence of state control in the energy sector will likely increase inefficiencies and, beyond an increase in short-term profits, will hamper efforts to increase long-term supplies and production,” the report said. So far this year, Venezuela has moved to double the level of taxes levied on oil production units operated by multinationals, Bolivia has nationalised its oil and gas fields, and Ecuador has seized several oilfields from Occidental Petroleum, the largest foreign oil company in the country.The report also noted that oil production in Mexico, which faces elections next weekend, is stagnating be-cause of constitutional re-strictions on foreign investment.Latin America accounts for 8.4 per cent of daily world oil output, according to the US Energy Information Administration, but energy supplies from the region make up 30 per cent of US energy imports, or about 4m barrels a day.Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador are the region’s largest exporters of oil and refined products. Brazil, Argentina and Colombia also produce oil, although predominantly for domestic consumption.That the US Southern Command, which oversees military relations with Latin America, has embarked on a detailed study of the subject underscores the view that energy has become a key facet of US national security.“It is incumbent upon the command to contemplate beyond strictly military matters,” said Colonel Joe Nuñez, professor of strategy at the US Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.An exception to the trend, the Southern Command study noted, is Trinidad & Tobago, whose policy of opening its doors to foreign investment has allowed it to become the top supplier of Liquefied Natural Gas to the US. Analysts have warned that, while the wave of resource nationalism in Latin America is allowing governments to grab a greater share of the energy price boom, tighter control will curb output in the future if, or when, oil prices fall.“Pending any favourable changes to the investment climate,” the Southern Command study concluded, “the prospects for long-term energy production in Venezuela, Ecuador and Mexico are currently at risk.”
150;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2006-06-25T17:48:59Z;Anadarko deal heralds beginning of the end;;"Anadarko Petroleum has taken a big bet that oil and gas prices are going to stay at their record highs with the acquisition last week of Kerr-McGee, a smaller rival.In so doing the fifth-largest US oil and gas company contributed a brush stroke to the changing landscape of the mid-sized US energy industry.If 1998 marked the birth of the super major as Exxon merged with Mobil, BP with Amoco and Total with PetroFina, then the past 12 months appear to have
heralded the beginning of the end of the US mid-tier oil companies.“Of the mid-tier US companies, on a two to five-year time scale, are any of these guys going to be left?” said Derek Butter, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh consultants. He added Marathon, Amerada Hess and Devon were most likely to be the next targets.Anadarko – which has long been eyed by companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, the AngloDutch group, for its gas assets – has perhaps made itself an even more attractive target with last week’s deal.Mergers and acquisitions in the oil sector began to boom again last year, after years of executives arguing that prices were too high. In 2005, worldwide mergers and acquisitions more than doubled to $160bn – the highest level since 1998.Anadarko’s $16.4bn deal is the third big acquisition among the mid-sized US energy companies since last summer. In the second half of last year ConocoPhillips bought Burlington Resources for $36bn and Chevron beat the Chinese in the $20bn battle for Unocal. On a smaller scale, Occidental Petroleum took Vintage for a little more than $4bn that year as well. Meanwhile, across the US’s northern border, Total, of France, bought Canada’s Deer Creek for $1.3bn.A study by Harrison Lovegrove, the UK-based corporate advisers, and John S Herold, the US research firm, found that executives were willing to pay 54 per cent more in North America, betting that high oil and gas prices were here to stay.Part of the reason is desperation and a wad of cash. Big oil companies have had trouble finding new oil and gas reserves through exploration because many of the world’s remaining reserves lie in countries unwilling to open them to foreign investment. In the meantime, however, the $70 oil price has swelled war chests. ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest energy group, has $30bn-$40bn at its disposal.But Exxon and the world’s other huge international oil companies are unable to use that money to buy each other because of regulatory hurdles. Mid-size energy groups without large numbers of petrol stations, pipelines and refineries, often the cause of regulatory scrutiny, are easier targets. Size has made companies such as Devon and Anadarko vulnerable: they are too big for modest drilling success to deliver good growth results, but too small to compete with huge national oil companies or to venture into challenging new terrain.But buying a mid-tier company does not solve some of the most serious challenges that energy companies face. Shortages of equipment, especially drilling rigs, and labour, particularly engineers, have helped push companies’ capital expenditure up 66 per cent since 2002 even though the money is going to producing 30 per cent fewer barrels, analysts at Deutsche Bank calculate.This new reality is showing up in share prices. Oil prices have jumped from $55 to $68 a barrel in the past year, but the share price of Exxon has not budged from $57. “Returns are under steep pressure as taxes and costs spiral higher, and competition in the remaining non-governmental opportunities eats away at remaining returns,” Deutsche Bank said in a recent report.As the cost of the US mid-tier companies rises with each acquisition, the next company to buy one will be placing an even bigger, bolder bet than Anadarko."
151;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2006-05-28T19:53:04Z;Investors reassess plans in Latin America;;"Sergio Gabrielli saw few clouds on the horizon when he was asked back in February to size up his company’s prospects in Bolivia.The president of Petrobras, Brazil’s state-owned oil giant, then believed that Evo Morales’s landslide victory in Bolivia’s presidential elections had created a “vision of stability”.Instead, within months, Petrobras found itself expropriated, the latest – and most surprising – casualty of a string of nationalist-inspired actions against foreign investors.In Bolivia, BG and BP of the UK, Total of France and Repsol of Spain – which have pumped billions of dollars into Bolivia over the last decade – suffered a similar fate. Just over a week ago, California-based Occidental Petroleum, was added to the list, taken over by Ecuador’s government after a contract disputeExecutives at Suez, a French conglomerate, have also had a rough time this year after Argentina’s government moved to take over Aguas de Argentina, the water company that is a majority-owned subsidiary.Repsol’s share price fell after writing down the value of its investments in Bolivia, Venezuela and Argentina.A new sensitivity towards the region has seen investors reassess their commitments. “Where there is any risk at all of things going the way of Bolivia, investments are on hold,” says Stephen Donehoo, who advises investors at Kissinger McLarty in Washington.In many ways, this is surprising. Latin America’s economies are more stable now than at any time for the last 30 years. In most countries, inflation is in single digits and demand from China and growing Asian economies have enhanced the attractions of raw materials such as copper and iron ore that Latin America possesses in abundance.In part because of this, foreign investment levels have been rising in the past couple of years, recovering from a slump associated with the financial crises of the beginning of the decade.In its latest paper on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the region, the United Nations Economic Commission on Latin America reports that overall flows of FDI rose from $61.5bn (€48bn, £33bn) in 2004 to $68.1bn in 2005, a figure close to the annual average of $70.6bn achieved in the second half of the 1990s.The recovery is all the more impressive since, during the 1990s, privatisation campaigns were attracting a wave of foreign investment into the telecommunications, energy and financial sectors. Telefónica of Spain, for example, invested billions of dollars in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and Spanish banks such as BBVA and Santander built up a presence across the region.On closer examination, the figures show a sharp disparity between the south of the region on one hand and Mexico, Colombia, Chile and the countries of the Caribbean Basin, which are more closely integrated with the US through trade, migration and security, on the other.While investment into Mexico reached $17.8bn in 2005, up by almost 50 per cent on the average achieved at the end of the 1990s, Brazil inflows last year reached only $15.1bn, down by more than a third. Argentina attracted $4.7bn last year, less than half the average recorded 10 years ago.Analysts attribute the decline in the south of the region to several factors. In the oil and natural resources sectors, governments have begun to impose much tougher contracts on foreign investors. Venezuela, the biggest oil producer in the region, imposed new terms on more than two dozen foreign companies last year, prompting Exxon Mobil to sharply reduce its presence in the country.On paper, Argentina’s investment codes are among the most liberal in the world. In practice, the left-wing government of Néstor Kirchner has intervened on a discretionary basis in a number of sectors, refusing to allow foreign-owned utility and financial service companies to increase rates. As well as Suez, Electricité de France has opted to leave Argentina; more than two dozen others have taken legal action against the government through the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes at the World Bank.“The environment has deteriorated significantly,” noted Helena Hessel, a credit analyst with Standard and Poor’s in New York in a paper this month.Brazil’s centre-left government has been more welcoming, but has failed to ease bureaucratic restrictions and onerous labour and tax burdens. The sharp appreciation of the real against the dollar – only partly reversed during recent volatility on international markets – has added to difficulties by increasing the costs of operating.Advisers also note a sharp increase in popular sensitivities to environmental issues across the region, in part stimulated by internationally financed non-governmental organisations. Argentine demonstrators, fearful of air pollution. have tried to stop paper and pulp plants being built by Botnia of Finland and ENCE of Spain in neighbouring Uruguay.In this context surprises such as the Bolivian nationalisation or Ecuador’s action in Occidental are particularly damaging. US officials described the decision to cancel the Occidental contract as “horrific”, partly because it seemed so arbitrary.Petrobras thought it had good political links with the Bolivian government and had promised to invest heavily. So being taken over was particularly alarming, says one São Paulo-based international risk manager. “It doesn’t help in term of perceptions. If you are sitting in Houston, New York or London and you see someone getting a kicking in Latin America it is bound to affect how you see things.”"

153;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2006-05-23T21:16:30Z;Occidental expulsion leaves farmers in the lurch;;At the entrance to Block 15, a remote oil field in Ecuador’s remote eastern jungle region, there is no indication that up until nine days ago, Occidental Petroleum was in charge.All signs bearing the US company’s logo have been removed, and none erected to announce the new owners.The lack of new signage is fitting. For the moment, the facility is in the hands of Petroecuador, the state oil company, but there is great uncertainty as to what will happen to Block 15, which has in turn fuelled concerns about the effect of the change on oil production and local communities.Ecuador’s government admitted last week that when it revoked Occidental’s contract for having improperly transferred a 40 per cent interest in its fields to Canada’s EnCana in 2000, it had no clear policy on what to do with the field.Officials say they are studying options, but for many analysts that should have been done long before Occidental was forced out. “This government didn’t have a Plan A or a Plan B for dealing with what was going to happen after Occidental left,” says Wilson Pástor, a former president of Petroecuador who now works as an oil consultant in Quito.Domestically, the government’s action has been met in large part with approval. Occidental was not popular in the Andean country, largely because it was portrayed as a US company that thought it could ignore Ecuadorean law.At a string of demonstrations in recent months, protesters demanded that Occidental be expelled.But in Limoncocha, a jungle village of faded pink, blue and green wooden huts 1km from Block 15, Occidental’s departure has left locals worried about the future.Most of the bilingual Quichua and Spanish-speaking community’s 1,500 residents earn a meagre living by selling cocoa beans, plantains and corn at nearby towns, and few have ever worked at the oil field. But they say they have come to depend on the aid the company gave to indigenous communities and fear it will be cut.“Oxy helped us for 20 years – with infrastructure, educational scholarships, sports facilities and vehicles,” says Jorge Grefa, president of the parish of Limoncocha. “Pretty much all the infrastructure here was paid for by Oxy.”The company spent about $300,000 a year in local villages and had recently signed several new agreements with community leaders on social spending. Contractors that had agreements with Occidental also spent money in local villages, equipping the school at Limoncocha with an internet-linked computer room.“Oxy was responsive to our requests,” says Enoc Cerda, the school’s rector. “We asked them to limit work at night and they did so. And they were pretty quick about responding to environmental problems.”Local leaders say they recognise that Occidental has probably left for good, but they are worried about who will take over Block 15. The one option they are dead against is Petroecuador continuing to run the field.“We know how Petroecuador works,” says Mr Cerda. “They damage the environment and don’t help local communities. Petroecuador has brought destruction wherever it has operated.”In all likelihood, Petroecuador, which is heavily indebted, will not operate the field in the long term. It could sell Block 15 directly to another state company, such as Agip of Italy, Cipec of Chile, Petrobras of Brazil or PDVSA of Venezuela.But both options may be complicated by Occidental’s international arbitration claim against Ecuador. The company is demanding that while the hearings continue, the country should be prevented from bringing in a third party to run Block 15.Continuing uncertainty would not just affect the communities that border the field. In Coca, a sprawling oil town of 15,000 people about 70km away, contractors say their businesses will be hit. The government is in dispute with Occidental over outstanding payments to some local contractors.“We’ve been left without a contract,” says Victor Becerra, a technical supervisor for Schlumberger, a US well service contractor. “We don’t know if we still have work. And if we do, it will be with Petroecuador, which pays lower service fees to contractors and is notorious for not paying on time.”Occidental’s departure could also have much wider implications. Block 15 accounts for about a fifth of the country’s daily production of 538,000 barrels. “The lack of any proper handover is going to lead to production problems,” says Mr Pástor.Back in Limoncocha, there are worries that the possible repercussions could be even more acute. “The local municipality doesn’t spend any money here,” says Mr Grefa. “Oxy was almost like a replacement government for us. Now we’ve been left with no government, with nothing.”
154;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2006-05-21T18:12:50Z;Ecuador ‘was right to revoke Occidental licence’;;The frontrunner in Ecuador’s presidential race has backed the government’s decision to revoke Occidental’s operating contract and seize $1bn of its assets in the Andean country, saying it was the correct response to the US oil company’s “unethical and illegal” actions.In an interview with the Financial Times, León Roldós, usually a firm critic of President Alfredo Palacio, said the administration had acted within Ecuadorean law and dismissed as “absurd” the idea that by expelling Occidental the government had drawn closer to radical nationalist leaders in the Andes such as Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia.Ecuador revoked Occidental’s operating contract last week after the energy ministry ruled that the company had improperly transferred a 40 per cent interest in its oil fields to EnCana of Canada in 2000. The government argues that this constituted a breach of contract and demanded that Occidental turn over its assets to Petroecuador, the state oil company.Occidental, which had been the largest foreign investor in Ecuador, filed an arbitration claim last week at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington.The company is seeking to prevent the government from allowing another foreign investor to operate its oil facilities until the dispute is resolved, which could take more than a year.“There’s a law and there’s a contract,” Mr Roldós said. “The law says that if you transfer rights without permission, that breaks the contract. The result is that all the assets pass to the state.”“What Occidental did was deliberate and therefore unethical. Without any doubt, if I were president I would have acted in the same way.”Mr Roldós leads the polls ahead of elections in October with some 23 per cent of the vote. A centre-leftist who is backed by the Izquierda Democratica, one of the country’s main socialist groups, he is also a former vice-president and brother of Jaime Roldós, a charismatic president who died in an aircraft crash 25 years ago this week.He said he was disturbed by the way the case had been reported internationally. “This has been portrayed as another case of a third world country that does not respect contracts,” Mr Roldós said. “That is entirely inaccurate.”“The reason I support the government’s decision is not because I wanted to get a US company out, but because of the company’s unethical and illegal behaviour.”Mr Roldós rejected the idea that multinational companies would be scared off from investing in Ecuador because of the government’s actions.“This should not affect the way that potential foreign investors view Ecuador, so long as they are given a full explanation of what happened,” he said. “At the moment all they see are the headlines that say ‘Ecuador kicks out Oxy’.”In the wake of the Occidental ruling, the Bush administration called a halt to trade talks, but Mr Roldós said progress in the negotiations had stopped before then. “The trade negotiations were effectively over before the ruling in the Occidental case.”He lamented the breakdown in talks, saying a trade deal was “indispensable” for Ecuador. “I have always opposed the US blockade on Cuba – so why would I voluntarily blockade Ecuador off from the US?”He said that if elected he would press for agreement and would then present the pact to the electorate in a referendum.He accepted that the trade negotiations were not currently popular in Ecuador but said he was confident that “a good trade agreement would win the approval of the people”.Because it came in the wake of tough action against foreign investors in Venezuela and Bolivia in recent months, and because it provoked a strong negative reaction from Washington, many observers viewed Ecuador’s move against Occidental as a sign that the country was shifting further towards the sort of radical nationalism espoused by Mr Chávez.Mr Roldós characterised that as “absurd” and said that if elected he would not seek closer ties with Caracas. “Whoever I speak to, be it an official of the Bush administration or Fidel Castro, I will always defend the position of a sovereign Ecuador,” he said.“We should have the same relations with Venezuela as with any other Latin American country. We are both oil producers, so we might want to seek a strategic alliance, but it should not be an ideological alliance.“I reject this idea that a country such as Ecuador has to choose between Washington and Caracas, between Bush and Chávez.”
155;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2006-05-18T20:10:05Z;Ecuador shrugs off challenge to $1bn oil seizure;;Ecuador on Thursday dismissed a legal challenge to its seizure of $1bn (€780m, £530m) of assets belonging to Occidental, after the US oil company filed an arbitration claim against the Andean country.On Monday, the government of President Alfredo Palacio revoked Occidental’s operating contract when the energy ministry determined the company had improperly transferred a 40 per cent interest in its fields to EnCana of Canada in 2000.Occidental, which was the largest foreign investor in Ecuador, filed a claim at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington on Wednesday. The company is demanding the court restore its rights and prevent the government from allowing another foreign investor to operate its oil facilities until the dispute is resolved, a process that could take more than a year.“Occidental intends to vigorously pursue redress for damages resulting from Ecuador’s illegal seizure,” the company said.But Enrique Proaño, the government’s senior spokesman, shrugged off the challenge. “This claim has no basis because Ecuador has applied the law,” he said.There is widespread concern within Ecuador about the damaging effect the government’s action has had on the country’s relationship with Washington. The Bush administration suspended trade talks with Ecuador on Tuesday in response to the move, which it said “appears to constitute a seizure of the assets of a US company”.Ecuador reacted angrily. “The US government has assumed as its own a problem between the Ecuadorean state and a US company,” said Diego Borga, finance minister. “It is not possible that on the one hand it pushes a trade negotiation and on the other hand seeks to interfere politically in an internal matter. This is unacceptable.”Rob Portman, the outgoing US trade representative, said the seizure was “unfortunate”, but was keen to stress that Washington still hoped to strike a trade deal with Quito.“We are very eager to engage with Ecuador but it’s difficult to engage while they are taking certain actions with regard to legitimate US investment,” Mr Portman said.Ecuador was on Thursday still trying to come to terms with how to operate Occidental’s installations, which were transferred to them on Tuesday. Petroecuador, the state oil company, was due to take over the facilities officially on Thursday after Occidental reportedly told workers it was no longer employing them.“We still don’t have a strategy to follow,” said Fernando González, president of Petroecuador, adding that he was analysing “whether to pick a partner, hold an international auction or if Petroecuador should continue operating”.The latter option is unlikely, given that the state company is woefully indebted and lacks basic cashflow. Petroecuador is thought to be looking at a list of potential partners including South American state oil companies from Brazil and Venezuela and possibly Chinese companies. Andean Petroleum Company, a consortium of two Chinese state-owned companies, bought EnCana’s assets last year for $1.4bn, the biggest transaction in the history of Ecuador’s oil sector.
156;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Lex: Ecuador/Occidental;;"The tide of resource nationalism in Latin America just strengthened. Coming in the wake of Bolivia?s moves to nationalise its gas fields, Ecuador?s termination of Occidental Petroleum?s oil contract raises the temperature for companies with direct commodities investments in the Andean region.The situations in Ecuador and Bolivia do have similarities. Both countries appear emboldened by high oil prices and Hugo Chavez?s squeezing of western oil companies in Venezuela. The governments face pressure from poorer voters who have not shared in the limited economic development of recent years. But, unlike Bolivia, Ecuador?s move is so far specific to Occidental.It is the culmination of a long-running legal dispute over Occidental?s sale of a stake in its Ecuadorian field to a third party. That has helped to create heavy political pressure, ahead of this year?s elections, for the government to act against Occidental.For Ecuador it is risky. Occidental is one of the biggest foreign investors in the country, which requires foreign capital and expertise in its oil industry. If a solution cannot be agreed it might deter investment and kill off already troubled trade talks with the US.For Occidental it might not be as bad as it appears. Ecuador accounts for about 7 per cent of its production, but a more modest 3 per cent of reserves and earnings. Perversely, the global trend of host countries being more aggressive with oil companies even highlights one of Occidental?s strengths. Over half its production comes from the stable US.If some host countries prove too forceful - and scare off foreign investment - it could help to restrain global production and bolster prices. Occidental could yet enjoy the benefits, unless the US itself one day decides to squeeze the oil industry at home.- Click here to add your comments

157;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
158;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2006-05-16T19:56:53Z;US angered by Ecuador takeover of Oxy assets;;The US said on Tuesday it was “very disappointed” at Ecuador’s decision to revoke the operating contract of Occidental, the country’s biggest foreign investor, and take over $1bn of the US-based oil company’s assets.The move comes weeks after Ecuador imposed a 50 per cent tax on the “extraordinary profits” of foreign oil companies, and follows a more hardline approach towards foreign investors in Bolivia and Venezuela.The California-based company warned on Tuesday that it could pursue Ecuador in court. An Occidental spokesman told the FT that international arbitration “is one option open to us that our legal team is looking at”. He added that the Ecuadorean government’s actions sent a damaging sign to potential foreign investors. “If you were looking to invest in Ecuador, you certainly wouldn’t see this as a favourable or encouraging development.”Ecuador has drawn up a shortlist of international bidders that it may now offer Occidental’s contract to, including Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro, Venezuela’s PDVSA, Colombia’s Ecopetrol and Mexico’s Petroleos Mexicanos.A potential purchaser could also come from China. In March EnCana sold its assets in Ecuador to Andes Petroleum, a Chinese consortium, for $1.42bn, the biggest transaction in the history of the country’s oil sector.Announcing the decision to cancel Occidental’s contract on Monday night, Ivan Rodriguez, Ecuador’s energy minister, said Occidental had improperly transferred a 40 per cent interest in its fields to EnCana of Canada in 2000.The government was under intense pressure to take action against Occidental following mass protests. Leftwing members of Congress had also threatened to have Alfredo Palacio, Ecuador’s president, prosecuted for treason should be settle with Occidental, which is thought to have offered a $1.7bn package to try to secure the operating contracts.A spokesman for the president said Mr Palacio “fully supported” the energy minister’s decision to cancel Occidental’s contract.Walter Spurrier, a political analyst in Guayaquil, said the case should be seen both in the international context of growing resource nationalism in other Andean countries such as Venezuela and Bolivia as well as the domestic context of October’s upcoming elections. “There’s a general feeling of nationalism, and bashing oil companies always goes down well.”Fernando Gonzalez, head of Petroecuador, the state oil company, went to Occidental’s offices on Tuesday to take control of the company’s Ecuadorean operations. “From today Petroecuador is taking effective possession of the fields,” Mr Gonzalez said. However, the Occidental spokesman told the FT that for the moment the company was still operating its fields. “We don’t know how long it will take to transfer them to the state,” he said.Occidental produces about 100,000 b/d in Ecuador out of the country’s total daily output of 538,000 barrels. Ecuador is South America’s second largest exporter of crude to the US.Business leaders who depend on current trade preferences with the US - due to expire at the end of this year - for their exports lamented the action on Tuesday.“This was a decision taken more with nationalist gut instincts than with the head,” said Gonzalo Correa of the Federation of Ecuadorean Exporters. “In time we will see the consequences of what the government is doing.”
159;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2006-05-09T17:11:17Z;Quito rally urges Occidental?s expulsion;;Indigenous demonstrators from Ecuador?s highlands and Amazon region converged on Quito to call for the expulsion of a US oil company and an end to trade talks with Washington.Alfredo Palacio?s administration appears to be moving towards a $1.7bn settlement with Occidental Petroleum. In a 19-month legal dispute, Petroecuador, the state oil company, had sought to revoke Occidental?s operating contract for improperly transferring a 40 per cent interest in its fields to EnCana of Canada in 2000.Foreign investors in the region, already jittery in the face of tax hikes in Venezuela, nationalisation in Bolivia, possible contract revisions in Peru and a 50 per cent tax on ?extraordinary profits? of foreign oil companies in Ecuador, are watching the case closely. ?The Occidental case has become caught up in the general wave of nationalist sentiment in the Andean region,? said Walter Spurrier of the Universidad Casa Grande in Guayaquil.Mr Palacio, an unpopular president who took over after Lucio Guti?rrez was forced out of power in April 2005, faces a dilemma, even though he is not running in October?s general election. Occidental, the largest private foreign oil company operating in Ecuador, has invested $900m in the Andean country and produces 100,000 b/d. Its assets will be taken over by the state if its contract is revoked, but Ecuador?s oil sector desperately needs foreign investment and Petroecuador, which is heavily indebted, is in no condition to invest.Ecuador also hopes an agreement with Occidental could give impetus to trade negotiations with the US. ?It would be hard to see the trade agreement going forward without a satisfactory solution in the Oxy case,? said Lisa Schineller of Standard and Poor?s in New York.However, the Occidental case has become a totemic issue ? yesterday?s protests were as big as those that brought down Mr Guti?rrez. And twice in the past eight months, opposition to Occidental has fuelled violent protests in the Amazon region that forced the government to call a state of emergency and halt exports.Gustavo Pinto, one of the protest leaders, said his supporters would take ?the necessary actions to prevent the country being betrayed? in the event of an agreement with Occidental. Leftwingers in Congress are preparing to attempt to have Mr Palacio tried for treason should he do a deal with Occidental.Mr Palacio may well opt for inaction, leaving the next administration to make the difficult decision when it takes office in January 2007.By then, current trade preferences with the US will have expired, which could have a damaging effect on agricultural sectors such as flowers and bananas. It is also likely that by next year Washington will have either sealed or rejected trade deals with Peru and Colombia, potentially dimming the prospects for getting an agreement with Ecuador through the US Congress.Negotiations were said to be close to completion last month, when they collapsed over the introduction of Ecuador?s hydrocarbons law.There is a sense that the Bush administration might be prepared to give Quito one more chance to secure a deal, however. Last week, Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, said ?we hope to conclude an agreement with Ecuador?.Meanwhile, Occidental is prepared to pay handsomely to stay in Ecuador. In March, the government rebuffed its offer to settle for a package worth more than $1bn in back taxes, social programmes, investments and extra revenues in return for a seven-year extension in its operating contract. Occidental is now thought to have upped the offer to $1.7bn. On Monday, the energy ministry gave Petroecuador until May 22 to negotiate an agreement.Much will depend on whether Mr Palacio has the stomach to take on radicals in the street and in Congress. ?I think there will be a deal,? said Mr Spurrier. ?The hydro-carbons law won the government some credibility with the left and that could help them to settle with Oxy.?

161;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2006-03-30T21:55:08Z;Ecuador lawmakers vote for 60% tax on oil profits;;Ecuador’s Congress has voted to impose a tax of 60 per cent on the “extraordinary profits” earned by foreign investors in the oil sector. The proposal, which modified a government initiative suggesting a 50 per cent tax, could earn the country up to $500m in extra revenues.“The government has acted responsibly,” said Diego Borja, economy minister. “And Congress has acted responsibly by approving this law.”Mr Borja said Ecuador had foregone $731m between 2003 and 2005 in lost revenue from higher oil prices. “Profit margins for foreign companies have been very great and a clause in favour of the state could lead to economic equilibrium between the foreign companies and the state,” he said. “This not in violation of any law or any article of the constitution.”Petroecuador, the state oil company, said ten foreign companies would be affected by the legislation. Among them are Occidental of the US, which is embroiled in tax and contract disputes with the government, and Repsol of Spain.Contracts signed with international companies such as Occidental and EnCana in the 1990s established a reference price of $15 per barrel. The legislation proposes that the government take 60 per cent of all revenues above that price.Ecuador is the region’s fifth biggest oil producer and its second biggest exporter of crude to the US. At full capacity, it produces about 525,000 b/d, some 200,000 of which is produced by Petroecuador,Private oil companies operating in Ecuador have been lobbying the government to withdraw the proposal and renegotiate contracts through negotiations rather than a unilateral imposition of new tax levels.Foreign investors have been increasingly targeted by protestors, who have shut down oil production twice in recent months.The proposal will further tarnish Ecuador’s reputation in the eyes of international oil companies. No new international investors have signed exploration or production contracts with the country since 1996.President Alfredo Palacio has 10 days to ratify or veto the legislation.

163;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2005-10-13T23:07:04Z;Occidental in $3bn deal with Vintage Petroleum;;Occidental Petroleum on Thursday night struck a deal to buy Vintage Petroleum, a midsized US oil and gas producer with assets in the US, Latin America, and Yemen, for more than $3bn in cash and stock.The transaction extends the wave of consolidation in the US energy industry, which is experiencing a series of mergers as companies use cashpiles developed because of high commodity prices to purchase rivals.By acquiring Vintage, which is based in Oklahoma, Occidental will be taking control of proved reserves of about 437m barrels of oil equivalent, as measured at the end of 2004.Ray Irani, Occidental's chief executive, said this represented an “excellent strategic fit, adding to our core areas in California, the Middle East and Latin America”. Occidental, which is based in Los Angeles, planned to divest Vintage's assets in the Gulf Coast, East Texas, and the mid-continent region as part of the deal.The planned acquisition comes on the heels of last week's announcement that Chesapeake Energy was acquiring Columbia Natural Resources for about $2.2bn, in an attempt to add natural gas reserves in the Appalachian basin.In August, Chevron, the oil major, closed a deal to buy Unocal, a Californian peer with most of its assets in Asia, for $18bn, after a six-week long takeover battle with CNOOC, the state-owned Chinese energy group.In Thursday's deal, Vintage shareholders are set to receive $20 per share, plus 0.42 Occidental shares for each Vintage share. Including the assumption of debt, this price values Vintage at $3.8bn.Charles Stephenson, chief executive of Vintage, which was created in the early 1980s and went public fifteen years ago, said: “The structure of this transaction allows Vintage shareholders to realise immediate and potentially continuing value.“Part of the deal includes plans by Occidental to repurchase about 9m shares. Mr Irani said the transaction would lift earnings, cash flow, and free cash flow immediately once the deal closed as expected early next year. In addition, Occidental said it would lift its dividend by 16 per cent. Occidental, which is worth $30bn in market capitalisation, has long been expected to participate in the consolidation of the US energy sector. But many believed it was more likely to pursue a merger of equals with one of its large independent peers. On Thursday, its shares closed down 2.5 per cent at $74.98.Vintage shares, which have been falling since early October, closed down a further 1 per cent to $38.95. Last year, the company made $332m of net profit on sales of $778m.Credit Suisse First Boston and Lehman Brothers advised Vintage. Occidental's advisers were Goldman Sachs and Petrie Parkman.
164;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2005-01-31T23:54:10Z;Libyan PM woos big oil companies;;Libya hopes to entice the losers in last week's landmark oil exploration auction back to the bargaining table by offering 40 new permits next month, Shukri Mohamed Ghanem, the Libyan prime minister, said on Monday.ChevronTexaco was the only large listed oil company to emerge with an exploration licence in last week's permit auction, the first since US economic sanctions were lifted last year.Mr Ghanem said executives from the Libya National Oil Corporation were working on the auction of a further 40 licences, expected to be launched in the next two months. “We hope [the major listed oil companies] are all successful next time,” said Mr Ghanem, who was in Vienna attending the policy meeting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.The opening of Libya's oil and gas sector to greater foreign investment has been swift since the US lifted sanctions last year after Libya paid compensation to the families of those killed in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and a made a commitment to end its development of weapons of mass destruction.Several big international companies including ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch/Shell and Total, which had been operating in Libya during the 18 years of US economic sanctions against the North African country, did not win any licences under the latest auction. New permits were awarded mainly to US companies, with Occidental Petroleum securing nine licences. Mr Ghanem denied any bias towards US companies, particularly Occidental, which along with Amerada Hess formed the quartet of US companies operating in Libya before they quit the country when President Ronald Reagan imposed sanctions in 1986. “Oxy [Occidental] had the best bids, and the company that has the best bid wins,” he said.The prime minister also said the government was close to signing an agreement with Occidental and the Oasis Group consortium, comprising ConocoPhilips, Marathon Oil and Amerada, about the return of the oil production concessions the US oil companies had surrendered when they left Libya in 1986. “We have an agreement in principle, but there are still a few details to iron out, because we still have to work out such things as compensation to Libya for the money we have spent on maintaining these fields for all this time,” Mr Ghanem said.Oasis production peaked in 1969 at over 1m barrels a day, and declined to 400,000 b/d in 1986 when the concessions were taken over by Libya's National Oil Corporation.Libya's rapid opening of its energy sector is in contrast to its neighbour and fellow Opec member Algeria, which proposed a reform of its energy sector in late 2001 that has yet to be turned into law. T he Algiers government says that situation will change this year with the new hydrocarbon bill that goes before parliament this month. Libya produces about 1.5m b/d and hopes to raise this to 2m b/d by the end of the year, rising to 3m b/d by the end of the decade with the help of increased foreign investment.
165;OXY;Occidental Petroleum Corp;2004-09-03T16:23:27Z;Wall St shrugs off bad news in a quiet week;;Wall Street took some disappointing corporate news in its stride this week, with the weaker oil price tipping the balance in favour of the bulls.There was also relief that the summer's final “big event” the Republican National Convention in New York had passed without a terrorist attack.But it was the last week of the summer and activity was muted, in part because many investors and traders went on holiday to avoid the Republican gathering.But while markets were up over the week, they dipped on Friday amid disappointment over a warning from Intel late on Thursday and because solid job creation figures suggested the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates again later this month.By the close, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 10,260.20. However, the benchmark index was still up 0.6 per cent on the week. The S&P 500 had slipped 0.4 per cent to 1,113.63 on Friday, but it made a 0.5 per cent gain on the week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.6 per cent to 1,844.48, for a 0.9 per cent weekly loss.Several strategists said the week's gains should be taken with a pinch of salt, because volumes were paper-thin.The week's economic data were largely tepid. August retail sales were extremely disappointing, with the much-anticipated back-to-school season stirring only modest interest in consumers.The data front took a turn for the better on Friday, with the eagerly awaited August non-farm payroll figures coming in at 144,000 just shy of analysts' expectations of 150,000 new jobs. But June and July figures were revised upwards by a combined 59,000.Although the figures suggest growth is more robust than feared, investors seemed to focus more on the implications for further interest rate rises.The closely watched mid-quarter update from Intel, the technology bellwether, was more than disappointing. The company said demand was weaker than expected and cut its forecasts for third quarter revenues and profit margins. Shares skidded 7.3 per cent yesterday to $20.05, making a new 52-week low and dragging down much of the chip sector with it. Semiconductors scored the week's worst performance on the S&P 500, down 7.2 per cent.Other losers included Advanced Micro Devices, off 6.6 per cent to $10.90 by the close, Xilinx, down 6.1 per cent to $25.59, PMC-Sierra, down 6.9 per cent to $8.69 and Applied Micro Circuits, 4.3 per cent weaker at $3.15.Intel's warning was only one of Thursday's disappointments. Wal-Mart, the retail giant, reported its weakest August sales in four years on the same day.Nonetheless, shares in the world's biggest retailer gained 0.7 per cent to $53.02 on the day, as investors were relieved that the 0.5 per cent same-store sales increase was not smaller.Gap, the clothing retailer, also reported a slimmer-than-expected drop in August sales. Shares climbed 5.7 per cent to $20.08, helping to lead the retailing sector to the session's best showing up 2.8 per cent. Taking the “glass-is-half-full” view to the extreme, markets sent shares of Ross Stores up 9.9 per cent to $23.53 after the company's August sales fell 8 per cent, rather than the 8.8 per cent investors had feared.Costco Wholesale, the membership warehouse chain, slid 1 per cent to $40.41 after the company reported August sales grew 4 per cent, missing analysts' expectations of 7.3 per cent growth by a wide mark.Energy stocks continued to prosper, in spite of the broader markets' relief at the recent pause in the crude rally.The S&P 500 energy group gained 3.9 per cent, the best performance on the week. Winners included Transocean, up 7.6 per cent on the week, Noble 7.9 per cent stronger and Occidental Petroleum, up 5 per cent.Woody Dorsey, a technical analyst at Market Semiotics, said investors' thinking about energy stocks had begun to shift, as they come round to the idea that oil prices may stay relatively high for some time.Although energy stocks have notched the S&P 500's best performance of the year, up 16.9 per cent, they have not kept pace with the soaring price of crude oil.
