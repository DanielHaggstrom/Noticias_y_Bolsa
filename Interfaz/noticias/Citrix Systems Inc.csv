0;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2019-03-08T19:31:24Z;Citrix investigates FBI report about cyber breach;Tech group told hackers ‘may have accessed and downloaded business documents’;"Citrix Systems, the networking and remote access technology company, said on Friday that it was responding to an FBI report that international cyber criminals had gained access to its network.In an online statement, the company that it had been contacted by the FBI about the breach on March 6, and that the hackers “may have accessed and downloaded business documents”.Shares in the group, which posted annual revenues of nearly $3bn in 2018, fell 3 per cent to $99.77 following the news.Its products are currently used by more than 400,000 businesses including 98 per cent of the Fortune 500, according to its website.Citrix said on Friday it did not know which specific documents had been accessed, but added that there was “no indication that the security of any Citrix product or service was compromised”.According to the company, the FBI had suggested that the hackers used so-called password spraying to gain access to the network, a technique that exploits weak passwords.“Citrix has taken action to contain this incident,” it said. “We commenced a forensic investigation; engaged a leading cyber security firm to assist; took actions to secure our internal network; and continue to cooperate with the FBI.”"
1;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2017-03-15T16:41:59Z;Citrix: altitude sickness;Private equity is ravenous for software but this is a big meal;Tech fund managers like to moan about the dwindling number of public companies — but this mood shifts whenever a private equity firm brandishes a big cheque.In a now familiar pattern, an activist, usually Elliott Management, turns up demanding change, usually including a sale. The tech company acquiesces and is snapped up by a private equity firm, usually Vista Equity Partners or Thoma Bravo, at a big premium. Everyone celebrates.Citrix, the desktop virtualisation company, is the latest to hoist a For Sale sign. But there is a problem: its enterprise value is $13bn. Earnings were $1bn in the past 12 months, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The resulting multiple is high for a buyout, though not stratospheric for software.The real snag is absolute price. If a bidder could assemble $4bn levered three to one, Citrix could be bought, even with a premium from today’s inflated level. But any cheque of more than $3bn is large in private equity. The debt, moreover, would fall foul of regulatory guidelines, which say borrowings of more than six times ebitda “raise concerns”.A further question is how much Citrix could be improved. It is more mature than many software targets, with revenues growing at a single-digit percentage since 2014. Unlike recent deals which have moved from activist situation to buyout in the blink of an eye, it has been almost two years since Elliott announced its action plan.Much of that plan has been implemented with impressive results, including an operating margin boosted from 18 to 23 per cent, with 33 per cent forecast for this year. Potential bidders will question what more they can wring out. It would be easier for a strategic buyer such as Microsoft or Cisco, which have more cash and fewer constraints. If a financial buyer does snap up Citrix, it would be a significant step up in an already hot market.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Despite being protected by The Federation, VMware is being captured by the secretive aliens of Denali. Yet this is a side-effect of the biggest tech deal in history. Dell and Silver Lake, in the guise of “Denali”, last year agreed to pay more than $60bn for EMC, the server group whose self-styled “Federation” of quasi-autonomous businesses includes VMware, the server virtualisation company.As the crown jewel inside EMC, VMware investors and employees have displayed some skittishness at being taken over by Michael Dell and his private equity ally. Shares in VMware remain more than 20 per cent lower than when the deal was announced in October. Parsing the future under Dell is complex. Concern has centred on Dell’s decision to pay for EMC, in part, with tracking stock in VMware, equivalent to a 53 per cent economic interest. There is also a vague timetable around $1bn in promised revenue synergies supposedly derived by VMware - not much incentive. And EMC CEO Joe Tucci has acknowledged worries that Dell might raid VMware's $7bn in net cash to pay down its huge debt pile, though he has also pledged it won’t happen.VMware’s share price decline was partly caused by the Dell deal and an arbitrage opportunity from selling VMware stock and buying EMC, but operating woes were also a factor. VMware cut guidance in two of the last three quarters. It has yet to prove that it can prosper in a world where customers use the clouds of Amazon, Microsoft and Google rather than the on-premise data centres where VMware ruled.There are, however, enough positives to make the valuation interesting. Last quarter VMWare defied expectations of a slump in IT spending. Its faster-growing mobile and cloud-focused businesses (under a Star Trek-like “Project Photon”) can make up for the slowdown of its legacy products. It is used to being operated as a subsidiary - EMC today owns 81 per cent. In spite of the healthy cash position, it trades at 13 times forward earnings, lower than other mature software companies such as Microsoft, Oracle and Citrix. The last of these three, which has an existing partnership with Dell, has more to fear from the EMC deal than VMware. Existing investors should cling on.

Meanwhile, sales slid 6 per cent to $5.6bn.Analysts had forecast earnings of 35 cents a share on sales of $5.7bn.Jack in the Box shares rose 5.8 per cent to $74.05 after the US fast-food chain said its fiscal fourth-quarter profits jumped 43 per cent to $23.1m, or 63 cents a share, from the year-ago period. Sales rose 3 per cent to $354.1m, shy of analysts’ forecasts.The benchmark S&P 500 was led higher by healthcare stocks, which gained 2 per cent.By close of trading, the S&P 500 advanced 1.6 per cent to 2,083.58, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4 per cent to 17,737.16.

4;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Elliott-Citrix: another one folds;The hedge fund has won concessions, but not yet a victory, in Silicon Valley;"Activist investors are as welcome in Silicon Valley as spoilers about the new Star Wars movie. So Elliott Management deserves credit for its victories there. On Tuesday, Citrix Systems became the latest company to cave in, erm, sorry, “decide on a new strategy after a thorough review”.The software company, after prodding by Elliott, will tick every box on the standard activist to-do list. It will spin off its web conferencing products, cut $200m in costs and 1,000 jobs, increase the salesforce for its core virtualisation products, and devote 50 per cent of free cash flow to buybacks.After all this, the shares fell 8 per cent, perhaps because profit targets attached to the overhaul were not aggressive. Revenue targets looked light and adjusted earnings per share for 2016 is expected to come in at $4.45, just ahead of analysts’ estimates (each ignores a $0.53 restructuring charge).These are just the first steps, though, and the targets have probably been set deliberately low. Bob Calderoni, interim chief executive, said nine times on a conference call that the revenue target was “conservative”. In spite of the lacklustre share price reaction, Citrix stock has risen since Elliott showed up. When it delivered its manifesto in June, the hedge fund noted that Citrix had underperformed the S&P 500 every year in the past five. This year the stock has risen 13 per cent to $72; the S&P 500 is flat.It is a long way from stating a plan to successful execution and, although it should have the advantage of being tax free, the spin-off is less tidy than a sale of the entire company, which was reported to be on the table.With its plan in place, a seat on the board and a say on the next chief executive, Elliott has all it wanted. Yet it envisaged a share price over $90 by the end of 2016. In the case of another, bigger tech investment, in EMC, Elliott was only bailed out by Dell’s bid for the company. If Citrix shares do not rally, Elliott might be the one being held to account.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

Sales fell nearly 41 per cent to $2.6bn.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast a loss of 56 cents a share, on sales of $2.5bn. Adjusting for one-off items the company reported a profit of 1 cent, ahead of forecasts for a loss of 52 cents.Oil production of 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) topped estimates for 301,000.The unexpected profits were driven by lower operating costs and a rise in oil output driven by its Wattenberg field in Colorado and by output in Delaware and the Gulf of Mexico.Total oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production of 846,000 boepd was, however, shy of forecasts for about 862,000.“All of Anadarko Petroleum’s large projects are advancing and new discoveries, which will likely be unappreciated in this market, should add long-term value, all else being equal,” said Michael Scialla, an analyst at Stifel.Shares of Anadarko Petroleum, which have declined 30 per cent in the past year, rose 4.7 per cent to $76.28 and were among the best-performing stocks on the benchmark S&P 500 on Wednesday.Elsewhere, Yelp suffered its biggest one day decline on record after the online review site cut its full-year sales outlook roughly 5 per cent on Tuesday and projected revenues short of Wall Street forecasts.The stock plunged 25 per cent to a two-year low of $25.11.Twitter was also high on investors’ sell lists. Shares in the social media platform known for its 140-character messages tumbled 14.5 per cent on Wednesday to $31.24, wiping more than $3bn off the company’s valuation after its finance chief warned meaningful user growth was not yet in sight.A top gainer, Citrix Systems rose 8.1 per cent to $75.27. Bowing to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management, the software company has agreed to put its GoToMeeting video-conferencing division up for sale and announced the retirement of longstanding chief executive, Mark Templeton.Gilead Sciences was up 2.3 per cent to $115.71 after the biotech company reported better than expected sales of its hepatitis C drug and lifted its full year outlook by $1bn.Overall, US equities were up after the latest monetary policy statement from the US Federal Reserve.Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.7 per cent at 2,108.57 and 17,751.39.

6;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2015-07-28T22:55:30Z;Citrix restructures after pressure from Elliott;Headhunters appointed to find replacement for chief executive Mark Templeton;Citrix Systems put its GoToMeeting video conferencing division up for sale and announced the retirement of its longstanding chief executive, Mark Templeton, in the latest victory for an activist hedge fund in the tech sector.Elliott Management, which has a 7.1 per cent stake in Citrix and which has been agitating for a strategic overhaul, also edged out the chairman, Thomas Bogan, who will step back into a lead director role.Citrix, which sells a range of business software, including desktop virtualisation products that allow employees to access their work computers remotely, has been struggling with the transition to cloud-based business software.It appointed Bob Calderoni, who Elliott has worked with as a director at Juniper Networks, as executive chairman, hired headhunters to find a replacement for Mr Templeton and appointed Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners to advise on its strategy review.The company said it planned to simplify its business by selling non-core products and reconsidering its capital structure.Mr Templeton, who has run Citrix for 14 years, said he would be “passionately and intensively leading this change” until a successor is found.He said GoToMeeting was aimed at small businesses, rather than Citrix’s core large enterprise customers, who were more likely to use Microsoft’s Lync and Skype for Business, and was not “synergistic”. Citrix’s perspective had changed, he said, on “where we should be investing more and less”.Citrix also reported second-quarter results that showed revenue rose 2 per cent to $797m and net income increased to $103m from $53m in the second quarter of 2014.Reflecting the shift to a new generation of cloud services, Citrix said product and licence revenue decreased 12 per cent to $205m, while software-as-a-service revenue, which includes its fast-growing GoTo products, increased 11 per cent to $178m.Elliott wrote an open letter to Citrix in June demanding the company focus on its best products, saying it had missed a “profound opportunity” to capitalise on the shift to the cloud, because of a sprawling product set and bloated costs.Jesse Cohn, head of Elliott’s US activism arm, will join the Citrix board and the hedge fund will have a veto over one other new board member.“We first invested in Citrix because we saw a substantial value creation opportunity for the company and its shareholders,” Mr Cohn said on Tuesday. “We are confident that the initiatives announced will allow Citrix to build upon its position as an innovative industry leader.”Elliott’s success in forcing its way on to the Citrix board comes amid an aggressive push by activist hedge funds in the tech sector. A week ago, Jana Partners won board seats at Qualcomm, the smartphone chipmaker, and also persuaded that company to launch a strategy review.
7;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2015-06-16T17:57:22Z;Citrix: virtual reality;Cloudy prospects for desktop virtualisation;Not all tech companies live in a bubble. Citrix, which has more than $3bn in annual revenue, is growing sales at 5 per cent a year, and is profitable. With an enterprise value of $12bn, Citrix is worth half as much as Twitter and a quarter as much as Salesforce, both of which are lossmaking.The problem is that Citrix’s products are a mixed bag. More than half of sales and profits come from what it calls workspace services, which includes desktop virtualisation (which allows employees to access their office desktops from their iPads). Citrix has a 38 per cent market share in this business, but the segment is growing slowly. Another fifth of revenues come from cloud services, where it faces tough competition. And another fifth comes from mobility apps, a fast-growing segment that includes services such as GoToMeeting, a virtual meeting organiser.Citrix’s share price has stagnated over the past five years. Recently Elliott Management, which holds a 7 per cent stake, demanded cost cuts, disposals, a larger salesforce, and (predictably) share buybacks.These proposals miss the point. Citrix’s growth is slowing because its core offering, desktop virtualisation, is becoming less relevant as work moves to the cloud. Even if the company did sell hot assets such as GoToMeeting, the core business would remain under pressure. In the short term, there is competition from Oracle and VMware. In the long term, obsolescence looms.Citrix should consider something more radical: selling the whole business. Microsoft, for example, would be able to cut costs for Citrix’s slower growing products by combining sales teams and data centres, and tie the cloud offerings in with its own. The companies’ products are used in tandem by many customers and the two companies have joint selling arrangements already. Cisco might be interested in Citrix as well.Life is harder for companies outside the bubble. They need to think big.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Sales rose 15 per cent to $422m.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 15 cents a share on sales of $418.3m. Adjusted earnings of 23 cents a share topped estimates for 20 cents a share.Same-store sales, a key industry metric, advanced 15 per cent, topping estimates for an 11.5 per cent gain.“The firm delivered better than expected sales and profits in a quarter marked by choppy results for many retailers, with reported growth rates near the top of the retail spectrum underscoring strong brand momentum,” said Matthew Fassler, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.The company lifted its full-year earnings and sales outlook. Restoration Hardware now expects full-year earnings in the range of $3.02 to $3.15 a share against forecasts for $3.03 a share. This is above its previous outlook for earnings of $2.95 to $3.10 a share.Sales are expected to range from $2.146bn to $2.176bn compared with forecasts for $2.16bn.Shares of Restoration Hardware advanced 3 per cent to $97.46 in morning trading, settling to close at $96.28. The stock has gained nearly 20 per cent in the past year.Shares of Citrix Systems advanced more than 2 per cent to $71.91 to be the best performing stock on the benchmark S&P 500 on Friday after the software company was upgraded by analysts at Needham and Piper Jaffray.The upgrades follow activist investor Elliott Management’s call for changes at Citrix, which sent shares up 7 per cent on Thursday.Elliot Management, which along with Elliott International has a 7.1 per cent stake in Citrix, sent a public letter to the Santa Clara, California-based company recommending that it sell some of its businesses and cut costs.Elliott said the changes could lift the company’s share price to $90 to $100 a share or more.Citrix has delivered an “inconsistent performance over the past several quarters” amid changing consumer preferences, said Scott Zeller, an analyst at Needham.“If Elliott is capable of gaining a board seat(s), it is conceivable they may achieve the outcome we have seen with Riverbed, Blue Coat and other activist investments, which would include improved operating profile and/or a sale of Citrix Systems or its parts,” Mr Zeller added.Shares of Darden Restaurants climbed 1.58 per cent to $68.11 after analysts at Credit Suisse upgraded the company that operates restaurant chains including Olive Garden.Analysts upgraded Darden Restaurants to “outperform” from “neutral” and raised the price target to $77 from $69.Shares of Wingstop, a chicken wing restaurant chain, jumped more than 60 per cent in their trading debut on Friday, valuing the company at over $900m.US stocks declined amid concerns on a Greek debt deal as Athens said it was still negotiating with its creditors to unlock more aid.The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 2,094.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.78 per cent to 17,898.70.

Citrix climbed 7 per cent to $70.39.“Citrix has leading technology franchises in attractive markets but has struggled operationally for years,” it said. “As a result, today Citrix’s operations and product portfolio represent an opportunity for improvement of uniquely significant magnitude.”Elsewhere, Nike gained 1 per cent to $103.88 after it landed a deal to replace Adidas as the exclusive on court uniform and apparel provider for the NBA, cementing the brand’s lock over the sport.Lululemon Athletica fell 1 per cent to $66.07 after the yoga-wear maker said its founder Chip Wilson and his family could sell their entire 14 per cent stake in the business.Shares in Box, the cloud-storage start-up, punched 3 per cent higher to $18.27 following a set of better than expected first-quarter results.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts was up more than 14 per cent to $19.80 after it delivered a 10 per cent jump in earnings on better sales and stronger margins.Overall, US equity markets were higher as investors cheered a rebound in May retail sales.The S&P 500, which had its biggest rally in a month on Wednesday, rose 0.2 per cent to 2,108.86 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 18,039.37.

10;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2014-05-25T14:07:22Z;Google deal highlights risk of leaving staff to their own devices;Once cyber security measures have been put in place, the policy can have a positive effect on staff;Google’s acquisition last week of Divide, a start-up that lets users securely separate their work and personal data on smartphones and tablets, has put the bring your own device trend, or BYOD, in the spotlight.As its name suggests, BYOD allows staff to use their personal electronic devices for work purposes. Its proponents point out that people regularly use multiple devices for work, depending on where they are, even if there is no BYOD policy.Corporate IT departments also tend to lag behind when it comes to rolling out new kit. “Ten years ago, you got a lot of the best new technology from your employer,” says Patrick Irwin, a product manager at Citrix. “Now, consumer devices move much faster.”When implementing BYOD policies and ensuring that staff are not adding devices to the company network willy-nilly, what issues should you be aware of?Start by familiarising yourself with the devices that are supported. Rob Smith, a research director in mobile and client computing at Gartner, says this can be complex. “With Android devices you often need to specify the handset and service provider,” he notes.If a device is acceptable, it should be subject to an enrolment process where the IT department checks it for viruses and then loads the appropriate enterprise software.There is a financial side to consider, too. Companies may pay staff a stipend to compensate them for using their own devices and in some countries this is seen as a taxable benefit.However, the biggest area to watch out for is employee behaviour. People often have a laid-back attitude to personal devices which is inappropriate if they hold potentially sensitive corporate information. “Businesses need to provide guidance to employees,” says Mr Irwin. “They need to understand how to protect data, store and access data.”With personal devices, staff may think nothing of connecting to open WiFi networks in coffee shops or installing popular apps, which they naively assume are safe. There is also a tendency for people to use apps and services they are familiar with for business. To discourage this, Mr Smith suggests you make staff more aware of corporate alternatives: “Rather than saying, ‘you can’t use Dropbox’, you should be saying, ‘use this enterprise file sync instead’.”When staff leave the company, their devices may need to revisit IT in order to have corporate data erased. Likewise, personal devices may need software installed for remote wiping in case they get lost or stolen.If all this sounds like a lot of hassle, there are upsides. Mr Irwin points out that BYOD can represent an opportunity for businesses as the staff using these devices sometimes discover new ways of working.“In the end,” says Mr Smith, “BYOD costs about the same as providing devices – but the users are happier.”workingsmarter@ft.com

But how often does a company acquire another for its culture?Bromides pumped out by companies during a takeover aim to reassure investors and staff that the two organisations will “fit” well. But history frequently disproves those promises. Even if the bid is deemed a success, the benefits are often achieved through the larger company’s total absorption of the smaller. Most of the time, the culture of the buyer prevails.This sort of acquisition strategy leaves behind a trail of disgruntled, if newly enriched, founders. They will often be torn between devotion to their business and old colleagues and irritation about the big-company bureaucracy to which they must now conform. Frequently, they will quit as soon as they can.Big companies have started to realise what they are losing by forcing new acquisitions into a blue-chip straitjacket. They are offering more independence to companies they acquire and providing some shelter from organisational overload.In a speech last month, Dick Olver, chairman of BAE Systems, recalled how in the 1990s his former employer BP “killed” the brand and culture of Duckhams, the venerable lubricants company it owned. By contrast, he said, BAE had tried to maintain the identity of Detica, a data management and cyber security group the defence and aerospace company bought in 2008. “We have to recognise that these sorts of new businesses require a slightly different culture and perhaps lighter-weight policies and processes [than] big companies,” he said.As I wrote last year, when the tension between Hewlett-Packard and its ill-judged 2011 acquisition Autonomy started to erupt, some integration – and, therefore, friction – is inevitable in any deal. Similarly, some parts of the culture of the new owner will be non-negotiable, however loosely the parent agrees to oversee its new subsidiary. BAE, for instance, cannot allow any business under its umbrella to flex the group’s strict code of business ethics.But best practice must run in both directions. The problem with a structure that guarantees creative thinkers autonomy and preserves their business in a discrete silo, safe from big-company bureaucratic nonsense, is that it could also prevent innovative business approaches from permeating to the rest of the group. How can both sides reduce this risk?The new parent has to give entrepreneurial employees the chance to make their own mistakes, but entrepreneurs must also take the initiative themselves.Tommy Ahlers sold Zyb, a social networking and data back-up company, to Vodafone in 2008. “I did more PowerPoint than coding,” he says, describing the first months working for the UK telecoms group. He left after two years.When Citrix, the technology company, bought his latest venture, an online work platform called Podio, he took a different approach, securing a seat at the table “where the important decisions are being made”, and a high-sounding title: Citrix vice-president of social collaboration. “Even if entrepreneurs don’t care [about titles], they need to look six months ahead and see how the dynamic of a big corporation will work,” he says.At a Citrix conference in January in California attended by 1,000 salespeople, the 15 “Podios”, as they style themselves, roamed about sticking fake tattoos to Citrix staff. Podio’s sales techniques – it uses a “freemium” model, making the software available for free at first – may not work for all the larger companies’ products. But according to Mr Ahlers, the Podios’ unconventional attempt to break the ice with their new colleagues may at least prompt Citrix executives to consider alternative approaches.The approach of serial acquirers such as General Electric, a rapid and efficient integrator of the companies it buys, is sometimes contrasted with that of, say, Amazon, which has allowed Tony Hsieh, founder of Las Vegas-based Zappos, the shoe retailer it bought in 2009, to maintain its declared culture of “fun and a little weirdness”.The best path, however, lies somewhere between the two. Don’t extinguish the entrepreneurial spark in new acquisitions or hold it at arm’s length from the rest of the company: seek it out and use it to rekindle everyone’s innovative flame.andrew.hill@ft.comAndrew Hill blogs at www.ft.com/businessblog
13;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2012-03-05T21:18:24Z;Advertisers abandon Limbaugh radio show;;The incendiary rhetoric of conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has begun to have a material impact on his business operations, as high-profile advertisers abandon his show.Mr Limbaugh faced an onslaught of criticism over the weekend after he used his popular programme to assail Sandra Fluke, a student at Georgetown University law school, calling her a “slut” and a “prostitute” after she declared support for health insurance coverage for birth control during testimony before a congressional panel.Critics of Mr Limbaugh seized on the statements and began petitioning advertisers to stop supporting the show. At least eight companies have now done so, including Quicken Loans, Citrix Systems and Sleep Train.On Monday AOL became the latest company to withdraw its support. “At AOL one of our core values is that we act with integrity,” it said in a statement on Facebook. “We have monitored the unfolding events and have determined that Mr Limbaugh’s comments are not in line with our values.”Mr Limbaugh mocked these efforts during his show on Monday. “I called myself to cancel advertising, but the line was busy,” he said during its opening.Yet Mr Limbaugh’s production company stood by him. “The contraception debate is one that sparks strong emotion and opinions on both sides of the issue,” Premiere Networks, a division of Clear Channel, which produces Mr Limbaugh’s show, said in a statement on Sunday. “We respect the right of Mr Limbaugh, as well as the rights of those who disagree with him, to express those opinions.”Clear Channel is owned by Thomas H Lee Partners and by Bain Capital, the private equity firm where Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made his fortune. Clear Channel was acquired after Mr Romney stepped down from Bain, but Mr Romney still profits from the firm’s activities.Premiere produces 90 programmes and has $330m in annual advertising revenue, according to its website. Clear Channel signed a $400m contract with Mr Limbaugh in 2008 that will keep him on the air through 2016. There are no reliable figures for the size of Mr Limbaugh’s audience, but Talkers magazine estimates his weekly listenership at 15m.Mr Limbaugh is no stranger to controversy. He has admitted abusing prescription drugs, and in 2003 stepped down from his role on ESPN, the Disney-owned TV network, after making racially charged comments on air.“They have profited handsomely from you,” Mr Limbaugh, speaking to his listeners, said of his advertisers. “These advertisers that have split the scene have done very well due to their access to you, my audience. They’ve decided they don’t want you or your business any more. So be it.”The outcry over Mr Limbaugh’s remarks recalls the fate of Fox News host Glenn Beck’s show. After calling US president Barack Obama a racist, an online campaign petitioned companies to stop advertising on the show. Hundreds of companies stopped advertising on Mr Beck’s show, which was taken off the air last year.But Michael Harrison, publisher of Talkers magazine, said that he did not believe that Mr Limbaugh’s show was in jeopardy. “Radio is much more tolerant than TV, it accepts a degree of controversy,” he said. “This is part of what Rush Limbaugh is about.”

Now the company is considering tailoring the programme for different countries and offering the BYOD programme as a default benefit for all Citrix employees.As a pioneer of the virtualisation techniques that sit at the core of most BYOD projects, Citrix is perhaps a special case. But, according to a recent independent survey conducted by Vanson Bourne based on the responses of 1,100 IT professionals across 11 countries, 53 per cent of IT professionals in the UK have implemented desktop virtualisation tools in order to support the diverse range of devices that employees are bringing into the workplace.Of these, 73 per cent believe this will offer greater flexibility for the workforce, and almost 80 per cent believe desktop virtualisation, and subsequently BYOD, will deliver reduced IT and/or business costs.To ensure that the scheme continues to evolve and attract new employees, Citrix is reviewing the benefits it offers. It is also reviewing the stipend provided for device purchases with a view to differentiate this further between geographic regions. This will allow all employees, regardless of location, to enjoy the same benefits from the scheme by accounting as far as possible for geographic differences, such as taxation.Martin Kelly, vice-president of information technology at Citrix, said: “Implementing a BYOD programme was a logical step for Citrix given that our technology allows users to securely access their desktop on any device.“The financial dividends we have seen from the programme have demonstrated significant return on investment, which is why we are working with our customers’ and partners to implement similar schemes within their organisations.”Despite adding about 2,000 employees over the past three years, he says Citrix still managed to make significant savings on IT spending. “As we continue to expand the scheme and put plans in place for the next few years, we hope to see these savings continue to grow as well as help our customers obtain similar results,” he said.Like most other BYOD programmes, the Citrix project was initially driven by a desire to enable employees to bring their personal devices into the workplace. It was initially available to employees who had been with the company for a minimum of 12 months and each participant was allocated a stipend to put towards a device of their choice.Once purchased, employees are required to install and maintain antivirus software as well as purchase a three-year support agreement.

The technology-heavy index fell 1 per cent to 2,577.97.Research In Motion was one of the few bright spots, climbing 10.1 per cent to $13.78 on hopes that it could be an acquisition target after reports that Yahoo had considered a bid for the BlackBerry handset manufacturer.RIM’s market capitalisation has fallen 75 per cent this year due to poor sales of its PlayBook tablet
and a failure of its BlackBerry network but analysts said the share price may fall further before a buy-out.“We expect to see further pressure on RIM’s share price,” said Stuart Jeffrey at Nomura. “While we believe that RIM shares could be worth $15 in a gradual wind-down scenario, we don’t see financial buyers bidding until the stock falls below $10.”Shares in Yahoo itself were on the move too, climbing 5.9 per cent to $15.99 late in the day on reports the internet portal will sell Alibaba Group and its Japanese affiliate back to their majority holders in a deal that could be worth $17bn.Tech stocks also weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended the day flat at 12,107.74, with IBM off 3.1 per cent to $181.47 and Cisco Systems down 2.7 per cent to $17.92.The S&P 500 edged up 0.2 per cent to 1,243.72, turning positive late in the day, despite Moody’s warning of a possible downgrade to US sovereign debt in 2012.The S&P 500 had opened lower as European nerves returned, after strong demand from the continent’s banks for three-year loans from the European Central Bank.US bank stocks also reversed early losses to close in positive territory, with Bank of America up 1.2 per cent to $5.23.Oil producers showed firmness as the price of crude oil edged up for a second day, nearing $100 a barrel, after falling as low as $94 last week. Among the smaller explorers, Noble Energy was up 1.9 per cent to $94.56 while, among the majors, ExxonMobil rose 1.4 per cent to $83.12.Cintas Corp rose 9.3 per cent to $34.19 for the best performance in the S&P 500. The provider of bathroom supplies and entrance mats raised its fiscal year 2012 profit forecast to at least $2.16 a share, 13 cents higher than expected.Nike climbed 2.9 per cent to $96.35 after the world’s largest sports goods company reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates by 12 per cent on strong North American sales.Walgreen shares tumbled more than 5 per cent in early trading after the pharmacy missed earnings estimates on declining market share, but shares recovered to close down just 0.4 per cent to $33.37.Rival CVS Caremark ticked up another 1.7 per cent to $40.46 after surging 9 per cent on Tuesday, as it raised its dividend.The CBOE’s Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 fell to its lowest level since the start of August, closing at 21.63. It had consistently traded above 30 from August through November."
16;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2011-10-27T20:52:18Z;S&P 500 set for best month since 1974;US GDP growth and Europe debt deal inspire markets;Bank stocks led a strong advance for Wall Street as Europe’s deal on sovereign debt and strong US growth data put the S&P 500 on track for its best month since October 1974.The S&P financials index surged 6.2 per cent, led by big commercial banks Citigroup, up 9.7 per cent to $34.17, JPMorgan Chase, up 8.3 per cent to $37.02, and Bank of America, up 9.6 per cent to $7.22. Investment bank Morgan Stanley jumped 17 per cent to $19.41.US banks were following their European counterparts up after Europe’s debt deal – which will impose 50 per cent losses on Greek bondholders, set recapitalisation targets, and raise the firepower of the eurozone rescue fund – at least gave investors more information.But the European deal did nothing to help MF Global, the broker-dealer which has been fighting for its life amid fears of heavy exposure to European debt.It fell a further 15.9 per cent to $1.43 on Thursday after Fitch downgraded the company’s debt to junk status, leaving the stock down more than 50 per cent since the start of the week.Insurance company Genworth Financial rose 11.2 per cent to $6.84. Europe’s faltering economy has weighed particularly heavily on Genworth as it sells a consumer debt insurance product on the continent.Meanwhile, US economic growth accelerated to an annualised 2.5 per cent in the third quarter, a strong improvement on the 1.3 per cent annualised growth posted in the second quarter – suggesting that the summer’s stock market woes had not been immediately transmitted to the real economy.The S&P 500 surged 3.4 per cent to 1,285.59, to close in positive territory for the year for the first time since August, after its best day in two months.The benchmark index has risen 13.5 per cent since the start of October, a month that started badly with the S&P 500 briefly dipping into bear market territory on October 4.The sustained rally has driven down the Vix index of 30-day implied volatility in the S&P 500 to levels not seen since early August. On Thursday Wall Street’s “fear gauge” dropped 12.9 per cent to 26.Although Europe’s deal was far from the finished article, analysts said, even cautious investors were worried about missing out on a strong rally.“Forward looking markets have clearly decided that things have progressed enough in the right direction and not to wait for all the i’s to be dotted and t’s to be crossed,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.But Birinyi Associates said the S&P 500 had reached “its most overbought level in the past 12 months,” based on deviation from its 50-day average. “The market has reached an absolute sell price,” Jeffrey Rubin at Birinyi said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.9 per cent to 12,209.55, with all 30 members closing up.Even consumer giant Procter & Gamble was up 0.5 per cent to $65.26, despite seeing third-quarter profits fall to $3.02bn, or $1.03 a share, from $3.08bn a year ago. High commodity prices pushed the company’s operating margin down 2.6 percentage points to 19.8 per cent.Oil major ExxonMobil, the largest US company by market capitalisation, was another laggard in the Dow – up just 1 per cent to $81.88, despite a 41 per cent increase in profits for the third quarter compared with the same period last year. Exxon also reported a 4 per cent drop in oil-equivalent production.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, meanwhile, was up 3.3 per cent to 2,738.63.BMC Software, the corporate IT supplier, lost 12.3 per cent to $33.88 after quarterly net income fell 13 per cent against the same period last year. Total bookings from corporate customers fell 16 per cent compared to the year-ago quarter.Cloud software company Citrix Systems was up 17.3 per cent to $75.35 after quarterly earnings of $92m or 49 cents a share easily beat expectations. The company landed 40 deals worth more than $1m each during the third quarter.Avon Products fell 18.3 per cent to $18.81 after the beauty product retailer revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing Avon’s dealings with financial analysts under Fair Disclosure.Cabot Oil and Gas was up 15.9 per cent to $77.43 after reporting a 39 per cent jump in third-quarter oil and natural-gas production, after hitting a sweet spot in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale formation.Retirement planning company Ameriprise Financial was up 13.2 per cent to $48.53 on the back of an increase in operating net revenue to $2.46bn, from $2.33bn a year ago, driven by double-digit growth in management and distribution fees. The company also said it had more than $2bn in cash, despite spending nearly $500m on a share repurchase programme.

New features in Acumatica 2.2 include automated bank reconciliation, inventory allocation by sales order and flexible payment remittance. While many in the ERP industry argue that the future of ERP software lies increasingly in the cloud, US-based Acumatica is hedging its bets. For cloud enthusiasts, Acumatica 2.2 is offered as a software-as-a-service product and the only financial commitment is a monthly rental fee – unusually, this SaaS option has no limitation on the number of users. But Acumatica also enables traditionalists to licence the software and install it either on their own IT systems or on a third party’s cloud infrastructure.Tailored cloud service targets US government agenciesAmazon Web Services has created a specialised cloud computing service for sensitive data in a bid to turn more government agencies on to cloud computing. The GovCloud service is specifically aimed at US agencies obliged to comply with arms trafficking and similar legislation requiring that sensitive data are only accessible to US persons. Any cloud service used by organisations that are covered by these regulations therefore needs to ensure that their data stays on data centres located in the US and that the users are legally allowed to access the data. Like rival cloud computing platforms, AWS already offers services that comply with more mainstream security certifications, such as Fisma for federal customers or Hipaa for healthcare sector. The GovCloud offering provides an example of how the cloud computing industry is rolling out tailored services to address the specialist requirements and data security concerns of commercial and government customers.iPad app for tech supportCan you never find your IT support people when you need them? Help is at hand with the Citrix GoToManage App for the iPad. This free app from Citrix allows peripatetic tech support people to troubleshoot misbehaving computers while they are on the road, at home or, ahem, down at the beach. The iPad app allows them to view and control a user’s PC or Mac as if they were sitting in front of it. It works over 3G/4G cellular networks or Wi-Fi. The GoToManage app for iPad is the latest in the line of Citrix products for the iPad including GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC and Citrix Receiver. Citrix clearly believes the iPad is poised to make big inroads into mobility applications that have traditionally been handled by notebook PCs.Making software ‘rules’ easier to changeDecisions, decisions, decisions. According to a survey by Corticon, a US specialist in business rules management systems, over a third of respondents plan to use a business rules engine to automate the business logic behind decisions. Most organisations use business rules to manage their interactions with employees, customers and suppliers - for example, employees with more than five years service get an extra vacation day, orders over $150 get free shipping, and so on. However, these rules are often programmed into the applications with the disadvantage that changes have to be made by the IT department. With a business rules engine, the business rules are separated from the application logic - the core of a software application. That allows business users with no IT knowledge to change the rules themselves and they can make the changes faster and more frequently than if the rules had to be reprogrammed by the IT department. Corticon argues rules engines are particularly relevant to health and government agencies, which have complex, changing rules governing entitlement to service and payments. Over a quarter of US state governments use its software.Fujitsu offers secure mobile browserJapanese IT giant Fujitsu has launched a service to protect corporate data when users connect to the firm’s intranet from mobile devices. The service requires the installation of a special mobile browser, called Fenics, which can be downloaded free from Android-based smartphone application stores and, soon, from Apple’s App Store. Unlike standard mobile browsers, which simply reformat website data to look good on mobile devices, Fujitsu’s browser has additional security features to prevent sensitive corporate data from being left on the device.
18;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2011-07-13T03:06:46Z;Citrix Systems in deal to buy Cloud.com;;Citrix Systems, the networking and remote access technology company, on Tuesday announced a deal to buy Cloud.com, a three-year-old cloud computing start-up, in a deal worth between $200m and $250m.It is the latest deal indicating the elevated prices that businesses are willing to pay for companies in high-growth areas such as cloud computing and social networking.Cupertino-based Cloud.com, had about 70 employees and had raised just $17.6m in two funding rounds with venture capitalists Index Ventures, Redpoint Ventures and Nexus Venture Partners. It had yet to make a profit.However, the company supplies technology to big customers such as Apple, Zynga, the Facebook games maker, GoDaddy, the internet domain name company, and Korea Telecom. It allows individual companies to manage their own remote data centres better, and provides tools for companies, which want to set themselves up as cloud computing providers, in competition with companies such as Amazon and Microsoft.Analysts expect the cloud computing market to be worth more than $11bn by the end of 2013, as more and more companies opt to have their computer networks hosted remotely by specialist companies.Citrix already provides cloud computing services and technologies that allow workers to access corporate networks remotely, but is continuing to build up its capabilities. In 2007, the company bought Xensource, a data centre virtualisation company, for $500m.Qatalyst Partners advised Citrix, while Goldman Sachs advised Cloud.com.

20;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2011-04-15T18:15:43Z;Earnings leave Wall Street stocks flat;;Disappointing results from Bank of America and Google weighed on the financial and technology sectors, but strong manufacturing and consumer sentiment data left the wider markets higher in the final session of a lacklustre week for US equities.Bank of America reported a 36 per cent decline in first-quarter profit as the foreclosures crisis continued to squeeze its home loan business.Earnings came in at $2bn, or $0.17 per share, falling short of the $0.26 per share expected by analysts.This left the stock down 2.3 per cent to $12.83, with news that the bank had made a deal with Assured Guaranty to resolve all its mortgage repurchase claims serving to limit further losses on the stock.Bank of America shares have fallen 33.9 per cent in the past year, the worst-performing stock in the 24-company BKX banking index, thanks partly to worries over its mortgage liabilities.The results weighed slightly on the financial sector, with Capital One losing 0.4 per cent to $50.03 and Regions Financial falling 1 per cent to $7.17. The BKX banking index was down 0.2 per cent.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Google dropped 8.3 per cent to $530.70 after the internet search group reported a 54 per cent jump in first-quarter operating costs.The news raised fears that Google was facing a deterioration in its underlying cost structure as it tried to maintain growth. The higher costs left profits below expectations, with pro forma earnings per share reaching $8.08, against the $8.13 analysts had forecast.These results dragged on the wider technology sector. Shares in Cognizant Technology Solutions were down 2.6 per cent to $78.72 while Yahoo lost 0.4 per cent to $16.62. The S&P technology index was down 0.4 per cent, the worst performing S&P sub-index.In spite of this, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,319.68 – down 0.6 per cent over the week – after the Empire State manufacturing survey showed that economic activity was expanding faster than expected in the New York area.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that its manufacturing index rose to 21.7 in April, ahead of the 17 point reading expected by economists. A figure greater than zero signals expansion.The Empire State index is the first of several regional manufacturing gauges to be released each month, although that from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve is seen as the most significant as a gauge of the strength of the wider economy.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index also came in slightly better than expected at 69.6. In other economic data, US prices rose 0.5 per cent in March according to the Labor Department. This was the ninth straight month of increases in the consumer price index, but it was in line with forecasts, and so did little to sway the markets.Overall, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent at 12,341.98 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,764.65. The indices have lost 0.3 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively in the past five days.The disappointing week on Wall Street began with sharp losses in energy and material stocks as commodity prices softened. This was partly due to Goldman Sachs advising clients to lock in profits on oil and other commodities.Lower than expected quarterly revenue from Alcoa, the first S&P company to report results, compounded negative sentiment in the material sector. Alcoa was down 7.8 per cent to $16.52 over the week while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 10.6 per cent to $51.17.The S&P material sector fell 2.3 per cent over the week while the energy sector lost 3.1 per cent.Towards the end of the week, financial stocks were in focus after the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations found that banks, including Goldman Sachs, had mis-sold mortgage-backed securities and misled investors and lawmakers. Shares in Goldman were down 3.6 per cent to $155.13 over the week while the S&P financial sector lost 2 per cent.JPMorgan Chase was down 4.2 per cent to $44.89, despite releasing quarterly results on Wednesday that beat forecasts.Arcos Dorados, the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee, saw a strong opening week of trading, rising 25.5 per cent to $21.36. Zipcar, the web-based hourly car rental group, was similarly successful, trading at $27.16 – 52.6 per cent above where the IPO originally priced.
21;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2011-03-30T21:00:57Z;Wall Street stocks boosted by jobs data;;Deal news helped to lift the pharmaceutical sector on Wall Street while the wider markets were buoyed by promising employment data ahead of the big monthly payroll report on Friday.Valeant, an acquisitive speciality pharmaceutical company, said it was making a $5.7bn hostile offer for Cephalon, another drugmaker.The news sent shares in Valeant up 12.8 per cent to $50.08, while Cephalon jumped 28.4 per cent to $75.44, the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 index. The $73-a-share cash proposal, which represents a 29 per cent premium to where the shares have traded over the past month, comes after Valeant tried and failed to engage Cephalon’s management and board in takeover discussions.Elsewhere in the sector Merck was up 1.6 per cent to $33.30 while Forest Laboratories rose 4.3 per cent to $32.48. The S&P healthcare index was up 0.7 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent to 1,328.26 after the ADP National Employment Report estimated that private non-farm employment had risen by 201,000 in March.The figure was broadly in line with expectations, but kept traders’ hopes alive for a strong official employment number on Friday. This was the fourth month where the ADP figure showed about 200,000 jobs being added, compared with the previous four months where the average was 74,000.“In short, there has been a clear and sustained acceleration in private payroll gains,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.The S&P 500 has bounced back 5.7 per cent in the past two weeks as traders have turned their attention to the US domestic economic recovery and away from global tensions.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the marketplace, fell 3.2 per cent in the session to 17.6, falling below 18 points for the first time since the tensions began in Middle East and north Africa in the middle of February.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,350.23 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,776.79.Financial stocks gained ground in the session, led by Visa and MasterCard, following speculation that US curbs on debit card fees will be delayed or modified.Visa was up 2.8 per cent to $74.23 while MasterCard added 0.8 per cent to $253.66 in reaction to comments from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in the previous session that the central bank would not meet an April 21 deadline to come up with a final rule on debit card transaction fees.Jon Tester, Democratic senator, is also pushing for a chamber vote on a bill that could delay the cap by two years.Elsewhere in financials, Goldman Sachs was up 0.4 per cent to $159.07 while JPMorgan Chase added 0.9 per cent to $46.45.

It is the first time that AppSense has received outside investment.Darron Antill, chief executive, said that AppSense would use the proceeds from Goldman’s investment to accelerate its expansion into the US, where year-on-year sales have risen 150 per cent. He said AppSense would look to carry out an initial public offering in the next three to four years.Goldman last month invested $500m in Facebook, the social networking site, together with Russia’s DST and arranged a $1bn offering in privately traded shares to a group of overseas investors.AppSense, which in the year to July 1 2010 reported a 60 per cent jump in sales to $47m, employs about 300 people round the world, half of whom are based in Daresbury near Warrington in the northwest of England.Last year the group took on 120 people and Mr Antill who is based in New York, said that he expected to add another 150 to 200 over the next 12 months.The group is expanding fast in Europe and the Middle East and also plans a push into emerging markets in Asia and Latin America.Mr Antill, who last month replaced the group’s founder Charles Sharland as chief executive, said the company had been approached by a range of investors, including private equity firms.The company was founded in 1999 but has grown rapidly in the past few years offering virtualisation technology and cloud computing services. Clients include government departments such as the UK’s GCHQ as well as global companies such as BAA, Broadcom, GE Money, Citigroup, Vodafone, Volkswagen and Time Warner.AppSense currently works in collaboration with companies including Citrix, VMware and Microsoft but Mr Antill said that he expected the group to increasingly work on a standalone model.According to IDC, the research firm, revenues from virtual client computing software hit $1.52bn last year and the market is projected to be worth about $2.5bn by 2014.Chris Ingle, consultancy director at IDC, said that while virtualisation has been discussed for the past few years, demand has recently increased as companies emerging from the economic downturn tried to find ways to deploy and manage the migration of technology across multiple platforms.As part of the deal with Goldman, Pete Perrone, managing director at the bank, will join AppSense’s board of directors.

30;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2009-06-17T15:18:38Z;Wireless security: Data fills the airwaves – who is listening ?;;"“Data,” says Howard Schmidt, professor, and president of the international Information Security Forum, “is the gold, the silver and the diamonds of the world we live in, so no matter how someone gets access to your data – whether it’s through a lost piece of media or a wireless network, it’s just as dangerous and troublesome as if someone broke in and stole the entire computer system.”This is why companies worldwide are worrying about the challenge presented by the growth of wireless networking. Richard Levine of Accenture, a consultancy, remembers how at one time the chief information officer mandated how an employee could connect to the network. “Today, they have expectations of how they want to connect and if you don’t give them the hardware and network to do it, they will find their own.”Even the jargon associated with networking security carries a whiff of menace: “evil twins”, the “man-in-the-middle*” and “split tunnelling**” are just some of the dangers facing companies and their employees. “It is an arms race,” says Rob Cotton, chief executive of NCC Group, a company that tests the integrity of corporate networks. “Hackers will break through virtually anything when it becomes advantageous for them to do so.” His own, 100-strong team of “ethical hackers“ claims a 97.8 per cent success rate in hacking into corporate networks in the course of their wholly legitimate activities.The mobility conferred by lightweight, affordable portable devices and ubiquitous wireless networks has been hailed as the next and most important business trend as employees enjoy access to the data they need to do their jobs anyhow, anywhere and anytime.But wireless networks are notoriously vulnerable to hacking – especially public Wi-Fi “hotspots”, which are unlikely to have security or encryption protection – and the experts are unanimous in claiming that constant vigilance is the only answer: “You must never believe you are secure,” Mr Cotton urges. “The only time we have discovered a network that is safe is when it is switched off.”Kurt Roemer, chief security strategist at Citrix, says organisations have spent millions on security measures to little avail: “The ubiquity of wireless coupled with the fact that users will sign up to whichever available network is easiest, means there is no way for an organisation to own and control the end-to-end network.“Investment in outdated wireless security measures such as WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is rendered worthless when an employee opts for an unprotected network – or when a hacker can use a ‘point and hack’ tool to expose the network in less than 60 seconds.”The good news, according to Paul Meakin, portfolio manager for Damovo, the services group, is that the right technology and the right security policies can go a long way to protecting both company and employees: “Remote workers must ensure they are protecting their devices and businesses must ensure they can manage them.“Devices such as laptops, mobile phones and USB sticks should be encrypted; otherwise they will be wide open to data access. Ideally, companies should have a ‘remote device wipe’ enabled so that all data can be destroyed in the case of loss or theft.” Sensitive data should not be stored on local devices, he urges, suggesting that proprietary technologies that enable a virtual encrypted disk to be created on the machine in use should be used. These make it possible to wipe the disk at the end of each session.Some argue, however, that data leaks through less technological loopholes. Bob Tarzey, of the consultancy Quocirca, says: “I could not put an accurate figure on it, but I would venture that 99 per cent of sensitive data being compromised through the use of wireless is through the loss or theft of the access device itself, which could be a laptop, netbook or smartphone, rather than the deliberate interception of wireless network traffic. This is the problem on which IT managers should focus. It requires the encryption of stored data.”Security specialists agree, however, that basic defence measures such as up-to-date firewalls and anti-virus software are critically important for any device that is to be connected to the internet. Dave Hughes, director of wireless broadband for BT Business in the UK warns: “For businesses and individuals that are concerned about their data being intercepted over the internet, we strongly recommend the use of a secure remote access virtual private network using either IPSec or SSL technology. This is an important common practice for both wired and wireless connections.”IPSec is a set of rules that authenticates and encrypts each packet of data across a network using internet technology. SSL or Secure Socket Layer and its successor Transport Layer Security also provide cryptographic protection for messages travelling across a network so as to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and forgery.BT operates a network of Wi-Fi hot spots called BT Openzone that can be vulnerable to the “evil twin” scam where a rogue access point pretends to be a legitimate Openzone point with a view to obtaining names, passwords and credit card numbers. Mr Hughes says customers should check that their browser displays a padlock symbol indicating a secured page, the address www.btopenzone.com and that no certificate error dialogue box pops up during log-in: “If these conditions are met, you can be sure that it’s a genuine BTOpenzone access point you are connecting to.“Remote working using Wi-Fi is perfectly safe provided basic precautions are taken and, as we know, accessing broadband out and about is a really powerful and increasingly essential aid to business,” he says.Dave Hartley, security consultant with the consultancy Activity, adds: “Try to use only a Wi-Fi provider that implements the IEEE standard 802.1x …What this basically means is that the provider’s client software automatically checks the network’s authenticity so a user cannot accidentally connect to an evil twin.”What steps should an organisation take to protect itself and its mobile employees? For a start, Prof Schmidt of the ISF emphasises that a wireless network connected to an enterprise network is not necessarily protected by the enterprise firewall. If an employee buys an off-the-shelf wireless connection, there may be no security at all.Mr Cotton of NCC Group makes four points. “First, do not believe any security vendors’ claims. Certainly, invest in security equipment, but have it tested by an independent expert. Second, don’t believe there is a silver bullet that will meet your security challenge. You must regularly review your arrangements. And if it’s cheap and easy to implement, it will not be secure. That’s just a rule of life.“Third, security policies must be in place and users must be aware of their responsibilities. Do not, for example, allow staff to use personal features on your wireless network. Fourth, keep up to date with the latest technical developments and advances in encryption.”Mr Cotton says the responsibility for observing these conditions lies with the chief executive: “A CEO has to know about security in this day and age.”*active eavesdropping where the attacker persuades the victims they are communicating over a secure connection.**a network allowing a virtual private network user to connect to the internet and a local network simultaneously over the same physical connection."

33;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2008-11-03T23:12:35Z;Laptop plan takes byte out of costs;;"When Tedd Fox, a desktop engineer at the virtualisation software company Citrix, wanted a new laptop for work, instead of contacting his IT department, he went out and bought exactly what he wanted. It was a new Mac Book, with a fast processor and extra memory. “My computer is my digital hub,” he explains, “and has all my pictures and music on it. Previously, I had one computer for work and one for home and it was very confusing.”Shawn Genoway, Citrix director of Americas IT service delivery, went for something rather different – a muscular HP laptop with a 17-inch widescreen, HDTV and Blu-Ray. The graphics and music specification were perfect for watching videos and gaming in his free time: “I have been much more content having a laptop that has all the bells and whistles that I wouldn’t have in a corporate standard.”Both are participants in Citrix’s BYOC (bring your own computer scheme) whereby the company gives employees who sign up a $2,100 stipend to buy whatever they want. There are virtually no restrictions on what they choose. The laptop has to run either Windows or Mac OS (Linux will be available in 2009), it has to have anti-virus software and a three-year manufacturers service agreement, and users need to download several Citrix packages. That’s it: as long as the laptop can be used for work, the company does not care whether you buy the most elegant Mac, the tiniest netbook or a gaming machine that looks like it has overdosed on steroids. Some employees spend more than the $2,100; others spend less and pocket the difference.So far, says Citrix chief information officer Paul Martine, about 300 people (of around 1,250 US-based laptop users) have signed up and feedback has been very positive. “The real difference from our point of view,” he says, “is that someone else does the care and feeding of the devices.” Employees who sign up to the scheme, have to get a three-year service plan from the vendor, so maintaining the machines is no longer Citrix’s problem.“It actually works out somewhat cheaper to do it this way,” Mr Martine adds.Citrix is leading the way by doing something of this scope and scale. However, others have made steps in the same direction. Google has an programme called “Stuff” which enables people to order the technology relevant to their jobs – so, for instance, small, portable laptops for those who travel, wider screens for engineers, Macs for those who prefer them and so on. However, unlike Citrix, these do need to be related to the job.BP also ran a pilot scheme similar to Citrix’s where a small group of employees were allowed to choose their own hardware. However it was decided not to roll it out.Of course, Citrix does have an advantage over many companies. Its employees tend to be of a techie mindset, meaning they have both a greater understanding of and passion for their laptops. It is a little more difficult to imagine the majority of staff who work in a bank or for a consumer goods business, for instance, knowing or caring much about Quad Core processors.Nonetheless, there are good reasons to believe we could see further similar moves in the wider world. One is that people are becoming more technologically savvy, having become used to a number of different devices (phone, laptop, desktop, smartphone, etc). The second is that file transferability between different platforms and operating systems has improved greatly.And the third is that many applications are becoming accessible through online platforms – which means that it really does not matter what you use to access themIndeed, Mr Martine thinks companies could decentralise their laptop buying in the way that many have dismantled their expensive in-house car fleets.Jakob Nielsen, an IT usability expert, says his own business, the Nielsen Norman Group, “just tells employees to get what they want and need in terms of technology to do their jobs”.He says that the growth in personal technology means that people feel these devices are part of their identity, even with respect to the office technology.And if knowledge workers feel held back by their tools, he points out, “the downside for productivity and morale could be immense”.Mr Fox agrees that a more personal laptop makes for a more engaged employee: “The real upside is that you don’t have to get used to several different working environments and that you have everything on one device – it makes me a happier person.”"

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

36;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2008-03-19T00:30:41Z;IT going green: Thin clients cut costs and strengthen security;;"David Hasselhoff has just featured in a remake of Knight Rider, the 1980s action-car TV show.But to the sorrow of those old enough to remember, the 1980s have made a comeback in other ways, too: radio DJs are resuscitating music that died long ago, while students embrace shoulder pads and brick-sized mobile phones as “retro” accessories.Few would have thought such revolutions in fashion could make their way into the computing industry. But rising energy costs are causing companies to ask their IT experts what they can do to cut the bills. And some are suggesting moving back in time to thin-client computing.“A thin client is a network computing device that depends primarily on the central server for processing activities,” says Simon Ponsford, chief executive of Cranberry, a UK technology company. “In most cases, a user’s applications are run on the central server and the thin-client processes only keyboard and mouse movements and receives updated video images.“In this respect, thin clients are similar to the old Unix-based mainframe systems accessed by dumb terminals that were popular in the 1970s and 80s.”That means there are no hard discs in an office, but just monitors, mouses and keyboards. The processing is all done behind the scenes in a data centre.IT vendors are excited about reselling this concept. Citrix, Hewlett-Packard and IBM are all shouting about the energy-saving benefits, implicit because of the cut in computer components in the office.For example, HP (which has just started selling a laptop thin client), says thin clients can be up to 80 per cent more power efficient than standard PCs.“In terms of green IT, thin clients are quite compelling,” adds Mr Ponsford. “PCs often use 175 to 200 watts of power, whereas a thin client uses 10 to 25 watts.“When comparing a thin client with a PC, it’s important to remember that the thin client needs a central server to operate and this should be included in any power calculations.“On average, the total power requirement for a thin client running against a shared central server is 50 to 60 watts, which is still favourable when compared with a PC.”Green IT is big news for vendors, who, having failed to realise the importance of energy saving until now, see the huge opportunities in encouraging companies to buy equipment that gives more bang for the buck.“There are fewer components, less energy is consumed, less heat is generated and you don’t need as much cooling in the office,” says Mick Walker, green computing consultant for IBM. “So you can turn your aircon down. There are also fewer components that need recycling. You expect that a keyboard, screen and mouse will last longer.”But thin clients are only one part of a bigger puzzle. The back-end of all that processing is where it gets hot. IT experts have found other ways to cut electricity usage. The use of virtualisation – multiple digital heavyweight computers built inside one physical server – is helping limit the use of equipment.“With virtualisation, we reduced our servers from 600 to fewer than 100,” says Sean Whetstone, head of IT services at Reed Managed Services. “[Thin-client computing] is a bit of a no-brainer. It ticks the green boxes; it has a very simple model and I wonder why more people don’t take advantage of it.“We’d say it’s a benefit. We were trying to cut expenditure by 20 per cent, be more secure and cut carbon emissions. The thin client terminals are only on between eight and 10 hours a day – you can turn them on and off as you go as there’s no operating system on them.“Our electricity savings were massive. The bills dropped by 26 per cent, which was a saving of a six-figure sum. And the good thing about 64-bit computing is you can get 100 people on one server.”"
37;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2008-02-11T10:18:59Z;Lessons from SocGen: Internal threats need to become a security priority;;"The staggering €4.9bn ($7.1bn) loss incurred by a rogue trader at Societe Generale has repercussions that extend far beyond the rarefied world of derivatives trading – notably concerning IT security issues that affect many organisations.Richard Stiennon, an IT security consultant, says: “The SocGen case is a classic internal one, carried out by a knowledgeable insider and, technically, it would have been very easy to detect.”Nevertheless, Jérôme Kerviel, a junior trader on SocGen’s equity futures trading desk in Paris, managed to hide his trades for almost a year before being discovered last month.He was helped by his intimate knowledge of the bank’s control systems and procedures and by vulnerabilities in IT security.“You can always rely on the IT guys to leave a gaping hole for an insider to exploit,” says Mr Stiennon, who previously worked as a “white hat” hacker for PwC.Mr Kerviel had spent five years working in middle-office functions before being promoted to the front office.Bob McDowell, senior analyst with TowerGroup, the financial services consultancy, says: “It is relatively unusual for people to move from the back office to the front office in an investment bank and someone like that should be not be allowed to run large positions.”Mr McDowell also points out that Mr Kerviel was not working in a customer-facing business but on the proprietary trading desk which is subject to “less onerous procedures”, partly because the money at risk is the bank’s own.Financial firms have spent huge sums on IT systems and procedures to comply with regulatory regimes such as Basel II, ITIL and Sarbanes-Oxley in recent years. In theory, they have an armoury of technology ready to catch any trader who strays.SocGen itself had built a sophisticated risk management system for its derivatives trading operation. The system, supplied by US vendor Algorithmics, was designed to measure the external risk of a counterparty defaulting on a deal. But a greater danger was lurking within SocGen; risk management systems are not designed to spot “rogue traders”.“This was a surveillance problem not a risk management problem,” says Simon Asplen-Taylor, head of regulatory services at Detica, an IT consultancy.Even the rules-based surveillance systems widely used in investment banks would have struggled to flag Mr Kerviel’s behaviour as suspicious, because he appeared to be staying within his daily trading limits.A recent survey by CERT, the IT security programme run by Carnegie Mellon University, shows that corporate IT security strategies remain heavily focused on protecting business from external threats such as hackers, even though the insider threat is getting worse – 27 per cent of incidents involve insiders.For this reason, analysts stress the importance of enforcing internal procedures and security systems.For example, Mr Kerviel was able to log on as someone else, allowing him to bypass his trading limit by “taking [trading] positions using the machines of colleagues at the same time and in full sight of all,” as he says in his statement to police.“It’s human nature for people to share passwords,” says Mark Fullbrook, manager of UK-based IT security firm Cyber-Ark.But this becomes a more serious problem when traders are able to access systems in the back-office. “It should not be possible for someone in the front office to access client-opening and interdealer systems,” says Mr McDowell.Security experts say such problems can occur when old log-ins are not cancelled and are especially serious if they include “privileged user” log-ins. These powerful passwords are normally restricted to IT staff, as they provide a “back door” into systems and allow the holder to access and change data.Keeping log-ins and access privileges up to date as employees join, leave or move is a chore for corporate IT departments and the potential security loopholes created by inefficient manual processes has led to the growth of dedicated solutions for “leavers and joiners”, such as Quest Software’s ActiveRoles Server. For managing privileged user passwords, Cyber-Ark has Digital Vault software.Single sign-on is a related technology that seeks to eliminate the risks arising from users needing multiple passwords to access different systems. Vendors in the SSO market include Entrust, IBM and Citrix.Passwords, by their very nature, provide only limited protection against internal attacks. More robust protection can be obtained using authentication technologies such as biometrics.Today, laptops and computer keyboards often come with built-in fingerprint scanners. But investment banks are not big fans of biometrics, despite the obvious benefits. Mr Stiennon says: “The problem with using biometrics or any other control technology in the dealing room is the ‘push back’ you get from the traders.”Nevertheless, Mr McDowell believes the SocGen case will force investment banks and other organisations to look again at using biometrics.There are many other technologies to help businesses protect themselves from internal threats. But they must go hand-in-hand with strict supervision and procedures.As Mr Kerviel told the police himself: “The techniques I used were not at all sophisticated, and in my opinion, any correctly conducted control should have been able to detect these operations.”…………………………………………..Security checks• Be aware of the areas in which staff have worked

38;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2008-01-29T18:09:37Z;New mainframes: IT power is moving back to the centre;;"Adecade ago they were counting them all out. Now they are counting the blades and servers back in again, as the trend to distributed computing falters and the datacentre reclaims its central position in enterprise information processing.The talk around the water cooler is of centralised control and virtualisation – using the power of modern processors to run many operating systems and applications on a single machine. Citrix, a maker of thin client software, and VMware, a specialist in virtualisation, are much in fashion.Ian Snadden, vice-president, systems and technology in Europe for Unisys, says the change represents a need to regain control: “Many chief information officers are not aware of the number of servers that sit on their network, never mind the sheer amount of wasted capacity that compromises their productivity.“Add to this growing concerns that staff members are exploiting the computing freedom they have amassed over the past 10 years and the reasons for greater control are evident.”There is no doubt that many big datacentres are struggling with complexity.Milind Govekar, analyst with the Gartner Group, observes that in IT, nothing ever dies. “We glibly talk about IT lifecycles but we don’t believe in one of the key stages and that is death. We keep piling on the stuff until we have a huge, complex mess.“Virtualisation is one answer. But if you virtualise a mess you’ll get a bigger mess. The overriding need is to cut complexity first.”A big catalyst for change, according to Jonathan Priestly, a director of BMC Software, is management’s need to regain control over its enterprise resource planning (ERP) operations.Large ERP systems such as SAP’s are often run on separate systems with their own dedicated staff: “If I walk into a big US retail set-up I can practically guarantee there will be a completely separate SAP team responsible for the implementation of the management side of it and for the core project itself.“This is a big problem from a management standpoint. The application is consuming an enormous amount of datacentre power that you have very little control over. The release of a new version of the product can have tremendous ripple effects throughout the organisation. It might take 18 months to upgrade from one version to the next,” he says, as evidence for his contention that management wants all IT operations under its control.And so, although their architecture today bears no resemblance to that of their predecessors, mainframe computers could once again become the workhorses of the computing industry.As Jim Porell, chief architect for IBM’s mainframe software division, put it: “What we offer is a superior operations container.”He points out that in a typical distributed computing environment, each application will run on a separate server leading to complex networking and a multiplicity of what the industry calls “intrusion points”.These are weaknesses where an insider can gain access to the system to perpetrate fraud or theft, something that Mr Porell says is a huge problem.His answer? “Draw a box around all these servers, call it System Z, and you’ve totally changed the operations model,” he says, arguing that security, resilience and risk management are all simplified in a device which takes up no more floor space than a single server today.System Z is IBM’s latest mainframe family, featuring up to 54 processing units and running ZOS, the latest iteration of the computing giant’s venerable MVS operating software.Mr Porell’s views are backed up by research published last month by the bank Credit Suisse, which confirms that reports of the death of the mainframe are overstated.“In fact,” it says, “we believe that the mainframe market is experiencing a renaissance as IT organisations have once again begun to value many attributes of the mainframe platform including data sharing, disaster recovery, the Linux operating system, partitioning, power and cooling, server pool workload balancing and prioritisation, security, specialised processors, total system utilisation and virtualisation – all of which represent key focus points in today’s cost-and-performance conscious IT spending environment.”Or as Gary Williams, enterprise computing specialist with NEC of Japan, puts it: “With distributed computing, everybody had the power on their desktops. Now everybody realises that is a management nightmare. As well as being heavy on power consumption, it takes a lot of people to manage a distributed environment.“By being able to deliver the same power to the user while putting control back into the datacentre, you are satisfying the best of both worlds. But it’s taken until now for networks to have evolved to be able to support this sort of operation.”NEC’s answer is what it calls the Virtual Personal Computer Centre (VPPC). This is essentially rackfuls of servers in a datacentre that are networked to small desktop units mounted on the back of flat video screens – the 21st-century equivalent of the dumb terminal.Screen updates travel from the datacentre to the desktop; key depressions travel in the opposite direction. The data are secure in the datacentre, free from insider or outsider interference.A similar approach has been taken by the US company ClearCube, which mounts an array of PC blades in the datacentre, communicating with a cassette-sized box on the user’s desk. “In a nutshell, it’s the power and flexibility of a Windows PC with the security, availability and manageability of the mainframe,” says Rich Hoffman, the chief executive.ClearCube’s customers include the US Federal Government and a number of the big banks, all of which value both the security of the system and its high availability – if a blade fails, its workload shifts to another in seconds.The shift back to centralisation has, however, generated diverse approaches. Jason Scott, chief technology officer in Europe for Wachovia, the fourth largest bank in the US, recently returned from the company’s headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he had been networking 5,000 ClearCube blades within a datacentre to create a “grid”, or co-operative computing system for the investment bank.He denies this is a return to the mainframe: “We are looking at a centralised model for running resources but it is a distributed platform. It runs a desktop operating system and it is not expensive like a mainframe. We don’t run any PCs on our desktops any more. Everything we do is what we call back-rack technology.”The ClearCube and grid computing approach seem to have paid dividends for Wachovia. Three years ago, the company invested $2m to create a 625-blade grid farm. “Thirty days later, regulators freed up more than $1bn in capital for Wachovia,” says Mr Scott.David Wright of Hewlett-Packard believes that customers now have a full spectrum of modes of operation available to them: “Computing is now available to customers in a variety of guises, one extreme of which is a centralised model, the other a distributed model.”The Corporate Markets division of Lloyds TSB, the UK bank, recently installed a new computing infrastructure for its 250 traders based on HP workstation blades and servers; the main components were confined to a central equipment room leaving the traders’ desks comparatively uncluttered.HP has recently acquired Neoware, a consultancy and manufacturer of network computers – essentially dumb terminals. According to the company’s Andrew Gee: “It has no moving parts, all is solid state and silent in operation. It uses 12 watts compared with 300 watts for a PC. All the applications reside on the server. It is inherently secure because the data never leave the datacentre.”Tim Murfet of the consultancy Accenture says that while virtualisation is now mainstream, innovations such as allowing staff to buy and use their own PCs over a network are in the early stages. Some companies, he says, are talking of abandoning PCs altogether and using personal digital assistants (PDAs) for connection. “When you come in in the morning, instead of plugging in your laptop to the network, you plug your PDA into the network and into a screen – you would effectively be using your phone to do all your IT.”In the end, however, the decision to centralise or distribute must depend on what is right for the business."

Each of the Eclipse 500s in DayJet’s fleet will have two pilots and carry up to three passengers. The air taxi service is expected to serve short-haul routes of 300 to 600 miles.DayJet is planning to take delivery of 300 Eclipse aircraft in the first two years with the total set to grow to as many as 1,400 in five years, if the business model proves a success.The company was cleared last week by the US Federal Aviation Administration to begin operations, after Eclipse had overcome a number of technical problems in the development and production of the early Eclipse 500 aircraft.Mr Gruen-Kennedy said that the air taxi service would begin services between five cities in Florida: Boca Raton, Gainesville, Lakeland, Pensacola and Tallahassee, before spreading out across the south-east of the US. The company plans to expand into the states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North and South Carolina and Tennessee.It is aiming to serve 40 airports in the region within three years as it took delivery of more aircraft and expanded its fleet. It is also studying an eventual launch of similar services in Europe.

Kirk Kerkorian said Tracinda, his investment company, was negotiating with MGM about buying the casino operator’s Bellagio Hotel and City-Center properties in Las Vegas. Mr Kerkorian holds a 56 per cent stake in MGM.The S&P 500 made another foray above its record close of 1,527.46 set on March 24, 2000 on Tuesday, but could not hold gains. The S&P reached an intra-day high of 1,529.24, a shade under Monday’s intraday high of 1,529.87.The US benchmark again struggled to make the decisive move higher that would eclipse the all-time intraday high of 1,552.87 – set on the same day as the all-time closing high seven years ago. Late in New York, the S&P had closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,522.11. Technology and financials were the only two positive sectors among the 10 major industry groups in the index. Materials and energy stocks led losses.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.4 per cent higher at 2,588.02, and had reversed weakness earlier in the day as semiconductor stocks rebounded.Blue chips set an new intra-day record high, but failed to hold that rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.02 per cent lower to close at 13,539.95 after it had set a new record high of 13,586.68.The S&P’s flirtation with record levels comes after more than 90 per cent of companies in the index have reported first-quarter results.“Although US growth has been slowing, S&P 500 margins seem to have been maintained in part thanks to the strength of the global economy and a weakening dollar which have boosted overseas sales. Around 30 per cent of revenues now come from abroad,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.“While earnings growth may continue to decelerate, we are not likely to see outright falls as long as the US does not go into recession and growth elsewhere stays robust.”Although recent economic data have been inconsistent, the stock market is riding a wave of liquidity, say analysts. “There is an ample supply of inexpensive investment capital and real interest rates remain low,” said Doug Peta, equity strategist at J&W Seligman.As stock prices have rallied since the end of March, short sales of shares have risen sharply – indicating that some investors expect the market to suffer a reversal.A short sale is a sale of a security that the seller does not own, and makes money if prices fall.Late on Monday, the New York Stock Exchange said the number of shares that have been sold short, known as short interest, increased to 11.8bn as of May 10, a new record high, from 11.0bn on April 13.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said the 7 per cent rise in short interest over the past month was the 10th largest monthly increase in short interest over the last 16 years. They concluded: “It is hard to imagine that investors are overly bullish with short interest hitting record highs month after month.”Amid the MGM casino news, other gaming stocks rose on Tuesday, led by Boyd Gaming, up 5.5 per cent to $49.64, Wynn Resorts, up 7.4 per cent to $101.15 and Las Vegas Sands higher by 5.6 per cent at $80.19.On the back of Fremont General’s sale of its commercial real estate business to iStar, other mortgage lenders rallied, with shares in Accredited Home Lenders rising 4.9 per cent to $13.38. Shares in iStar rallied 3.9 per cent to $47.60.In company news, Chevron said it planned to sell its 12 per cent stake in power producer Dynegy, the power producer, in a move to exit non-core operations. Shares in Dynegy fell 3.3 per cent to $9.83, while Chevron was 0.8 per cent lower at $82.18.In earnings news, Staples said its first-quarter profit rose 12 per cent, but lowered its guidance for future earnings. Shares in the office products supplier had slid 2.4 per cent to close at $25.05.A brokerage upgrade boosted Citrix Systems, by 5.4 per cent to $32.91. The software maker set a recent high of $34.63 in late April.

Sentiment swung wildly as investors got to grips with mixed results and guidance from several companies, volatile oil prices and rising bond yields.The Vix index, a market measure of volatility, reflected this. It swung from a low of 9.87 to a peak of 11.60 on Friday, and rose 7 per cent for the week.After setting a six-year high during the week, the S&P 500 retreated on Friday to close at 1,422.18, down 0.1 per cent on the day and 0.6 per cent over the five days as Treasury yields reached their highest levels in five months.“Rising rates are an expression of economic strength,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. But he said such strength ran counter to the Federal Reserve’s “soft landing” scenario and had “upset” investors.A clear trend this month has been the desire of investors to snap up recent underperformers if their earnings exceeded expectations.Jack Caffrey, senior equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “People are afraid of missing out, and when they hear good news they want to boost their portfolios with stocks that promise out-performance.”The situation was illustrated this week when Ebay beat earnings and raised guidance for 2007. The online auctioneer rose 6.8 per cent to $31.65, having fallen
30 per cent during the previous 12 months.Better than expected earnings from Yahoo boosted its shares by 1.4 per cent to $28.04 this week. After tumbling 35 per cent in 2006, the stock has risen 10 per cent this month. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,435.49 on Friday, a loss of 0.65 per cent for the week. A drag on the Nasdaq was Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares fell 3.7 per cent on the week to $71.50, after earnings failed to beat estimates.Other technology companies moving higher amid better earnings and guidance this week included Sun MicroSystems, up 9.7 per cent to $6.33, RF Micro Devices, up 13 per cent to $7.85, and Citrix Systems, up 8 per cent at $31.10. Microsoft beat earnings estimates but fell 1.6 per cent to $30.60 after setting a multi-year high of $31.48 on Thursday.Advanced Micro Devices, slid 8.5 per cent to $16.22 after the chipmaker missed its earnings estimates. Sun also said it would use chips from Intel in its servers, a move that could erode maket share for AMD said analysts.In contrast, Texas Instruments rose 9.3 per cent to $31.02 as the chipmaker produced stellar earnings. Shares in Corning surged 9.7 per cent to $21.20 after the maker of glass and fibre optics products also beat estimates.Blackstone increased its offer for Equity Office to $54 from $48.50 a share as it countered a rival buy-out offer of $52 a share. Shares in Equity Office rose 5.2 per cent to $55.22 this week.Countrywide jumped 4.2 per cent, to $42 on Friday after the Financial Times reported that the mortgage lender was in talks with Bank Of America about a possible $30bn deal. BofA shares fell 0.7 per cent to $52.04 on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record close during the week, only to retreat. It fell 0.1 per cent to 12,487.02 on Friday, a loss of 0.6 per cent over the week.AT&T led Dow constituents reporting earnings this week. Better revenue growth sparked a 3.8 per cent rise to $36.40 and shares hit a multi-year high of $37.70 on Thursday.Caterpillar shares rose 2.5 per cent to $61.09 on Friday after it raised sales guidance for 2007.McDonald’s weighed on the Dow as its shares slid 4.2 per cent to $42.93. Its quarterly earnings met estimates that were recently upgraded and had sent the stock to a multi-year peak of $45.06 more than a week ago. Topping the Dow this week was General Motors, up 4.4 per cent to $32.93, although the stock fell from a peak of $33.30 after it announced a delay in filing its fourth-quarter earnings.The company reiterated that it expected to be profitable in the fourth quarter of 2006.In stark contrast, Ford announced an annual loss of $12.7bn, the largest in its
history. The shares rose 1.4 per cent to $8.42.Analysts at Gimme Credit said Ford had managed investor expectations well: “We all know this is just the first quarter in what will be a gruelling, physical game.”"

AT&T rose 4.3 per cent to $36.87 and led gains for blue chips.The group’s mobile unit, Cingular Wireless, reported a sharp rise in fourth-quarter profit due to a surge in new customers during the period. AT&T fourth-quarter figures are due on Thursday.McDonald’s was a drag on the Dow as its shares fell 1.5 per cent to $44.16 after earnings met recently upward revised estimates.The restaurant chain’s shares hit a 52-week high last week. Technology companies were in the spotlight as the quarterly earnings season continued, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4 per cent to 2,466.28.It is now up 2.10 per cent for the year and leads the Dow’s rise of 1.3 per cent and the S&P’s 1.5 per cent gain so far in 2007.Yahoo shares rallied 7.3 per cent to $28.94 after the internet group’s fourth-quarter net income beat estimates late on Tuesday. Analysts cheered news that Yahoo would roll out its Panama search technology earlier than anticipated.Yahoo shares have risen 13.6 per cent this year, repairing some of its 35 per cent slide in 2006.Another technology company on the up was Sun MicroSystems, 8.7 per cent higher at $6.15.

43;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2005-02-23T07:24:57Z;Mark Templeton of Citrix Systems;;Building on demand for secure access to dataThe US government may have set the cat among the pigeons last month when a federal agency gave a warning about the security of internet telephony, but Mark Templeton, chief executive of Citrix Systems, is taking the controversy in his stride. “Security is our opportunity,” he says.The National Institute of Standards and Technology warned of the “inherent vulnerabilities” of voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) compared with conventional telephony and said this could result in “additional security weaknesses and avenues of attack.”But Florida-based Citrix is developing prototypes of technologies that will be able to “virtualise” VoIP, says Mr Templeton. This, he says, is much like the virtualisation achieved by Citrix’s flagship MetaFrame “presentation server” which transmits a “picture” of the information rather than the information itself – “virtualising the user experience in a computing situation,” as Mr Templeton puts it.The Citrix CEO seems well aware that his company operates in territory that can be hard for the layman to comprehend, but usually has a metaphor or simile up his sleeve to help cut though the jargon. Virtualisation, he says, is a bit like creating a jigsaw puzzle – “if you steal the transmission, you are faced with a huge problem: you’ve stolen a jigsaw puzzle of a screen that you have to put together to recognise the data”.Even the company’s chosen description of itself – the global leader in access infrastructure solutions – risks producing glazed looks in all but the most IT-savvy. Mr Templeton offers a different version: “Securing ends of the pipe so that people can’t crawl into the pipe and shielding the pipe so that people can’t pierce it, is basically what we do.” In the context of the fast-growing VoIP market, doing this over a “public, and fundamentally dirty network” – the internet – is a core competency of the company, he says.Citrix has made two unsuccessful attempts to encapsulate itself since Mr Templeton decided in 1999 that the company’s future lay in products that give people secure and well-managed access to business information wherever they are, on whatever device, and wherever the data may reside. “The messages were all getting at the same point, but communications is a very precise art,” he notes.First came “digital independence,” which turned out to be “too big and vague to understand,” he says. Then in 2001 the mantra changed to the “virtual workplace”. This worked well internally, says Mr Templeton, helping to bind the company together but people outside the company made an intellectual, rather than visceral, connection with it, and it did not translate well.The new description, in use for the past 18 months, is resonating well with customers and partners, he says. “Our customers tend to be the IT guys, even though it is the users of information systems that are beneficiaries of our technology, in a huge way. Some of our [marketing] messages were too ‘end-user-ish’ in genre and feel, and access infrastructure strikes at some ideas that IT people can get.”Citrix has thus positioned itself as a key enabler of the mobile working revolution, and Mr Templeton wants it to be as synonymous with access infrastructure as Oracle is with databases or Microsoft is with Office, Windows or operating systems in general.“We’re on our way, but this will be years in the making,” he says. “It’s like a rock star who might seem to be an overnight success. People say ‘wow’ but the star may have been playing for years at home, in school or in church, there’s a long thread of passion to what they are doing.”Given the market it has chosen to be in, Citrix will never be as visible to the general public, or to the average mobile worker, as companies such as Oracle or Microsoft, even though nearly 50m people in 120,000 organisations round the world use its software, according to the company.But Mr Templeton believes strongly that the time is right for the concept of access infrastructure to take root, especially in the context of enabling the much-hyped “on-demand” enterprise, a phrase that seems to have as many meanings as vendors offering it.The Citrix chief sees it as all about “having a core competency around being able to respond, in an on-demand way, to change in the business, whether it be external forces – such as regulation, compliance or government moves to promote flexible working – or internal forces, such as growth or the need to cut costs”. Access, he says, is the most important part of the computing infrastructure on which an on-demand enterprise has to be built.In a more general sense, access infrastructure is also a huge sector, he says – IDC, the IT analyst, forecast last year that the overall market would grow at a compound annual rate of 11.7 per cent to exceed $21.6bn by 2007. “And most of the segments are greenfields,” enthuses Mr Templeton. “Even in the sectors where we have 80 per cent market share, we have only tapped 10 per cent of the opportunities on a worldwide basis.”There are a lot of “natural drivers” behind this projected growth, he says: “Customers know that how they provide secure access has everything to do with being able to support teleworking or flexible working and with their ability to comply with financial or privacy regulations, because you need to know who is accessing what, and where and how they are doing it.”Within companies, Mr Templeton sees the impetus for mobile and flexible working initiatives coming both from the “middle-up” – functional business units with a specific need – and from the “bottom-up” – switched-on individual employees often referred to as “prosumers.” Citrix, he says, is not a huge believer in the usefulness of top-down initiatives unless they have a clear focus.So are mobile, flexible, teleworking employees here to stay or will enterprises try to turn back the clock? The short-term driver is increased productivity from the same number of employees, says Mr Templeton, while protecting the work-life balance.Long-term, even global warming, and the need to take people off the roads or trains to work, will play its part in encouraging teleworking. “If a flexible working strategy is well-executed, there won’t be a backlash,” he says. “If it is haphazard, there will be.”Crisp execution is what Mr Templeton is looking for from Citrix. Last year revenues rose 26 per cent to $741m, putting it in the world’s top 25 software companies. In five years, he says, it has the opportunity to be in the top 10, assuming the top five get bigger through consolidation.But if access infrastructure is such a hot sector, can Citrix avoid being swallowed up in any future consolidation? Mr Templeton believes access infrastructure is better offered by an independent company, because of the need to connect heterogeneous “ends of pipes”, and for many different relationships with all kinds of software, hardware and network companies. In this sense, being a “Switzerland” is a label he is proud of.But, he says, “I will never, ever sleep with both eyes closed, thinking that somehow, some bigger guy won’t look at what we’re doing and say ‘That looks interesting.’ That would be totally naïve on my part.”
44;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2005-02-23T07:01:46Z;Trend begins to hit home;;With the introduction in 2003 of legislation allowing parents of young children to request flexible working arrangements, the subject of flexible work practices has been placed firmly on the UK corporate agenda.But how much of the talk is just that? How many businesses are implementing policies and embracing the technologies that enable a more efficient working culture and a more flexible lifestyle for their employees?To help answer these questions, FT-IT Review in association with Citrix Systems today reveals the findings from a survey designed to allow readers to share their flexible working experiences – from a cultural, technological and personal point of view – whether they are responsible for the implementation of the policies or technology, or an employee.The study drew nearly 200 responses from FT-IT readers in all walks of life, and shows definitively that mobile and flexible working is here to stay. Thirty-six per cent of respondents spend 10 hours or more away from their main office every week, either on the road, in a branch office or at home, and 10 per cent spend more than half their week working from home.As for the impact of mobile or flexible working practices, nearly half the respondents say mobile working has produced a better work/life balance while 42 per cent say it has increased productivity and 19 per cent claim it has renewed their enthusiasm for their work and/or their company. Only 27 per cent say they don’t do mobile working.When asked which mobile devices they carry around with them, 51 per cent said 2G mobile phones and 48 per cent said laptops. The scores for all other devices are much lower: PDAs – 24 per cent, 2.5G mobile phones – 15 per cent, notebook computers – 11 per cent, 3G phones and smartphones – 7 per cent each, and BlackBerries or equivalent – 5 per cent.Laptops and 2G mobile phones were considered most essential for mobile working, and the news for 3G mobile operators was discouraging: only 13 per cent of those who did not own a 3G mobile planned to use one for work purposes, against 50 per cent with no such plans and 21 per cent who said “maybe.”From a corporate perspective, meanwhile, the outlook seems pretty clear. A majority (53 per cent) envisage that mobile and home working will increase over the next two years, against 21 per cent who believe the reverse will be the case. Among those who believe it will increase, the drivers are: a reduction in the need for office space (58 per cent), keeping key workers happier and more motivated (57 per cent), increases in productivity (51 per cent) and better mobile devices (46 per cent).When it comes to the impact on the corporate culture of the company, “increased productivity” again scored highly at 35 per cent, the same score achieved by “less stressful working environment.” However, in a sign that it is still early days for mobile working, 39 per cent of respondents said there was no noticeable impact yet on their company’s culture.Security remains an issue for companies, however. More than half (53 per cent) of respondents said they had concerns about data security with the use of mobile devices away from the office, compared with 39 per cent who did not. Among the former group, firewall software and virtual private networks were the most popular solutions.The survey reinforces the message from another research study conducted in the autumn by Coleman Parkes for Citrix. This suggested the government’s push towards a more flexible working nation was paying off with 90 per cent of leading businesses seeing flexible working as an “established, accepted way of working.”According to board directors questioned for the research, issues holding back the widespread implementation of mobile working are cost (55 per cent of respondents) keeping pace with new technology (52 per cent) and educating staff in using the relevant technology (48 per cent).“Putting theory into practice is often the issue for most businesses when it comes to mobile working, but this research highlights a significant step forward in the adoption of, and confidence in, flexible working,” says Lewis Gee, managing director of Citrix UK and Ireland, of the earlier study. “It’s even more reassuring that both employees and members of the board share the same positive views about the benefits.”The FT-IT/Citrix study was conducted in December 2004 and collated by Framework, a UK survey analysis company. There were 178 respondents, nearly three-quarters of whom were involved in IT/technology initiatives.
45;CTXS;Citrix Systems Inc;2005-02-14T07:04:12Z;Thin clients yield fat cost savings;;For employees of PKF, getting access to their corporate applications on the road is as simple as logging on with a user name and password. They do not even have to have their own computer with them. A web café or a hotel business centre is enough to give travelling staff members access to their corporate data and applications, from e-mail to specialised tax software.All this is possible because PKF, a UK-based firm of accountants and business advisers, decided to design its IT systems using an architecture known as thin client. This thin-client approach is expected to play an important role in enterprises’ strategies to adopt flexible working practices.Around three years ago, PKF decided to redesign its systems to replace separate servers in its 20 UK branches with a centralised cluster of servers. Rather than running on PCs, applications run on the central servers. Users access them through a web browser, using software from Citrix Systems.Reduced support costs are one of the main benefits. “Since it has been installed, we need fewer IT staff. We are now supporting one central set of equipment,” says Jim Greenfield, IT director of PKF. “While that takes more effort than one office did, it takes much less than looking after 20 sets of equipment.”As a side benefit, PKF’s use of the thin client makes it much easier to adopt flexible working practices. “The fact that we are thin client makes any kind of remote access much, much easier – you have everything in one place,” says Mr Greenfield.The main use for this is for people working at home over broadband, either on laptops or on their home computers. But PKF staffers have used it remotely, in airports, web cafes, PCs in client premises, or WiFi hotspots.“It can literally run on any connection,” says Mr Greenfield. “Someone once ran it on an interactive television in a hotel room in Australia.”Using thin client for flexible working eliminates many of the headaches that come with supporting a mobile workforce. All the data is stored on central servers, so if a device gets stolen or lost, none of the company’s data risks falling into the wrong hands.The entire fleet of users can be updated at a stroke just by updating the application software on the servers.It is also a popular approach for home working, as no corporate data is downloaded to vulnerable home computers, or transported between office to home on disks or memory keys.“For many security conscious organisations, this is the only way they will allow home working,” says Darrell Jordan-Smith, vice-president at Sun Microsystems, a big thin-client vendor.Citrix claims to have 50m end-users at about 160,000 organisations worldwide using its thin--client software, and increasingly they are using it to enable flexible working schemes.“As many as 20 per cent of those are using it for some kind of home or flexible working, for some of their workers,” says David Jones, senior vice-president at Citrix.Thin-client vendors such as Wyse Technology, Citrix, Tarantella and Sun are all promoting their solutions for mobile workers, as are mobile companies, including Vodafone and Nokia.“Instead of us trying to convince people to adopt thin client for mobility, they are coming to us and asking us to make it possible,” says Curt Schwebke, chief technology officer at Wyse.Vendors are also developing mobile equivalents of their desktop thin-client terminals. These notebook computers come with a full-size screen and keyboard, but reduced memory, smaller processors, and no hard disk or cooling fan. Fewer parts mean fewer ways for the machine to break down, and promise lower power consumption.Tadpole Computer recently launched a laptop version of Sun’s SunRay thin-client terminal, called the Comet, and Wyse is preparing a product for launch later this year.However, the thin-client approach depends on having a reliable connection between the client and the server. High bandwidth isn’t essential, but without a reliable and consistent connection, a true thin client is unusable.“From the point of view of technological elegance, thin client is the ideal solution for mobility,” says Michael Daseke, global sales and marketing alliance lead for mobility at consulting firm Accenture.“We see a desire by global enterprises to go thin client, for all the benefits that brings. My current client wants to go thin client but they can’t get their data, because the network isn’t there.”Most home broadband systems are good enough, but for the moment, mobile data networks are not. Users can not depend on having a connection everywhere they go. To solve this, applications can be designed to store a certain amount of information on the device, allowing it to run while offline. The data can then be synchronised with the central server next time it connects.Though not strictly a thin client architecture, this approach works for many applications, notably the BlackBerry e-mail device. However, this approach dilutes many of the benefits of running a genuine thin client over mobile.The problems of storing data on easily lost devices reappears, and the devices have to be larger and more sophisticated, and hence more expensive to support.For Mr Jones of Citrix, going fully thin client is the only reasonable strategy. “We are moving to a world where everyone is online all the time. So why compromise?” he says.However, network performance and coverage have a long way to go. Mr Daseke of Accenture predicts that it will take three to four years to reach a level where users can assume an almost ubiquitous connection.Doubts linger over the price of mobile access, too. “We will be looking at 3G but there are concerns about long-term costs. We really have to see the benefits from it,” says Mr Greenfield of PKF.Compelling though it is in theory, thin client for mobile will have to wait for ubiquitous and affordable mobile coverage before it really takes off. It could be a long wait.
