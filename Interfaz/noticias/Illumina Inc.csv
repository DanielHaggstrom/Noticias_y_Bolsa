0;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-01-03T16:58:05Z;Illumina and Pacific Biosciences call off merger;Mooted $1.2bn deal halted after scrutiny by UK and US competition watchdogs;DNA sequencing company Illumina called off a $1.2bn merger with smaller rival Pacific Biosciences on Thursday following scrutiny of the deal by competition watchdogs in the UK and the US who feared the two could become too dominant in their field.San Diego-based Illumina said the two had mutually agreed to abandon the mooted deal, first announced in November 2018, as a result of “the lengthy regulatory approval process” and “continued uncertainty” over its outcome.The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority and the Federal Trade Commission in the US had both stepped up their investigations last year due to concerns over the deal’s impact on the market in DNA sequencing.DNA sequencers, first commercialised in the late 1980s, are used to analyse the genetic make-up of humans and other species for use in clinical testing, disease research and drug development. Illumina’s DNA sequencing technologies are deployed in areas including oncology and personalised medicine.Illumina has about an 80 per cent share of the DNA sequencing market globally and controls 90 per cent of the market in the UK, according to the CMA. The merger with PacBio would have given it an almost 100 per cent market share in the UK.Shares in Illumina opened 1.4 per cent lower on Friday, while shares in PacBio, which is also based in California, opened 0.2 per cent lower.The CMA, which deepened its inquiry in July last year, provisionally found that the deal would result in a significant loss of competition because of the small number of rivals in the market and could lead to a worse service and higher prices. It said PacBio was one of Illumina’s closest competitors and vice versa and pointed out that the companies’ internal documents often referred to each other as competitive threats.The FTC also moved to block the deal last year and was working closely with the CMA to monitor its progress.In December the FTC said it feared that Illumina was using the merger to unlawfully maintain its monopoly in the US market for next-generation DNA sequencing. It added that the proposed acquisition was “illegal because it may substantially lessen competition” in the market for genetic sequencing by eliminating current competition and preventing future competition between Illumina and PacBio.On Friday Illumina said its proposed tie-up with PacBio would have “broadened access to Pacific Biosciences sequencing technology, significantly expanded and accelerated innovation, and ultimately increased the clinical utility and impact of sequencing”.Michael Hunkapiller, chief executive of PacBio, said: “We are disappointed that our customers and other stakeholders will not realise the powerful advantages of integrating the sequencing capabilities of our two companies.”
1;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2018-07-30T20:38:51Z;Illumina shares lit up by earnings beat, outlook raise;;Growing demand for genomic information and applications saw diagnostics company Illumina soar past analysts’ expectations in the second quarter and boost its forecast for full-year sales growth and earnings.Shares of the California-based company rose 7.2 per cent in Monday after-hours trade following its earnings report for the three months to July 1.The company said that revenue rose 25 per cent year-over-year to $830m, while net income came in at $209m, or $1.41 a diluted share, up from $121m, or 87 cents, in the year-ago period.Analysts had expected revenue of $787m on net income of $163m, or $1.01 a share, according to Factset.Illumina’s president and chief executive, Francis deSouza, credited the performance to “broad demand across applications, systems and geographies” for its products, which include tools to analyse genetic variations and functions.“Sequencing consumables, array consumables, and lab and other services each grew more than 30% compared to the second quarter of 2017, highlighting the growing interest in genomic information and its application to research, clinical and consumer markets,” he added.The strength of its second quarter prompted Illumina to raise its full-year forecasts. It is now looking for revenue to grow 20 per cent year-over-year in fiscal 2018, and earnings per share between $5.10 and $5.20. It had previously predicted revenue growth between 15 and 16 per cent and earnings per share of $4.45 to $4.55.After rising 70.6 per cent in 2017, Illumina shares are up 32.38 per cent so far in 2018.
2;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2017-08-01T21:31:02Z;Illumina rises as its boosts forecast, posts earnings beat;;Diagnostics company Illumina saw its shares climb in after-hours trading after it raised its revenue growth forecast due to stronger-than-expected demand for its NovaSeq sequencing platform and posted quarterly earnings above Wall Street forecasts.The California-based company on Tuesday said that interest in the NovaSeq platform — which debuted in January, with the expectation that it could one day lower the cost of sequencing a human genome to $100 — had helped it to a strong showing in the second quarter. Illumina also signalled that it expected interest in the platform to continue in the months ahead.Chief executive and president Francis deSouza said:“Interest in the NovaSeq platform exceeded our expectations during the quarter. As a result, we have updated our 2017 revenue growth projections to reflect the market demand for NovaSeq and our positive outlook for the rest of the business.”Its full-year guidance for earnings per diluted share attributable to its stockholders has now been lifted to a range of $5.36-$5.46, a dime higher than its previous guidance for $5.26-$5.36. It has also tightened its full-year revenue growth target to 12 per cent, from its previous range of 10 to 12 per cent.The rosier outlook was accompanied by a better-than-expected round of earnings, which saw the company’s revenue rise 10 per cent year-on-year to $662m, beating expectations for $642.5m from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income attributable to Illumina shareholders was $128m, or 82 cents per diluted share, versus forecasts for $85m profit, or 58 cents per share.The news sent the company’s shares 9.5 per cent higher in after-hours trading on Tuesday.
3;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2016-11-10T17:42:39Z;Siemens: healthy cynicism;Separating the healthcare unit makes sense. Announcing it now does not;"Why announce that a business is to be separately listed but provide no detail on timing, free float or method of separation? Perhaps to engineer a share price pop. If that was the intention, it certainly worked for Siemens.On Thursday, the German conglomerate said (alongside full-year results that featured a warning on 2017 revenue growth) that it would float its medical division. Its shares duly hit their highest level since 2000. The decision is hardly unexpected; medical has been run as an independent entity since 2014, and in May was christened Siemens Healthineers in one of the year’s most lampooned rebrandings. Cynicism aside, though, the separation makes sense and should help move the unit into higher-growth areas.The mainstay of Healthineers is imaging and diagnostics, typically large, expensive pieces of kit sold to hospitals. Revenue growth has been fairly pedestrian but operating margins have expanded nicely, from 10 per cent five years ago to 17 per cent now. An area where growth is more exciting is molecular diagnostics, but valuations in this field are racier — Illumina, pursued in 2013 by Swiss pharma group Roche, trades at a heady six times forecast sales. Listing Healthineers separately will give it an acquisition currency of its own.Valuation is tricky, since the most relevant peers are themselves divisions of other conglomerates such as General Electric or Toshiba, and because the future capital structure of Healthineers is — guess what? — undecided. Less exact US comparators such as Hologic and Varian trade at enterprise values equivalent to 11-12 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. On that basis (and assuming that Healthineers’ share of group net debt is in line with its contribution to profit) then the company could have an equity value of €25bn. That is more than the combined value of Osram Licht and Infineon, earlier Siemens offspring.Separating Healthineers, along with the already announced combination of its wind power division with Gamesa of Spain, would leave Siemens as an ABB-style engineer with (likely controlling) stakes in listed medical and green energy companies. That would make it easier to value and allow management to focus on the main industrial businesses. One plea, though: please call the separated medical business something other than Healthineers.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
4;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Healthcare clocks sharpest decline in broad S&P 500 sell-off;;Tuesday turned out to be an ugly day for US stocks with a trifecta of problems — namely, a gloomy start to earnings season, strengthening expectations of a rate rise this year and a drop in oil prices — sending the S&P 500 1.4% lower.But healthcare took the hardest hit.A more than 25 per cent tumble in shares of gene sequencing company Illumina, which issued disappointing earnings outlook, saw the healthcare sector lead the decline on the benchmark S&P 500 with a 2.3 per cent drop.Meanwhile, a 1.5 per cent drop in Brent, the global oil benchmark, to $52.33 a barrel, saw the energy sector fall 1.1 per cent.Dividend paying telecoms, which are interest rate sensitive but not as expensive as utilities, posted the slimmest losses on the S&P 500, sliding just 0.2 per cent.
5;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2016-10-11T17:43:49Z;Illumina shares slide on sales ‘credibility gap’;US stocks retreat as healthcare sector posts heaviest losses;Illumina shares shed more than $6bn in market value after it warned that its third-quarter sales were likely to come in below its own forecast and Wall Street’s because of a drop in revenue from its high-speed genetic sequencing devices.The diagnostics group said that it expects sales in the third quarter to have risen 10 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $607m, compared with an earlier estimate of $625m-$630m. That was also shy of analyst expectations of $628m.Illumina said the shortfall in revenue came as a result of a bigger than expected year-on-year dip in sales of high-throughput sequencing instruments, or devices that can analyse a very high number of DNA molecules at the same time.“We are clearly disappointed,” said chief executive Francis deSouza in a conference call, adding that “returning to the level of predictability that our stakeholders expect is my top priority as CEO, and you have my commitment that we are focused on achieving this goal”.Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted that the disappointing results create a “widening credibility gap”.That adds to concerns that the research market that uses the gene sequencing machines “looks increasingly saturated”, while start-ups are challenging the company in the cancer diagnostic segment, the investment bank said.Shares in the California-based company fell 24.8 per cent to $138.99, marking one of the stock’s biggest falls on record.On the other side of the spectrum, Apple shares rise for a second day as rival Samsung’s woes deepened.Samsung was forced to stop selling the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone on consumer safety grounds.The problems for the South Korea-based company could be good news for Apple, as it is expected to reduce competition against the iPhone, the group’s biggest source of revenue.“We see a more favourable competitive landscape and higher Android switcher rates for [Apple] over the next 12-18 months as Samsung’s issues may weigh on future product launches and given [Apple’s] strong potential offerings”, said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA Research.Apple shares climbed 0.2 per cent on Tuesday, adding to a 1.7 per cent gain in the previous session, bringing them to $116.30.Looking more broadly, the markets were in the red by close of trading. The S&P 500 was down 1.2 per cent to 2,136.73, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 1.1 per cent to 18,128.66 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.5 per cent to 5,246.79.The S&P 500 healthcare sector posted the heaviest losses, led by the plunge in Illumina shares.The materials sector was also under pressure as Alcoa, the US aluminium group, skidded 11.4 per cent to $27.91 after revealing quarterly profits and sales that missed analyst estimates.The disappointing results from Alcoa marked a gloomy start to third-quarter earnings season, which is forecast to show yet another year-on-year fall in corporate profits.Several large lenders, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, are set to report results on Friday.
6;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;S&P falls 1% as US stocks extend declines;;A downbeat start to earnings season, strengthening expectations of a rate rise this year and a renewed sell-off in crude all combined to see US stocks extend their declines on Tuesday.By late morning, the S&P 500 was 1 per cent lower at 2,141.61, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.9 per cent to 18,159.51. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.2 per cent to 5,264.77.While speaking at an event in Sydney, Chicago Fed president Charles Evans said “policy could well be changing soon”. Following his remarks, federal funds futures put 67.6 per cent odds of a rate rise in December, compared with 64.3 per cent on Friday.Meanwhile, a renewed sell-off in crude also drove energy shares 0.9 per cent lower.And finally, a downbeat start to earnings season also proved a drag for US stocks. Gene sequencing firm Illumina was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500, falling 26 per cent to $137.32. Investors soured on the company after it warned that its third-quarter sales would miss analysts’ forecasts and fall short of its own estimates because of a bigger-than-expected drop in revenue from its high-volume genetic sequencing instruments.Aluminium maker Alcoa also added to the glum start to earnings after posting disappointing third quarter results.
7;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Illumina tumbles 25% after sales warning;;Illumina shares plummeted by a quarter after it warned on Monday that its third-quarter sales were likely to come in below its own forecast and Wall Street’s due to a drop in revenue from a type of genetic sequencing instrument.The diagnostic group said that it expects sales in the third quarter to have risen 10 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $607m, compared with an earlier estimate of $625m – $630m. That was also shy of analyst expectations of $628m.Illumina said the shortfall in revenue came as a result of a bigger-than-expected year-on-year dip in sales of high-throughput sequencing instruments, or devices that can analyse a very high number of DNA molecules at the same time.Shares of the California-based company fell as much as 26 per cent in after hours trading. They were down by 3.7 per cent for 2016 as of Monday’s close.
8;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-25T00:51:32+0000;President raises patient and business hope for cancer treatment;Many experts believe a new type of drug promises to revolutionise treatment;When Jimmy Carter was diagnosed last year with melanoma that had spread to his brain, many people feared the worst for the oldest living US president.Yet four months after making his condition public, he revealed that the cancer had disappeared. By March this year, doctors were confident enough to give him the all-clear. “So I’m not going to have any more treatment,” he told the Sunday school class he teaches in his home town of Plains, Georgia.Mr Carter, 91, is one of the latest beneficiaries of a new drug type which many scientists, medics and pharmaceuticals executives believe is destined to transform the treatment of cancer. Until recently, advanced melanoma would have been a near-certain death sentence. That has begun to change since the arrival of Keytruda, the drug by Merck of the US given to Mr Carter, and a rival product, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo.Both are so-called PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors, which work by disabling the mechanism used by cancer to evade the immune system. Robbed of this defence shield, tumours are exposed to attack by disease-fighting T-cells.These are among the first of a category of “ immunotherapies” which use varied techniques to help the body fight back against cancer. Some researchers have likened them to the antiretroviral drugs which have turned HIV into a manageable chronic condition.“The excitement is warranted because of the extent to which we are seeing very durable responses — people with very advanced cancers surviving for many years,” says Sir Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK.This is good news for patients and investors. Cancer immunotherapies are forecast to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenues over coming years, helping the industry rebound from recent patent expiries on many older drugs. Keytruda and Opdivo are, together, generating more than $300m of sales every month and several similar products are nearing market.Researchers caution against seeing “ immuno-oncology” as a miracle cure. Keytruda and Opdivo have so far been used mainly against melanoma and a type of lung cancer — and less than a third of people with those conditions respond to treatment. “There are still a number of very significant questions,” says Sir Harpal. “The most important is why only a relatively small population benefits. How can we pinpoint who will benefit and who won’t and why?”Pharma companies believe that they are starting to find answers. Data to be published at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which starts today in Chicago, are expected to show progress in extending checkpoint inhibitors into a wider range of cancers. Researchers are experimenting with drug cocktails that combine immunotherapy and other approaches with the aim of raising response rates.8mThe number of people killed by cancer every year worldwide“We are at the beginning of the immuno-oncology era and only starting to understand the complexities of the tumour ecosystem,” says Chris Boshoff, head of early development in immuno-oncology for Pfizer. “Finding the right combinations is going to be key.”By 2025, most cancer patients will receive some kind of immunotherapy as part of their treatment in much the same way as chemotherapy is standard today, according to Mr Boshoff.Paul Workman, chief executive of the UK-based Institute of Cancer Research, does not dispute such forecasts but questions whether it is sensible for so many drug companies, including Roche, AstraZeneca and Pfizer, to be developing checkpoint inhibitors to rival Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb.“I’m genuinely excited [by immuno-oncology] but the pendulum has probably swung too far,” he says. “A certain number of companies competing for the best PD-1 is good but do we need 20?”The excitement is warranted because of the extent to which we are seeing very durable responsesImmunotherapy is not the only scientific breakthrough improving patient prospects. Just as important could be advances in diagnostic technology leading to earlier, more accurate detection. “Liquid biopsies” which can identify DNA shed by tumours into the bloodstream could make it possible to spot cancer long before symptoms show.Among the pioneers of this technology is the Californian company Grail, spun-out of genomic sequencing group Illumina and backed by investors including Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Illumina president Francis deSouza says better diagnostics can save lives and money. “Treating cancer at stage one is much cheaper than treating it late.”Containing the cost of cancer is an increasing problem for health systems around the world. The disease kills some 8m people a year worldwide — 13 per cent of all deaths — with cases forecast to grow by 70 per cent over the next 20 years, says the World Health Organisation.$1bnCost of US government ‘cancer moonshot’ search for curesMuch of the increase will come among the rapidly ageing populations of newly-industrialised countries such as China.Health activists complain that the benefits of immunotherapy will remain out of the reach of most patients around the world because of their high cost. Keytruda and Opdivo are both priced at about $12,500 per month in the US.French scientists have carried out the first human trial of an ultrasound device that pushes drugs through the “blood-brain barrier”, potentially clearing a big obstacle to using chemotherapy on brain tumours. Clive Cookson, the FT’s science editor, tells John Murray-Brown how it works. Music by David SappaProf Workman says new approaches to research and development are needed to improve affordability. He highlights the approval last year of Tagrisso, an AstraZeneca drug which took two and a half years from first clinical trials to launch, compared with the decade or more the process has usually taken.Tagrisso is targeted at lung cancer patients with a particular genetic mutation, allowing for smaller, faster trials than those for one size-fits-all medicines. “This opens the potential to fundamentally change the economics of R&D,” says Prof Workman.The US government this year launched a $1bn “cancer moonshot” programme to support the push for new approaches. The project is spearheaded by US vice-president Joe Biden, whose son, Beau, died last year from brain cancer — a reminder of how big a threat the disease remains even as Mr Carter’s survival demonstrates progress.
9;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2016-04-01T05:03:18Z;Whole-genome breakthrough promises tonic for healthcare;Accurately sequencing an individual’s DNA for less than $1,000 is now possible;Commentators have long looked forward to the “thousand-dollar human genome” — the ability to sequence accurately all 3bn letters of an individual’s DNA for less than $1,000. In 2016 it seems likely to happen, 15 years after the completion of the first whole human genome in a decade-long $3bn research programme. The consequences for personalised healthcare could be profound.Veritas Genetics, a Boston start-up company, announced in March the availability of whole genome sequencing together with interpretation and genetic counselling for $999 — the first time the price of a consumer genomics product has fallen below the thousand dollar barrier.George Church, Harvard University genetics professor and co-founder of Veritas, predicts that whole genome sequencing will soon replace the partial DNA sequencing that, at present, dominates genetic testing.“Now that the whole genome is this accessible, it will replace all genetic tests,” he says, “because it is all genetic tests and much, much more.”The tests commercially available today read only a small fraction of the patient’s DNA. They may focus on specific genes known to be involved in a disease, on mutations scattered through the genome or on the “exome”, the part of the human genome containing active genes but not the DNA that controls their activity.These partial DNA testing techniques are still considerably cheaper than whole genome sequencing. In September, for instance, Human Longevity, a San Diego company founded by genomics pioneer Craig Venter, announced a $250 exome sequencing service in collaboration with Discovery, the South African health insurer.Veritas claims, however, that whole genome sequencing catches many clinically important DNA variants that lie outside genes. “The whole genome is the foundation of precision medicine and a lifetime resource to maximise quality of life and longevity,” says Mirza Cifric, the company’s chief executive.While a host of companies such as Veritas and Human Longevity offer genomic services, backed by deep scientific and clinical knowledge about the relationship between genes and health, the instruments they use to read DNA come almost entirely from one source: Illumina. This Californian company’s machines are generating an estimated 90 per cent of the world’s DNA sequence data — thanks to technology acquired in 2007 when Illumina bought Solexa, a spinout from Cambridge university in the UK, for $650m.MinIon is no larger than a mobile phone, fits into the USB port of a laptop computer and costs no more than $1,000Francis deSouza, Illumina’s president who will take over as chief executive in July from the long-serving Jay Flatley, points out that the DNA sequencing market is still in its infancy. “Until now it has been used largely for research,” he says. “The overarching story for the future will be the march of sequencing into the clinic.”The first medical fields likely to be transformed by large-scale genomic diagnosis are prenatal screening for genetic defects in the embryo — and oncology. The concept of the “liquid biopsy”, diagnosing cancer from DNA that has leaked from the tumour into the bloodstream, is one of the hottest topics in oncology and Illumina has set up a subsidiary company, Grail, to exploit the market. Many others are in the field, too.Although the cost of DNA sequencing per genome has fallen sharply, the machines are still big and expensive. This year Illumina launches its smallest and cheapest sequencer so far, the $49,500 MiniSeq, and it has promised a new machine called Firefly for late next year at a price below $30,000.For a radically smaller, cheaper and more portable DNA reader, researchers can turn to the recently introduced MinIon from Oxford Nanopore, a start-up from Oxford university that focuses on a quite different technology: nanopore sequencing. MinIon is no larger than a mobile phone, fits into the USB port of a laptop computer and costs no more than $1,000 (though consumable reagents add to the running expenses).The technology employs a microscopic hole within bacterial proteins — the nanopore — to act as a biosensor. A voltage is applied across the pore and, as DNA moves through it, the electric current changes in a way that distinguishes between the four biochemical “letters” of the genetic code: G, A, T and C. This direct electronic reading is quite different from the “sequencing by synthesis” technology developed by Illumina, which attaches fluorescent molecular tags to the DNA and uses a computerised camera to read the results.MinIon has the advantage over its competitors of portability, which has enabled many scientists to use it in the field for identifying viruses and bacteria, plants and animals, from their genomes. It cannot come close to the larger Illumina machines for sequencing capacity.Oxford Nanopore’s next offering, the desktop PromethIon being introduced this summer, is a more direct competitor for Illumina. Clive Brown, chief technologist at Oxford Nanopore, says the instrument will begin sequencing human genomes later this year.A court case, however, is currently commanding Oxford Nanopore’s attention. In February Illumina sued the company in the US for allegedly infringing Illumina patents. Although it has no nanopore machines close to commercialisation, Illumina said it “has made substantial investments to obtain licenses and develop the nanopore sequencing technology invented by researchers at the University of Alabama and University of Washington.”Oxford Nanopore, which has an extensive portfolio of nanopore patents from other universities, has issued a robust defence. It accuses Illumina of using the lawsuit “as yet another weapon in its long-running campaign to thwart Oxford Nanopore’s research and commercialisation efforts . . . with the ultimate intent of expanding its already overwhelming monopoly power into the nanopore space, which would be extremely detrimental to competition in the DNA sequencing market”.

Solexa was acquired for $650m in 2007 by Illumina, based in California, which used its technology to become the world’s market leader for reading genes.His new company Cambridge Epigenetix has raised the financing from a number of venture funds including Google’s GV, Wellcome Trust’s Syncona, Sequoia Capital, New Science Ventures and Cambridge Enterprise. Bobby Yerramilli-Rao, a technology entrepreneur, is co-founder and chairman.Cambridge Epigenetix will use Prof Balasubramanian’s recent discovery of techniques for identifying the chemical tags that determine whether or not genes are active in specific cells.“I realised when founding the company that epigenetics was going to be hugely important in medicine,” he says. “I realised too how underprovided the epigenetics research community was with good tools and reagents.”Tom Hulme, GV general partner who has joined the Cambridge Epigenetix board, said: “We’ve seen how the commercialisation of genome sequencing has created incredible opportunities to improve human health, and now the epigenome [the chemical tags that control the genome] holds similar potential. Cambridge Epigenetix is one of the few teams on the planet with the skills and experience to break new ground here.”Scientists have long recognised that the genome, the DNA blueprint for an individual, must be controlled by chemical tags or markers, which determine the activity of genes in different cells in varying circumstances from embryonic development to old age.But only now are researchers such as Prof Balasubramanian beginning to identify these epigenetic tags, which attach to the four chemical letters of the genetic code: G, A, T and C. The three most important tags go by the chemical names of methyl, hydroxymethyl and formyl; they can switch genes on or off in different circumstances.Epigenetic markers may be shortlived or long-lasting — sometimes even passed on to future generations. This heritability has been demonstrated in animal experiments and occasionally in human observations; for example grandchildren of women who were pregnant during great famines such as the Dutch “hunger winter” of 1944-45 show metabolic effects two generations later.Many human diseases, including cancer, and autoimmune and neurological disorders, reflect aberrant epigenetic activity. Some drugs with an epigenetic mechanism — turning off cancer-related genes — are already on the market, including Vidaza and Istodax from Celgene of the US, Zolinza from Merck of the US and Dacogen from Otsuka of Japan. A recent report by Citigroup pharmaceuticals analyst Andrew Baum estimated that the epigenetic oncology market would be worth $10bn a year by 2025.Such projections suggest a large potential market for a company that produces accurate diagnostic tools and technology to accelerate the translation of epigenetics from lab to clinic, according to Geoff Smith, newly appointed chief executive of Cambridge Epigenetix.“Cambridge Epigenetix is ideally positioned to catalyse the market for epigenetics, just as Solexa and Illumina did for genomics a decade ago,” adds Dr Smith, who joined the company from Illumina where he was vice-president for product development."

12;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;DuPont boosted as chief bows out;Chemical company under pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz;DuPont shares surged higher on Tuesday after the company’s chief executive abruptly outlined plans to retire.Ellen Kullman, who has been at the helm of the company since 2009, will exit on October 16. Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont has been under pressure from Nelson Peltz, the leader of activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management, to turn round its performance. Mr Peltz failed in a push earlier this year to secure a seat on the company’s board of directors.The blue-chip chemical company also cut its full-year earnings guidance as a result of a stronger dollar and tougher conditions in its agriculture unit. DuPont now expects full-year earnings of $2.75 a share, down from a previous outlook of $3.10.DuPont’s revenues fell 11 per cent in the second quarter from the year before, while operating earnings per-share ticked up 1 per cent on the same basis.The shares climbed 7.7 per cent to $55.23, cutting the year-to-date loss to about 25 per cent.Elsewhere, Freeport-McMoRan shares rallied 6 per cent to $11.85 after the company revealed plans to explore strategic alternatives for its oil and gas business. The company, which also cut the size of its board of directors, said it was considering a potential spin-off, joint venture or more cost cuts. A previously announced strategy to sell a minority stake in the oil and gas segment in a public offering also remains on the table.Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport-McMoRan is one of the world’s biggest copper producers, but generated about 20 per cent of its overall revenue from its oil and gas business in 2014. Its shares have collapsed by half this year amid the swoon in commodity prices.Skyworks Solutions saw its shares dip 1.4 per cent to $80.71. The semiconductor company, which makes chips for Apple, said late Monday it would buy PMC-Sierra for roughly $2bn in cash. The transaction valued PMC at $10.50 a share, a 36.5 per cent premium to the company’s closing price before the deal was announced.Microsoft shares ticked up by 12 cents to $46.75 after the software group took the wraps off a duo of new smartphones. The company also updated its Surface tablet and Band fitness tracker.The healthcare segment was the biggest laggard of the major S&P 500 sectors. The losses were led by a sell-off in the biotechnology segment.Illumina faced some of the steepest losses on the closely tracked Nasdaq biotechnology index, tumbling 10.6 per cent to $145.81. The pharmaceutical company disclosed after the bell on Monday a full-year sales outlook that missed Wall Street forecasts.On the other side of the spectrum, energy shares were lifted by a rally in the price of brent crude oil. Transocean, one of the biggest offshore drilling contractors, jumped 7.3 per cent to $15.76.

13;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2014-06-05T17:03:16Z;Amazon gains in Nasdaq 100 advance;;The Nasdaq 100, a compilation of the largest companies on the broader Nasdaq index, extended a nearly two-month long ascent, leading US equity markets and returning the index to highs not seen since 2000.Previously hampered by an investor rotation into haven equities, as well as a shift into companies with more economical price-to-earnings valuations, the index has largely recovered since April lows.Amazon, TripAdvisor and Whole Foods, advanced more than 3 per cent on Thursday.Darren Wolfberg, head of US cash equity trading at BNP Paribas, said he expected equity markets to shift higher by the end of the year, although they may do so in fits and starts.Institutional traders have begun to digest the improving economic data in the US, he says, and will eventually have to shift funds out of bonds purchased over the past few years and into other asset classes, including equities.“Investors are still reticent to put money into equities, which indicates to me we are not at a top,” Mr Wolfberg said.The Nasdaq 100 advanced 0.9 per cent to 3,776.95.Many large-cap stocks have also been lifted by corporate buybacks as companies buy on dips, Mr Wolfberg added.The S&P 500 Buyback Index, which measures the top 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratio, touched a record high on Thursday, rising 0.5 per cent to 11,702.89.By close of trading,TripAdvisor gained nearly 4 per cent to $103.03, Amazon climbed 5 per cent to $323.57 and Whole Foods rose 4 per cent to $40.08.The grocer was also buoyed by unconfirmed talk that competitor Publix was eyeing the chain.Rite Aid was among the laggards on the Russell 2000, the small-cap index that remains 6 per cent below its March peak, declining 7 per cent to $7.87.The third-largest US drugstore was under pressure after forecasting first-quarter earnings below Wall Street expectations.The company said it expected to earn between $35m and $45m, or roughly 4 cents per share. Analysts had forecast earnings per share of 8 cents in the first quarter.The company also lowered its full-year earnings guidance to between 30 and 40 cents from as much as 42 cents earlier.PVH, the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, dipped 8 per cent to $120.09 after the company lowered its full-year earnings forecast due to “heightened” discounting.The company said it expected to earn between $7.30 and $7.40 per share, below Wall Street expectations for $7.50.Analysts with Citigroup said store checks and conversations with industry experts indicated “department store traffic was difficult for the majority of PVH’s first quarter, only picking up near the end”.Barnes & Noble rallied after the book retailer said it would partner with Samsung on a co-branded tablet in an effort to revive its flailing Nook e-reader business.The company said it expected to launch the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook tablet in August, ahead of the key holiday sales period.“This will drive cutting edge designs as well as dramatically cut losses in this division,” Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said.Barnes & Noble shares increased 4 per cent to $19.57.Overall, US equity markets advanced as data on jobless claims were indicative of a firming economy and a lack of large-scale lay-offs.Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, noted “current conditions could not be any better”.“Good news this morning on the labour market, current conditions. We don’t see the slack economic conditions that Fed officials see, and unemployment claims don’t either,” Mr Rupkey said.“These are levels we tend to see during robust economic expansions, where any job losses are modest frictional ones in a normal, growing $17tn economy.”The S&P 500 advanced 0.7 per cent to 1,940.46, a record intraday high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 16,836.11.

That has been the pharmaceutical industry’s excuse for a decade of underperformance in the face of a wave of patent expiries. Trailing the market is quite an effort given the collapse in bank shares, although in fairness pharma has held its own in the past year and a half. Is that a buy signal for a global sector that makes lots of cash and has a fair number of defensive qualities? That depends on whether its problems are outweighed by a couple of notable industry positives.The patent cliff aside, the two biggest issues facing global pharma companies are shrinking health budgets and unproductive research and development spending. Neither is new, but the industry response has been patchy. The push into emerging markets is starting to produce results.A feature of Big Pharma’s 2012 quarterly numbers was the pace of revenue growth in emerging against mature markets. But emerging nations account for a fifth of the global pharmaceuticals market – almost as much as Europe. That is not yet reflected in the sector’s global sales.R&D is proving a tougher issue to address, though in fairness things are getting better. Each of the past two years has seen the highest number of drug approvals in the US since 2004. Deutsche Bank estimates that European pharma companies have nearly 60 drugs in the launch pipeline from 2013 to 2015, with peak sales potential of $64bn. That will easily outweigh the estimated $27bn of patent expiry revenue losses those companies face in that period.A less risk-averse regulatory environment helps, as does the fact that pharma companies may just be making better drugs than a decade ago. And do not forget M&A in innovative areas such as biotech and genetics (see Roche’s on-off pursuit of Illumina), which should help to cut R&D costs.Large-cap US pharma stocks trade in line with the market; their peers in Europe enjoy a small premium. Investors have good reason to recall past underperformance, but it is time to look beyond the patent cliff.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
15;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-04-12T08:52:56Z;Roche persists with Illumina chase;;Roche on Thursday sent its third letter to Illumina shareholders, repeating its readiness to improve its takeover offer, as strong diagnostic sales in the first quarter reflected the Swiss pharmaceuticals group’s growth potential.Severin Schwan, chief executive, repeated Roche’s $51 a share offer, valuing the US gene sequencing group at $6.7bn, saying the price was “more than adequate”. But he confirmed Roche might go higher if allowed due diligence and claimed not to be perturbed that the company had so far been tendered only a minimum number of Illumina shares.“It is typical that shares are tendered only at a very late stage,” he said in a conference call, noting that a large proportion of Illumina’s stock was held by a relatively small number of investors, and that Roche had conducted “several discussions” with relevant owners.“Illumina has to date not provided any quantitative support for their aggressive growth assumptions. We believe that their long-term growth expectations are unrealistic,” he said in a statement.“If Illumina were to engage with us, we would consider any information supporting Illumina`s contention that our offer undervalues the company and its prospects.”Illumina has consistently rejected Roche’s offers as too low and, most recently, cited reports by three US proxy advisory groups supporting its stance.Mr Schwan declined to discuss how Roche might react if its alternative slate of directors, proposed for Illumina’s shareholders’ meeting next week, were not approved. Illumina’s general meeting is due in New York on April 18, and analysts remain mixed on whether the Swiss group might come out with a surprise or walk away if unsuccessful.The comments came as Roche reported that first-quarter sales fell 1 per cent to SFr11bn ($12bn), hit by restricted health spending and the strength of the Swiss franc. In constant currency terms sales rose 2 per cent in the period, in line with market expectations.But while sales in the core pharmaceuticals division declined 1 per cent to SFr8.6bn (and rose 2 per cent in constant currency terms), sales in diagnostics, Roche’s smaller second division into which Illumina would be integrated, remained stable at SFr2.4bn, climbing 4 per cent at constant exchange rates.The respectable first quarter prompted Mr Schwan to reaffirm the group’s financial targets for 2012, with the prospect of low to mid single-digit sales growth at constant exchange rates for both the group and the pharmaceuticals division.Roche’s drug sales remained resilient thanks to the group’s focus on cancer treatments, where its Avastin and Herceptin products have gained significant market share.Avastin sales rose 1 per cent to SFr1.4bn in the first quarter, a turnround from a recent slip caused by regulatory restrictions in certain indications.
16;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-04-10T16:11:34Z;Roche and Illumina remain at loggerheads;;Roche and Illumina remained at loggerheads on Tuesday, as the $6.7bn battle for control of the US gene sequencing group entered a potentially decisive week.Illumina, which is fighting a hostile bid from Roche, ignored the Swiss pharmaceuticals group’s hint last week that it might improve terms if allowed due diligence, and instead highlighted backing from a further US proxy advisory group.Illumina said Glass Lewis had added its voice to that of two other leading proxy advisory companies supporting the board’s recommendation that shareholders reject Roche’s proposals.Roche declined to comment on the latest twist. A company official said the group stood by its statement of last week, when it hinted its improved $51-a-share offer might be further sweetened if it were allowed access to Illumina’s books.Roche has called on Illumina investors to support an alternative slate of directors for the board, with the two sides set for a showdown at Illumina’s shareholders’ meeting on April 18.Jay Flatley, Illumina’s chief executive, highlighted the latest backing for his position.“We are very pleased that all three of the leading proxy advisers – Institutional Shareholder Services, Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones – have now recommended that their clients support the re-election of Illumina’s slate of directors and vote against all of Roche’s proposals at Illumina’s upcoming Annual Meeting,” he said.“The simple fact remains that Roche’s unsolicited offer clearly undervalues Illumina and that our highly qualified and experienced directors are best positioned to create value for Illumina’s stockholders,” he added.The latest rejection comes in spite of suggestions by European equity analysts that Roche’s hint of an additional improvement in its offer might finally unlock the door to a negotiated deal.However, based on the last published figures, Roche’s bargaining position remains weakened by the fact that it has so far amassed only a minimal number of Illumina shares in its tender offer.Glass Lewis’s comments echo the report last week from Institutional Shareholder Services, which said Roche’s current bid “does not provide meaningful compensation for the potentially enormous long-term opportunity shareholders would forgo by selling at this point.”Roche shares were down 0.63 per cent at SFr156.50 in late afternoon trading.
17;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-04-07T00:10:47Z;Roche looks at raising bid for Illumina;;Roche, the Swiss drug company, said on Friday it might consider raising its bid to acquire Illumina, the US genetic sequencing company that has rebuffed its previous takeover offers.Severin Schwan, Roche chief executive, said the group would “remain willing to consider additional value if given the opportunity to enter discussions and perform due diligence”.The statement came in response to a report from Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday that said Roche’s current bid of $51 a share, or $6.7bn, “does not provide meaningful compensation for the potentially enormous long-term opportunity shareholders would forgo by selling at this point”.Roche in January made an unsolicited $5.7bn bid for Illumina that was rejected as insufficient.On Monday Roche stepped up its offer for Illumina with a bid that it said represented an 88 per cent premium above Illumina’s closing stock price on December 21 2011. Illumina quickly rejected the offer, calling it “opportunistic” and not reflective of its strength or future prospects.ISS, a proxy advisory group, agreed with Illumina, pointing to the “vast” potential for genetic sequencing and the lack of competition.It also said Illumina should be concerned about “unnecessary truncation of value by selling the company at too low a valuation of its future”.Roche has put forward candidates for Illumina’s board ahead of its April 18 shareholder meeting.The Swiss suitor said it was disappointed in the ISS recommendation that Illumina shareholders vote against its board nominees, and challenged the group’s assertion that the bid was not a fair starting point for negotiations.
18;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-04-02T20:42:29Z;Illumina rejects latest Roche offer;;Roche has reacted angrily to Illumina’s rejection of its improved takeover offer as the rhetoric between the US gene sequencing group and its Swiss suitor escalated ahead of Illumina’s annual shareholders meeting on April 18.Expressing “disappointment” at Monday night’s unanimous rejection by Illumina’s board of directors, Roche said that “by not engaging with Roche, Illumina reinforces the notion” of an entrenched board.“We are disappointed that Illumina’s board of directors has rejected Roche’s increased $51 cash offer and continues to rebuff our attempts to engage in substantive discussions,” said Severin Schwan, Roche’s chief executive.“Roche’s increased offer is highly attractive. By not engaging with Roche, Illumina reinforces the notion that its board and management are determined to preserve their positions rather than maximise shareholder value.”Pointing to Illumina’s forthcoming shareholders’ meeting, Mr Schwan said: “We expect that Illumina shareholders will see the substantial value in our increased offer, conclude that there is absolutely no justification for Illumina’s current directors’ refusal to begin discussions with Roche and vote their shares for the Roche director nominees.”Roche’s position remains weakened, however, because so far very few Illumina shareholders have accepted its tender offer, leaving the Swiss group with only a minimal amount of the US group’s stock ahead of the April 18 meeting, at which Roche has put forward new candidates for the board.Roche’s reaction followed Monday’s night’s description by Illumina’s board of its latest offer as “opportunistic”. The US group added that “even the revised offer does not reflect the intrinsic strength or future prospects of Illumina”.In a letter to Franz Humer, Roche’s chairman, Jay Flatley, Illumina’s president and chief executive, said the offer, valuing the US diagnostics group at about $6.7bn, “dramatically undervalues Illumina and does not adequately reflect Illumina’s singular position in an industry poised for extraordinary growth”.Mr Flatley, drawing from Roche’s own remarks, pointed to his company’s strong generation of revenues, profit and cash and a record of delivering continual upgrades in technology to the market.Analysts in Switzerland said they were not surprised by Illumina’s rejection, which they took as an attempt to squeeze still better terms out of Roche after last week’s increased offer. Roche has argued the offer is already fully priced and warned of the risks to Illumina of rejection.Referring to extensive contacts with Illumina’s biggest shareholders in a letter accompanying Roche’s improved offer, Mr Humer said his group had detected a strong wish among Illumina shareholders to accelerate the takeover process after “a number of productive discussions” with Illumina shareholders in recent weeks.“Our revised offer represents a 15 per cent premium to our offer on January 25 2012 and a substantial premium of 88 per cent over Illumina’s closing stock price on December 21 2011, the day before market rumours about a potential transaction between Roche and Illumina drove Illumina’s stock price significantly higher,” he added.Earlier in March, Severin Schwan, Roche’s chief executive, warned Illumina shareholders their company’s growth prospects had diminished over the past year at a time of slowing demand reflected in lower earnings guidance. He said its shares had only held up because of stock market speculation over Roche’s bid.He warned that Illumina alone did not have the scale and infrastructure to expand successfully in diagnostics and had little experience in regulated areas.
19;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Letter from Lex: First quarter break;Some companies would prefer if people stayed indoors more;Some people have been out enjoying early Springtime sunshine, but Microsoft and others would prefer if they stayed indoors. Its aim is to “own the living room” through its Xbox home entertainment hub, but it has tough competition. For one there is the much-touted Apple iTV, which Taiwan’s Hon Hai is well-positioned to take advantage of if it ever arrives after buying a 10 per cent stake in flagging Japanese television maker Sharp. US studio Lions Gate would also like people to stay inside watching Mad Men and The Hunger Games, which made $155m in its opening weekend in the US, so it can pay down its $900m debt.Meanwhile, after a slow first quarter, the M&A market showed signs of life. Swiss pharma group Roche upped its offer for US diagnostics company Illumina to $6.7bn while the world’s largest power utility – GDF Suez – made a £6bn offer for the 30 per cent of International Power it does not already own. In China the first hostile bid by a state-owned enterprise for a domestic company tested new boundaries while India’s Tata group considered increasing its debt even more with a bid for the UK’s Cable & Wireless Worldwide. Elsewhere Rio Tinto joined BHP Billiton by putting its diamond business up for sale while London-listed Indonesian coalminer Bumi sidelined its co-founder in an effort to prove it is more than a shambolic get-rich-quick scheme.And finally, who can forget the banks? Due to regulation following the financial crisis, banks are being forced to concentrate on areas of real prowess and scale, and cut back on areas where they lack expertise. As European banks adjust – the latest example being Caixabank’s €980m takeover of Banca Cívica to create Spain’s largest domestic bank – foreign competitors can smell blood. Eurozone policy makers are hoping that the €700bn firewall they have agreed to will give the region’s economies and banks time to stabilise and recover.John Casey, Lex Publisher
20;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-03-29T19:11:45Z;M&A activity picks up in Europe;;Europe last year was the whipping boy of the global economy and the dealmaking world.The continent’s sovereign debt crisis rattled markets across the world leading to a sharp drop-off in mergers and acquisitions activity in the second half of the year.And the slump has continued into 2012. Dealmaking fell almost 15 per cent from the final quarter of last year, the fifth consecutive quarterly decline.But the moribund European market is twitching. From an abysmally low base at the end of last year, M&A volumes rose about 14 per cent in the first quarter. True, Glencore’s proposed $53bn tie-up with Xstrata helped boost Europe’s numbers.But elsewhere there are signs of life, with Sumitomo spending $7.3bn to snap up the aviation finance business of Royal Bank of Scotland and UPS agreeing a $6.8bn deal with TNT Express of the Netherlands.Advisers argue that the indiscriminate sell-off in European equities created opportunities for those eyeing the market. “Inbound European deals are being driven largely by attractive valuations, reduced levels of uncertainty, and the perception that one has not yet caught up with the other,” says Steve Baronoff, chairman of global M&A at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Other buyers, such as Cisco in its $5bn deal for video software company NDS, are looking for opportunities to deploy overseas cash, which would be taxed if repatriated to the US.“There are US companies who have a lot of cash sitting in Europe, which enables them to tax-efficiently acquire companies that are consistent with their strategic objectives,” says Jacques Brand, co-head of investment-banking coverage and advisory at Deutsche Bank. “There are also European companies that have significant operations in Asia or the emerging markets that are of interest.”Despite a revival in debt markets which has allowed private equity funds to increase the amount of leverage they can use, buyout volumes dropped 36.2 per cent year on year in the first quarter to $41.3bn, writes Anousha Sakoui.“Public to private deals in Europe remain difficult for private equity because of continued differences between buyer and seller price expectations,” says Karen Simon, global co-head of private equity for JPMorgan. “Funds are more focused on the US where it is easier to do public-to-private deals.”The reopening of the IPO market in Europe is giving some funds hope that they will soon be able to float some portfolio companies.“We have started to see an increase in seller-driven activity, as a result of companies reassessing their portfolios, including the potential sale of divisions [and] sponsors considering exits,” says Giuseppe Monarchi, head of Emea M&A at Credit Suisse.But the agreement by Switzerland’s ABB to buy Thomas & Betts in the US for $3.9bn and Roche’s $6bn hostile bid for US diagnostics company Illumina also showed renewed interest from European companies in overseas deals.“We are seeing more Asian and European buyers looking into North America as a platform for growth,” says Chris Ventresca, co-head of North American M&A at JPMorgan. “From more developed overseas markets, growth in North America may look relatively attractive.”The tick-up in Europe is highlighted by a stony silence stateside. The US dominated the first three months of 2011, with seven of the quarter’s top 10 deals an all-American affair. This year, however, only 28 per cent of activity involves the US, down from almost half last year.Some advisers point to a time-lag, arguing the dearth of announcements reflects last year’s European woes. Others suggest that with more businesses coming to the market, a buoyant leveraged finance market and the fading threat of a eurozone meltdown the second half looks promising.“This should be a market in which we see much more robust M&A activity,” says Mr Brand at Deutsche Bank. “Volatility is down, corporates are cash rich, top line growth is slow, therefore mergers that result in expense synergies and opportunities to access new markets inorganically make a lot of sense.”“As confidence broadens, we should see levels picking up further,” says Hermann Prelle, chairman of M&A at UBS. “The M&A market is benefiting from being global. Asian buyers have kept the market going last year and US buyers are increasingly becoming active.”
21;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-03-29T11:39:58Z;Roche / Illumina: time to talk;Swiss pharmaceuticals group raises offer for US diagnostics company;"Severin Schwan is a determined man. The chief executive of Roche Holding will simply not give up on Illumina. Thursday’s revised terms raised the Swiss pharmaceuticals group’s cash offer for its US target by 15 per cent, valuing the genetics company at $6.7bn. But Illumina chief executive Jay Flatley is also playing tough: his studied disdain for Roche’s offer, in the near certainty that it would have to table a better one, is obviously working.Valuing the potential of genomic research is all but impossible, but Roche will not keep raising its offer forever. So Illumina is close to having to recommend the bid before its suitor walks. That said, the Swiss group is still well within its means: free cash flow was nearly SFr14bn in 2011; Goldman Sachs estimates that the company will generate SFr37bn of free cash flow net of dividends and capital expenditure over the next five years. It has little debt, and deep pockets. And Illumina is a good fit: although it would add only 2 per cent to Roche’s revenues, its gene sequencing technology could help to develop new cancer drugs.Even so, the riskier of the two balancing acts probably is Mr Flatley’s. Roche’s revised offer represents an 88 per cent premium to Illumina’s share price before speculation about the Roche deal leaked into the market in late November (although it is still a third below the equally bid-inflated level at which the shares were trading last July). Roche’s offer equates to a tempting forward earnings multiple for Illumina of 34 times, compared with 12 to 14 times for such peers as Life Technologies and Agilent. Some Illumina shareholders are already backing Roche. If Mr Flatley and the board are too intractable, Illumina’s share price has a long way to fall.Illumina says its shareholders should take no action on the revised Roche offer. But the US company’s board should give the terms a thorough hearing. The time for talking is approaching.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
22;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-03-29T08:30:37Z;Roche improves offer for Illumina;;Roche on Thursday made its long-expected improved cash offer for Illumina with a 15 per cent increase to $51 a share, valuing the US diagnostics group at about $6.7bn .“Based on our discussions with Illumina shareholders we have seen interest to accelerate the takeover process,” claimed Severin Schwan, Roche’s chief executive.“Roche’s preference continues to be a negotiated transaction. We look forward to the possibility of a swift completion that offers immediate value to Illumina’s shareholders,” he added.The offer came alongside release of a new letter from Franz Humer, Roche’s chairman, to Jay Flatley, US-based Illumina’s president and chief executive, in which he argued the Swiss group’s move had been prompted by “a number of productive discussions” with Illumina shareholders in recent weeks.“Our revised offer represents a 15 per cent premium to our offer on January 25 2012 and a substantial premium of 88 per cent over Illumina’s closing stock price on December 21 2011, the day before market rumours about a potential transaction between Roche and Illumina drove Illumina’s stock price significantly higher,” he addedRoche expressed confidence the improved terms would bring round Illumina’s board, which has so far strongly resisted the takeover, triggering a proxy battle ahead of a shareholders’ meeting at the US group on April 18.“I strongly hope that you will either agree to commence discussions with us now or remove all obstacles so that your shareholders can make their own determinations about the adequacy of our increased offer,” concluded Mr Humer.Illumina responded by saying it was advising shareholders to “defer taking any action”. It added that its board would review the revised proposal and make a recommendation “in due course”.The Swiss pharmaceutical group’s tactics closely follow its earlier takeover of Ventana, another cutting edge US healthcare group that also strongly resisted acquisition at the outset.In the Illumina case, Roche had previously argued its $44.50 a share cash offer represented “full and fair value”, upping the pressure by sending assorted letters to Illumina investors expressing “disappointment” at the US group’s resistance.Earlier this month, Mr Schwan told Illumina shareholders their company’s growth prospects had diminished over the past year at a time of slowing demand reflected in lower earnings guidance and its shares had only held up because of stock market speculation over Roche’s bid.He warned that Illumina alone did not have the scale and infrastructure to expand successfully in diagnostics and had little experience in regulated areas.Illumina’s own letter to shareholders noted: “Roche Holding Ltd – an Illumina competitor with a record of pursuing hostile acquisitions – is trying to buy Illumina at a lowball price and capture our future growth and value potential for its own stockholders.”
23;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-03-27T23:13:27Z;Investment banking: David versus Goliath;Boutique banks are closing the gap on their bulge-bracket rivals in a difficult market – and squeezing those in the middle;In the past year, the long-predicted shakeout in the investment banking sector has begun in earnest.Bulge-bracket banks in particular have slashed costs, cut jobs and disposed of businesses amid a sharp drop in revenues, tighter regulatory pressure and the need to shore up their capital cushions.But behind this frenzy of cuts and business-model adjustments, a long-term and fundamental trend is coming back to the fore: the perennial fight between smaller boutique advisers and their bulge-bracket rivals has picked up pace.While it is far from clear which group will eventually emerge as the winner, it does seem that investment banking’s Davids are gaining ground against the Goliaths.The trend is apparent in a number of business segments, from mergers and acquisitions to brokerage and fixed-income trading.Take M&A: in January this year, the takeover and merger market saw a brutal drop in revenues and fees, with global announced deal value falling to the lowest level seen for nearly a decade.But for some independent advisory firms such as Greenhill and Moelis, the start of the year shaped up to be a fairly good one. Both boutiques managed to crack the top-10 league table in January, pushing some of their much larger rivals to lower ranks. Greenhill’s advisory of Swiss drugmaker Roche’s $5.7bn takeover of Illumina, the US genetic diagnostic company, catapulted it into the top 10 after ranking only 122nd globally in the same period of the year before.Other smaller, independent advisory firms have achieved similar successes in the past year. Perella Weinberg last year blindsided US bulge-bracket banks with its role advising NYSE Euronext on the exchange operator’s attempted tie-up with Deutsche Börse, which ultimately failed due to antitrust issues.And Evercore has grown so fast in the past few years that the US firm’s founder, Roger Altman, a former deputy US Treasury secretary, refuses to label it a “boutique” any longer. In the past year, its revenues surpassed $500m for the first time in its 16-year history, boosted by its advisory role on high-profile deals such as Kinder Morgan’s $37.6bn takeover of rival energy group El Paso.A 2009 presentation from Evercore highlighted the long-term trend: in the US, those firms labelled by the firm as boutiques have increased their M&A advisory market share against Wall Street’s bulge bracket from 3 per cent in 2000 to 16 per cent in 2008 and 2009.Boutique firms argue that the larger banks’ model of providing debt finance alongside M&A advice is prone to conflicts of interest. They also say they are more attractive to work for at a time when large banks are firing staff and sharply reducing bonuses. The bulge-bracket firms are seen as less “fun”, given intense public scrutiny and added layers of bureaucracy in the wake of regulatory pressure on their compliance and risk models.By contrast, boutique firms see themselves as more entrepreneurial, with the individual banker participating directly in the success of the firm and not feeling like a small cog in a big machine.But from a customer perspective, big investment banks often have the advantage of being one-stop shops where clients can get finance, advice and other services in the same place.Some observers say that in reality the fight will once again end with an impasse. A number of both small and larger firms could come out of the crisis stronger, while medium-sized groups might turn out to be the real losers.Analysts say the fixed-income business, one of the big revenue drivers for investment banks since the financial crisis, could see such a bifurcation between the large bulge-bracket companies such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, and a string of new and old smaller firms.Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at JPMorgan, says the trend would mirror what has already happened in equity trading businesses. “There are large global equity houses that provide a whole range of services such as prime brokerage, cash equities [and] equity derivatives with bulge bracket compensation, and then there are small boutiques that are focused and are highly profitable such as Autonomous and Redburn Partners, with high revenue per head,” he wrote in a recent note.“We also note fixed cost is low – as illustrated by the low compensation ratios for Autonomous and Redburn, with profit being paid out to members purely dependent on profit performance. This business model is highly profitable [up] to a certain size of 100-150 people in our view.”With competition increasing and revenues going down, the ones that lose out are the medium-sized banks that have the same pay structures and technological platforms to support as their larger peers, but lack economies of scale.Bill Michael, UK head of financial services at KPMG, the professional services group, says: “The big question for the industry is how it will consistently generate a return on equity above the average cost of capital. This is a very tough ask in the current environment and the challenge for management will be to continue driving down costs to match reduced revenue levels.”Some medium-sized investment banks, such as Japanese Nomura, which took over Lehman Brothers’ European and Asian operations a few years ago, are already cutting costs. Royal Bank of Scotland is scaling back its investment banking by shedding thousands of jobs.

company.The Swiss pharmaceutical group filed its definitive proxy statement and proposed an alternative board of directors, arguing that its $44.50 a share cash offer for Illumina represented “full and fair value”.In a letter to investors, Severin Schwan, Roche’s chief executive, expressed “disappointment” that Illumina’s directors rejected his bid last month, stressing that it represented a 64 per cent premium to the share price ahead of the bid last December.He criticised management’s reluctance to embark on share buybacks, saying its “inaction” had cost the company $390m at the current share price under the terms of 2014 convertible notes, which allowed Illumina’s counterparty banks to buy shares at $31.44 each.Mr Schwan also said Illumina’s growth prospects had diminished over the past year at a time of slowing demand reflected in lower earnings guidance and its shares had only held up because of stock market speculation over Roche’s bid.He warned that Illumina alone did not have the scale and infrastructure to expand successfully in diagnostics and had little experience in regulated areas.In its own letter to shareholders on Monday, Illumina said: “Roche Holding Ltd – an Illumina competitor with a record of pursuing hostile acquisitions – is trying to buy Illumina at a lowball price and capture our future growth and value potential for its own stockholders.”Mr Schwan left open the possibility of more talks with Illumina, stressing that Roche still preferred “voluntary and meaningful discussions” with the board, and hoped Jay Flatley would remain chief executive. “Do not let Illumina silence your voice,” he wrote.
● AstraZeneca has taken a further $50m charge to write off its remaining investment in TC-5214, an experimental anti-depressant, following the failure of late-stage clinical trials with its US partner
Targacept.The move increases pressure to the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical group, adding to speculation that the company will need to launch a major acquisition or itself be bought.The company faces the threat of generic competition on existing drugs, and has suffered late-stage failures. In December, Deutsche Bank said in a research note that 2012 would be a “crunch year” for the company “that could well prompt a change in group strategy”."
25;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Oxford Nanopore unveils mini-DNA reader;;A young British company has made a powerful entry into one of the fastest-moving and most competitive fields of technology – gene sequencing for science and medicine.Oxford Nanopore, set up in 2005, unveiled on Friday the world’s first miniature DNA sequencer, small enough to fit in the hand.The company says its technology reads the four biochemical letters of DNA more quickly and less expensively than the established companies in the field.The corporate leaders in DNA sequencing are two US companies: Illumina, for which Roche of Switzerland launched a $5.7bn hostile bid last month, and Life Technologies, which made a splash with its recent announcement of a machine that could read a whole human genome – 3bn DNA letters – for just $1,000 in less than a day.What makes Oxford Nanopore’s “strand sequencing” so effective is that it reads the chemical letters on the DNA directly, one by one, as the molecule ratchets through a microscopic nanopore – a round protein structure with a hole in the middle. Each letter is recognised by its distinct electrical signal.One advantage of the technique is that it can read much longer strands of DNA than other sequencing methods. Another, said Clive Brown, chief technologist of Oxford Nanopore, is that it requires less sample preparation – making it possible for a doctor to read a patient’s DNA directly from a blood sample in the surgery.Oxford Nanopore said its MINION sequencer, the size of a USB memory stick, would be available commercially this year at a price below $900.Ewan Birney, senior scientist at the European Bioinformatics Institute and a scientific adviser to the company, commented: “If you line up all the characteristics of Oxford Nanopore against the other technologies, they will become the dominant technology – they win.”Gordon Sanghera, chief executive of Oxford Nanopore, said his company aims to grow into a large UK technology champion without being acquired by a larger group.“My management team came into this because we wanted to deliver a strong, independent British technology company,” said Mr Sanghera. “Our shareholder register does not include any venture capital funds that might be looking for a quick exit. We have only long-term investors.”UK financial institutions have put £74m into Oxford Nanopore over six years. IP Group, which has a 23 per cent stake, has been a shareholder from the start.“We share the long-term view of Gordon [Sanghera] and his team,” said Alan Aubrey, chief executive of IP Group. “We believe this is the first truly fundamental and disruptive new technology to emerge in DNA sequencing. It is a fantastic company and a great advert for British science.”A more recent addition to the shareholder base is Invesco Perpetual. “We have come in as patient, long-term investors,” said Neil Woodford, Invesco’s head of investment. “We are prepared to see Oxford Nanopore grow into a large independent company.“On so many occasions the great technology being developed in our universities has not got funding. Then the technology – and its financial upside – has leaked abroad,” Mr Woodford added.The UK has made a big contribution to the international development of gene technology ever since the double helix structure of DNA was discovered in Cambridge almost 60 years ago.Today Illumina depends on technology it acquired when it bought Cambridge-based Solexa in 2007, while Life Technologies uses technology licensed from DNA Electronics, a gene testing company spun out from Imperial College London.
26;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-02-07T23:16:09Z;Illumina rebuffs Roche again;;The US diagnostics company Illumina has rejected Roche’s $5.7bn hostile takeover bid, calling the offer “grossly inadequate” and urging stockholders not to tender their shares.Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company, last month launched an unsolicited bid for Illumina for $44.50 a share in cash, about a 64 per cent premium to the genetic sequencing company’s share price in mid-December.Illumina then adopted a “poison pill” to protect its shareholders, allowing them to buy new common stock if a bidder acquired 15 per cent of the company’s shares. Roche countered last week by proposing a slate of new Illumina directors.In a letter to Roche’s chairman on Tuesday, Illumina said: “After careful consideration, including a thorough review of the terms and conditions of Roche’s tender offer, our board of directors unanimously determined that Roche’s offer is grossly inadequate in multiple respects, dramatically undervalues Illumina and is not in the best interests of Illumina’s stockholders.”Illumina said Roche had failed to accurately value its growth potential and pipeline. Moreover, it argued Roche was trying to capitalise on a dislocation in Illumina’s share price that will be corrected once the company’s research stabilises this year.Roche said it was reviewing Illumina’s response and maintained that its offer was “full and fair”.Shares in Illumina closed down 0.33 per cent to $51.80 on Tuesday. Roche shares were up 2.68 per cent to $44.
27;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-02-01T08:05:19Z;Roche steps up Illumina bid as sales hold up;;Roche spotlighted the potential of diagnostics, traditionally the junior of its two divisions, as sales of testing and other medical equipment last year clearly outpaced the Swiss group’s core pharmaceuticals business.The change of fortunes came as the group stepped up its $5.7bn hostile bid for Illumina, the US manufacturer of genetic testing equipment, by announcing it has proposed a slate of new Illumina directors to be tabled at the next shareholders’ meeting.If accepted, along with an increase in the size of Illumina’s board, directors sympathetic to Roche would comprise a majority of the board.The step came as the group announced that the strong Swiss franc and absence of significant Tamiflu pandemic influenza treatments had pushed down sales at both of its divisions last year. But while group sales dropped 10 per cent year on year to SFr42.5bn (€35.3bn, $46bn) and pharmaceuticals revenues dropped by 12 per cent year on year to SFr32.8bn, sales in diagnostics declined by a more modest 7 per cent to SFr9.7bn.Measured in constant currencies, pharmaceuticals remained static while diagnostics jumped by 6 per cent – “significantly above the market”, said Roche.Net group profits rose by 7 per cent to SFr9.5bn, helped by lower financing costs and a lower tax rate.The healthy annual performance, against an increasingly tough international drugs market, with heavy pressure on pricing amid budget cuts, was broadly in line with market expectatoins. Roche also gave a relatively upbeat outlook for the current year.Sales at group level and for pharmaceuticals were expected to grow by “low to mid single-digit” percentage points. By contrast, diagnostics is expected to expand “above the market”. Core earnings per share are forecast to rise by a “high single-digit” percentage point.“We achieved our sales and earnings targets for the year and also made significant progress with our pipeline,” said Severin Schwan, chief executive.While currency factors played a significant role in damping reported sales, the group noted profits were slightly less affected, as some 80 per cent of costs are incurred outside Switzerland. Analysts predict adverse exchange rate factors should have less impact on all Swiss groups this year, following the decision last September by the central bank to hold down the value of the franc.Roche said margins had also been boosted by improved efficiency and cost savings, with the core group operating margin up 0.7 percentage points to 35.6 per cent, while the core operating profit margin in pharmaceuticals rose by 1 percentage point thanks to efficiency improvements.The group said it had completed the bulk of its plan to eliminate 4,800 jobs, although net employment was down only about 2,000 because of new hiring in diagnostics and for pharmaceuticals in China. Cost savings so far had reached about SFr1.8bn.Financial costs were also down as the group further reduced the $48bn in debt assumed to buy out minority interests in Genentech in the US. By the end of last year Roche had paid off 42 per cent of the total.
28;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-01-29T17:11:30Z;Sluggish start to year for M&A volumes;;Dealmaking has had its slowest start to a year for nearly a decade as companies’ appetite for mergers and acquisitions remains suppressed by the uncertain outlook for the global economy.M&A volumes have been at their lowest levels since 2003, with $102.9bn worth of deals announced globally so far this year – nearly half the level at the same time last year, according to data provider S&P Capital IQ.The muted start comes as some bankers say this year may not improve much on 2011 as the sovereign debt crisis continues to create market volatility. “We are expecting this year to be softer overall across investment banking,” said Larry Slaughter, co-head of North American investment banking at JPMorgan Chase.“However, our pipeline of activity is up so we expect M&A to increase. Shareholders still prefer companies to grow, either via M&A or organically, rather than return cash to shareholders by dividends or stock buy-backs.”The fall in activity has been most marked in the US, where only $34.2bn of deals have been announced so far this year, when in 2011 the figure was nearly three times that level ($89.1bn). Oil and gas companies accounted for the largest proportion of M&A activity – 16.5 per cent, according to Dealogic.Activity levels are slowest in Europe, with $30.4bn worth of deals announced this year, down by a quarter on last January’s $40.4bn. With takeovers typically taking months to negotiate, dealmakers say the lull reflects volatility in the markets from last autumn when deal talks broke down or were shelved.“Overall, volumes have been fairly anaemic so far in 2012,” said Gary Posternack, head of M&A for the Americas at Barclays Capital. “But the numbers do not really represent the level of activity and, to the extent that we get some stability in the markets, there is room to have a strong second half.”With interest rates low, the cheap cost of funding is helping drive dealmaking. On Friday Eastman Chemical highlighted how cheaply it raised the $3.5bn it needed to buy Solutia, the speciality materials company, paying an expected after-tax rate of about 3 per cent for a mix of five to 30-year debt.Some bankers also note a growing number of so-called hostile deals in recent weeks, a leading indicator for a rebound in M&A. Last week Roche made a $5.7bn hostile bid for Illumina, a genetic sequencing specialist, while Martin Marietta remains in pursuit of construction aggregates rival Vulcan Materials, having launched a $4.8bn hostile bid last year.“Companies feel that M&A needs to play a critical role in driving growth and hostile deals are evidence of confidence among buyers and the pressure to act,” said one dealmaker.
29;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-01-28T00:09:30Z;Investors brace for improved offer from Roche;;Roche this week sought to strengthen its ambitions in “targeted medicine” with a hostile $5.7bn bid for Illumina of the US, which specialises in analysing DNA.The Swiss pharmaceutical group, a leader in oncology and other biological medicines through its US subsidiary Genentech, has increasingly seen the need to ensure its medicines are accompanied by diagnostics that ensure they reach the right patients.As the US Food and Drug Administration’s withdrawal of its drug Avastin (which has no such diagnostic) for breast cancer showed in 2010, diagnostics increases the chances of regulatory approval, reduces the risk of side effects and is ever more in demand from healthcare systems seeking value for money as a condition of reimbursement.Despite Roche’s claim that its “full and fair” bid represents a good price at a substantial premium, the Illumina board has activated a “poison pill” that grants other investors rights to buy additional shares.With Illumina trading above Roche’s $44.50 a share bid, the market is braced for an improved offer. But past experience suggests that could take many months, for which Roche has the resources, patience and experience.Roche’s $47bn buy-out of minorities in Genentech in 2009 was initially hostile, as was the purchase of Ventana, another US diagnostics business, in 2007. Both acquisitions were masterminded by Severin Schwan, now Roche chief executive.

In the US, giants Apple and McDonald’s turned in strong performances with the former doubling its profits to $17bn and the latter benefiting from robust international growth. In the media sector, both Time Warner and Netflix recorded better than expected subscriber numbers while Xerox took a more conservative view aimed at slow but steady growth. In oil services, Halliburton looks better positioned than smaller players to cash in on the biggest North American oil boom in decades.In Europe, some companies were working to make themselves larger. Swiss drugmaker Roche launched a $5.7bn hostile offer for the US’ Illumina while one of Europe’s major steelmakers, ThyssenKrupp, confirmed it talks to merge one of its divisions with Finland’s Outokumpu. Also in the industrial sector, German bellwether Siemens reported worrying first-quarter results while Airbus-owner EADS reshuffled its top management, but remains beholden to its Franco-German political masters. Elsewhere two shrunken Scandinavian goliaths – Nokia and Ericsson – have their work cut out for them after recent poor performance.In Asia, the Chinese were celebrating the arrival of the Year of the Dragon, so the action shifted to Japan, where both Nintendo and Toyota are suffering from the strong yen. The video game company tripled its estimates for full-year losses to Y65bn while things are finally starting to look up for the carmaker after a string of bad luck.

31;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Roche / Illumina: take a chill pill;Roche has seen off poison pill defences before without the price rising too much;Jay Flatley has run scared. The chief executive of Illumina, the US genetic diagnostic company, has implemented a “poison pill” to try to frighten off Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, that this week went hostile in its bid for the company. Essentially, this means Illumina shareholders will be able to buy shares at a favourable price if anyone buys more than 15 per cent of the company. The acquirer’s stake will then be diluted and gaining full control will be costly.Short-term investors love this stuff. On Thursday, Illumina’s share price jumped 46 per cent and now sits at $52.65, about one-fifth above Roche’s offer price. Investors clearly expect the Swiss company to play the game and pay more. And Roche certainly has the capacity to sweeten its offer. If the bid is fully debt funded at an assumed marginal interest cost of 3.5 per cent, Roche can raise its offer to $62 per share before it would dilute earnings, calculates Deutsche.Mr Flately is right to negotiate hard. But poison pills entail serious risks. If Illumina pushes too hard and Roche walks, not only will the latter’s shares fall back to their undisturbed level (about half the current price), but they may receive an additional discount because management has made a policy of spurning bids. It is, after all, the takeover threat that keeps management teams focused on making shareholders richer.Roche, though, has won hostile bids before without bumping up the price too much. When it wrested control of Genentech in 2009, the eventual $95 per share price was only 7 per cent higher than the original offer. Rivals are unlikely to enter a hostile bidding war, so Roche should have plenty of time to convince enough of Illumina’s shareholders to sell without activating their poison pill rights. Either way, Mr Flatley should be worried about his position.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
32;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Illumina adopts ‘poison pill’ against Roche;;US diagnostics company Illumina has moved to fend off Roche’s $5.7bn hostile takeover bid by announcing that it will adopt a “poison pill” to protect its shareholders.Through the rights agreement, Illumina shareholders can buy new common stock if a bidder acquires 15 per cent of the company’s shares. The move is intended to deter Roche, the swiss drugmaker, or other potential acquirers by making Illumina more expensive to acquire.“The Illumina board has taken this action to ensure that our stockholders receive fair treatment and protection in connection with any proposal or offer to acquire the company, including the proposal announced by Roche,” said Jay Flatley, Illumina’s chief executive.The bid for Illumina comes as dealmaking in the healthcare sector has proved resilient amid the economic slump. Large pharmaceutical and biotech companies are doing deals as they try to replace revenues lost from drugs coming off patent and to establish their position in emerging treatment and diagnostic areas.In a second high profile healthcare deal this week, Amgen of the US on Thursday unveiled a $1.16bn agreed takeover of Micromet, a biotechnology business founded in Germany with a leading experimental cancer compound and a broader technology with scope for a wider range of treatments.The $11 per share cash offer gives Amgen control of Micromet’s experimental drug Blinatumomab, currently in mid-stage clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, with scope for a range of other diseases. Roger Perlmutter, Amgen’s head of R&D, said: “Our goal is to bring new therapies to patients in need. These are rare assets, and we have enormous confidence in our freedom to operate with them.”Separately on Thursday, Celgene, another US biotech group that specialises in cancer therapies, said it is acquiring Avila Therapeutics for $350m in cash plus another $575m pending the development of some of its drug candidates. Avila is developing promising drugs to “silence” problematic proteins associated with diseases.This news follows an uptick in dealmaking activity in the sector that started late last year.Gilead Sciences, the US biotechnology company which pioneered treatments for HIV, last November said it would buy fellow biotech Pharmasset for about $11bn, a sizeable bet on the fast-developing market for oral remedies for the treatment of hepatitis C. Bristol-Myers Squibb, which faces losing patent protection on several top-selling drugs, followed suit in January agreeing to buy Inhibitex for $2.5bn, another developer of new treatments for hepatitis C.Both deals were struck at substantial premiums to the target’s stock price – something advisers say is typical in a sector where the value of emerging technology and drugs in testing and development has yet to be fully established.Illumina’s decision to put in place a poison pill, which was announced on Thursday, suggests the company’s board is intent on forcing Roche to pay a higher price for the company. Illumina’s shares are already trading substantially above Roche’s $44.50 cash offer, although they slipped 2.85 per cent to $53.51 on Thursday.Industry advisers were this week doubtful that a counterbidder would emerge for Illumina, given Roche’s reputation and previous success in launching hostile bids and its financial firepower.

But it pared losses later when the Federal Open Market Committee said interest rates would stay low until late 2014, longer than previously stated.That triggered a 15 point afternoon rally for the benchmark index, but analysts were cautious about both the FOMC meeting and prospects for the bull market.“It’s clear the make-up of the Fed board has become more dovish and it will do what it can to inoculate the US economy from global problems,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial. “On the other hand, the Fed is acknowledging that US growth will be substandard, which can’t be good for equities.”Apple had earlier briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as shares surged following Tuesday’s blockbuster results.Shares closed up 6.2 per cent at $446.66, having hit an all-time high of $454.45 at the open.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to gain 1.1 per cent to 2,818.31, and triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.Qualcomm, which manufactures microchips used in the iPhone 4S, climbed 0.6 per cent to $59.00, as analysts at JPMorgan said: “Apple’s very strong numbers give us more confidence that Qualcomm should report strong numbers and guide well in its earnings report next Wednesday.”Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, climbed 3.1 per cent to $6.73, despite opening sharply lower after cutting full-year guidance. But Nvidia, which hopes to supply the next generation of Macs, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.85 after reducing fourth-quarter sales projections.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,758.85, lagging other indicesGoldman Sachs fell 0.5 per cent to $108.31, and Morgan Stanley was off 0.1 per cent to $18.12, as JPMorgan analysts said a new method for calculating risk requirements, without reference to rating agencies, could reduce Goldman’s 2012 tier one capital ratio by 1.2 percentage points and Morgan Stanley’s by 0.8 percentage points.“Yet another US investment bank disadvantage,” JPMorgan said and removed “buy” recommendations on both banks.Illumina climbed 46.3 per cent to $55.15 as Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, launched a hostile bid for the diagnostics company. Roche has offered $44.50 a share in cash, but investors appear to believe Illumina will hold out for a higher price.Airlines advanced after Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group both beat projections by analysts.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
35;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-01-25T20:34:20Z;Roche: bid battle is a gutsy move;The offer is 43 per cent above Illumina’s three-month average share price;“Screw it, let’s go hostile.” That thought is probably what went through Severin Schwan’s mind last week. The chief executive of Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company, has been frustrated by the board of Illumina, the US maker of genome diagnostic equipment, which has refused his offer to buy the company. So now he has decided to take his $5.7bn offer straight to Illumina’s shareholders.At a time when any acquisition is rare, Roche’s hostile move is gutsy. But it is also smart. Funding the deal is easy. The company’s net debt should be a comfortable 13 per cent of its assets at the end of this year, and fall to zero by 2015, according to UBS calculations. And the strategic rationale is clear. Although Illumina will only add about 3 per cent to Roche’s revenues, it will boost the latter’s growing diagnostics unit and test for conditions for which Roche is researching treatment.The price is also fair. The $44.50 a share offered is about 30 times this year’s expected earnings. That is two-fifths below the level at which the shares traded last July but that was at a time when growth expectations were overblown. Increased competition among makers of genetic sequencing machines has squeezed the price Illumina can charge customers. In the company’s third quarter, it revealed a small drop in revenues and a one-third drop in earnings per share. Since then, and until rumours of a takeover surfaced, Illumina’s shares had lost two-thirds of their value.Accepting the offer has proved a pill too hard for Illumina’s management to swallow but the reality is its prospects have waned. In 2010, its earnings increased 32 per cent. However, next year, growth will be about half that, estimates Deutsche Bank.

In 1991 the Swiss pharmaceutical group bought worldwide rights to polymerase chain reaction, the key technology for manipulating and amplifying genetic material.Since then, Roche has developed and acquired a wide range of tests for detecting and decoding DNA, ranging from individual genes in viruses and bacteria to the whole human genome – the 3bn biochemical “letters” that make up our genetic code.In 2007 Roche bought 454 Life Sciences, based in Connecticut, a leading producer of “high throughput” DNA sequencers. Although 454 still has a loyal following of customers, it is regarded in today’s fast-moving gene reading industry as a niche player.The current leaders in large-scale DNA sequencing are Illumina, for which Roche has bid $5.7bn, and Life Technologies, another US company.Although Illumina probably has the largest market share, Life Technologies laid down a big challenge earlier this month when it announced a new sequencer that can read a whole human genome in less than a day for $1,000.Other innovative companies such as Oxford Nanopore of the UK are also poised to launch fast new gene sequencers.As the cost of DNA sequencing plummets, the technology will move from biomedical research labs – the main users today – into mainstream clinical practice, a huge new market.On Wednesday, for example, a UK government committee urged the National Health Service to embrace genomics, as a way to tailor patients’ treatments to their individual genetic make-up.
37;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Pharma groups target specialised deals;;"Roche sought to strengthen its position in personalised medicine with a $5.7bn hostile bid early on Wednesday for Illumina of the US, signalling continued appetite in the healthcare sector for targeted acquisitions.The proposed takeover reflects the Swiss drug company’s desire to develop treatments in combination with accompanying diagnostics that ensure its high-priced drugs are given only to those patients in whom they are most effective.For Severin Schwan, Roche’s lawyer-turned-chief executive, the acquisition mirrors his decision in his previous role as head of the diagnostic division to launch a similar initially hostile and protracted takeover of Ventana of the US in 2007.Together with Frans Humer, then chief executive who is now Roche’s chairman, he went on to co-ordinate a tense $47bn buy-out of minority investors in 2009 of its partner Genentech of the US, which has provided the company with many of its top-selling drugs in recent years.The Genentech deal, combined with the “megamergers” in the same year of Pfizer’s $68bn purchase of Wyeth and Merck’s of Schering-Plough for $41bn, was a recent high water mark in dealmaking in the healthcare sector.Figures compiled by Dealogic for the FT show that while the volume of deals has continued to be significant since then, healthcare has dropped back from 12 per cent of all acquisitions in 2009 to below 8 per cent, more in line with the average over the past decade.While the scale of the Genentech takeover was large, that deal reflected Roche’s continued focus on prescription medicines, notably for cancer, spurning a broader trend for diversification championed by others including Pfizer, Merck and its Basel neighbour Novartis, which paid $28bn for the eyecare business Alcon in 2010.Leading investment bankers maintain that megamergers can create value. But a growing chorus of senior industry executives as well as investors believe they have merely deferred the pain of growing patent expiries, and distracted from efforts to boost innovation to develop replacement products.Most subsequent deals have been more targeted on particular products or regions, such as Sanofi’s purchase of Genzyme in 2011, which specialises in “orphan diseases”; Johnson & Johnson’s purchase of Synthes in medical devices; and Takeda’s purchase of Nycomed, to expand into off-patent generic medicines and emerging markets.There is still potential, with large pharmaceutical companies seeking to generate new and more reliable sources of income. Many companies are cash rich, often with money held offshore that is more efficiently used in foreign acquisitions.But much recent activity has instead focused on divestments, including spinoffs by Pfizer in the wake of its Wyeth purchase and by GlaxoSmithKline of some consumer products. Among large-scale deals, the “pure” research and development companies led by AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly appear among the most vulnerable.Fintan Walton, head of PharmaVentures, a life sciences advisory firm, says: “The industry has this huge dilemma over innovation. Acquisitions are part of solving it. But every time they do a big deal, there’s a lot of criticism and cost. The future is these specialised deals.”The Illumina deal itself marks a renewed determination by Roche to provide medicines that can demonstrate value for money and safety in patients. The need was reinforced by investor concern after the US Food and Drug Administration’s decision to withdraw Roche’s drug Avastin for breast cancer in 2010 in the absence of any clear “biomarker” to better target its use.Based on the Ventana experience, analysts were anticipating a long drawn out battle for the company. One argued that Roche’s bid was likely to scare off alternative offers from Abbott and J&J, but the relatively high price at which some investors bought in to Illumina meant a successful bid would require a higher offer.The ultimate value of the deal is less certain. In a research note, Bernstein cautioned of “persistent over-optimism” in genomics, Illumina’s area of expertise, which has only proved to have limited use in many genetically complex common diseases. But it viewed Roche’s interest as an “option” in its success, with the company “probably in a better position than most to take a view”."
38;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2012-01-25T16:02:17Z;Roche launches $5.7bn bid for US group;;Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, on Wednesday described its $5.7bn hostile offer for Illumina as “full and fair” and said it had no plans to raise its bid for the US diagnostics company.But investors and analysts, while broadly supportive, pushed Roche’s shares down amid fears the group would be embroiled in a lengthy bid battle and ultimately overpay. On Tuesday, Illumina shares closed 3.79 per cent higher at $37.69 and by Wednesday morning in New York they were up 43.3 per cent to $54 a share.Roche has offered $44.50 a share in cash for Illumina, about a 64 per cent premium to the company’s share price in mid-December. Illumina’s shares had already risen by about 40 per cent since early December, partly on takeover rumours.Illumina rejected an initial $40 a share offer from Roche earlier this month.Severin Schwan, chief executive and a former head of diagnostics, the second of Roche’s two divisions alongside pharmaceuticals, likened the offer to his 2007 bid for Ventana, another highly entrepreneurial and fast-growing US diagnostics company.Although now successfully integrated into Roche, negotiations over Ventana dragged on for months, with the Swiss group ultimately raising its already high offer.In a conference call, Mr Schwan said he still hoped for a recommended offer. But he added Roche would, if necessary, table proposals at Illumina’s shareholders’ meeting, expected in May, to address shareholders directly, including proposing alternative directors. So far, Roche, which initiated contacts with Illumina in December, has built only a minimal stake in the US company. Illumina, founded in 1998, is not believed to have any dominant shareholders.Buying Illumina will accelerate Roche’s efforts to strengthen its presence in genetics and gene sequencing. A number of companies including Roche are seeking to offer “personalised medicine”, selling both drugs and “companion” diagnostics to ensure they are accurately “targeted” to subgroups of patients who will benefit.But many have struggled to develop both the treatment and the accompanying diagnostic in-house.“Just take cancer, which is a very heterogeneous disease,” said Mr Schwan. “The more we understand about the mutational aspects of a gene that cause a cell to mutate uncontrollably, the more we can target treatments.”Illumina is among the companies attempting to develop ways to read a person’s DNA cheaply and quickly, enabling drug companies to more easily tailor medicines to specific patients. Life Technologies, a US biotechnology company, earlier this month announced the first machine that can read an individual’s DNA in one day for as little as $1,000 – something that on other available instruments costs up to $10,000 and can take a week.Daniel O’Day, Roche’s head of diagnostics, said in the conference call that scientific advances meant the equipment made by Illumina and its peers, once restricted to top research laboratories, would increasingly be sold much more widely.Illumina, which is based in San Diego and has 2,100 employees, has expanded rapidly, with sharply growing sales and profits. Sales in 2010, the most recent available, amounted to $903m, with a 23 per cent operating margin. However, its business is focused largely on the US.Greenhill and Citigroup are advising Roche on the deal, which the company said would be financed from its existing cash and credit facilities.Roche’s unsolicited offer comes as deal advisers point to an increasing willingness on the part of would-be buyers to press their case in public, where targets prove reluctant to engage.Additional reporting by Alan Rappeport in New York
39;ILMN;Illumina Inc;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Machine to read individual’s DNA for $1,000;;A US biotechnology company will on Tuesday announce the first machine that can read all 3bn letters of an individual’s DNA for as little as $1,000 – a development that will greatly accelerate medical treatment tailored to a patient’s genes but also raises ethical questions.Life Technologies says its new Ion Proton sequencer – a $149,000 instrument about the size of a laser printer – can read a whole human genome in less than a day for $1,000 including all chemicals, running costs and preliminary data analysis.The landmark development, expected to be matched by other companies soon, will greatly increase knowledge about the links between genes and disease, while guiding patients – particularly those with cancer – to receive the treatments most likely to work with their individual genetic profile.However, some fear that scientific enthusiasm for mass decoding of personal genomes could lead into an ethical minefield, raising problems such as access to DNA data by insurers – especially if most babies have their genome read at birth – and by employers.For a decade since the completion of the $3bn international research project to decode the first human genome, the cost of DNA sequencing has been falling faster than almost any other field of technology, as new methods are introduced to read the genetic code shared by all life on Earth.“A genome sequence for $1,000 was a pipedream just a few years ago,” said Richard Gibbs, director of the human genome sequencing centre at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “[It] will transform the clinical applications of sequencing.”Baylor is one of three large US medical centres, along with Yale School of Medicine and the Broad Institute, that will receive the first Ion Proton sequencers at the end of January, said Jonathan Rothberg of Life Technologies, who invented the technology used. Deliveries to other academic and commercial customers will follow over the next few months.Sequencing a human genome on most of the instruments working today costs $5,000 to $10,000 and takes up to a week, using optical technology to read the individual letters of DNA that are tagged with fluorescent marker. The Ion Proton machine cuts that substantially, by using semiconductor technology to read DNA directly through its chemistry.Life Technologies will not have the $1,000 genome field to itself for long. Other gene sequencing companies, such as Illumina of the US and Oxford Nanopore of the UK, are rapidly developing competing systems – and the cost is expected to plummet further, leading some to speculate that it will become routine for every baby to have its genome read at birth.Mr Rothberg estimates that between 5,000 and 10,000 people have had their full genome sequenced so far, almost all for research rather than medical treatment. “I believe millions or even tens of millions of people will have their personal genome read over the next decade,” he said.

Macy’s gave up 6.3 per cent to $11, while Best Buy dropped 5.3 per cent to $32.08 and Nordstrom, the clothing retailer, declined 7.1 per cent to $18.63.“The jobless figures were abysmal,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.“We’re now in a malevolent cycle and the risk is that the government will have to issue even more debt. This could lead to higher interest rates, which would undermine the whole V-shaped recovery.”But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, disagreed. “The market is over-reacting,” he said. “The combined loss of jobs for the last two months is only just more than that seen in January. These are the beginning stages of the stabilisation of the unemployment rate.”The S&P 500 closed 2.9 per cent down at 896.42 while the Dow Jones was 2.6 per cent per cent lower at 8,280.74. This was after trading on the New York Stock Exchange was extended for 15 minutes after a technical glitch.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7 per cent to 1,796.52.That left the markets between 1.8 and 2.5 per cent lower for the week, which was cut short because of the Independence Day
holiday.Thursday’s selling knocked the markets out of the narrow trading range they had been in all week, which saw the close of the best quarter for the S&P since December 1998.Equities rose and fell with the price of commodities throughout the week, with oil climbing above $72 a barrel only to fall back below $68.But in a week which saw the release of several important pieces of economic data, trading volumes remained thin, with much of Wall Street taking an early break ahead of the long weekend.There was further volatility in commodities on Thursday, and energy producers fell as the price of oil continued the previous sessions’ declines.Schlumberger gave up 3.2 per cent to $52.55 and ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $40.96.Elsewhere in the sector, NRG gave up its pre-market gains, which had been made on an increased bid from Exelon after a fall in Exelon’s share price meant there would be less of a premium attached for NRG shareholders.The bid is now $7.45bn, but NRG’s shares fell with the price of oil, dropping 4.8 per cent to $24.80. Exelon lost 4.3 per cent to $49.37.Materials companies also suffered and Freeport McMoRan the copper and gold miner, gave up 1.7 per cent to $49.72. Newmont Mining dropped 4.6 per cent to $40.26.Airlines fluctuated as Morgan Stanley reviewed its ratings on some of the biggest US carriers. The bank started coverage on Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest, recommending a price target of $9 after recent selling pressure.The shares climbed 0.5 per cent to $5.88.Morgan Stanley also upgraded shares in Continental Airlines, saying it was a likely survivor from the fall-out in the industry.There was some pressure on the stock from news on Wednesday evening that its revenue per seat may have fallen more than 20 per cent in June compared with a year earlier. But the shares still managed to gain 6.2 per cent to $9.79.Southwest Airlines fell 4.4 per cent to $6.50, however, after the bank downgraded its shares, saying higher oil prices would take a toll on profit margins.Meanwhile Illumina, which makes equipment to analyse DNA, dropped after reporting lower revenues than expected as cash-strapped researchers delayed orders. The shares lost 12.3 per cent to $33.46."

Shares were 6.1 per cent higher for the week at $70.57.Consolidation among airlines was another talking point. US Airways launched an $8bn unsolicited cash and stock offer for Delta Air Lines, which is in bankruptcy protection. Shares in US Airways hit a 52-week high of $62.57 and were up 20.6 per cent at $59.45. The American Stock Exchange airline index notched a 52-week high of 62.04 and was 7.9 per cent higher at 60.03.The Dow Jones Transportation Average index led broader indices and was 2.4 per cent higher for the week. “It is unlikely only one airline merger will be proposed. Given the potential economies of scale, we believe that no airline wants to be left as a niche carrier,” noted UBS.Other airline shares rose sharply, including Continental, up 16.7 per cent at $42.49. JetBlue, up 9.9 per cent to $14.58, and AirTran, which gained 26.3 per cent to $13.03, helped in part by upgrades.Radio station operator Clear Channel Communications agreed to a $19bn purchase at a share price of $37.60 by a consortium of private equity firms.
