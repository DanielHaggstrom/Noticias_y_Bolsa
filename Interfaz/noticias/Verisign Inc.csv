0;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2014-03-17T21:49:16Z;Sina surges as Weibo files for NY listing;US stocks gain as EU and US impose sanctions on Russian officials;Shares in Sina surged on Monday after the company’s subsidiary, the Weibo social media network, filed paperwork to list shares in New York with the US securities regulators late last week.Weibo said it could list its shares on either the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange and sought to raise $500m, although that figure is likely to change.People familiar with the offering said China’s rival to Twitter was seeking to raise close to $700m in a listing this spring that would value Weibo at between $7bn and $8bn.The company said it would use about $250m from the offering to repay loans to Sina. The rest of the proceeds will be used for employee incentives and to enhance its brand recognition.Weibo said sales more than doubled in 2013 to $188m, while its net loss narrowed to $38m from $102m a year earlier. The company listed 129m monthly active users at the end of December, a 33 per cent gain from a year earlier.The rise, nonetheless, represented the slowest pace of growth in the company’s history amid intense competition with Tencent’s WeChat and Facebook’s recently acquired WhatsApp chat apps.Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse are set to lead the offering, according to the filing. Shares in Sina rose 6.6 per cent to $68.83 by the close.Weibo’s listing comes as Alibaba confirmed it would float its shares in a US listing as soon as next month in a bid to raise at least $15bn.Shares in Yahoo, which holds a 24 per cent stake in the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, climbed 4 per cent to $39.11.An Alibaba initial public offering would give Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo chief executive, the opportunity to start shrinking the stake in a company some believe will command a market value of more than $150bn.Hertz, the car rental company, advanced as it prepared to spin off its construction equipment rental business in a deal that could value the division at about $4.5bn.The company, which came under pressure from activist investors last year, may announce details of the separation of the equipment business as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.Shares rose 4.8 per cent to $27.22.Sears Holdings shares strengthened further on Monday after the company announced it would float its Lands’ End business in April.The retailer said Lands’ End would pay it a $500m dividend before the split. Current shareholders will receive about 0.3 shares of Lands’ End common stock for every Sears share they currently hold.Sears shares advanced as much as 5 per cent, before closing up 1.9 per cent at $44.84.VeriSign, the manager of internet addresses, declined at its greatest pace in more than a year after the US said it would yield control of the internet’s domain system.Analysts at Cowen downgraded VeriSign to ‘market perform’ from ‘outperform’ after the National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced that it would hold meetings with key stakeholders as it ends its co-ordination of the domain name system.“With less US control and without knowledge of what entity or entities will ultimately have power, we believe there is increased risk that VeriSign may not be able to renew its .com and .net contracts in their current form,” Cowen analyst Gregg Moskowitz said.Mr Moskowitz noted that it was unlikely a new governing body would award VeriSign’s contract of the .com domain to another provider when it comes up for renewal in 2018 because of the company’s “impeccable track record and unrivalled scale”.Shares in the company slid 5.8 per cent to $51.68.Overall, US equity markets climbed as the EU and the US imposed sanctions on several top Russian officials, but stopped short of wider restrictions against the country.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.96 per cent to 1,858.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.1 per cent to 16,247.22. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 0.81 per cent to 4,279.95.
1;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2011-09-09T14:37:33Z;Wall Street down after Obama speech;;A sharp drop on Friday, gave the S&P 500 its worst start to September in a decade, as President Obama’s jobs plan failed to stimulate markets and euro zone debt fears intensified.The broad S&P 500 index lost 2.7 per cent on Friday to close at 1,154.23, and sent the benchmark into negative territory for the week, for a loss of 1.9 per cent since Monday.On Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.7 per cent to 10,992.13 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.4 per cent to 2,467.99.A $450bn package was unveiled on Thursday night in a well-trailed speech but the measures had already been priced in to the market.“Obviously there’s disappointment – the market doesn’t think the Obama speech is going to change things materially,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.She added: “The big questions is still whether US markets can divorce from Europe.”Despite many investors focusing on macro factors, which led to more big swings up and down, the performance of many stocks was determined by earnings reports and sectoral trends rather than fear.Semiconductor stocks rose strongly in a week when several companies produced earnings forecasts that were not as bad as expected considering deteriorating macroeconomic data.Demand for semiconductors depends on global growth, making the stocks highly cyclical.In August the semiconductor holders trust ETF fell 9.1 per cent, almost 50 per cent more than the S&P 500.This week it rose almost 2 per cent, closing most of the gap in performance with the S&P 500 since the start of August.Shares in companies that make DRam memory chips for personal computers, which had suffered most in August, did particularly well. Micron Technology was up 15.8 per cent to $6.35 and SanDisk rose 10.3 per cent to 38.73.Smartphone supplier Nvidia was also up 7.2 per cent to $13.88 after surprising analysts with its earnings forecasts.Regional bank stocks decoupled from bigger national banks after Credit Suisse recommended clients buy their shares.Analyst Craig Siegenthale argued that low interest rates are already priced into regional bank business models because most of their lending is to commercial clients at variable rates.On the other hand, national banks are likely to see interest rate margins fall over time as fixed rate consumer loans mature and are refinanced at lower rates.Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp was up 2.2 per cent to $9.81 and US Bancorp rose 1.5 per cent to $22.00.National banks continued to fall on fears of exposure to Europe and a stalling economy.Bank of America was down 3.4 per cent to $6.98, Citigroup fell 5.8 per cent to $26.74 and JPMorgan fell 7.5 per cent to $32.08.Overall, financial companies in the S&P 500 were down 2.7 per cent for the week.Coal mining stocks were given a boost by unconfirmed reports of a potential bid from Anglo American, the global metals and mining group, for Walter Energy, the largest pure play coke and coal producer in the US. Those rumours followed hot on the heels of a confirmed bid last week from US coalminer Peabody forMacArthur, the Australian coal producer.Walter rose 13.3 per cent to $88.22 and Alpha Natural Resources, which has significant US coal mining interests only fell 0.5 per cent to 30.81, handily outperforming the S&P 500.Yahoo rose 12 per cent to $14.48 after the sacking of chief executive Carol Bartz and news that activist investor Daniel Loeb had taken a 5 per cent stake in the company.Mr Loeb immediately called for the resignation of the board of directors.Investors greeted the decision of oil company Sunoco to desert refining, closing its last two remaining facilities. Shares rose 2.2 per cent to $37.12.RBC Capital upgraded Sunoco from hold to buy, arguing its streamlined supply and logistics focus leaves it well set to benefit from the combination of, “growing crude oil production and insufficient pipeline takeaway capacity”.International Paper Company, the largest US pulp and paper maker, rose 2 per cent to $26.17 after the company successfully concluded its three-month battle to acquire shipping-box manufacturer Temple Inland.The $3.7bn bid values Temple-Inland at $32 a share. Temple stock rose 25.8 per cent to $31.04.VeriSign, the internet domain name seller, fell 3.4 per cent to $29.03. The company has announced the departure of Chief Financial Officer Brian Robins, damping speculation that it was about to be acquired.
2;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Icann chairman urges patience;;"Repurposing Churchill quotes is popular among those involved with Icann. Those pushing for reform of the organisation that manages the world’s internet domain names call it the “worst system of internet governance, apart from all the others”.Steve Crocker, Icann’s newly elected chairman, has his own favourite quote: “It is not the end, not the beginning of the end, but the end of the beginning.”A veteran computer scientist who help create the very foundations of the internet, Mr Crocker wants people to be patient with the Californian non-proft company, which is only 13 years old and just beginning to get into its stride in improving the structure of the internet.Icann dismayed many companies and governments with a recent decision to allow a huge expansion in the number of internet names. Mr Crocker points out that there was a long-standing demand for this move, as many people were worried that the .com domain, run by VeriSign, unduly dominated the internet.“Expanding internet names was part of the founding principle of Icann. Once upon a time there was a clamour to open up domain names,” he said.He’s concerned about suggestions that the US Department of Commerce could consider other organisations to run the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (Iana), the database of all the world’s domain names.“I don’t see how that would help the stability of the net. Icann was purpose-built to operate the Iana function,” he said. He doesn’t want the running of the Iana function to be seen as a poltical issue instead of a purely functional issue akin to operating a telephone directory service.“It is a record-keeping function. You want it to be something unobtrusive and automatic and grey,” he said.But its hard to see how acting as gate-keeper to the world’s internet names can really be apolitical or grey. Icann still has a long road ahead navigating through contentious applications for internet domain names, possible lawsuits from disgruntled trademark owners, and grumbling from governments which prefer much more control over the internet. If the new internet domain name plans don’t work well, governments could still pressure Icann to scrap them.Mr Crocker should perhaps be looking to some other famous Churchill quotes, such as: “We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.”"
3;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2011-05-12T21:05:14Z;Upbeat jobs figures lift Wall Street;;Cisco Systems lost ground after issuing a profit warning, while the wider markets edged higher after broadly positive economic data and firmer commodity prices helped to lift investor sentiment.Shares in Cisco fell 4.8 per cent to $16.93 after the world’s largest producer of networking gear by revenues announced that its sales and profits in the current quarter would come in below expectations.The company also reported that its net income had fallen 18 per cent in its last quarter to $1.8bn, or 42 cents a share. This was broadly in line with expectations.News of the profit warning weighed on related technology stocks. Motorola Mobility fell 1.1 per cent to $24.98 while Harrislost 1.4 per cent to $48.29. The S&P technology equipment sector was down 0.7 per cent, although in the broader tech sector most stocks were up.Looking at the wider markets, the S&P 500 index closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,348.65, paring some of the 1.1 per cent losses in the previous session, with sentiment helped by upbeat employment data.Figures from the Labor Department showed that 44,000 fewer Americans applied for unemployment insurance last week.The number of new claims fell to 434,000, which was a bigger drop than had been expected and was the steepest fall since February 2010.It also reversed much of the sharp increase in claims in the previous week. But other data in the session were less positive, showing that the higher oil and food costs were hitting retail spending and lifting producer prices.The 0.5 per cent rise in retail sales in April and the 0.8 per cent rise in inflation were both slightly worse than the markets had been expecting.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,696.14 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.6 per cent to 2,863.04.The energy sectors were again lower in the session, as traders remained uneasy following the recent volatility in the oil markets.Within the energy sector Murphy Oil fell 1.3 per cent to $66.63 while ConocoPhillips declined 1.4 per cent to $71.53. The broader S&P energy sector closed down only 0.1 per cent, however, after the oil priced edged a little higher. The S&P energy sector has fallen 7.2 per cent this month.Consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks saw some of the biggest gains in a possible sign that some stocks are beginning to benefit from the recent drop in oil prices.Among the stocks to gain in these sectors, Tyson Foods was up 4.6 per cent to $18.84 while Mead Johnson added 2.1 per cent to $67.72. Best Buy rose 4.1 per cent to $31.69.The S&P consumer discretionary index was up 0.9 per cent and the consumer stable index added 1.3 per cent.The financial sector was one of the worst performing of the session, led by Goldman Sachs. Shares in the investment bank were down 3.5 per cent to $142.1 after pair of analyst notes downgraded the stock, warning investors that Goldman could still face charges from the US Justice Department for its behaviour during the financial crisis.Citigroup fell 1.2 per cent to $42.42, adding to the 5 per cent losses already this week after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split on Monday. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.The S&P financial index was down 0.1, recovering from sharper losses earlier in the session as the afternoon continued.Elsewhere, shares in First Solar rose 6.3 per cent to $132.07, the best performing stock on the S&P 500 index, after the maker of thin-film solar modules received letters indicating support from the US Energy Department for three projects in California.Shares in Symantec added 5.2 per cent to $20.42 after the maker of security software reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 38 cents a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate by 2 cents.VeriSign, the company best known for the management of internet domain names, was up 3.2 per cent to $36.68 after saying that it had resolved a lawsuit.Clearwire, a wireless broadband provider, fell 15.6 per cent to $3.99 after Intel said that it would sell 10m shares in the company.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Kohl’s added 3.9 per cent to $55.68 after the retailer reported a 6 per cent rise in first-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast for the year.
4;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2010-11-30T18:57:32Z;US seizes domain names of 82 websites;;US authorities invoked tough asset-forfeiture laws to seize the domain names of 82 websites accused of aiding the sale of counterfeit goods or assisting with digital piracy, the most sweeping use of the statutes thus far against illicit online activity.All but five of the confiscated website addresses offered tangible products for sale, mostly made in or shipped from China, officials said Monday. The others were connected with the distribution of copyrighted movies, music or software.Among the sites shuttered in recent days were louis-vuitton-outlet-store.com, burberryoutletshop.com and realtimberland.com, none of which were affiliated with the real brands cited.In all of the cases, the Justice Department and the customs division of the Department of Homeland Security relied on forfeiture laws that allow for property seizures when the judge finds that property – in this case the domain names – were probably used to facilitate copyright or trademark infringements.Forfeiture cases are technically not filed against any individual or business but against the property itself, and the laws have been faulted by civil liberties advocates alarmed by the lack of due process. After a seizure, the burden of proof shifts to the owner of property to show that it was not used for an illegal purpose.At least one of the sites accused of assisting with digital piracy, Torrent-Finder.com, complained that it acted merely as a search engine for people seeking material hosted with the BitTorrent protocol, which distributes both pirated and non-copyrighted works.But in an interview, a customs official said the site would have to do more than that to be pursued under the forfeiture law.Erik Barnett, assistant deputy director of immigration and customs enforcement, said that the Torrent-Finder case was under investigation and that he could not go into details about it.In general, Mr Barnett told the Financial Times,”there’s no interest in a site in existence as a search-engine type mechanism, that’s not violative of the law. But where an individual gets more heavily involved in engaging in specific techniques designed to direct users to copyrighted material, that’s where there is going to be Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security interest and ultimately a federal judge who recognises that a line has been crossed.”Most commonly, US forfeiture laws are invoked to seize drug houses. They also come into play in money laundering and smuggling.But a number of other crimes can trigger forfeiture under the statutes as well, including computer hacking. That raises the possibility that domain names could be seized from online gangsters, especially those who register sites that are common misspellings of banks and other financial institutions.The approach has its limitations as well. Domain names can be easily purchased and the same business can move locations and rebuild traffic.VeriSign, which oversees all of .com domains, including those seized in recent days, cooperated with the court orders. Other domain-name endings are controlled by companies based overseas and would not have to comply.
5;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2010-08-01T18:49:17Z;Domain name investing;The highest public price paid for a domain has steadily risen;Online, anyone can be master of their own domain. In the first quarter of this year there were 193m registered domains, according to registry VeriSign. Only a nominal fee and imagination is required to stake out online real estate – a Welsh village registered the longest single-word domain name purely to boast about doing so. But good names, the web’s waterfront property, were snatched up years ago, prompting the development of a secondary market in used domains.Companies with existing trademarks can generally just assert their rights to non-generic domains. This year InterContinental Hotels won an arbitration case over the use of 1,542 separate domains. So the market falls broadly into two categories: cheap names, such as common misspellings of popular websites good for a few regular advertising dollars, and valuable dotcoms easily typed into the address bar of a browser. Slots.com recently sold for $5.5m.Can such domains be considered an alternative asset class, similar to art or rare coins? Oversee.net, which estimates aftermarket volume now totals about $500m a year, certainly hopes to encourage the comparison. It is holding a public auction in New York this month where bidders will compete for the likes of patents.com and stocks.com.Median prices for “.com” names – the most popular suffix accounting for over two-fifths of registered domains – have risen by a quarter in the past year to $510, according to Sedo, a domain exchange. Aside from the almost $100m that an SBC-BellSouth joint venture was reported to have paid for yellowpages.com in 2004, the highest public price paid for a domain has steadily risen, from the $7.5m paid for business.com in 1999 to the $16m paid for insure.com last year. But, as search engines continue to make human memory obsolete, what a domain is actually called is becoming increasingly irrelevant.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
6;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2010-05-20T20:47:28Z;S&P 500 falls most since April 2009;;"A jump in jobless claims and continuing European debt jitters drove US markets sharply lower, sending the S&P 500 to its sharpest drop in 13 months, and more than 10 per cent below last month’s high.At close in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 3.9 per cent to 1,071.59, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.6 per cent to 10,068.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index lost 4.1 per cent to 2,204.01.With yesterday’s declines, US indices joined other global markets in posting losses for the year – but the US benchmarks are still outperforming many of them.Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, said this month’s intraday lows were significant indicators to watch, such as 1,065.79 for the S&P 500.If the main indices were to fall past these levels “[it] would be a problematic development” he said.As stocks fell, the Vix, a widely watched measure of volatility, surged 26 per cent to 44.38, the highest level for more than a year.The US labour department said initial claims for unemployment benefits on a weekly basis rose 25,000 to 471,000, seasonally adjusted, for the week ending May 15, highest since early April.“The theme of breaking no new ground on the lay-off front continues,” said Jonathan Basile, vice-president for economics at Credit Suisse.Materials and industrials led the market declines.Alcoa, the global metals group, fell 6 per cent to $11.07. Caterpillar, a manufacturer of construction equipment, lost 4.5 per cent to $58.67.General Electric’s shares lost 5.8 per cent to $16.26. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries filed a US antitrust lawsuit against GE over patents related to wind turbines.Leading banks also slipped. The US Senate, in a party-line vote, sent the financial reform package to a final vote. Citigroup was down 4.7 per cent to $3.63 and Bank of America lost 6.3 per cent to $15.28.Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist at UBS, said investors would be watching banking shares as credit risk indicators to determine whether conditions had bottomed out.“Markets have become increasingly concerned about the sufficiency of measures taken to defend the euro as well as the impact of proposed austerity plans,” said Mr Golub.Harman International, an audio equipment maker that receives nearly three-quarters of its revenues in Europe, slipped another 3.7 per cent to $30.56.Net income for Autodesk, the design software maker, jumped 11 per cent in its first quarter over the same period last year, beating analyst expectations.But the group, which said it sold more software overseas, also warned those gains could be fleeting. Shares fell back 6.9 per cent to $28.28.“[Our] enthusiasm is tempered somewhat by the devaluation of the euro and the general instability of the European economy,” said Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive.VeriSign, an internet software provider, lost 1.5 per cent to $27.56 after agreeing to sell its security unit to Symantec for $1.3bn. Symantec fell back 5.6 per cent to $14.76.Advance Auto Parts shares were 6.9 per cent higher at $48.99 after Credit Suisse raised its price target to $55, citing an economic backdrop in which more drivers would be servicing their own cars, as well as the group’s ability to provide “customer service focus, direct sourcing and price optimisation”.Sears said its earnings fell 39 per cent in the first quarter year-on-year, which the retailer attributed to declining margins in appliances and other big-ticket items. Its shares plummeted 11 per cent to $88.70.Drugstore chain Walgreens lost 6 per cent to $32.71, after analysts at Credit Suisse downgraded it from “outperform” to “neutral”.Ross Stores was 1.1 per cent higher, to $52.28, after it reported higher-than-
expected profits and record sales margins.MasterCard, the payment network, was also among the few gainers. It advanced
1.5 per cent to $205.50 after said Heartland Payment Systems would pay it $41.4m in claims related to security breaches. Visa, however, was 0.2 per cent lower at $72.82."
7;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2010-01-13T16:55:47Z;Google hack could hurt cloud computing;;Security experts warned on Wednesday that businesses could lose faith in the security of cloud computing after Google admitted that its web-based Gmail system had been hacked by what it described as attacks originating in China.They said it could slow down corporations’ willingness to put their business information into “the cloud” – remotely-hosted data centres.“This is a pretty public blow against the security of the cloud,” said Whit Andrews, vice president at Gartner, the research company. “It is possible that it will affect the uptake of Google applications.“Most companies that are concerned about security are not considering the cloud at the moment. They might think about it from time to time as a way of making some cost savings, but this could push those decisions back.”However, Mr Andrews said that Google was unlikely to lose Gmail users in any significant amounts over the incidents.He said all companies faced these kinds of attacks. “I can’t identify a company that suddenly looks more responsible than Google on this,” Mr Andrews said.Rival Microsoft, for example, faced security challenges for its Hotmail service 10 years ago, but these had not noticeably slowed growth in user numbers.Security experts said that the threat from Chinese hackers was well-known by the US and UK governments.“The information that we are given is that the UK and US government believe the Chinese cyber attacks are real and aimed at the private as well as the public sector,” said Pete Wood, chief of operations at First Base Technology, an ethical hacking company.“It would be a mistake to assume that Google is any more vulnerable than other providers. Any mail server that we have tested is vulnerable to an attack,” he said.According to Verisign iDefense, the hack attack against Google also targeted 33 other companies, including other Silicon Valley technology companies, financial institutions and defence contractors.It was mainly aimed at stealing source code from the companies, and in some cases was successful.“Sources indicate that they believe the attack is the work of actors operating on behalf of or in the direct employ of official intelligence entities of the People’s Republic of China,” iDefense said.The attacks were similar to an attack last July – also believed to have come from China – which targeted 100 IT companies. iDefense said it was possible that some of these companies might have been compromised since then.Mr Wood said the Google attacks should be a wake-up call for all companies.“There has been complacency in firms. They should be looking at their internet boundaries and how closely they are being monitored. Firms need to be more proactive in protecting themselves. Most of the just don’t know that these attacks are happening,” he said.
8;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2009-12-22T21:47:41Z;Obama chooses cybersecurity chief;;Barack Obama, US president, on Tuesday picked a White House cybersecurity co-ordinator to bring greater focus to the defence against internet attacks, ending a protracted search that has raised questions in some quarters about the potential effectiveness of the role.The appointment of Howard Schmidt, an internet security veteran with experience in both industry and government, was greeted with relief among security experts, where the move was seen as a welcome outcome after a seven-month delay in filling the role.However, the lack of direct authority for the White House position and potential difficulty of squaring public and business interests have left doubts about what the White House official will be able to achieve.Mr Schmidt will not be able to use his position as a “bully pulpit” to bring rival interests together and his effectiveness will depend on his ability to act as an “evangelist”, said Ken Silva, chief technology officer at Verisign, the company that operates the DotCom internet domain.Like other security industry experts, Mr Silva said that Mr Schmidt’s broad experience and personal contacts in both the public and private sectors would put him in a good position to make the most of the role.The Computer and Communications Industry Association added that the new official will also be in a position to represent the administration’s position as momentum builds on Capitol Hill for legislation on cybersecurity.Mr Obama first promised during his presidential campaign to appoint a cybersecurity “tsar”, throwing considerable weight behind the job of ensuring that the nation’s critical communications infrastructure is secure, and of helping to protect both public agencies and private businesses that rely on the internet. The job description was later revised to “co-ordinator”, implying that the position had been scaled back, though the role is still seen as the most significant White House position yet dealing with cybersecurity.Adding to questions surrounding the job was an initial plan for the cybersecurity chief to report both to the National Security Council and the National Economic Council, leaving the official with two masters. In the seven-month search to fill the role, both John Thomson, former chairman of internet security company Symantec, and Scott Charney, head of security at Microsoft, turned down the job.In a change of plan, the White House said on Tuesday that Mr Schmidt would report only to the NSC, though he would also “work closely with [the president’s] economic team”.A former head of security at both Microsoft and eBay, Mr Schmidt’s government roles have included serving as vice-president of the critical infrastructure protection board set up by the Bush administration after the World Trade Center attacks.
9;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2 per cent to 9,370.07.The jobs data capped a run of economic data which spurred rallies at the beginning of the week.“This has been probably the most important week from a data perspective in many, many months,” said Burth White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial. “We have had great numbers, first with GDP, then the ISM survey and now with the jobs report. This is the proof that the green shoots are really growing.”In spite of the rally, some traders are worried that low summer-type volumes will not sustain further gains.Trading was choppy during the week and after a dip on Wednesday, the S&P rose 2.3 per cent this week, while the Dow gained 2.2 per cent. The tech-dominated Nasdaq lagged behind slightly in the week, rising only 1.1 per cent.The technology sector lagged again on Friday after several companies reported their results. Two rival IT companies saw an improvement in orders from businesses for their services.Computer Sciences was also helped by lower costs, and its better earnings than expected boosted the shares 1.6 per cent to $49.45.But Affiliated Computer Services fell 5.1 per cent to $44.52 after it predicted lower earnings next quarter than analysts currently expect, even though it beat estimates this quarter.Microchip Technology also lost ground in spite of reporting better results than expected, dropping 1.1 per cent to $26.43.Elsewhere in the sector, VeriSign, the internet domain company, was one of the day’s steeper fallers after reporting slightly weaker revenues than expected.The company failed to reassure investors even by announcing the promotion of Mark McLaughlin from chief operating officer to chief executive, and the shares fell 9.2 per cent to $18.66.Elsewhere, financial shares were mixed on Friday, as banks initially overcame pre-market wobbles following RBS’s warning that recovery was still some way off.Citigroup rose 1.3 per cent to $3.85, and while investors pared much of its earlier gains, the stock recorded a weekly rise of 21.5 per cent.Bank of America, howver dropped 1.7 per cent to $16.42, clipping its rise this week to 11 per cent, while JPMorgan, up 4 per cent at $42.36, rallied 9.6 per cent this week.AIG performed even better than the rest of the financial sector after the bailed-out insurer reported much stronger profits than had been predicted.The company was helped by narrowing losses on its investments. The shares jumped 20.5 per cent to $27.14, and more than doubled this week.As the second-quarter earnings seasons starts winding down, shares in broadcaster CBS jumped 26.6 per cent to $10.81 on Friday, after the company swung to a profit, although its earnings were still 96 per cent lower than the same quarter last year.Leslie Moonves, the chief executive, gave further impetus to the rising share price when he said he expected earnings to be stronger next quarter.In the telecoms sector, Leap tumbled 24.5 per cent to $17.06, after reporting weak profits as new wireless internet subscribers were lower than forecast.
11;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2009-07-31T15:57:56Z;SSL flaws prompts ‘secure’ websites warning;;The digital certificates that many websites use to prove their authenticity before users make financial transactions could have been faked using hacking attacks demonstrated at a technology security conference in Las Vegas.The certificates issued by VeriSign and others rely on what is known as the Secure Sockets Layer, which is what produces a small image of a padlock on internet browsers and is reflected in the address bar as https, instead of http.But the technology underpinning the certificates is old, complicated and fragile, and therefore able to be hacked, said researcher Dan Kaminsky.Mr Kaminsky reported his findings to the makers of major browsers and the certificate companies, and all of the holes have been fixed, he said during a standing-room only presentation at the Black Hat USA conference earlier this week.Mr Kaminsky gained fame last year when he uncovered a bug in the domain name system that allowed hackers to wrest control of website addresses. As in the latest case, he worked in secret with software and security companies to temporarily patch the DNS problem before disclosing it in public.The fundamental problem with SSL, Mr Kaminsky said, is that it is among the many security mechanisms structured on top of inherently untrustworthy parts of the internet. About the only thing that has proven reliable is the DNS system for routing web users to the correct numerical address after they type in the words for that website.Infrastructure firms are shifting to a more secure version of DNS, in part because of Mr Kaminsky’s previous discovery, and after that he said a new version of SSL should be based on DNS.Other researchers at the conference disclosed more new methods of attacking smart phones, personal computers and computerised systems governing parking metres. Most of the world’s computers can now be penetrated by an as-yet unpatched vulnerability in Adobe’s Flash software, if Web surfers visit a compromised site.Meanwhile, malware expert Joe Stewart reported that he had broken through the encryption in a two-year-old banking Trojan that has been placed on what he estimated as between 100,000 and 500,000 PCs. Like other keystroke-recording stealth programs, the Clampi Trojan has been distributed largely through compromised legitimate websites that victims visit. Many security programs block those so-called iFrame attacks.But while most previously studied financial Trojans target users of a couple of dozen banks, Clampi scoops up data entered by consumers at 4,500 sites in 70 countries. The sophisticated coding in the program means that most antivirus programs can’t tell if a user’s PC is infected.The information is sent off to criminals who have hired often unsuspecting “mules” who transfer money that has been pilfered from accounts using the stolen data, Mr Stewart said.
12;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2009-06-08T20:44:29Z;Wall Street recovers losses in late trade;;US stocks staged a late recovery on Monday to end roughly where they were at the end of the previous session after a day spent almost entirely in negative territory.The equities markets opened lower on worries that interest rates might rise later in the year and stall an economic recovery.“Bond yields have been on the rise and that spells weaker than average performance,” wrote analysts at Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch. “We found that stocks deliver below-average performance when interest rates rise dramatically.”Don Galante, senior vice-president of fixed income at MF Global, agreed, saying: “The risk is that such a rise could shut the economic recovery down.”But financial stocks, which were the only sector to perform well throughout the day, led a late reversal while the market waited to see which banks would be first to be allowed to repay money from the government’s troubled asset relief program.The Wall Street Journal reported JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs would be named on the initial list. But while JPMorgan gained 2.4 per cent to $35.39, Goldman gave up 0.4 per cent to $148.35. Citigroup rose ahead of an expected swap of preferred shares into common stock.The Financial Times reported over the weekend that the bank’s plan to raise $33bn in capital had been postponed after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation threatened to lower a crucial financial health rating as part of the regulator’s drive to replace Vikram Pandit, chief executive. Citigroup shares closed 1.2 per cent higher at $3.42.The paper also reported that Bank of New York Mellon and BlackRock were competing to buy Barclays Global Investors.BlackRock, which Reuters reported was the frontrunner with an offer of about $12bn, gained 3.4 per cent to $169.36, while BNY Mellon picked up 1.1 per cent to $28.54.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent down at 939.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, on which Travelers and Cisco made their first appearance, replacing Citigroup and General Motors, edged a fraction up to 8,764.49. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,842.40.Materials were the biggest drags on equities markets as the price of oil and metals dropped.Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, lost 1.2 per cent to $56.48, while Nucor, the steelmaker, dropped 1.6 per cent to $46.76.Multinationals felt the effect of the strengthening dollar. McDonald’s was a particularly heavy faller as the company warned that exchange rates could cost the company 20 cents per share for the year.The warning negated the impact of a stronger-than-expected rise in global sales for May and the company’s shares fell 1.9 per cent to $58.72.General Mills, which makes food brands such as Cheerios, gained 4 per cent to $54.22 after the company said 2009 earnings would be several cents better than forecast.Apple shares lost 0.6 per cent to $143.85 even though the company unveiled a new iPhone and a new Mac operating system at its annual developers conference.There had been early rumours that Steve Jobs, chief executive, might make an unexpectedly early return from ill health at the conference.However, the company said his return was not expected until the end of June.Meanwhile Palm, Apple’s latest competitor in the smartphone market, retreated 6.5 per cent to $12.16 in spite of reports that the company’s Pre phone had sold out at some stores during its launch over the weekend.Investors were concerned the new iPhone would reassert Apple’s position in the market.Verisign, which operates internet domain names, fell more than any other on the S&P after a court on Friday allowed an antitrust suit against the company which claims its pricing of the .com and .net domain names is artificially high.The company’s shares slumped 14.2 per cent to $19.90.

Ari Balogh, the chief technology officer who joined from Verisign only a year ago, is the coming man who has been put in charge.This does not mean that Ash Patel, EVP of the previous Audience Product Division, is the going man, but he does appear to be lower down the pecking order now as leader of some kind of Product Evangelist group.Yahoo has divided itself into two regions – North America and International. Before it was US, Europe, Asia Pacific and Emerging Markets. Hilary Schneider, EVP Yahoo US, stays in charge of North America with an International leader to be “hired soon”. Both regions report directly to the CEO.The new head of Global Mobile Business, David Ko, will report to Ms Schneider. This division replaces Connected Life, whose EVP Marco Boerries is leaving the company, it was announced this week. Ko had been a deputy to Boerries.Then there is Bartz’s first major appointment. She has created the role of Chief Marketing Officer for Elisa Steele, who will join from Netapp on March 23.Given all the upheaval and departures over the past two years, Ms Bartz wants the new arrangements to stick.“This structure is designed to last two to four years; however, we’ll continue to make adjustments as needed. But we expect this core structure will stay in place,” said a Yahoo spokesperson.So the major departures unveiled this week have been Boerries, Neeraj Khemlani, the head of Yahoo’s News and Information division, who is joining Hearst, and the CFO Blake Jorgensen, who will hang around until a successor is appointed.By the way , Sue Decker, Yahoo’s president, who missed out on the CEO’s job and announced her departure in January, has not left the building yet. The spokesperson said she was “still transitioning.”"
14;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2009-02-17T23:28:55Z;Real downturn hits virtual world;;New registrations for internet domain names are the latest victim of the economic downturn, according to research published on Wednesday.Verisign, the company which manages the .com and .net domains, has found the number of domain names registered in the fourth quarter of last year fell 17 per cent compared with the same period in 2007.More new sites are being registered in Russia and China, but most areas of the world saw a decline. Only 36 per cent of the 25 largest country-code domains saw growth in the fourth quarter, Verisign said, “driven largely by the weakening of the world economy”.Analysts said the decline reflected a reduction in the number of companies starting up and a slowdown in online advertising.The Russian domain, .ru, saw growth of 11 per cent and the Chinese domain, .cn, grew 8 per cent, driven in part by the relatively new availability of domain names that do not use the Latin alphabet.Some 10.1m new domain names were registered in the fourth quarter, taking total registrations to 117m.In 2008, an average of 11.9m new domain names were registered each quarter, compared with a quarterly average of 12.2m in 2007.“What we can see is a little slowdown on the [pay per click] market,” said Tobias Wann, leader for Verisign’s domain name services in Europe, referring to domains registered for putting up advertising sites. “But there is also a little less [registration] activity on traditional domain names, like [individuals] or a company.”●Consumer demand for data services on mobile phones, such as accessing e-mail or browsing the internet, is rising despite the global economic downturn, a survey released on Monday found, Reuters reports from Barcelona. The survey of 50,000 consumers in Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Spain and the US found more than half of those who already used mobile data expected to use it more often in the next two years.

16;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2008-11-11T23:01:16Z;How fraudsters found bigger phish to fry;;If you thought spam was a problem, things are only set to get worse with phishing. Most e-mail users are used to spam – the irritating unsolicited e-mail trying to sell you something. It is easy to spot. But phishing, a form of fraudulent spam that attempts to get account information from individuals or install malicious programmes on their machines, is becoming smarter.For one thing, phishing e-mails have become slicker and more personalised. Richard Howard, director of intelligence at iDefense, a security intelligence company, says: “This is a trend change, from global to targeted. It is now senior executives in major financial institutions. And the bad guys aren’t just after retail accounts but big commercial accounts. An e-mail asks you to go to a specific web page, and once you are there, they own you.”The programming behind the e-mails is also becoming more sophisticated. According to Rik Ferguson, senior security adviser at TrendMicro: “This isn’t bedroom coders any more – it’s a mainstream business.” A new malware (malicious software) programme is created every six seconds and, once installed, they are getting harder to detect.Part of the problem is the volume of e-mail in the workplace. Simon Church, vice-president of VeriSign, a security company, says: “In the general course of the day you get so much interaction from friends and colleagues, it could come from anywhere.”Spam is still a vast problem. It is estimated that over 100bn spam e-mails are sent every day. But the number of targeted e-mail attacks is also rising at a phenomenal rate. Trend Micro, an internet security company, calculates that in 2005 there were on average two such attacks globally a week. That rose to over 1,000 a day by late 2007, and shows no signs of slowing down.Phishing attacks are often sent out in short bursts. On October 16, MessageLabs, the online security firm, intercepted 7,000 phishing attacks purporting to be from Bank of America in an attack that took place over two hours. The next day, the BofA phishing e-mails more than doubled to 15,000 and during the weekend reached a total of over 125,000. And that was only 16 per cent of all phishing for the weekend – a total of more than 780,000 e-mails.Some phishing attacks use the same principle as spam, which is a simple numbers game: send out as many as possible and the chances are some careless or confused people will give you their details. But the new trend, known as “spear phishing”, is to target wealthy people using personalised e-mails. And if the target also has a high public profile, the attack is known as “whale phishing”.A recent whale phishing target was the chief executive of one of the biggest banks in the US. Like many chief executives, his e-mail was handled by staff in the office. The message was convincing, as it had a document attached that related to a potential lawsuit. According to one of the senior executives at the bank: “The e-mail sent to the CEO was then forwarded to the legal department, and 15 people clicked on that link. The recipients did not think it would be malicious, as the e-mail came from someone they knew.”Unbeknown to the recipients, opening the attached document in the e-mail installed a keystroke logger – a programme that records all the activity on a computer entered on the keyboard and sends it to a remote location where the attackers can analyse it, picking up passwords and other details. Fortunately, the bank had been warned of some sort of attack, and had put blocks in place to prevent the malware being installed.Another recent whale phishing attack was directed at the head of an internet security company. Dave DeWalt, chief executive of McAfee, received an e-mail that was so convincing that even he was nearly duped.“It was from my bank. They knew I was out of the country, they knew where I was, and it said my accounts had been suspended,” he says. “It had some of my account information in it and asked me to re-authenticate myself. This was a highly sophisticated attack on me, and they may have called my office to find where I was.”Mr DeWalt was too savvy to click on the link: “I thought straightaway that my bank would call over something like this rather than send an e-mail.” But tracking down the owner of the website behind the e-mail proved too hard even for a security company as powerful as McAfee. The website IP address, commonly used to identify a site, changed over 1,000 times in the following week, making it almost untraceable.Stories of fraud and phishing have only increased the confusion over internet and banking security.When it was revealed that Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, had money stolen from his bank account in October, the French government launched an inquiry into how the account was hacked. Some articles reported that Mr Sarkozy had been a victim of a phishing attack, yet police reports suggested that the criminals did not know the identity of the president when they accessed his account, suggesting it was probably a direct debit fraud or similar activity.The response by the French government was to place the security spotlight on the bank. However, most internet fraud is prompted by people who fail to safeguard bank details or choose passwords that are easy to guess.Almost all banks now ask only for specific characters from passwords, not the password in full. And many use two forms of authentication – a phone call or text message as well as an e-mail.So how can people stay safe online? Mr Howard has a golden rule: “Never click on a link in an e-mail,” he says. “Never ever ever. Not even if you know them.”You have been warned.
17;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2008-09-16T15:53:29Z;Security matters: Every piece of data lengthens a digital shadow;;According to the computer industry, the amount of data stored on IT systems is doubling roughly every 18 months to two years. Industry watchers believe that the total size of the worldwide digital archive stands at just short of 10m petabytes.Much of that data is being generated by businesses, in the form of e-mails, PowerPoint presentations and the output from enterprise IT systems. Another large chunk of data comes from the move towards digital storage and distribution of music, TV, photographs and even books.A large and growing amount of this digital data is either about, or generated by, individuals, quite possibly without their knowledge. Internet users might post personal information on blogs or on social networking sites such as Facebook or MySpace, or business networking sites such as LinkedIn.But we also hand over personal data whenever we interact with a website, either by logging on to carry out banking and other financial transactions or, in the case of many e-commerce sites, simply by searching. Amazon.com, for example, remembers what you searched for last time you visited the site and also lists items bought by other shoppers who entered similar search terms.Such shopping hints can be fun and even useful. But, as Jannis Kallinikos, professor of information systems at the London School of Economics cautions, it also leads to a build-up of an alternative, online persona or “digital shadow”.Professor Kallinikos describes the digital shadow as a series of traces, left by individuals each time they do something online. “What can or should become of our growing digital shadows is destined to become a contested and probably bitter economic and political issue,” he says.The growth of the digital shadow raises questions about both privacy and security. Some internet users – especially the younger generation – might not mind if their searches or transactions are recorded and, if that information is then used to offer shopping hints or promotions.Others, though, might not be so sanguine. It is easy to see how even something as innocent as an online search for books could become a privacy issue: you might not want details of searches about a sensitive medical condition, or still less a subject such as marital infidelity, to show up the next time someone visits that site from the family PC.Often, individuals will have little or no control over such data, or how it is used. Ownership of data is typically held by the online store in question, according to Kelly Dempski, director of research for Human-Computer Interaction at Accenture Technology Labs. But younger internet users appear to have few qualms about divulging information, even to commercial organisations.“I have a member of staff working for me who is in his early 30s and he has pictures of his son on [photo-sharing site] Flickr,” he says. “He has established his own rules about what he will share: anything he doesn’t want his grandmother to see, doesn’t go online. He believes that the benefits of sharing information outweigh the risks.”Nonetheless, some social networking sites, such as Facebook, have moved to enhance the security and privacy settings on offer to their members. But, as Mr Demski points out, social networking sites have to strike a balance between allowing members freedom of expression, protecting their privacy and keeping sites convenient to use.“There are question marks about implementing security controls in a way that is easy to use and easy to understand,” he says. “If you confront someone with 15 different options, they won’t know how to set it up.”The need for individuals to control their digital shadow is becoming more pressing, however, as evidence grows that cybercriminals are targeting social networking sites for information that can then be used for identity theft and other forms of fraud.“There is a problem that, not just online, but throughout your life, you give away information that you consider personal and secret,” says Ken Silva, CTO of security technology company VeriSign. “For Americans, the social security number is given out so many times, to so many people, that it cannot be considered a secret. My date of birth and my mother’s maiden name are not secret …people give away an alarming amount of information, for very little in return.”There is a real risk, according to some information security experts, that cybercriminals will start by “harvesting” information from publicly-available websites such as social networks or even genealogy sites. Such harvesting could make it far easier for criminals to find the personal information they need to, say, operate a stolen or cloned credit card. In the wrong hands, even someone’s home address could be sensitive data.The problem is made more serious still, by the tendency for banks and other organisations to rely heavily on personal and biographical information to verify individuals’ identities, not just when they apply for accounts or services, but when they operate them. Password reset requests, for example, are all too often verified by asking personal questions such as someone’s mother’s maiden name.“We are granting credit or carrying out transactions on the basis of very weak information,” says Jay Heiser, research vice president at industry analysts Gartner. “Rather than finding stronger means of authentication, we are wrapping more after-the-fact protection around something that is already broken.”The answer could lie in moving to more robust forms of authentication, for anything from online shopping to banking services. Such measures could mean introducing either tokens, which generate one-time codes, or using biometric information. “There is no static information that can be kept secret for a lifetime,” says Verisign’s Mr Silva.However, the logistics of operating large-scale strong authentication systems might point towards the need to set up shared authentication services, to make the measures both convenient and cost effective. Relatively few such services exist.“There is already plenty of use of tokens and two-factor authentication in online banking and there are some innovative technologies being deployed, such as measuring the rhythm of your keystrokes,” explains Mike Maddison, leader of security and privacy services at Deloitte, the professional services firm. “But we are not yet seeing much in the way of outsourced authentication.”But if such measures were to become a reality, they would have an additional benefit: personal information would be personal, rather than the basis of security. Internet users would then be free to disclose whatever information they chose.

Apple owns its own proprietary DRM software, which means that the content it sells on its iTunes store can only play on iPods and other Apple devices.“I’m not sure that the absence of Apple is a negative to what we’re trying to achieve,” said Mr Singer. “Apple is a very good ecosystem that will continue to sell content. What we’re focusing on is a different type of consumer that really wants more choice.”Devices and websites compatible with the set of agreed standards will bear a new logo.Mr Singer said this would make it easier for consumers to understand what they were buying. The consortium was taking the “lessons learned from the successful ‘buy once, play anywhere’ experience that we enjoy with CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray today”.The new standards will also allow consumers that have paid for content to access it remotely, via a “rights locker”, he added. “You will be able to stream your content to enabled devices in the same way that you can share photos on the internet. Why shouldn’t that same concept also apply to movies?”DECE has attracted a range of companies from across the technology, retailing and media industries. Alcatel-Lucent, HP, Cisco, Intel and Toshiba have all signed up. Fox Entertainment Group, Lionsgate and Verisign, the internet security group, have also joined.Nico Popp, vice-president of innovation at Verisign, stressed the open credentials of the consortium. “If you look at the market place, open [standards] always win. There’s a big demand for consumption of content online waiting to be unleashed. We want to tap into that … the more successful we are the more people will want to participate.”
19;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;VeriSign parts company with CEO;;VeriSign, the world’s leading provider of the electronic certificates that help secure internet traffic, on Thursday announced the departure of its chief executive.The company said William Roper, who joined the VeriSign board in 2003 and took the top job last year, had agreed to step down as CEO and vacate his board seat.VeriSign, which also makes money by managing the .com and .net internet domains, stressed that Mr Roper’s departure was voluntary.But the timing of the announcement – which came in the afternoon before a US bank holiday weekend - raised eyebrows on Wall Street.“This kind of came out of left field,” said one analyst.VeriSign said Jim Bidzos, the company’s founder and chairman, would take over CEO duties until a permanent replacement could be found.Shares of VeriSign fell 1.3 per cent to $36.74 as investors digested the news. The company’s stock price had risen more than 45 per cent since Mr Roper was appointed CEO last May.Mr Roper’s departure comes as VeriSign is attempting to dispose of its telecommunications billing group and other non-core businesses as part of a restructuring plan.VeriSign announced in November that it planned to shed its telecommunications units and re-focus on the internet security market that has traditionally underpinned its growth.Asked to explain the reason for the sudden management change, Mr Bidzos said the company had reached a “natural tipping point” in its reorganisation, and that Mr Roper had decided to step down so that the company could focus on expanding its range of existing products.In a statement, Mr Roper said he had enjoyed his time at the helm of the company. “I wish the best for my former colleagues as I move on to the next chapter in my career.”The company on Thursday said it remained on track to complete its divestitures by the end of the year, in spite of a difficult credit and financing environment for potential acquirers.“These aren’t the best times in the world but we expect to be on track for the end of the year,” said Mr Bidzos.Prior to his time at VeriSign, Mr Roper served as chief financial officer of Science Applications International Corp, a big defence department contractor.
20;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2008-01-16T01:24:34Z;Samwers join Facebook;;German internet entrepreneurs Marc, Oliver and Alexander Samwer said they had taken a stake in Facebook and would help the US social networking site with a planned roll-out of websites for European markets.Oliver Samwer told FT Deutschland, the FT’s sister-paper, that the investment was “very important” to him and his brothers, although he declined to reveal the size of the stake or how much they paid for it.As part of the deal, he said, the Samwers would help Facebook “recruit staff and generate [web] traffic” for its planned German service, a rival to StudiVZ, which they helped fund.They will join forces with Facebook at a time when one of Silicon Valley’s biggest recent success stories is embarking on a potentially more difficult phase as it recruits outsiders.Last spring, the company announced it would allow outside developers to make games, slideshows and other gadgets for its service – a move that seems to have lured the Samwer brothers.The co-operation with Facebook led to speculation that the trio, who run a venture capital fund, had paid less than others who bought into the privately held US group late last year.US software giant Microsoft paid $240m for 1.6 per cent of the company. Hong Kong investor Li Ka-shing paid $60m for 0.4 per cent.It is unlikely that the amount the Samwers spent on their stake exceeds those made by fellow shareholders.In 1999, the Samwers set up German auction site alando.de, selling it to US rival Ebay months later for $43m. They sold their next venture, Jamba, which marketed the successful Crazy Frog ringtone, to VeriSign of the US for $273m in 2004.They also helped fund German student networking site StudiVZ, which they reportedly tried to sell to Facebook in return for a 5 per cent stake in the US company a little under two years ago.The Samwers exited that investment at the start of 2007. That experience could stand them in good stead with Facebook, which has to navigate a mire of German privacy rules.Facebook could not be reached for comment.
21;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2007-06-01T20:23:32Z;Wall St rallies as data boost sentiment;;Wall Street enjoyed another banner week, with the S&P 500 and other benchmarks moving into record territory.Deals and earnings continued to provide a catalyst for big moves in a number of stocks. Technology and small capitalised stocks led gains as a series of economic reports this week suggested that the economy could enter summer on an upswing. While that outlook has largely reduced the chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut this year, stock investors focused on the bright side of a robust economy in 2007.“This week’s data has shown that the economy is gathering momentum,” said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services. “Retail investors have not been buyers of late and this should start to bring them back.”Late on Friday, the S&P closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,536.34, a gain of 1.4 per cent this week. The benchmark closed above its March 2000 record level of 1,527.46 on Wednesday and is now up 8.3 per cent so far this year.Mr Anderson said the S&P 500 is currently valued at attractive levels and that investors should look to favour growth over value stocks and also domestic rather than international equities.Blue chips also moved further into uncharted territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average made its 26th record close this year on Friday. The Dow rose 0.3 per cent to close at 13,668.11 and had made a new intra-day high of 13,692, for a rise of 1.2 per cent this week.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to finish at 2,613.92 for a gain of 2.2 per cent this week. For the year, the Nasdaq is up 8.2 per cent and approaching 2006’s gain of 9.5 per cent. The Russell 2000 index rose 0.7 per cent and closed in record territory on Friday, for a gain of 2.8 per cent this week.Among stocks in the news on Friday, Dell rose 1.45 per cent to $27.30, for a weekly rise of 5 per cent, as its its first quarter earnings beat estimates. The computer maker announced a 10 per cent cut in its workforce after the results.Shares in Dow Jones surged 14.8 per cent to $61.20 on Friday, for a gain of 18.3 per cent this week. The Bancroft family which controls Dow, said it would it would meet and discuss the $5bn offer made by News Corp in April. Shares in News Corp rose 2.5 per cent to $24.22.On Friday, shares in CKX, which operates Elvis Presley’s Graceland estate, rose 37.8 per cent to $14.65, after the company received a $1.3bn buy-out offer from Robert Sillerman, its chairman and chief executive.“We continue to believe the company will ultimately accept the $60-a-share offer from News Corp, with concessions that ensure the journalistic integrity of Dow Jones publications,” said James Peters, publishing industry analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research. “We do not see competing bids emerging.”Earlier in the week, Wachovia said it would buy AG Edwards, a brokerage firm, in a $6.8bn deal. Shares in Wachovia fell 1 per cent to $54.51, while AG Edwards jumped 17.3 per cent to $88.75 this week. The deal will make Wachovia the second largest US retail brokerage after Merrill Lynch.Ceridian rose 7.2 per cent to 35.41 after the information services company agreed to a $5.3bn private equity buy-out.The battle for the CBOT Holdings intensified this week. The InterContinental Exchange struck a $665m deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange to support its bid the CBOT.At this stage, the CBOT has agreed to be bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and has thus far not expressed a preference for a competing bid from ICE. This week, ICE fell 1.4 per cent to $142.97, CBOT rose 2.4 per cent to $196.98, while CME gained 4.6 per cent to $537.Archstone-Smith Trust, a real estate investment trust, was purchased for about $22.2bn, including debt, by Tishman Speyer Properties and Lehman Brothers. ASN rallied 11.5 per cent to $61.57.CDW, the technology retailer agreed to a $7.3bn private equity offer and is shares rose 12.6 per cent to $85.07 this week.In other deal news, Avaya, the office telecommunications-equipment maker, was in discussion with private equity firms and other investors about a possible sale of the company or its divisions. Avaya rose 17.6 per cent to $16.08 this week.Dendreon, jumped 24 per cent to $8.10 this week, after regulators approved its experimental prostate vaccine.Despite the general rally in blue chips, Citigroup dropped 1.1 per cent to $54.51. The bank is one of only five stocks in the Dow that are negative performers to date this year, down 2.1 per cent. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who holds 4 per cent of the stock, gave a ”vote of confidence” to Chuck Prince, chief executive, and said the company should be given ”some time to perform”.Citigroup’s shares rose sharply last month on news that Eddie Lampert’s hedge fund had built a 0.3 per cent stake prompting speculation that he might press for a shake-up.Google rose back above $500 for the first time since the start of February, gaining 3.5 per cent to $501.39 this week. The company released details about its new Gears technology that will enable people to browse internet services, including e-mail, either online, offline or intermittently connected to a network.Shares in Adobe rose 5.1 per cent to $44.53 on news the software designer will incorporate Google’s new gears.Biogen Idec rose 5.7 per cent to $52.29 this week after it approved a $3bn buy-back of its stocks.Wal-Mart raised its share buy-back program to $15bn, on Friday and sent its shares up 3.9 per cent to $49.47.Ciena recorded its third straight quarterly profit and raised its sales forecast. The network equipment maker jumped 16.4 per cent to $34.92.Verisign rose 11.4 per cent to $30.36 this week after chief executive Stratton Sclavos resigned.
22;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2007-05-30T20:50:28Z;S&P 500 hits record high after Fed minutes;;The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Wednesday, as investors looked on the bright side of the Federal Reserve’s recent meeting minutes.While stocks are set to record their third straight positive monthly gain on Thursday, investors face a cocktail of potentially potent economic data due on Friday.On Wednesday, fears that a sharp slide in Chinese stocks overnight would spark a similar reaction on Wall Street faded early. Stocks opened lower but losses were quickly contained. “Any link between Shanghai and the S&P 500 is tenuous at best,” said Jack Ablin, portfolio manager at Harris Private Bank.For some investors, the lack of a major pullback in US stocks was disappointing.“We were ready for some opportunities in equities if there was a large sell-off,” said Michael Kastner, port-folio manager at Sterling-Stamos.After the Fed minutes were released, the leading benchmarks made fresh highs and the S&P 500 index finished up 0.8 per cent at 1,530.23, above its March 2000 close of 1,527.46. The June S&P futures contract rebounded from a low of 1,512.60 earlier in the day and closed at a new contract high of 1,532.50. Within the S&P, the energy and telecoms sectors led gains, while health care lingered in negative territory.The Nasdaq Composite shrugged off early losses and closed up 0.8 per cent at 2,592.59, a fresh six year high. A decline of 0.4 per cent in semiconductor stocks dented the technology sector, led by Intel, down 1 per cent at $22.08 and Applied Materials, off 1.5 per cent at $18.93.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 13,633.08, its 25th record close this year. Caterpillar, up 3.6 per cent at $78.48, led gainers in the Dow.Healthcare stocks Merck, down 1.3 per cent at $52.71, and Pfizer, off 0.5 per cent at $27.41, both weighed on the blue-chip benchmark.A bright spot in the healthcare sector was Biogen Idec, up 5.9 per cent at $52.13 after it approved a $3bn buy-back of its stocks.With attention focused on employment, inflation and manufacturing reports due on Friday, stocks generally traded in a narrow range.“All eyes are on the employment report,” said Mr Ablin. “The labour market has been sustaining the consumer in the face of higher gas prices and weak housing.”On Wednesday, ADP said it expects 97,000 new private sector jobs were created in May. The ADP report which excludes government workers suggests payrolls will be around 117,000 this month, below the current consensus call of 135,000.Traders believe a payroll gain of at least 100,000 jobs will be enough to soothe concerns that the labour market is faltering.Mr Kastner said investors were hoping that capital investment spending would take over from consumer spending in pulling up economic growth and take over from consumer spending in the months ahead. He also believed corporate earnings were likely to fall this year, pressuring stock valuations.Merger and acquisition activity on Wednesday was led by the news that CDW the technology retailer had agreed to a $7.3bn private equity buy-out.InterContinental Exchange struck a $665m deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the hope of boosting the chances of its hostile bid for CBOT Holdings.At this juncture, the CBOT has agreed to be bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ICE hopes its deal with CBOE will resolve a legal dispute between the options exchange and CBOT, which argues that some of its members are entitled to an equity stake in CBOE.Shares in ICE rose 0.65 per cent to $148.71, CBOT shares gained 2.4 per cent to $197.62, while CME was up 0.4 per cent at $527.85.In other deal news, eSpeed, an electronic bond trading platform controlled by Cantor Fitzgerald, said it would buy BGC Partners, Cantor’s privately held brokerage unit, in a $1.3bn deal. Shares in eSpeed rose 0.4 per cent to $9.23.In earnings news, Coldwater Creek reported a stronger than forecast first quarter profit and the retailer rose 16.6 per cent to $24.37.Pulte Homes said it would cut 16 per cent of its workforce, and shares fell 0.1 per cent to $27.41.Shares in Coca-Cola were up 1.6 per cent at $53.05. Citigroup upgraded the beverage maker to a “buy” with a $59 price target.NiSource fell 7.8 per cent to $22.07 after the utility said it had concluded talks without selling its Indiana electricity assets, but would still consider spinning off that unit. Utility stocks have recently pared solid gains this year – the S&P utility sector is up 12.8 per cent in 2007 – as investors have become concerned at the sector’s low dividend yield as compared with rising bond yields.“Utilities have run a little further beyond reasonable valuations,” said Mr Ablin.Verisign was 5.3 per cent higher at $29.43 after chief executive Stratton Sclavos resigned. The internet infrastructure company’s stock is up 22.1 per cent this year on the back of expansion and diversification of its operations.
23;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2007-02-11T14:57:20Z;Verisign braces for DNS onslaught;;"The internet is preparing itself for the onslaught of new web-enbled mobile phones, the uptake of internet television and an increasing number of phone calls made online.The latest sign was Verisign’s announcement last week that it would spend more than $100m to increase its capacity 10-fold over the next three years.Verisign, which runs the .com and .net domain names and directs internet traffic at two of the 13 ‘root’ servers that direct the world’s internet traffic, said it had had a ""wake-up call"" on capacity needs.Industry forecasts estimate that global internet users will nearly double to 1.8bn by 2010. Much of this will come from the world’s 2bn mobile phone users buying internet-enabled phones. In countries like India and China, the mobile phone may be the primary way to access the internet.In addition, households will be increasingly hooking up their TVs and home phones to the internet.All this creates more traffic for Verisign to deal with. Each time anyone clicks on a .com or a .net website or checks email, that is another query for Verisign’s DNS servers to handle. But now, in addition to just individuals sending queries, the servers will be handling traffic each time someone changes channel on internet TV, or makes a voice over IP call.Verisign currently handles 24bn queries a day and has capacity to handle up to 400bn. It is now ramping capacity to 4,000bn a day.The scale of what it is doing is pretty astounding. In 2000 Verisign had servers in 8 locations. Over the last seven years that has slightly more than doubled to 20. Now Verisign are increasing that to 130 over three years.Ken Silva, chief security officer at Verisign said the company was also building an increasing buffer against hackers. The more capacity there is the harder it is for hackers to overwhelm the system with denial of service attacks.Last week hackers mounted the largest attack for four years on the root servers. Although it had the security guys and the techies scrambling, ordinary users barely noticed.Hurrah for the robustness of the internet. But would the system stand up to an attack three years from now, if millions of Chinese and Indian smartphones were recruited into overwhelming botnet armies?"
24;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2007-01-08T20:56:41Z;High fliers make a mark in domain names;;I am jealous. Not of the usual suspects. I am fine with all the 30-something hedge fund managers making $20m bonuses. I have dealt with the fact that there are managing directors at the big investment banks who earn $10m a year. That is fine. I don’t want to work at an investment bank. Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs did not respond to my e-mails six years ago anyway.I am jealous of the people who registered names such as sex.com, vodka.com and business.com. Sex.com sold for $12m last year to a private equity group. Vodka.com sold for $2m, business.com for $7.5m in 1999. The list goes on. Last week antispyware.com sold for $550,000. And this past year, the misspelled mortage.com garnered $242,000. They were smart people who registered these names.We all knew, back in the early 1990s, that the internet was going to be big. But few had the business sense to make a land grab on domain names. It was even free to register then.Cover this paper for a second and try to guess the first “.com” registered. Your hunch might be ibm.com or microsoft.com but that is not the case. The first was symbolics.com. Symbolics, Inc was a spin-out of MIT that made “Lisp machines”. Do you use a Lisp machine?It is natural that the domain name business would intersect with the hedge fund world. I called Jeff Burkey who runs hedgefunddomain.net. He sells domains for hedge funds. Say you were an amateur pilot paying your dues at Goldman Sachs and now you’re ready to start your own hedge fund. You had your heart set on Aviator Capital but aviatorcapital.com is already taken. Don’t sweat it. Burkey owns it. And he has it for sale for $10,000.That is nothing if you’re launching a $700m hedge fund. He has great names for sale, including maximacapital.com and lucentcapital.com, each for $10,000. “The theory is similar to a deep out of the money option strategy,” he said. “Since I buy all the domains directly from the registrar, my cost is very low, less than $10 per year,” Burkey said. “I buy most knowing full well they will expire worthless. I only need a few to hit for a solid ROI.”The idea was born when he tried to register a domain name, terrapincapital.com. “It was taken so I registered two derivatives, diamondbackcapital.com and testudocapital.com.”A few months later Chad Loweth and others started a $500m fund and happened to name it Diamondback Capital. “So I learnt a little HTML and hedgefunddomain.net went live. It’s been a lot of fun.”When I spoke to Burkey, vodka.com had just been sold for $3m and he’d been trying to register whiskey.com, sherry.com and others. Of course, they were all taken.It turned out that Bob Chapman, a hedge fund manager and shareholder activist, owned sherry.com. I rang Bob and asked when he started buying domain names.“In March 1996, it was obvious to me that .com versus .net etc was beachfront real estate available for lease at $35 a year. A true no-brainer,” he said. Had he received offers for any of the domain names he owns? “Yes,” he said, “but they were not bought with an intent to sell for a profit, instead to use them. Several telco service operators have offered me over $3m for calls.com – to compete against Skype – but I am holding out for a much higher price. Given that all calls are going to be made over the internet in the next 10 years, calls.com is the hotels.com of that space.”Several public companies are in the domain name business and I think most of them are interesting buys. It is worth taking a look at a pseudo-domain name index.First, there is Marchex (MCHX), started by Russ Horowitz, former Go2Net founder and chief executive. The company owns more than 200,000 names, including domains for every zip code. Marchex trades for a tad over 10 times cash flows and had year-over-year revenue growth of 26 per cent last quarter.Communicate.com (CMNN.ob, which trades over the counter) is a small public company that is sitting on quite a few domain names, including importers.com, perfume.com, body.com and cricket.com. The company has been generating revenue by selling domain names but, more recently, by setting up e-commerce sites on some of these domains and making decent money from retail.InterSearch Group (IGM) on the Amex owns valuable domains such as irs.com. TuCows, another Amex-listed company, helps connect buyers and sellers of domain names and takes fees in the middle. TuCows is currently the fourth largest domain name registrar.Private company GoDaddy is in first place. GoDaddy is a veritable cash machine but pulled its S1 filing because it didn’t like how GAAP forced it to defer, sometimes for years, cash revenues the company already had in the bank. “There’s no need for us to go public,” Bob Parsons, chief executive, said at the time.The grandaddy of the domain name business is Verisign, which is the provider of all the .com and .net domain names. All of the registrars are simply reselling domain names they acquire through Verisign. VRSN has a clean balance sheet with $500m in net cash and trades for a little over 10 times cash flows.This will be the year we finally forget about the dotcom bust. There are many private internet companies ready to go public. Just look at Zappos, the online shoe company, which is enormously profitable. And the venture capitalists are itching to exit some trades and put money to work in others.The land grab for domain names is far from over, both in the hedge fund world and the real world, and I think the companies mentioned here are worth a look.james@formulacapital.com
25;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2006-09-13T12:52:38Z;Wall St higher as earnings cheer investors;;"US stocks climbed on Tuesday, in a broad-based rally, as better-than-expected earnings reports buoyed investor confidence.Investment bank Goldman Sachs reported a fall in third-quarter profit but still beat analyst estimates, sending its shares up 4.8 per cent to $158.30, its best day since March.McDonald’sbeat forecasts when it reported a 6 per cent rise in August sales, helped by new menus in Europe. The stock rose 2.9 per cent to a six-year high of $38.18.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 1 per cent, or 13.58 points, at 1,313.12, while the Nasdaq Composite had added 2 per cent, or 42.57 points, to 2,215.82. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.9 per cent, or 101.25 points, to 11,498.09.Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at CIBC World Markets, said the market had been pleasantly surprised by the beginning of the third-quarter earnings season.“Some of the earnings have come in above consensus. The early numbers were encouraging,” he said.Mr Kumar said investors’ spirits were also raised by the continued lower oil prices, with crude hitting new six-month lows of $63.76 a barrel.“In the market, there’s still a sense that if oil prices are going down, the risk of a precipitous earnings decline goes down.”Electronics retailer Best Buy jumped 9.2 per cent to $52.15 after it announced a better than expected increase in second-quarter earnings, aided by sales of flat-panel televisions. Best Buy competitor Circuit City also gained, adding 7.2 per cent to $25.27.The robust earnings and lower oil prices raised hopes that the consumer economy was stronger than originally thought, helping to lift homebuilding stocks. DR Horton leapt 5.7 per cent to $23.62 and Pulte gained 6.7 per cent to $31.48. The S&P homebuilder index hit its highest level since June.Archer Daniels Midland, maker of ethanol fuel additives, continued to suffer from lower oil prices, shedding 2.9 per cent to $37.22. ADM is still up over 50 per cent this year.Investors were unfazed by news that communications software maker Comverse Technology would delay filing financial reports concerning its stock options programme, focusing instead on news of a 38 per cent rise in second-quarter sales at the company. Its shares jumped 8.1 per cent to $22.18.Semiconductor stocks were helped after Credit Suisse upgraded the entire semiconductor sector.Applied Materials, manufacturer of chipmaking equipment, rose 6.2 per cent to $17.44 and Broadcom gained 7.3 per cent to $28.42. Lam Research jumped
8.2 per cent to $42.56.Supermarket chain Kroger reported higher second-quarter earnings, but its shares slumped 5.8 per cent to $22.69 after profit margins fell short of some analyst expectations."
26;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2006-07-11T14:34:37Z;The advantages of sealing wax;;If I was a revolting baron sending a message to King John in the late Middle Ages I would be likely to use a wax seal. I would take my letter, fold it, and then use wax to join the folds in such a way that an attempt to open it would crack the wax.I would then imprint the wax with my seal which could be a ring or some other complex stamp. In this way the King could be reasonably sure that the message had not been tampered with and that I was the sender.In a strange twist of “progress”, most electronic messages today have much less authentication than even a simple wax seal. The information in a plain e-mail, including details of the sender, can be modified without restriction.E-mail spoofing of this sort is used to try to crash and compromise systems, obtain information by deception or simply to disguise unsolicited advertisements or spam. One variant of this that I find particularly annoying is the rejection messages that end up in my inbox because my e-mail address has been spoofed as the return address to a message whose delivery fails.A method of message authentication, which could greatly reduce such issues, has existed for many years in the form of digital signatures. A mathematical computation provides the “wax” to prevent tampering with the message and a cryptographic key provides the “seal” to verify the sender. The keys for signatures are usually obtained from trusted third party companies such as Thawte or Verisign who have their public keys preloaded into many applications to make the process easier.While the average medieval gentleman would be expected to recognise the Great Seal of the Realm and other important seals it is probably a bit much to expect anyone to recognise my digital signature. So how does a recipient know the signature is mine?One solution (as used by CAcert and Thawte) is the “Web of Trust” which uses a community-based scheme. To validate my digital ID I have to meet several “notaries” in person with suitable documents to build up “points”. Once sufficient points have been accrued a validated digital signature is issued. In other methods the user has to be validated before the signature is issued but unfortunately this adds an extra step, and usually expense, that puts the average user off.Interestingly one of the documents suggested for the web of trust is a passport. In the UK, new passports contain electronic biometric information intended to allow positive identification of the holder. This could allow very direct linking of real and digital identities, although whether this is a good idea is another issue entirely.Unfortunately, probably because of lack of knowledge, incentive or a widely accepted distribution method, digital signatures are rarely used outside security circles. Microsoft is addressing the issue of digital identities with the CardSpace (formerly InfoCard) framework intended to simplify identity management for users. However Microsoft Passport, a previous initiative of this type, never really took off.As with most such projects there is an open source equivalent or complement in the shape of the Higgins Trust Framework that has gained support from Sun, IBM, Novell and others. Whether this will bear fruit is open to doubt.The scope of Higgins and CardSpace goes beyond simple digital signatures and includes single sign-on (password management), e-commerce (credit card information) and personal data.If current initiatives bring digital signatures into widespread use then maybe we can bring e-mail communication up to 14th century standards.■ James Bowers works for Pentest, an IT security company providing consultancy services in the UK, Europe and North America. www.pentest.co.uk
27;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2006-05-30T17:15:30Z;Websites face more attacks;;The number of co-ordinated attacks by criminals aimed at bringing down corporate and ecommerce websites for blackmail purposes has increased sharply in recent years.IT security firm Symantec estimates that distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks rose 51 per cent in the past six months of 2005 and detected an average of 1,402 attacks a day. Research by NOP adds that 13 per cent of UK businesses were affected by DDoS attacks in 2005, at a cost of more than £558m.Detective inspector Chris Simpson at London’s Scotland Yard computer crime unit says he expects to see a further rise in attacks: “The technology to launch such attacks is now in the public domain, or at least it is available to the technically proficient within the internet community,” he says.Inquisitive teenage hackers through to international crime gangs are increasingly able to buy DDoS tools over the internet and crash websites by bombarding them with thousands of page requests, he says.“DDoS attacks may be launched for a number of reasons: it could be extortion, as recent attacks against financial institutions have demonstrated through to revenge or political reasons,” says Mr Simpson.But so far, attacks have focused mainly on e-commerce sites that depend on the internet as their sole revenue source.One industry hit hard by DDoS attacks is online gambling. In March 2004, at the time of the UK Cheltenham horse races, several online bookmakers were targeted, including William Hill, Paddy Power and Blue Square.Criminals took control of thousands of home computers, which had been surreptitiously infected by a computer virus. The compromised computers, or “bots”, were used to send thousands of page requests to betting websites in an attempt overwhelm servers and take their business offline.The bookmakers were then contacted by extortionists: Blue Square, for example, was ordered to pay €7,000 to cease the attacks. Similar attacks have since occurred in the US in the build-up to the Super Bowl.“Online bookmakers are a clear target for this because they have a large flow of money and if they miss a sale, it’s gone. You can’t bet on the FA Cup the day afterwards,” says Phillip Hallam-Baker, principal scientist at IT security firm VeriSign.“Bots are being traded on internet bulletin boards. They start off being used for high value stuff like phishing and spam, and then the absolute dregs are used as DDoS attack droids,” he says.But Elad Shaviv, head of Cisco’s European security operations, says that while the majority of criminals are targeting companies who rely on the internet for their survival, some gangs are launching DDoS attacks for political reasons.For example, in 2004 political “hacktivists” distributed an e-mail virus called the Maslan-C worm. The e-mail tricked users into opening an attachment by claiming it contained pictures of a glamour model.While computer users were enjoying the images, hidden malware commandeered their computers and used them to launch an attack on Chechen separatist websites.Criminals have become even more sophisticated in their approach recently. In February, online payment processing firm StormPay was hit by a ferocious attack which closed its business for two days (see case study).“Attacks are coming from everywhere,” says Mr Shaviv, who works with internet hosting firms, such as Telecom Italia and AT&T to mitigate the problem.He says that the main problem businesses face is trying to spot genuine customer requests from those sent by cybercriminals. “There is no way to distinguish who really wants to do business with you. In the past, companies would just shut the door, but today you can filter traffic,” he says.Cisco, Juniper Networks and Prolexic, among others, are developing DDoS mitigation technology, which routes web page requests via a filter looking for anomalies and abnormal amounts of activity coming from one computer or location.Scotland Yard’s Mr Simpson advocates the use of such systems but says, as such protection can be costly, the decision should be balanced against the perceived risk a company faces: “If a significant percentage of your business is conducted online, then higher levels of investment are probably justified.”But Dr Hallam-Baker at VeriSign believes “prevention is better than cure”, saying more needs to be done to stamp out the botnets being used to launch DDoS attacks. While better education of computer users and anti-virus software can reduce infection rates, internet service providers should also do more to improve online security, he says.By introducing “reverse-firewall” technology into a computer’s modem connection, which can detect and block abnormal internet activity, problems could be greatly reduced, he says.“As a casual internet user you’re only going to read a certain number of web pages, talk to a certain number of friends and send a number of e-mails during a day. If your computer is making more than, say, 10,000 outbound contact requests an hour, then this should be spotted,” says Dr Hallam-Baker.“Ultimately what you need to do is drain the pond. Until you get rid of all the botnets you won’t get anywhere.”

broad-based infrastructure . . . The new forms of attack are taking over legitimate computers, potentially millions at a time . . . and you’re looking to shut down those IP addresses but those are our legitimate customers.”Mr Sclavos said a legitimate practice known as domain tasting was making the job of detecting criminal activity harder. Domain tasting is when companies take advantage of a five-day grace period, in which they can get a refund for any .com domains bought, to buy thousands of web addresses. They test those that receive the most traffic and surrender the rest for a refund.In the past 18 months Verisign’s registrations had risen from about 500,000 a week to 7m, he said. Domain tasting made it harder to figure out which .com addresses were being used for “phishing” attacks, where users were lured through e-mails to fake bank or eBay sites and asked to provide their personal log-in details."

Its shares advanced 3.2 per cent to $84.59 after it reported above-estimate quarterly earnings.The news failed to lift the biotechnology and drug sectors, with the respective Amex indices off 1.3 per cent and 0.9 per cent. However, the declines did little to dent year-to-date gains of 11.6 per cent and 1.3 per cent.Genaera shares edged off 1.1 per cent to $1.78 after it reported positive results of a clinical trial for an eye drug. ImClone Systems was up 1.4 per cent to $31.45 after analysts at UBS upgraded the stock in anticipation of renewed growth for the company’s Erbitux cancer drug.IBM shares put on 2.4 per cent to $83.19 and accounted for the bulk of the gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the information technology group received its second analyst upgrade in as many days.Alcoa, a fellow Dow component and the world’s leading aluminium producer, gave up the bulk of an opening advance for a gain of 0.8 per cent at $22.85 by the close. It exceeded its reduced earnings estimates when it reported quarterly results after the close on Monday.Among technology stocks, VeriSign, the payment processing software provider, gained 0.9 per cent to $20.21 after it agreed to sell a unit to PayPal, a subsidiary of Ebay, the online auctioneer. Its shares closed virtually unchanged at $40.46.Apple Computer gained 2.4 per cent to $51.59 ahead of the iPod maker’s quarterly earnings release after the close.K2, the sports equipment manufacturer, was among the worst performers on the New York Stock Exchange following its warning of lower earnings and sales amid softness in its paintball business. Shares lost 14.5 per cent to $9.14.By the close, the Dow gained 0.5 per cent, or 14.41 points to 10,253.17 while the broader S&P 500 index was up 0.2 per cent, or 2.46 points, at 1,184.87. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.9 per cent, or 17.83 points, to 2,061.09.However, the broader momentum of the market remained bearish, with Ken Tower, chief market analyst at Charles Schwab’s CyberTrader unit, saying that “the bulls’ backs are against the wall [and] they have their work cut out for them”.Many analysts expect the third-quarter results season to yield double-digit earnings growth for the fourteenth consecutive quarter.However, some market watchers have pointed to the fact that recent results look less impressive if they are stripped of the energy sector’s performance.Energy, up 30.6 per cent, and utilities, up 13.7 per cent, account for the bulk of the S&P 500’s returns this year, well ahead of healthcare, the only other rising industry group.

NeuLevel of the US, which runs .biz, has teamed up with Japan Registry Services and Core++ represents the registries of Korea, Brazil and South Africa.An independent adjudicator, Telcordia Technologies, has been appointed by Icann to assess the bids and its rankings are due to be published on Monday. Icann is obliged to enter into immediate negotiations with the top-ranked bidder to ensure a successor from the end of June.Meanwhile, a new domain for the European Union is about to be introduced with Icann giving its official approval for the .eu TLD last week.
31;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2005-02-28T20:07:34Z;Broadband ?helps to spread internet fraud';;Vietnam and Romania joined the US at the top of the league of countries generating the largest amounts of internet fraud over the recent Christmas holiday period, a study said on Monday.The two countries are new entrants to the list, part of a quarterly report by VeriSign, the US-based internet security company and website registrar.Hong Kong and Sweden were also identified for the first time as generating significant amounts of fraudulent internet transactions. In contrast, Indonesia, Israel, India, Nigeria and Malaysia, which topped the league in December 2003, were absent this time.The shift is thought to reflect the increasing penetration of high-speed internet access in countries such as Vietnam and Romania.In many cases the new internet service providers in these countries are less well protected against abuses, creating opportunities that fraudsters can exploit.The study also found that sites used in ?phishing? attacks were increasingly being hosted outside the US.?Phishing? is a rising type of internet fraud in which internet users are lured to a bogus website purporting to be the official website of their bank, for example and tricked into revealing account or credit card details.In the first half of last year only 37 per cent of the ?phishing? sites monitored by VeriSign were outside the US, but this had grown to 58 per cent by December.South Korea is the most popular location for these sites after the US, accounting for 7.3 per cent of the total. Germany is third on the list, accounting for 5.8 per cent.Fraudsters were increasingly moving to host their ?phishing? sites in diverse countries, VeriSign said, as it was generally more difficult for authorities to shut down sites that were hosted outside their borders.In response, several governments are concluding bilateral agreements to collaborate on internet fraud.The UK has a memorandum of understanding with Canada on consumer-related internet scams and is understood to be close to signing similar accords with Japan, the US and South Korea.
32;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2005-01-04T19:40:18Z;The surprise rise of the US ringtone;;"The sound of ringing cash registers would be the most appropriate tones for the phones of two US chief executives enjoying huge growth in their mobile content businesses.Stratton Sclavos, chairman and chief executive of VeriSign, is seeing more than double the expected revenues this year from Jamba, the European wireless content provider he acquired last June for $273m.Jim Voelker, InfoSpace chairman and CEO, anticipates twice as much as earlier guidance in sales this year from the US-based services developed through the company's acquisition of Moviso in 2003.Both believe the ringtone sales driving the business are the start of large revenue streams as more sophisticated mobile phones enable the creation of a new media network by operators.“We expected [sales of] $76m in the second half, but we had $75m in the third quarter and it looks like $85m this quarter,” says Mr Sclavos, whose companyalso focuses on infrastructure security and managing the servers behind addresses ending in ‘dotcom'.“I don't think we're alone in the poor forecasting business [for this industry] this year,” Mr Voelker says.“At the beginning of the year, we were guiding for our mobile business at around $40m; at this point it's up to $85m. Yet if someone had told me 20 months ago that I would be excited about being in the ringtones market, I would have thought they were crazy.”InfoSpace, best known as an internet search and directory business, had been distributing its ringtones through a European provider, Jippy, until it acquired Los Angeles-based Moviso for $25m in October 2003.It owns the trademark for Trutones the name being given to the latest ringtones that are perfectly reproduced samples of music capable of being played on top-of-the-range phones.“The uptake has been pretty rapid. [VeriSign's business] is almost all in Europe and ours is almost exclusively in the US, so it's more than just a local phenomenon.“We are still behind the penetration curve here that they have reached in Europe, but we are catching up,” Mr Voelker says.Jupiter Research, the technology research firm, predicts the installed base of ringtone-capable phones in the US will grow from 55 per cent of handsets in 2004 to 100 per cent by 2008. Downloads of music ringtones will grow from 6.1m in 2004 to 332.6m in 2009, creating US revenues of $897m in 2009.“Growth is currently very high, but it's from a small base,” Julie Ask, senior analyst at Jupiter, says.“Data as a percentage of revenues for European carriers is around 15 to 20 per cent, whereas it's still in single digits for US operators, so the US market has not taken off as quickly as thought.”She says this is a legacy of inter-operability problems between US carriers and the fact that Americans prefer their PCs to their phones for entertainment.Jamba's customers can download their ringtones by typing in a short code on their phones. They typically pay a subscription for five ringtones a month and VeriSign shares about 30 per cent of revenues with the carrier and royalties of 12 to 15 per cent to the content providers.“We do all the billing through the carriers and we license all the content from the traditional labels, so we are the middlemen,” Mr Sclavos says.Jamba has competition from companies such as Buongiorno and iTouch in Europe but is more than three times the size of its nearest competitor.VeriSign is testing the service in the US, where it will take on InfoSpace and companies such as Zingy and Ztango.“We think we are in the formative stages of the online content business at the moment. No one has really achieved critical mass,” Mr Sclavos says.This opens up the possibility that a big content company such as Yahoo will consolidate the sector, according to Mr Sclavos, although his opposite number believes the operators might resist this.“How open are the carriers going to be to allow their assets to be used by big brand names?” Mr Voelker asks.InfoSpace's business model is to sell to the carriers rather than the consumers, giving its own brand a low profile while taking a cut of operators' revenues. The next developments expected are video ringtones and the expansion of games on phones.“What we are seeing is the development of a whole new media network right now, it's tones. That could mutate into MP3s and video clips, games and directory products,” Mr Voelker says.VeriSign's chief says: “What we love is, every day there is a new product and there seems no end to the number of them that this mobile medium will support.”"
33;VRSN;Verisign Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
