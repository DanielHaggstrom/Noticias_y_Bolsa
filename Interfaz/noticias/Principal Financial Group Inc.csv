0;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2018-09-15T10:00:00Z;Principal Financial reshuffles top team;;Des Moines-based Principal Financial said it would deepen its presence in international markets with the creation of an enlarged global investment business following a senior management reshuffle.Last week’s shake-up led to the abrupt departure of the veteran Jim McCaughan who led the $430bn Principal Global Investors multi-boutique unit since 2002. Mr McCaughan was replaced immediately as chief executive by Pat Halter, chief operating officer, while Tim Dunbar, the chief investment officer of Principal Financial, was promoted to the role of president of a new $667bn global asset management business that will unify four previously separate investment divisions. Dan Houston, chief executive of the parent group, said unifying the four investment units would help the company better meet the needs of investors globally. “We will continue to look to expand in infrastructure and real estate to match the long-term liabilities on our balance sheet. We need to explore private debt and private equity. Internationally, we have around $200bn in retirement and long-term relationships in 10 countries outside China where our clients are looking for global asset management capabilities,” said Mr Houston. Principal Financial reported record net profits of $2.3bn in 2017, up 75 per cent on the previous year.Mr McCaughan, an insightful market commentator and public speaker, formally leaves on September 30. Principal Financial failed to provide a reason for his departure. One industry veteran said institutional investors did not like organisational upheavals that distracted portfolio managers. “Clients will be surprised, as we all are. They will want some explanation,” the person said.A former employee, who did not wish to be named, said the timing of Mr McCaughan’s exit “would not have been Jim’s choice”. Mr Houston said Mr McCaughan had done “an extraordinary job” and insisted his departure was part of a longstanding succession plan that had been in place for two years. He added that the re-organisation would deliver revenue, cost and talent synergies. “Principal has been in business for more than a century and we want to construct a strategy that will serve our clients well over the next hundred years,” he said.Under Mr McCaughan’s leadership, Principal Global Investors expanded from an operation with just $92bn in assets that served only US investors into an international business employing more than 500 investment professionals serving clients in 80 countries. The unit was highly profitable and reported pre-tax profits of $470m last year, an increase of 6 per cent over 2016.New business growth, however, has gone into reverse recently. Investors have pulled about $9.5bn since the start of 2017 from Principal Global Investors, which registered positive inflows of $9bn in 2016 and $15.5bn in 2015.
1;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;BlackRock and Franklin Templeton to win big from US tax holiday;Trump plan to cut tax on repatriated earnings would boost US asset managers;Billions of dollars of profits held overseas by asset managers to avoid corporate tax in the US could be brought home if president-elect Donald Trump follows through on plans for a tax cut on repatriated earnings.Franklin Templeton, which manages $714bn, and BlackRock, the world’s largest investment house, have the largest piles of cash offshore and would benefit most from a one-off tax holiday to encourage companies to bring profits to the US.Mr Trump has said that he will reduce the tax liability for US businesses that want to retrieve profits. This will provide a much-needed boost for asset managers that are fighting pressure on profits from fee competition, poor returns and increased regulatory scrutiny.Usually multinational companies trigger a tax bill of 35 per cent, the US’s statutory corporate tax rate, if they shift profits back. Most keep the money offshore as what they call “permanently reinvested earnings” that can be used for dealmaking outside the US.US asset managers T Rowe Price, Affiliated Managers Group, Principal Financial, AllianceBernstein and Eaton Vance would also gain from a lower tax rate on overseas earnings.“You could see them bringing cash and using it to reinvest and revitalise growth, or for capital management purposes,” said Neal Epstein, senior credit officer at Moody’s, the rating agency that this month lowered its outlook for the industry. “This will relieve pressure in the industry from regulatory changes and the need to invest capital in competitive products and in compliance.”The expectation that a tax holiday will enable companies to use offshore profits for share buybacks or dividend payouts has provided a fillip for investment managers in the US.$7.9bnThe amount of money Franklin Templeton holds offshoreThe share prices of Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, which hold $7.9bn and $4.7bn offshore, rose sharply in the days after the US election, and are up 15 per cent and 10 per cent respectively since Mr Trump’s victory. This month the president-elect chose Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive, to join a council of business advisers for his administration.T Rowe Price said that the tax reform “would be considered favourable” but that there were no immediate plans to repatriate profits or change dividend and buyback plans.$4.7bnThe amount of money BlackRock holds offshoreBlackRock said that it was “not reliant on potential tax law changes to repatriate our offshore cash balances back to the US or invest in our business”.Campaigners argue that asset management companies have little opportunity for capital expenditure or job creation, defeating the purpose of repatriating profits to stimulate the economy.“Despite the best efforts of Congress to make sure that the last repatriation holiday spurred investment rather than dividends, it didn’t work out,” said Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, who analysed asset managers’ company filings for FTfm. “Cash is fungible and companies are going to do whatever they want with their repatriated cash.”Research from the Democratic staff of a senate investigation group in 2011 showed that the 15 companies that benefited most from a previous one-off tax break for repatriated profits reduced spending on research and cut more than 20,000 jobs. It argued the tax holiday cost the US Treasury $3.3bn in lost revenues over 10 years.Investors have already begun to price in a surge in buybacks, which analysts predict could break records next year.Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, a campaign group, said that shareholders and the US taxpayer are divided on the merits of the transition tax.“The companies that are going to win the most is those that have paid the lowest rate offshore for longest,” he said. “The American people lose.”James Henry, senior fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Sustainable Investment, added that companies often hold profits offshore in anticipation of tax holidays in the future.“If you do these things often enough you essentially get people to expect them. People wait around keeping their money offshore waiting for that. A lot of that money will be flown back if the US becomes a tax haven.”Legg Mason, which manages $733bn, and Janus Capital, which in October announced plans to merge with Henderson, the Anglo-Australian investment house, are expected to benefit most from separate plans by Mr Trump to reduce the top federal corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 per cent.These two companies pay the most tax of US-based asset managers, according to Rory Callagy, senior credit officer at Moody’s.The money held offshore by financial institutions is dwarfed by the more than $1.2tn that is permanently reinvested by technology companies such as Microsoft, Apple and Google to avoid US tax rates.Franklin Templeton, Affiliated Managers Group, AllianceBernstein and Eaton Vance did not reply to requests for comment.

A spokesperson for Principal said the Liongate board would be “taking steps to return assets to investors.”It is the second big fund to shut this week, after Fortress Investment Group announced it would be closing its flagship macro fund on Tuesday. Many hedge funds have been affected by market volatility in recent months, and the industry is on track to post one of its worst years since 2011.Liongate managed $2.1bn worth of assets when Principal bought it in 2013, but Principal said in a statement that a loss of clients and reduction in assets under management had “placed the business under significant pressure” in the past two years.Liongate was founded by Randall Dillard and Jeff Holland in 2003. Principal wrote down its $44m investment in Liongate in 2014, and the group’s co-founders both left the fund this year.Principal gave no comment on the value of Liongate’s assets, but the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that they had fallen to less than $500m this year.

4;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2014-06-16T18:25:15Z;Wizz a damp squib but the IPO market soldiers on;Queue of wannabe debutants winds round the block;It was the sudden evaporation of investors, not the lack of a silent H, that dashed Wizz Air’s hopes of exploding on to London’s stock market at the speed of its first world war near-namesake, the whizz-bang shell. Demand for the Hungarian airline’s initial public offer vanished during a leap in the oil price and a wave of bad news from rivals.Wizz might have fared better if it had floated earlier this year when the new issues market reopened after a prolonged moratorium. Then investors were cash-rich and exuberant. Now, their natural scepticism has returned following dismal post-float performances from the likes of AO World, the white goods e-emporium, and Just Eat, the online takeaways business.Some see Wizz’s less than supercharged reception, so soon after fashion retailer FatFace pulled its float, as a sign that the IPO market is closing. Yet the queue of wannabe market debutants still winds round the block. And bankers are busy setting up so-called “early stage meetings” with shareholders to discuss autumn’s line-up and assess demand for shares.True, investors are pushing back against entrants with me-too brands in sectors where they have their pick of listed rivals. But they gobbled up debt-laden discounter B&M, deeming it a rare chance to buy into a growing business chaired by ex-Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy. There are high hopes, too, for the expected float of SSP, the station caterer under Kate Swann’s shrewd management.Barring unforeseen economic shocks the IPO market is not shutting. It is just midway through a classic cycle that swings from exuberance, satiation, disappointment and rejection through to more rational price formationAussie rulesThe facial expression of footballer Marcelo Vieria spoke volumes after he scored the opening goal of the 2014 World Cup against his own side, Brazil. It said: “No error could be more tragic than one which renders me universally ridiculous.”The same horror will have adorned the features of the broker who understated the float price of “flash sale” fashion website MySale by two decimal points. As a result, the shares appeared to open on Monday at 2.26p, a 99 per cent discount.The mistake triggered a flash sale of the company’s own shares that wiped almost 30 per cent off their price. The stock clawed back lost ground after MySale explained it was denominated in pounds, not pennies. But already the etailer’s name had been inscribed in The Bumper Book of Numerical Cock-ups.Here, MySale will rub shoulders with the Isaac Peral, a hastily redesigned Spanish submarine. A decimal point error would have made the vessel 70 tonnes too heavy and good at diving but bad at surfacing. Closer to home, apparel company Supergroup overstated profits forecasts in 2012 after a blunderer added rather than deducted a stock provision.Two brokers handled the MySale float: Macquarie Capital and Zeus Capital. Only one, Macquarie, bore responsibility for filling in the stock exchange form stating the float price in the role of nominated adviser. Being Australian, it may also tend to think in the dollars-spot-cents of its home market.Macquarie declined to comment. Sir Philip Green, rumbustious retail entrepreneur and 22 per cent shareholder in MySale, is likely to have expressed himself rather more freely.Hot stylesThe Principal, the shadowy figure who runs the City behind the scenes, wishes to remind readers who are attending Wimbledon next week of the dress code for financial professionals. It is as follows:“Middle-ranking stock analysts (male). Your clothing should be at least as formal as rival analysts to reflect the paranoia proper to your calling. A three-piece suit is a good way of signalling subconscious fear of being thought a slacker. Heat stroke is a small price to pay.“High-ranking bankers (male). Dress more casually than for the office. You don’t want to be mistaken for a middle-ranking stock analyst. A light-coloured summer suit is appropriate. But avoid the slept-in look pioneered by the late Mr Lee Brilleaux of the Dr Feelgood rock group.“Ladies. In dressing for the office, women have to negotiate minefields regarding hemline, neckline, trend and brand. You can wear anything for Wimbledon, though. A demure dress is fine. So is a spangly top and pedal pushers. Come in fancy dress if you like (a giant tennis ball costume, perhaps?)“Hedgies (male). By all means slick your hair back and wear a blazer, polo shirt, slacks, deck shoes and aviator sunglasses. But only if you’re a continental.”IPOs: kate.burgess@ft.comjonathan.guthrie@ft.com
5;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2014-04-06T08:46:45Z;Chilean pensions lure US investors;MetLife and Principal blaze a trail to the country’s pioneering private market;US asset managers are increasingly buying into a Chilean resource that could turn out to be richer than even its copper mines: its population’s golden years.Only six private sector investment houses are approved to manage assets in the country’s mandatory Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones, or AFP, scheme and two of them were bought by US groups last year – market leader Provida by MetLife and Cuprum, the fourth biggest, by Principal Financial Group.Chile’s upward mobility, combined with a transparent political and regulatory system and its pioneering embrace of defined contribution pension saving have created one of the world’s most promising retirement markets, says Oscar Schmidt, executive vice-president and head of MetLife in Latin America.“This balance in Chile between growth from an emerging middle class and relatively low risk – that is the sweet spot,” Mr Schmidt says.Created in the early 1980s, Chile’s pension system is built on individual savings accounts funded by mandatory 10 per cent salary or wage contributions. The assets are invested by one of six AFPs, which offer up to five government-approved portfolios invested according to differing risk levels.The mandatory savings are supplemented with tax-advantaged voluntary schemes known as Ahorro Previsional Voluntario, or APV accounts, in which assets are invested in private sector mutual funds or insurance products by the AFPs.As of February, the AFPs oversaw $160.4bn in assets, up 11.5 per cent over the past year, according to government data. Assets in the voluntary schemes rose 11.2 per cent in the year to September, to $7.2bn.Fuelling the rising trend is Chile’s robust economic growth, which its central bank projects will climb as much as 4.8 per cent this year. Pension fund assets in the country, meanwhile, are projected to rise at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7 per cent through to 2017, compared with 7.4 per cent in the US, according to data from Cerulli Associates, the research company.“This is a country that is going to be growing at a higher rate than the developed markets, and because of that growth we will have more new consumers demanding new products,” says Roberto Walker, president of Principal’s Latin American operations. “New growth will take place within the mandatory programme and will be even faster in the case of the voluntary programme.”Indeed, the voluntary scheme has attracted recent US interest as well. In the past month, Nuveen Investments and Federated Investors have announced distribution deals making their funds available.“Any time we see an emerging market that is developing with a stable and growing pension marketplace, we think our product line fits it,” says Gordon Ceresino, executive director for international distribution at Federated and president of Federated International Management.Chile’s system also stands out for provisions allowing investors to allocate up to 80 per cent of their contributions to foreign investments. About 40 per cent of that is invested in the US, Mr Ceresino says.Nuveen sees a glowing prospect in convincing savers about the benefits of active management, says Oscar Isoba, its head of business development for Latin America.“The allocation is done on a regional basis and developed markets like the US are accessed mostly through passive vehicles,” Mr Isoba says. “If US active managers gain ground on the performance front, there could be an opportunity to raise assets.”The next large competitor in the market, however, may be the government.President Michelle Bachelet has vowed to create a government-run retirement fund to compete with private sector providers. Her proposal is expected to be presented to the National Congress this year.MetLife’s Mr Schmidt says he takes comfort in the fact that Ms Bachelet presided over an ambitious, and ultimately positive, pension reform initiative in 2008, during her previous term as president.“Overall, it was a great reform, and we think she is going to continue supporting the system,” Mr Schmidt says.Both Mr Schmidt and Principal’s Mr Walker say the system suffers from insufficient savings rather than a lack of competition. They point to potential solutions including higher contributions and greater support for an employer-sponsored option under the voluntary scheme.“We are not against the idea of the government-run AFP because we believe in competition, and if it is fair, we will compete,” Mr Schmidt says.“But we do not think it solves the current problems.”
6;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2013-06-16T03:08:38Z;Retiring boomers reshape investment;An industry report finds a gloomy picture of the increasing personalisation of risk is emerging;Baby boomers will control almost three-quarters of the world’s retail assets within five years, dramatically reshaping the global investment industry.This is one of the findings from “Investing in a debt-fuelled world”, the fifth annual industry report compiled by Create Research, a UK consultancy, and Principal Global Investors, the institutional investment arm of the Iowa-based Principal Financial Group.Based on responses from more than 700 asset managers, pension schemes, consultants, distributors and fund administrators from 29 countries, with combined assets of $27.4tn, the report also paints a gloomy picture of the increasing personalisation of risk. The report sees this being transferred from “those who couldn’t manage it to those who don’t understand it”, as developed-world governments scale back public pension provision and the closure of private sector defined benefit plans accelerates.Perhaps the most wide-reaching trend identified by the report is the changing priorities of baby boomers, those born between 1945 and 1965, who are starting to retire in significant numbers.The report argues that these boomers will be less interested in the mass of products that aim to beat the market, and more interested in “solutions” that will meet their needs in retirement.“Almost 75 per cent of retail assets in the world will be held by retirees or near retirees [within five years]. People have talked about it but it’s happening now.“They want investment choices that are not about beating the markets but meeting their needs in retirement – regular income, inflation protection and low volatility. It is changing the whole complexion of the product mix in asset management,” says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research and author of the report. “What baby boomers want is complete vehicles that can get them from A to B.”Other examples of this “solutions alpha” include liability driven investing in the DB pension fund sector, life-cycle investing and target income funds in the defined contribution world and “advice-embedded” investing in the mass market.“Legacy assets will migrate towards solutions-driven investing. The emerging trend will be as immutable as the momentum of a supertanker,” the report claims. “Conventional investing will morph beyond recognition by the end of this decade.”Survey respondents saw the rate of closure of DB plans accelerating as deficits rise, even in Japan, which has thus far largely retained its “jobs-for-life” culture.As a result, DC schemes are expected to increase their share of global pension assets from 43 per cent today, to more than 60 per cent by 2020.This is likely to have significant repercussions for the investment industry, with 62 per cent of DC investors planning to invest in balanced or multi-asset class funds.Mr Rajan also foresees a wave of innovation in the construction of DC funds, with the rollout of target income funds and vehicles that have an annuity rolled in.The industry itself seems unsure about the manner in which the dominant trends in markets, economics and politics will play out.About 40 per cent of survey respondents see quantitative easing as a tonic for reviving growth, 35 per cent see it as inflationary and 25 per cent as deflationary.Cuts in public spending are seen as the most likely route that European governments will take over the next three years to tackle their debt problems. In the US, a combination of low interest rates and economic growth is seen as a more likely path to achieve the same goal.There is, however, a broad consensus, shared by 62 per cent of the respondents, that central bank decisions will be the primary factor driving global markets in the next three years. This is tied in with worries over “financial repression”, which occurs when central banks keep policy rates artificially low for a long period of time in order to help governments finance their debts.“It is feared that a combination of low rates and rising inflation will steadily vaporise public debt and erode the purchasing power of the underpinning assets,” the report says.“Investors fear being on the losing side in this arbitrary redistribution of wealth that could last for at least 10 years, if history is any guide.”The report will be available on www.create-research.co.uk June 17.
7;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2013-03-04T14:41:57Z;Pensions group buys into fund of funds;;Liongate Capital, the London-based fund of hedge funds, has sold a majority stake of its business to US pension plan specialist the Principal Financial Group.Liongate’s sale is the latest in a series of moves towards consolidation in the funds of hedge funds industry, where many businesses have found themselves squeezed by pressure from investors on fees and low returns from the hedge funds they invest in.Funds of funds were once the single biggest source of money for hedge funds and the route through which most investors accessed the industry. However, since 2008 many have struggled to carve a niche for themselves amid the disappearance of their main high net worth client base.Principal’s deal to acquire 55 per cent of Liongate underscores the extent to which institutional, pension-fund clients are now the biggest source of capital for hedge funds – and institutionally-focused funds of funds are those with the greatest opportunities for growth.Liongate, which was founded in 2003, manages assets of $2.1bn.“With its strong reputation and focused investment expertise, Liongate is a welcome addition to our multi-boutique management structure,” said Jim McCaughan, chief executive of Principal Global Investments, a division of Principal Financial.“The partnership will enhance our capabilities in alternative investments, which is an area where client demand continues to grow. Very few institutional investment firms have this level of expertise in hedge fund investing,” he said.Pension providers such as Principal – which manages assets of more than $400bn – have been ramping up investments in hedge funds since 2008, though few have yet sought to buy hedge fund businesses themselves.UK-based asset manager Aberdeen last year said it hoped to more than double its current hedge fund business, if possible through acquisitions.The deal will help Liongate focus on targeting bespoke mandates for Principal clients, the company said in a statement.“Our clients increasingly want hedged solutions over their entire portfolios, and not just on an ‘alternatives’ side plate,” said Liongate’s co-founder and chief investment officer Randall Dillard.Other recent, high-profile fund of funds deals include the Man Group’s acquisition of FRM last May – for which a maximum consideration of just $142m was paid – and Permal’s acquisition of Fauchier Partners in December.Numerous other fund of fund businesses are said to be for sale, including most notably Arpad “Arki” Busson’s EIM, though many stress there is a great deal of difference between them.The sector is sharply divided between funds that have been treading water since 2008 – thanks, among other things, to reputational damage following investments in the Madoff Ponzi scheme – and those that have quietly targeted pension fund money and sought to move away from traditional off-the-shelf fund products.
8;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2012-11-28T00:40:44Z;BBVA sells Mexican pension for $1.6bn;;"Spain’s BBVA has agreed to sell its Mexican pension fund to local buyers for $1.6bn, the latest in a line of local asset sale by retreating Europeans.Grupo Financiero Banorte, the only major bank that is Mexican-owned and Mexico’s Social Security Institute, known as IMSS, will share the cost for Afore Bancomer – as the pension fund unit is called – equally.The combined fund will have some $40bn of assets, making it Mexico’s largest. The deal is subject to approval by regulators.The deal marks a further consolidation of the Mexican system of private pension funds, known as afores. The afores are largely modelled on Chile’s pension funds, known there as AFPs. Little more than a month ago, Principal Financial Group, a US insurer, agreed to buy Cuprum, the fourth biggest AFP, for $1.5bn. Cuprum has $32bn in assets.Principal has also been active in Mexico, snapping up HSBC’s Mexican pension fund earlier this year for some $200m giving it total assets of $8bn in the country.With a dozen Afores left in Mexico regulators and analysts say there is still room for more consolidation as competition increases.Ramón Pando, chief executive of Afore Principal recently told the Mexican daily El Economista: “We’ve seen it in Chile we’re seeing it here. The companies are consolidating so as to provide better services.”Related reading:

9;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2012-10-09T01:17:46Z;Chile’s privatised pensions draw Principal interest;;Chile pioneered privatised pension funds in Latin America and the fund managers, known as AFPs, are now the country’s biggest institutional investors, with a juicy $159bn under management at the end of September, up 9.6 per cent on a year ago.So perhaps it’s no surprise that the pension funds in Latin America’s best-managed economy are increasingly being seen as investment targets in themselves.Chile’s fourth-biggest AFP, Cuprum, with some $32bn in assets under management, is the latest to catch the eye of a suitor. Principal Financial Group, a US insurer and asset manager which is expanding its footprint in Latin America, has agreed to buy Cuprum for $1.5bn.Penta Group, Cuprum’s owner, has agreed to sell 63.44 per cent of the AFP to Principal and the US firm will launch an offer for the remainder, which it expects to close in the first quarter next year.Cuprum is not alone. As Reuters remarks:Chile’s private pension fund system has attracted investor attention due to high returns and robust local economic growth. Medellin, Colombia-based Grupo Sura paid more than $3.5bn last year for the regional assets of ING Groep NV , including Chilean pension fund AFP Capital. Spain’s No.2 bank BBVA may sell its Latin American pension fund businesses, joining the ranks of banks looking to shed operations outside their main markets to reduce risks and meet tougher capital rules, it said in May.Chile is increasingly seeking to position itself as an attractive gateway to funds seeking to invest in the region. But for investors seeking to broaden their exposure to Latin America and gain a foothold in stable, healthy Chile, acquiring an AFP looks like a good way to go.

12;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2012-06-06T17:48:33Z;Prudential’s GM deal revives annuities;;At a stroke last week Prudential Financial resuscitated a slumbering but potentially lucrative corner of the US insurance industry.The company agreed to take on as much as $26bn of pension liabilities from General Motors, for the assets backing the plan and cash payments that could total $3.5bn. The deal reduces the US carmaker’s pension liabilities by about a fifth.If completed, the GM transaction would eclipse anything seen before in the market for corporate annuities. The US pension insurance, or buyout, market is less developed than the UK’s. The last such US deal to involve the transfer of more than $1bn in liabilities was in the 1980s, according to Aon Hewitt, a consultancy.But it could be the tip of the iceberg. With S&P 500 companies facing combined pension liabilities of $1.7tn, according to Credit Suisse, and US states and municipal governments also exposed to defined benefit schemes, some say the dam could be about to burst on such deals.“This is a watershed moment,” says Rick Jones in the retirement plan division at Aon Hewitt. “The market has been in the doldrums for years but, if others companies follow GM’s lead, it could be worth trillions.”For Prudential the deal represents the first fruits from setting up a pension risk transfer unit three years ago. The unit has grown to 100 employees, while people who worked on the GM deal say MetLife, American International Group and Principal Financial, among others, are also seeking such deals.But while the financial crisis left gaping holes in corporate pension plans as the prices of plan assets tumbled, the annuity business has struggled to gain traction.“Over the past few years especially, US corporations have been keen to transfer pension risk,” said David Zion, head of accounting research at Credit Suisse. “But the key question has been price: with interest rates low and markets volatile, it can cost a lot to offload these long-duration liabilities.”GM will make payments of up to $4.5bn to its pension plan to fund lump sum payments to retirees who exit the pension scheme, and premiums to Prudential to assume liability for those who stay in the scheme. That will be partly balanced by a narrowing of the funding gap in the company’s pension plan, but the net cost to GM will still be $3bn.The deal covers all 118,000 of GM’s “salaried”, or white collar, retirees. But GM has a further 400,000 “hourly”, or blue collar, retirees with defined benefits.Bob Shanks, chief financial officer of Ford Motor, said this week that it had decided not to offload some of its pension liabilities because it did not have sufficient cash once plans for dividends and investments were taken into account.Another obstacle to the deals is their complexity. Morgan Stanley, the lead adviser on the deal, had been working with GM on pension alternatives since 2010.Oliver Wyman has been advising the independent fiduciary, which represents members of the pension plan, for at least six months, during which time at least four insurers submitted bids.Prudential may have to set aside $2bn against the GM pension liabilities, according to Raymond James analysts. That would be equal to the excess capital of Prudential’s US insurance arm at the end of 2011. By comparison, MetLife ended 2011 with $3.5bn and Principal Financial held $1.6bn.According to a GM filing, both it and Prudential could pull out of the deal before it is set to close at the end of the year if markets deteriorate and increase the total cash required to close the transaction.Despite these hurdles, insurers are confident the symbolic value of the deal with GM, with total pension liabilities of more than $100bn, will lead others to follow suit.Dylan Tyson, head of pension risk transfer at Prudential, says his company is in talks with several other large US companies about annuity deals, and expects further agreements this year.According to Raymond James, even after capital allocations are taken into account, the GM deal could add as much as $200m a year to Prudential’s earnings.“This [the GM deal] is not something that is going to happen every week,” says Steven Schwartz at Raymond James. “But we will see more deals, and when we do they will be meaningful for insurers’ earnings.”
13;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2011-12-14T11:11:56Z;High stakes over definition of high frequency trading;;"The battle lines over the definition of “high frequency trading” are being drawn.Industry trade groups are calling for a regulatory focus on the techniques of high-speed trading rather than the participants, while regulators are hoping to identify the largest speed-trading firms.On Tuesday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission convened its technology advisory group, consisting of agency officials and industry members, to discuss definitions. Trade groups made their own proposals.The stakes over the definition are high. If regulators define it broadly, groups such as investment banks and traditional asset managers who use automated trading programmes that send and cancel bursts of orders to the market could be tagged as ""high-frequency traders”.But if it is defined narrowly, some proprietary shops could be subject to harsh rules that put them at a disadvantage.Sensitivity over how regulators define high-frequency trading (HFT) has already been seen in Europe, where a proposal by the European Commission that automated traders be required to make markets at all times, regardless of market conditions, has raised eyebrows.While the practice of HFT has been a focus for regulators and market participants for the past several years, it has so far eluded a commonly agreed definition.The Principal Traders Group, a group of independent trading firms including Getco, DRW Trading and Infinium Capital Management, attempted to do so on Tuesday by saying that regulators should look at traders who use automated trading tools that make decisions on how to trade without human input. That can include high-frequency firms, but also asset managers and banks that use algorithms to trade.“Orders of all market participants should be subject to risk controls,” wrote John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association on behalf of the PTG.“The broader term ‘Direct [Automated Trading System] Participant’ would appropriately include any firm directly accessing the market with an ATS, rather than a narrow subset meeting a definition of HFT,” he wrote.However, CFTC officials argued that it is still important to identify certain firms that directly connect to markets, trade in high volumes and end the day with little inventory.“We want to understand what we’re regulating,” said Scott O’Malia, CFTC commissioner, at the session on Tuesday.Mr O’Malia recently proposed a seven-point definition of HFT that would include certain behaviours that are common to some proprietary trading firms but do not necessarily apply to traditional investors who might trade at great speed.Pete Kyle, professor of finance at the University of Maryland, told the FT that regulators and academics need to investigate whether such firms have unique advantages.He, along with Andrei Kirilenko, CFTC chief economist, argue that certain behaviours, including taking little “directional risk” and trading in high volumes, should be included in any definition. They believe there are about 15-20 trading firms that could be classified as HFTs.“Some people that invest a lot in technology, co-location and using automated trading may be a little faster than everybody else,” Mr Kyle said.“If you have a registration process, you could do research on whether people with ATS and direct access were getting better prices. If you establish that, you then want to ask, is this because HFTs are providing a service that they’re charging for, or are they just a tax? That’s a very important question.Regulators’ approaches also differ. The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken a behavioural approach in informal discussion, identifying certain trading strategies that are common to HFT such as arbitrage and passive market-making.In Europe, the approach has been more focused on the dangers of automation. In a speech this month the head of the French markets regulator, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, said: “Limiting the spread of these trading techniques, the benefits of which are dubious, will make our markets more stable and clearer for investors without jeopardising genuine liquidity.”In the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) review, “high frequency” trading is discussed in the context of algorithms.The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma), the largest Wall Street lobbying group, advocated a focus on all automated trading, with attention paid to abusive practices.“The difficulty of defining HFT and the widespread use of the term in a variety of contexts has confused efforts to address substantive concerns about particular trading behaviors that are abusive or manipulative, or about potential market structure issues arising from the increase in computer-based trading,” Sifma wrote.There are some who even question the value of definitions at all. The International Organisation of Securities Commissions has argued that any definition “may not be practicable for regulatory purposes”."

The accompanying photo of FT fashion editor Vanessa Friedman, at the equally glamorous setting of The Modern at MoMA in New York, shows just one of some two dozen excellent pairings between food and company.Le Bernardin, the renowned fish restaurant on West 51st Street, will host the FT’s US managing editor, Gillian Tett. In Hong Kong David Pilling, our Asia bureau chief, will meet his guest at The Principal, the new restaurant opened by Paulo Pong. In Paris Simon Kuper will take lunch at Il Vino, the wine restaurant created by Enrico Bernardo, while Quentin Peel, our man in Berlin, is as exciting a lunchtime companion as chef Christian Lohse’s menu at Fischers Fritz at The Regent Hotel.In London, Lionel Barber, the FT’s editor and an avid cyclist, will join the successful bidder for impeccable food, wine and service at Le Gavroche under the aegis of Michel Roux Jr, an equally avid marathon runner.For cricket, food and wine lovers there is the chance to catch up with Matthew Engel, Rowley Leigh and Jancis Robinson at Le Café Anglais, L’Anima and The Ledbury, respectively. Skylon in the Southbank Centre, Koffmann’s in Knightsbridge, The Ivy in Covent Garden and Bar Boulud at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park will play host to the opinions of columnists Lucy Kellaway and Mrs Moneypenny, Gillian de Bono, the editor of How To Spend It magazine, and Caroline Daniel, FT Weekend editor.Aside from the significant contribution these lunches make to the future work of Sightsavers, both luncher and lunchee gain insights into each other.Last year, I was fortunate enough to be bid for by Yves-André Istel, a senior adviser at Rothschild, New York. While he and his wife were delighted by the Portuguese wine proposed by sommelier João Pires at Dinner in the Mandarin Oriental, (as well as the opportunity to meet Heston Blumenthal), I was even more impressed by his story of quite how narrowly his family had escaped the Nazis when they were living in Paris in the late 1930s. Our conversation was as fascinating as the food.For full details of the FT lunchers, the restaurants they are paired with, and terms and conditions of the auction, go to www.ebay.co.uk/ftappeal.For more information on Sightsavers and the FT’s coverage of the charity go to www.ft.com/appeal

16;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2011-09-25T10:06:27Z;Jim McCaughan: modest chief with a grand design;PGI’s Jim McCaughan says its grand plan requires managers without egos;"More hubris than humility may be a defining feature of many global chief executives, but Jim McCaughan, boss of Principal Global Investors, is attempting to shift the balance a little.Mr McCaughan is piloting a radical switch to a multi-boutique model at the $240bn US-based house, with equity stakes and revenue or profit-sharing part of a plan to incentivise investment staff via their wallets and purses. However, he believes such a model can only work if senior executives are willing to leave their egos at the door.“When things are going well these investment people can do very well and people within corporations find that in some cases these people can make more money than the chairman. You have to tolerate that,” says Mr McCaughan.“Almost every year [there are people earning more than me] and that’s just fine because they only make that money if they make even more for the company. Some chief executives find that difficult, but it’s the big stars that make the money in the movie and music businesses, not the studio manager.”Further, some senior managers can be too controlling to allow boutiques enough freedom to prosper, he argues. “Some companies get very caught up with their own branding and their own story that they are not tolerant enough. Many companies find that hands-off element quite difficult to do. Multi- boutiques have some management challenges, which is why not everybody is doing it.“Talent needs a bit of space to operate in, but there are people who say ‘I won’t tolerate any fiefdoms’.”Born: 1953Education1974: Cambridge University, BA Mathematics and Theoretical Physics1974: Actuarial student, Lane Clark & Peacock1978: Fund manager, Phillips & Drew1986: President, UBS Phillips & Drew International Investment Management1994: Co-ordinator, institutional asset management, UBS, Zurich1996: President and CEO, UBS Asset Management, New York1998: President and COO, Oppenheimer Capital, New York2000: CEO, Americas, Credit Suisse Asset Management2002: CEO, Principal Global InvestorsPGI, the asset management arm of the Des Moines-based Principal Financial Group, managed $79.5bn on behalf of external investors at the end of June, and a further $159.6bn on behalf of its parent.Unlike many multi-boutique operators, which have simply acquired majority stakes in a series of managers, PGI has also moved in the opposite direction, carving out chunks of its in-house operations into definable boutiques. However, this transition is still work in progress with most of these boutiques still wholly owned by PGI.“Three years ago we had made several acquisitions, they were working well, and we had developed some in-house talent,” says Mr McCaughan. “We have reverse-engineered them to make these in-house teams more like the boutiques. They have profit sharing. They are still 100 per cent owned but they operate with an income stream.“The next stage is to get the people within them as equity owners. In the next three or four years maybe 20-30 per cent will be owned by key people within the separate boutiques.”PGI’s largest boutiques include Columbus Circle Investors, a $17bn equity house; Spectrum Asset Management, a specialist in preferred securities (also known as preference shares), with $14bn under management; and Post Advisory Group, a $10bn high-yield house.And the Iowan company’s spending spree is far from over. So far this year it has bought a 51 per cent stake in Finisterre Capital, a London-based emerging markets specialist with assets of $1.6bn, and is awaiting closure of a deal to buy 74 per cent of Origin Asset Management, a $3bn quantitative equity manager.Mr McCaughan still has an outstanding wish-list, to be satisfied either through further acquisitions or organic development. Like so many houses, top of his list is expertise in emerging markets.“One of the features of the next decade or two will be the continued importance of having skills and talent in emerging markets,” he argues. “We have a lot already but there will always be the need to have more capability, partly through acquisitions.”Further, PGI hopes to globalise its real estate operations away from its US core, putting more emphasis on owning physical properties rather than utilising real estate securities as a proxy.Third, PGI “would be prepared to add” fund of fund operations. This latter option stems from Mr McCaughan’s belief that hedging risk and delivering absolute returns, alongside a need for income as the post-war baby boomer generation begins to retire, will become increasingly important, particularly for members of defined contribution pension schemes, such as the 401k system in the US.“Someone earning $70,000 might have $300,000-$350,000 in their plan. The challenge is to get that to $20,000 a year, with social security and part-time work on top,” he says.Established: 1999 as the investment management unit of Principal (founded in 1879)Assets under management: $239.1bn, as of June 30Number of employees: 1,143Headquarters: Des Moines, Iowa, US. 17 other offices worldwideOwnership: a wholly owned subsidiary of Principal Financial Group, listed in New York. Largest shareholders are Nippon Life Insurance, Northern Trust and T. Rowe PriceMr McCaughan sees absolute return and income-seeking strategies combining to achieve this type of goal. In a world where yields on the government debt of perceived safe nations such as the US, UK and Germany have plunged towards record lows, generating a decent income stream has become harder, particularly as Mr McCaughan envisages a period of sub-trend growth in the developed world (with the likelihood of a recession in the eurozone and a 20-30 per cent probability of the US following suit), a factor likely to keep yields low.However, PGI’s experiences in Japan, a country which has been marked by very low nominal yields for many years, gives him confidence it can be achieved.“Our Japan business has done very well. Through Reits [real estate investment trusts], preferred securities and high-yield bonds we have continued to get high yields,” Mr McCaughan says of a strategy he believes will work further afield.“The need for income from investments will be one of the major trends of the next 10-15 years with the retirement of the baby boomers.“Retirees will have to take more risk and work longer. My expectation is that we will see more of a process [of retirement], rather than an event. Our challenge is to create these income-producing investments that will give people choices as they get older so they can live, in part, on their savings.”"
17;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2011-02-08T22:50:35Z;Small business confidence lifts Wall Street;;"McDonald’s led gains for US equities as the wider markets edged up on news that small business confidence had risen to its highest level in three years.But disappointing earnings reports from smaller companies and a fall in energy stocks due to an interest rate rise in China pared gains for the session.McDonald’s, the world’s largest burger chain by sales, saw strong gains after reporting same-store sales had unexpectedly risen by 5.3 per cent in January compared with the same period a year earlier. The stock climbed 2.6 per cent to $75.36.The news lifted the restaurant sector. Starbucks was up 2.4 per cent to $33.12 while the S&P consumer services index was up 1.8 per cent to 306.96. This helped Wall Street add to the 2½-year highs reached on Monday.The S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent higher to 1,324.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 12,233.15 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent at 2,797.05.Also helping to lift markets was data from the National Federation of Independent Business showing that US small business confidence was at its highest level since December 2007.But the survey also showed that small businesses remained cautious about hiring and the group was far from jubilant about the future prospect for small business.“While recent political rhetoric favours small business, it is belied by the actions of policymakers whose new policies and activities almost exclusively support big businesses,” said Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Small Business. “While the economy is moving forward, albeit at a snail’s pace, it is not nearly fast enough to dramatically improve the unemployment situation, which continues to languish.”Also tempering sentiment on Wall Street was some lacklustre earnings news.Principal Financial, the life assurer, released disappointing fourth-quarter results, sending shares down 4.3 per cent to $32.24. The group reported a profit of $199.3m, or 62 cents a share, up 40 per cent from the previous year but short of the 68 cents predicted by analysts.Elsewhere, NYSE Euro-next, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, said fourth-quarter net profit had fallen 20 per cent as trading volumes in the US and Europe slowed. This sent shares in the group down 1 per cent to $33.41.The energy sector saw the greatest losses in the session on news that China had raised interest rates in an effort to combat domestic inflation.Schlumberger, the largest oil services group in the world, was down 0.9 per cent to $88.04 while Halliburton lost 2.6 per cent to $44.97.This was the third time that China had raised its benchmark interest rate since October and it sent the S&P energy index down 0.5 per cent to 552.71.The wider markets were not dragged down by the rate rise, however, as many investors saw the move as both expected and even necessary.“The Chinese keeping inflation under control is positive for US equities,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial. “It is only if investors think they are pulling back too hard that equities will really start to react badly.”In deal news, Kindred Healthcare agreed to acquire RehabCare Group in a move the companies said would create the largest US post-acute healthcare services group. The $900m deal sent shares in Kindred Healthcare up 28.3 per cent to $25; RehabCare Group shares climbed 45.5 per cent to $37.05.Herley Industries, a defence contractor, agreed to be acquired by Kratos Defense & Security Solutions for about $270m. This sent shares in Herley up 16.3 per cent to $18.89 while Kratos shares were flat at $14.01.Conexant Systems, the semiconductor maker, jumped 17.9 per cent to $2.47 after saying Golden Gate Private Equity had offered to buy it for $2.35 to $2.45 a share.These deals follow on from a series of bigger deals in the previous session. On Monday, Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn in a move that would create the world’s second-largest offshore driller by number of rigs. Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, also agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn."
18;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2010-08-25T01:15:07Z;Traders in denial over May 6 events;;From Mr R.T. Leuchtkafer.Sir, Jean Eaglesham ( “Tighter curbs on traders after flash crash”, August 23) quotes a recent PhD thesis cited by James Overdahl and the Principal Traders Group, a lobbying organisation for high-frequency traders. The thesis is a study on high-frequency trading by doctoral candidate Jonathan Brogaard at Northwestern University, and reported no evidence that high-frequency firms withdraw in volatile markets. The study data predate the flash crash, however, which puts Mr Overdahl in the same awkward position as that of a physician hunched over a cooling heart attack victim, results from the poor man’s last prostate exam in hand.More recent evidence includes statements from the firms themselves. The day after the flash crash, Dave Cummings, founder of Tradebot, one of the largest high-frequency firms in the world, said his systems stopped trading on May 6, just as they are programmed to do in volatile markets. Another firm reported that it entered the system command “HF STOP”, causing its systems to sell everything and withdraw. Matt Schrecengost, chief operating officer of Jump Trading, another large high-frequency firm, said at a Securities and Exchange Commission panel that it too withdrew from the equities markets on May 6.The Principal Traders Group is surely aware of this, yet seems to be saying, as Chico Marx of the Marx Brothers once said: “Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?R.T.

19;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2010-06-17T02:51:19Z;Trading body hires former SEC official;;The high-frequency trading industry signalled on Wednesday a new campaign designed to improve its public image by hiring a former Securities and Exchange Commission official to act as its first public spokesman.The appointment of James Overdahl, who left his post as the SEC’s chief economist in March, as a mouthpiece for the Principal Traders Group – a division of the Futures Industry Association recently set up to represent proprietary trading firms – is likely to heighten concern in Washington at what is seen as the “revolving door” of regulatory agency staff taking up jobs in the financial industry.Eyebrows were raised on Capitol Hill last week when Getco, one of the biggest high-frequency-trading firms, hired Elizabeth King, a former SEC associate director.Chuck Grassley, a senior member of the Senate finance committee, said on Wednesday: “We need to ensure that SEC officials are more focused on regulation and enforcement than on getting their next job in the industry they are supposed to oversee. The SEC should be more proactive about disclosing and managing potential conflicts like these.”The SEC said on Tuesday it was investigating Ms King’s move as well as those of several other former agency officials.Like Ms King, Mr Overdahl will not be able to appear before the SEC for a one-year “cooling off” period. He stressed that he would not be involved in lobbying and said he had consulted the agency on the ethics of his appointment. “My role is to help understanding of what happens in these markets,” Mr Overdahl said.High-frequency trading – which accounts for the vast majority of the US equities market and an increasingly important share of the listed derivatives market – has come under increasing scrutiny in recent months, with accusations that the speed of market movements privileges a small number of trading houses.The “flash crash” last month – in which US stock markets plunged and rebounded within 20 minutes – was widely seen as a reflection of the way in which lightning-fast trading has changed the market.The incident has added to the calls for stricter regulation. The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures watchdog, are examining high-frequency algorithmic trading practices closely as they continue to try to decipher what happened.The SEC last week approved new rules to halt trading in S&P 500 stocks that rise or fall more than 10 per cent within five minutes. The CFTC proposed last week to start regulating “co-location”, in which high-frequency firms place servers at an exchange’s data centre to trade as fast as possible.Don Wilson, chairman of the Principal Traders Group and chief executive of DRW, a high-frequency firm, said there had been a lot of media coverage of the perceived harm that proprietary trading groups were causing in the market. “There was not an organised group to respond to a lot of these mis-statements,” he said“The truth is the high-frequency traders create liquidity,” said John Damgard, FIA president.

If they are trying to achieve name awareness, or at least make their presence felt, they need to aim for either prominent placements or frequency.”Aberdeen says the campaign will primarily focus on raising the profile of its closed-end fund range in the US, and will target institutional investors, financial advisers and small direct investors. It will roll out the campaign from today.“This is our debut in the US,” says Piers Currie, group head of marketing at Aberdeen.“We are a global active money manager, but in the US there are a lot more domestic managers. As the industry becomes more global, we want to make sure investors understand exactly what it is we do.”But in order to establish itself as a serious contender in the US, Aberdeen is likely to have to spend more if it is to stave off the threat from long-established
players.Last month, US mutual fund house Principal Financial launched an advertising campaign encouraging investors to seek help in rebuilding their portfolios. It is costing the company an estimated $30m.Other US houses, including Sun Life, OppenheimerFunds, DWS, Putnam, Fidelity and Vanguard, are all reported to have built up their marketing arsenals recently, following cutbacks in their budgets during the worst of the financial crisis.According to figures from Nielsen, the mutual fund industry spent about $115.4m across print, online, television and other advertising in 2009, compared to $211.7m the previous year.“If it is retail funds they are marketing, Aberdeen is entering the single most competitive market on the planet, with many huge and well-established players,” says one marketing executive at a UK-based asset manager.“They’d better have some incredibly good stories to tell if they’re going to be successful.”The marketing push follows a recent name change on five closed-end funds in the US, which Aberdeen acquired during its deal with Credit Suisse in 2008.Gary Marshall, Aberdeen’s recently appointed head of Americas, says with the group having over 25 years’ experience managing closed-end funds in the UK, it is “eager to deliver the best of that expertise and knowledge to our US products”.Other acquisitions have certainly helped Aberdeen grow its footprint in the US market.In 2005, its purchase of parts of Deutsche Asset Management enabled Aberdeen to establish a presence in Philadelphia for the first time. It also acquired certain US fund management businesses from Nationwide Financial Services in 2006.Mr Currie says as a result of several deals, particularly those that have helped build up a presence in the US, establishing one brand is important in targeting investors. He recognises some of the challenges.“Being a foreign manager, the US is one of the most competitive markets to be in,” he says. “In order to get recognised, firms have to work at getting a voice.”The group’s performance should help its voice to be heard above the competition. It was named one of Barron’s best mutual fund families in a survey last year. Among the 61 leading mutual fund families, Aberdeen was ranked third during a one-year period ending December 2009.Two of the closed-end funds – the Aberdeen Chile Fund and the Aberdeen Latin America Equity Fund – have a four and three Morningstar rating respectively.“Aberdeen has been operating in the US now for some time and their funds have received recognition and have good ratings,” says Mr Newman.David Ricketts is a reporter on Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared"
21;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2009-06-15T21:29:09Z;Lincoln reduces its bail-out needs;;Lincoln Financial will draw less than half of the US bail-out money it has approval for after selling a UK life assurance business for more than $300m to Canada’s Sun Life and announcing plans to raise $1.4bn in stock and bond sales.Lincoln expects to draw $950m from the troubled asset relief programme, much less than the $2.5bn in capital injections it was offered.The company is only the second US life assurer to take bail-out cash. The Hartford Financial Group said on Friday it would take its full $3.4bn allowance.Six big US life assurance groups with banking subsidiaries gained approval to receive billions of dollars in US government bail-out funds in May, after concerns grew about the financial stability of the sector.However, four of these groups turned down the funds after raising capital through other routes – Principal Financial, Prudential Financial, Allstate and Ameriprise Financial.The US life industry has been hard hit by a combination of tumbling stock and bond markets, which have hurt the value of investments, and the high cost of making good on guarantees promised to individual policyholders in variable annuity products.These are long-term savings products where the consumer is able to reap some of the benefit from rising investment values, but is protected against steep declines.Lincoln said on Monday that it intended to pay $1bn of the proceeds of its capital-raising exercise into its principal insurance unit, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, and keep the remaining $1bn for general corporate purposes, including repaying short-term debt.“These actions supplement dividend reductions, cost cuts, and other actions previously taken to strengthen the company’s capital,” Lincoln said.The company will issue $600m of new shares in a public underwritten offering and up to $500m of senior debt.The sale of its Lincoln National UK life insurance operations to Sun Life Financial of Canada has already secured about $320m in its capital raising efforts.Both the Sun Life and Lincoln National operations in the UK are in effect closed books of life assurance business, which means they sell few new policies.However, such businesses can still generate strong cash flows, which has attracted some colourful entrepreneurs to the sector in the UK to buy up such businesses.Sun Life said the deal would increase its UK assets under management by about 60 per cent to £10.6bn ($17.2bn) and add between C$0.08 and C$0.10 to earnings next year.“The combined operation is expected to generate attractive returns and serve to position Sun Life for future growth in one of the world’s largest life insurance markets,” said Donald Stewart, Sun Life chief executive.
22;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2009-05-16T01:43:12Z;Life assurers to receive bail-out cash;;Life assurance groups with banking subsidiaries will receive billions of dollars in US government bail-out funds, officials confirmed on Friday, a move experts hope will damp concerns about the financial stability of this sector.Six companies have been approved for capital injections: Hartford Financial Services, Prudential, Allstate, Ameriprise, Lincoln National and Principal Financial, although Ameriprise turned down the money on Friday. Officials said the insurance groups could receive much of the $22bn (£15bn) remaining in the capital purchase programme, part of the wider $700bn troubled asset relief programme, but cautioned that not all the money would necessarily go to them.“This has the potential to be a meaningful, material contribution to capital for certain companies,” said Kevin Ahern, an analyst at Standard and Poor’s, the credit rating agency.The companies eligible for bail-out funds all own or have recently acquired banks. They applied for capital months ago and received approval through the normal process for bank recapitalisation. Nonetheless, the capital injections, which can be used to support their insurance operations as well, come as policymakers are paying increasing attention to risks emanating from the life assurance sector, as well as property and casualty insurers and pension funds.Officials have no specific or immediate cause for concern. But while they think they have a very good handle on risks within the banking system following the stress test of the top 19 US banks, they are less confident that they have identified all the dangers within the insurance and pension industries.Insurance groups are regulated state-by-state by 51 regulators, meaning that federal authorities do not have as good a line of sight into their operations as they do with the biggest banks.Moreover, they operate under actuarial principles that allow them to smooth their operating performance and do not need to mark all their assets to their current market values – practices that make them less vulnerable in the short term to market disruptions but also mean that problems may take longer to come to the surface.Opinions differ on how opaque these groups are. Matt Carroll, a second analyst at S&P, said there was “pretty good visibility in real time on both the asset side and liabilities side”.Nonetheless, a number of policymakers believe that if there is a further relapse in the financial system, it is more likely to be caused by problems at the insurers than at the banks.Many life assurance groups issued a lot of annuities that offered clients the better of a fixed return or a rise in the stock market. Analysts suspect that some of these were imperfectly hedged. Meanwhile, life assurance groups – and other insurers, as well as pension funds – face losses on their portfolios of commercial mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate whole loans and corporate bonds.In a report published in February, S&P said the economic downturn would put “unprecedented stress” on these portfolios. Since then, analysts have become even more concerned about commercial real estate loans in particular.Lower credit ratings and counterparty concerns in turn have raised the cost of financing for life insurers and made it harder for them to raise capital if needed to shore up their finances.The rally in the stock market since its March lows has provided a strong boost to life assurance companies, other insurers and pension funds. But concerns about asset quality remain.Life assurers are historically very stable, with predictable outgoings and a strong cash flow from the sale of new business. However, in theory at least, they could be vulnerable in extremis either to a funding crisis or to a fear-induced rush to cash out policies with surrender values early.Life assurers do not have access to Federal Reserve liquidity, though their banking subsidiaries do.With defined-benefit pension funds, meanwhile, the main danger is that large accumulated losses could create a need for large top-up payments from the sponsoring companies. That would put a drag on profits, in effect forcing an increase in corporate saving that is likely to come at the expense of some investment, sapping growth. Losses on defined contribution plans fall directly on households.In depth: US banks
23;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2009-05-11T20:29:46Z;Bank stocks a drag on Wall Street;;US stocks fell on Monday, giving back almost all the gains made on Friday in the wake of the government’s stress test results.Investors remained focused on financial stocks after three companies said they would issue shares to raise capital to pay off government bail-out funds.The results of last week’s stress tests had revealed that Capital One, BB&T and US Bancorp would not need new capital to survive the government’s adverse economic scenario. But the companies said on Monday that they would raise money to free themselves from government restrictions.Capital One said it would sell 56m common shares and its stock fell 13.5 per cent to $27.10. US Bancorp said it wanted $2.5bn from its issuance, sending its shares 9.9 per cent lower to $18.50.BB&T said it would use the additional $1.5bn it planned to raise also to boost tier one capital, an effort supported by a deep cut in its dividend. The company fell 7.6 per cent to $24.34.Other banking stocks also lost ground after last week’s impressive gains, even though reports over the weekend indicated the banks may need less capital than estimated if their earnings remain strong.Wells Fargo lost ground after it said it could fill its remaining $13.7bn deficit with earnings alone by November, having taken $7.5bn from a public offering on Friday. Its shares avoided the worst of the selling but slipped 5.9 per cent to $26.53.Even Morgan Stanley, which also successfully raised capital from a stock offering on Friday and which was upgraded by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Monday, lost ground. Its shares fell 7.6 per cent to $26.07, even though Bank of America said its shares would do well on “long-term earnings power”.Prudential, the life assurer, was a particularly heavy faller after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to “neutral”, slashing its price target. Goldman upgraded the company just over two weeks ago, triggering a 10.8 per cent rise in its shares. They lost 12.3 per cent to $40.33 on Monday.Principal Financial, Prudential’s rival, also slumped after saying it would offer 42.3m shares, valued at over $1bn, in order to bolster its capital position. The shares lost 14.1 per cent to $20.34.Huntington Bancshares was one of the few financial companies to find gains as Bank of America said the company would start posting a profit in 2011. Its shares jumped 9.8 per cent to $5.71.The S&P 500 fell 2.2 per cent to 909.24, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8 per cent to 8,418.77.“If the S&P can get through the first half of this week without breaking through 900 it will be a win for the bulls,” said David Kreinces, portfolio manager at ETF PM.The Nasdaq Composite index fell a relatively modest 0.5 per cent to 1,731.24, however, amid resilience from technology stocks.Microsoft lost 0.5 per cent to $19.32 after the company said it would sell debt in order to take advantage of its rare triple-A credit rating. It has resisted taking on debt for years.“The fact that Microsoft is issuing debt suggests they must think the environment is pretty good and rates are going to be going up because the economy will improve,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors.Intel rallied ahead of the European Union’s decision on whether to approve action against the company on allegations that it abused its dominant market position. Lawyers forecast that any potential fine could be one of the heaviest implemented in Europe but the stock edged 0.5 per cent higher to $15.37.Energy producers lost ground as the price of oil fell following its recent rally, during which it reached new highs for the year. Chevron lost 3.4 per cent to $68 and ExxonMobil dropped 1.6 per cent to $69.27.CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company, was one of the S&P’s biggest fallers after the company was downgraded by Goldman Sachs to “sell”. Its shares dropped 10.6 per cent to $8.38.General Motors was another heavy faller as Fritz Henderson, chief executive, said it was “more probable” that the company would file for bankruptcy by June 1 in his latest update on the car company’s restructuring efforts. Its stock gave up 10.6 per cent to $1.44.

Wells Fargo, which jumped more than 23 per cent during the previous session, fell 4 per cent to $23.27. JPMorgan, whose chief executive Jamie Dimon said “the banking system can handle an awful lot of loss and be okay”, fell 2.7 per cent to $34.82.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global said: “The market seemed a little bit rose-
coloured yesterday but investors have become more pessimistic again today.”But Bank of America and Citigroup, which some analysts say already have the prospect of further equity raising priced into their stock, both found gains. Bank of America rose 4.4 per cent to $10.84, while Citigroup climbed 3.4 per cent to $3.31.There was further support for financials from Principal Financial Group, the life assurer, which jumped 10.8 per cent to $18.75 after first-quarter sales boosted its profits, even though the company missed earnings estimates as the value of its investments fell.The S&P 500 lost 0.4 per cent to 903.80 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.5 per cent to 1,754.12 points. The Dow Jones was marginally stronger, down 0.2 per cent to 8,410.65 points.Colin Cieszynski, analyst at CMC Markets, said the moderate movements were actually a good sign. “This can be viewed as a sign of accumulation and provides a significant contrast to last autumn when each bounce was met with a wall of selling,” he wrote.Steel companies fell after AK Steel warned it would make a wider-than-expected second-quarter loss as struggling carmakers General Motors and Chrysler cut orders. AK Steel shed
8.1 per cent to $14.39, while US Steel dropped 2.1 per cent to $30.81.Energy companies were also heavy fallers as the oil price fell from a five-month high and Chesapeake Energy reported widening losses. The company was forced to write down the value of its oil and natural gas businesses amid falling prices. Chesapeake fell 10.6 per cent to $20.40, and the energy sector was the worst-performing on the S&P, losing 1.3 per cent.The losses came in spite of positive words on the economy from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Bernanke said he saw the housing market stabilising, but job losses continuing to rise.Investors also seemed little reassured by figures showing that non-manufacturing activity slowed its contraction during April.DR Horton disappointed the market after the homebuilder reported a wider loss than analysts had predicted. Revenue from homebuilding fell sharply, cancelling out a steep fall in writedowns. The company’s shares gave up 8.5 per cent to $12.35.However, consumer companies received a boost after Kraft Foods, which makes household brands such as Maxwell House coffee, reported better-than-expected profits as dairy costs fell. The company’s shares rose 4 per cent to $25.22.There was also good news on consumer activity from MGM Mirage, the casino operator that has been restructuring its debts recently in the face of a sharp fall in revenues.The company posted a surprise first-quarter profit after selling one of its casinos, and also said that occupancy rates at its hotels had begun to recover. Its shares jumped 35.6 per cent to $12.80.Avon Products took some of the shine off the sector after the cosmetics retailer earned less than analysts had forecast, with sales and revenues falling. The shares lost 8.5 per cent to $23.08.Archer Daniels Midland, the agricultural processor, also missed analysts’ forecasts after suffering a 98 per cent drop in profits.Demand for the company’s oilseeds and agricultural services dropped and the stock fell 8.9 per cent to $23.84."

Mr Bernanke was due to say he sees the housing market stabilising, but that job losses will continue to rise.Equities were also helped by figures showing that non-manufacturing activity slowed its contraction during April.McKesson, the pharmaceutical company, beat analysts; estimates with its earnings, but fell back before the bell after it lowered its earnings forecast the full year, which it said assumed the economy and financial markets would stay flat for most of the fiscal year until March 2010. Its shares lost 1.6 per cent to $39.75.DR Horton also disappointed the market after the homebuilder reported a loss of 34 cents per share, wider than analysts had predicted. Revenue from homebuilding fell sharply, cancelling out a steep fall in writedowns also.

The deal, which would be paid for using Pulte stocks, valued Centex's shares at $10.50, a significant premium to Tuesday’s closing price. Centex jumped 27.6 per cent to $9.72, while Pulte fell 4.3 per cent to $10.31.This gave further confidence to the sector after the number of mortgage applications was shown to have risen 4.7 per cent during the week ending April 3 as low interest rates begin to take effect. Lennar benefitted from that strength, gaining 10.9 per cent to $7.91.The benchmark S&P 500 index managed to find moderate gains after two loss-making sessions, rising 0.7 per cent to 821.26 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.6 per cent to 7,832.97 points and the Nasdaq Composite index lifted 1.5 per cent to $1,584.31.Alcoa was the first major company to report its first quarter earnings, and the aluminium maker made a loss of $0.59 per share from continuing operations as a lack of demand for the metal, especially from the ailing car industry, drove down prices. This was slightly worse than analysts had predicted and the company fell in post-market trade on Tuesday. But it recovered during Wednesday morning’s trade, with many analysts saying the results could have been even worse. Its shares rose 0.9 per cent to $7.86.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said that the disappointing results from Alcoa were unlikely to spook investors. “The company tends to disappoint and is unlikely to move the market,” he wrote.Alcoa was followed by Constellation Brands, the owner of several big alcoholic brands including Robert Mondavi wines, which also reported mildly disappointing results. The company made a loss of $1.88 a share, hurt by disappointing demand in Europe and Australia over the winter festivities. Its shares lost 3.4 per cent to $11.24.Family Dollar Stores was able to increase its profits in line with expectations as cash-strapped consumers shopped in its budget stores. The company made $0.60 per share, as forecast, but the shares rose after the company said it would make better profits than previously predicted for the fiscal year. They gained 5.8 per cent to $34.55.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, made a profit of $0.55 per share, which was lower than its previous quarter, but far outstripped consensus expectations of $0.44 per share. Its shares picked up 19.2 per cent to $30.41.“It’s not earth shaking, and there is still a lot of uncertainty out there,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “But if we see several companies report in line with expectations, we may see support come into the market.”Mr Cook also said the results for consumer companies were encouraging, even though ABC figures showed that consumer confidence declined during the week ending April 5. “We are seeing consumer spending increase even if incomes are falling. People are still buying,” said Mr Cook.The agricultural company Mosaic reported particularly disappointing results however, although it did not prove a major drag on the equities market as it is not listed on any of the best known market measures. The company made $0.18 per share compared to analysts’ estimates of $0.22 after prices tumbled last year. Its shares lost 1.2 per cent to $42.42.Many analysts are scrambling to lower their estimates on companies before the earnings season gathers pace next week. Wednesday saw Morgan Stanley fall after Oppenheimer slashed its forecast for the company’s first quarter earnings from $0.37 in profits per share to $0.59 in losses. Morgan Stanley’s shares fell 2.5 per cent to $22.73.Energy stocks were the major drag on the index however, as the price of oil continued to fall. Early in New York, oil was trading $0.89 lower at $48.26 per barrel of US crude. Exxon Mobil and Chevron both dropped 0.8 per cent to $68.18 and $67.84 respectively.European stocks were mixed early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index 0.1 per cent higher at 761.15 points.

27;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2009-04-08T20:22:09Z;US life insurers rally on bailout hopes;;Shares of US life assurance companies surged on Wednesday on hopes the US Treasury would soon approve a number of the sector’s troubled companies for access to government bailout funds.The Treasury is nearing a decision on whether to provide funds to several life assurance companies with bank subsidiaries, and announcements could come in the next week or two.A Treasury spokesman said: “There are a number of life insurers who met the requirements for the capital purchase programme because of their thrift or bank holding company status.”Lincoln National led the sector’s gains on Wednesday, soaring 36.2 per cent in morning trade to $9.39. Principal Financial Group rose 23.15 per cent to $12.50, while Hartford Financial Services rallied 21 per cent to $10.23 and Genworth Financial rose to 12.9 per cent to $2.36. Phoenix rose 15.3 per cent to $1.73. All have bank holding company or savings and loan status, or own a thrift.The decision to open the bailout programme to insurers with bank subsidiaries was made by the Bush administration. The Obama administration has maintained this position.Since then some life insurers that did not have a bank decided to acquire one to become eligible for bailout funds, including Genworth Financial, Hartford Financial and Lincoln National. Seven insurers have announced they have applied for the funds. Officials indicated the total number of applications was less than 10.“These companies are among the hundreds of financial institutions in the [capital purchase programme] pipeline that will be reviewed and funded as appropriate on a rolling basis,” said the Treasury spokesman.While there is a general expectation that the bank subsidiaries of life assurance groups will receive some share of bailout funds, officials cautioned that final decisions on individual applications have not been made. Administration officials said there was no additional allocation of bailout money for life assurers – and any amount given to their banks would come from funds already set aside for banks in general.The Treasury is sticking to its estimate that it will allocate about $218bn under the capital purchase programme inherited from the Bush administration. It has already allocated $198.5bn, but it also expects about $25bn in capital will be returned and could be reallocated to new recipients.The prospect of a near-term injection of Troubled Assets Relief programme capital comes as the sector has suffered from losses related to guarantees on investment products, as well as losses from portfolios that were heavily exposed to the financial sector and equity markets in general.The losses have eroded capital, leading to a string of rating agency downgrades that have made it more difficult for some insurers to raise new money.

21.3 per cent to $12.31 and Hartford Financial picked up 13.5 per cent to $9.59.“An injection of capital similar to the banks would provide enough capital for even the most thinly capitalised institutions to weather a prolonged and protracted credit cycle if the S&P 500 does not drop below 600,” wrote Thomas Gallagher at Credit Suisse.Meanwhile, Pulte Homes said it was to buy Centex in a $1.3bn takeover that would create the country’s largest homebuilder by sales.

Lennar also benefited, gaining 5.1 per cent to $7.49.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.2 per cent up at 825.16 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.6 per cent to 7,837.11 points.The Nasdaq Composite index, up 1.9 per cent to 1,590.66 points, continued to outperform on strength from the technology sector, which some analysts have said will lead the market out of the downturn. Microsoft was the exerted the greatest pull, gaining 2.3 per cent to $19.19.Alcoa was the first leading company to report first quarter earnings, and the aluminium maker made a loss of 59 cents per share from continuing operations as a lack of demand for the metal, especially from the ailing car industry, drove down prices.That was slightly worse than analysts had predicted and the company fell before recovering some ground on Wednesday, and closed 3.5 per cent up at $8.06.Alcoa was followed by Constellation Brands, the owner of several big alcoholic brands including Robert Mondavi wines, which also reported mildly disappointing results.The company made a loss of $1.88 a share, hurt by falling demand in Europe and Australia over the Christmas period. Its shares lost 5.1 per cent to $11.05.Family Dollar Stores was able to increase its profits in line with expectations as cash-strapped consumers shopped in its budget stores. The company made 60 cents per share, as forecast, but the shares rose after it said it would make better profits than previously predicted for the fiscal year. The stock gained 6 per cent to $34.63.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, made a profit of 55 cents per share, which was lower than its previous quarter, but far outstripped consensus expectations of 44 cents per share. Its shares picked up 24.3 per cent to $31.70. “It’s not earth shaking, and there is still a lot of uncertainty out there, but if we see several companies report in line with expectations, we may see support come into the market,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “We are also seeing consumer spending increase even if incomes are falling. People are still buying.”The non-essential consumer goods sector was the S&P’s strongest.Many analysts are hurrying to lower estimates before the earnings season gathers pace. Morgan Stanley fell 2.7 per cent to $22.69 on Wednesday after Oppenheimer slashed its forecast for the bank’s first quarter earnings from a profit per share of 37 cents to a loss of 59 cents."
29;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2009-02-27T21:34:52Z;Citi deal hits US financials;;US stocks plummeted again on Friday to levels not seen since 1996.Details of a government plan to take a 36 per cent stake in Citigroup and more negative economic data caused the heavy falls, which took shares below Monday’s level, when they tested 1997 lows.Investors balked at the dilution of Citi’s shares by the government holding as well as the news that the company would suspend all dividend payments.But an annualised 6.2 per cent fall for the fourth quarter in US gross domestic product, the sharpest since 1982, meant that the whole market was hit.The benchmark S&P 500 index dropped 2.4 per cent for the day, finishing at 735.09.Citigroup saw 39 per cent of its share price wiped out, finishing at $1.50. It was joined by Bank of America, which shed 25.8 per cent to $3.95 and Wells Fargo, which lost 16 per cent to $12.10. Banks fell 8.7 per cent, and the financial sector overall lost 7.4 per cent.Insurers, meanwhile, fared even worse, hit not only by general fears over the financial sector but also by the fact that Standard & Poor’s cut its rating for 10 companies in the sector.Principal Financial lost 24.6 per cent to $7.99, Metlife dropped 23.1 per cent to $18.46 and Lincoln National fell 20.1 per cent to $8.59.“The insurers have been big backers of commercial securities and that area is getting weak as well,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial. “The whole financial sector is going to continue to show weakness,” he added.General Electric slumped in afternoon trade after the group cut its quarterly dividend from 31 cents to 10 cents per share. Even though the news had been widely expected, its shares fell 6.5 per cent to $8.53.It was a mixed day for healthcare stocks, which fell in afternoon trading after early gains as the market continued to digest the government’s healthcare plan.Humana recovered to gain 0.1 per cent to $23.67, but other companies lost out, such as Johnson & Johnson, which fell 4.7 per cent to $50. Overall, the sector lost 4.2 per cent, contributing to a total fall of 11.4 per cent for the week.“When people started looking at the details of the Obama plan, it got even more frightening for healthcare companies,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Dell did well after its earnings beat analysts’ predictions and it announced it would seek to save an extra $1bn as part of ongoing cost-cutting efforts. Its shares were up 3.9 per cent to $8.53.Heavy selling was also seen on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index. The Dow fell 1.7 per cent at 7,062.93, while the Nasdaq fell 0.98 per cent to 1,377.84 The Dow has now seen six straight months of falls.The sell-off capped a turbulent week, which saw the equities market breaking through November’s lows after heavy selling on Monday which some analysts called “capitulation” and “a technical breakdown”.Despite a mid-week rally, all three indices finished around 4 per cent down for the week, with different sectors having pulled in opposite directions throughout on announcements from Washington.On Tuesday and Wednesday, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped trigger a surge in banking stocks when he reassured the market that the government had no plans to nationalise banks.His message was boosted when Mr Obama announced that, as part of his budget, he wanted to put aside $250bn into a reserve fund in case the financial sector needed further bail-outs.These announcements meant that financial stocks remained one of the week’s big winners, even after Friday’s selling, finishing the week 2 per cent up.“The government is starting to realise it needs to either nationalise the banks or be very clear that it will not,” said Mr Paulsen. “But it could still have been more explicit this week.”
30;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2009-02-19T23:59:23Z;US bank stocks fall to 17-year low;;US banking shares hit their lowest level since 1992 on Thursday as fears mounted that the government would be forced to nationalise a key institution.Further heavy selling of key names – Bank of America and Citigroup were once again among the worst performing, down 14 per cent to $3.93 and 13.8 per cent to $2.51, respectively – helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its lowest level in six years.Shares in several regional banks also sustained heavy losses as the S&P financial index dropped 5.2 per cent to its lowest level since 1995.“Every time someone mentions the word [nationalisation] then investors shiver – and with good reason,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “There’s a lot of angst over what [US Treasury Secretary] Geithner’s going to propose.”Insurers also suffered badly after Fitch cut its ratings on the senior unsecured debt of Prudential Financial to BBB and issued a negative outlook. Shares in Prudential lost 15.9 per cent to $19.02 while Hartford Financial tumbled 24.5 per cent to $7.73.Talk of stake-building helped Principal Financial buck a downward trend for much of the session a day after the insurer said that it was exploring options to raise capital. The shares succumbed late in the day, off 0.4 per cent to $10.51.Relative strength in the energy, consumer and telecoms sectors helped pare the losses in the wider market, which drifted between losses and gains in choppy trading.The S&P 500 closed down 1.2 per cent at 778.94, its fourth consecutive retreat.The S&P slumped this week beneath the psychologically significant 800 level for the first time since November, which has prompted concerns among technical analysts that the benchmark index would test an 11-year low. The S&P index stands only 3.5 per cent away from that bottom.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.2 per cent lower at 7,465.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index 1.7 per cent weaker at 1,442.82.The tech sector shed 3.3 per cent overall in the wake of Hewlett-Packard’s results, which prompted concerns over the prospects of other computer manufacturers.Shares in HP, a bellwether for the industry, lost 7.9 per cent to $31.39 after the group missed its first-quarter sales estimates and issued a worse-than-expected forecast for the coming year.“We think the drivers of the revenue weakness are not isolated to HP but instead a reflection of the macro blues,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan. Dell was one of the worst hit in the fallout, off 6.1 per cent to $8.12.Elsewhere, earnings that were not quite as bad as feared gave bargain hunters at some reasons to return to other sectors.Energy stocks found positive territory after the latest government report showed an unexpected drop in crude inventories.ExxonMobil edged 0.3 per cent higher to $72.16 even though Barclays downgraded its view from “overweight” to “equal weight”.Paul Cheng, analyst, said the stock’s valuation “appears toppy” and said the group may lower its medium term production target at the forthcoming analyst meeting.Telecoms performed relatively well, lifted 1 per cent overall by a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss from Sprint Nextel. The shares leapt 19.9 per cent to $3.25 as the group also said it expected subscriber losses to improve this year.Consumer discretionaries also outperformed. Whole Foods bounced 37.2 per cent to $12.75 as its first-quarter earnings fell less than forecast. “Even with the considerable economic headwind, the company, we believe, is beginning to take the steps to reverse the decline in its operating performance,” wrote analysts at Jefferies, who upgraded their recommendation on the stock to “buy”.Video game shares did well on an upbeat forecast from GameStop, which rallied 7.1 per cent to $26.63.Meanwhile, shares in drugstore Walgreens added 0.7 per cent to $25.83 on the back of well-received results from peer CVS Caremark, which climbed 6.4 per cent to $28.71.Bucking the upward momentum in the consumer sector, however, was Expedia, which lost 7.4 per cent to $7.90 after the online travel agency disclosed worse-than-expected earnings.
31;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2008-10-09T19:45:42Z;MetLife sells stock at a discount to raise $2bn;;It emerged on Thursday that MetLife, the largest US life assurer, had to sell stock at a discount on Wednesday in an effort to reassure the markets over its capital base, helping to drive down the shares of its competitors on fears they would have to follow suit.MetLife, which has seen its market capitalisation almost halve so far this month, sold the 75m shares at $26.50 a share on Wednesday, 28 per cent less than its closing price on Tuesday, raising nearly $2bn.Insurers’ stocks have been severely hit in recent weeks and the cost of insuring their debt has risen to record levels on concerns that their exposure to credit markets and the extent of their leverage could rapidly eat into their capital bases.Last month, AIG, which was once the world’s biggest insurer, was bailed out after huge loses in its financial products unit forced it close to collapse.MetLife’s sale of stock helped to drive down other insurers as investors bet that they would also need to dilute shareholders.Prudential Financial fell as much as 38 per cent in morning trading, while Principal Financial Group fell by as much as 14.5 per cent.“Investors [hedge funds] think they are the next to raise capital …and now, for the first time in a month, the shorts can actually short financials again, so Pru is the focus,” said Alan Devlin, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.Hartford Financial sold $2.5bn in stock and debt to Allianz SE earlier this week. UBS on Thursday cut its price guidance on the company to $26 a share from $70 a share.Analysts expect insurers to return for repeated capital raisings in order to maintain their credit ratings – which are critical to attracting new business.Some also expect smaller insurers that have difficulty raising capital to be acquired by larger competitors.“I wouldn’t be surprised to see MetLife or ManuLife, now it has raised capital, to consume a smaller competitor who can’t raise capital – a Lincoln or Principal for example,” said Mr Devlin.
32;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2008-09-14T21:22:08Z;Face to Face: Global group from Iowa with diversity on its mind;;"People from outside the US sometimes mix up Iowa with Idaho, or even Illinois. Jim McCaughan, despite being from Scotland, seems to be quite clear on what it means to be from Iowa. PDF“We’re an Iowan company,” he says proudly of Principal Global Investors, an asset manager with $245bn (£139bn, €173bn) under management and offices around the world. “We’ve taken the very best of our culture, the team work and the reliability, and built a global company.”Principal Global Investors’ parent company, Principal Financial Group, was established 130 years ago and floated as a public company in 2001. A couple of years earlier, the financial services group, which is a leading provider of defined contribution pension products in the US, had decided to give its asset management arm more autonomy.“Our full service pension products were getting more attractive to larger players,” explains Mr McCaughan. “This led us to a very different competitive set.” He explains that while small and mid-size pension schemes focus on operations as the distinguishing factor among pension providers, larger schemes look primarily at investment returns.As well as becoming a returns-focused asset manager, Principal Global Investors has also stretched itself far from its centre in Des Moines, Iowa.“In line with what the market wants – and it’s really changed this decade – we’re now set up as a seamless global investment management group,” says Mr McCaughan, who is proud of the fact that when he logs on to a computer in the London office, it brings up a desktop identical to the one he sees in Des Moines, or would see in Singapore.Globally integrated systems are not as straightforward as one might think, according to Mr McCaughan, because in some companies “they cut across local fiefdoms”. To counter that risk, Principal Global Investors does not treat its offices as profit centres.“We measure success by metrics like investment performance and asset gathering,” says Mr McCaughan. “We’ve made our profit centres the asset classes.”From that perspective, equities look to be doing well for Principal Global Investors. Out of 12 equity sectors, just two have failed to produce consistent outperformance over the last one, three and five years for the asset manager: US large cap growth has struggled year to date, while Japanese equities have proved a stumbling block for some time.Fixed income looks less sparkling: “We’re an A student getting B minus results,” comments Mr McCaughan. “We’ve had a credit bias, which means our numbers are down a bit. That does at least mean yields are high,” he adds. “And it will heal in the next two years.”Real estate, in which Principal Global Investors has won awards for being a “green” investor, provides a steady track record for the company, despite being out of favour at the moment as an asset class.An unlikely seeming outcome of the push to globalisation is that the Iowan company is a pioneer in Islamic products. This arose out of a joint venture with Malaysian financial services group CIMB.About a fifth of the $5.4bn of assets managed by the joint venture is shariah-compliant debt or equity.Principal Global Investors’ culture may grow from its Iowan roots, but it has come a long way.Mr McCaughan is clear that diversity is essential for the successful running of a global business. With a top management team consisting of four women and four men, six from the US and two from the UK, he is dissatisfied with the level of diversity thus far achieved. “Understanding how clients see the world is very
important.”Thus far, clients see the world from the US, Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East is on the agenda, as Mr McCaughan expects petrodollar-funded sovereign wealth funds to be the biggest business opportunity for asset managers in the next 10 years. This would also play to the company’s strength in shariah products.“We will be moving in that direction,” says Mr McCaughan. “If I had known six years ago what the oil price would be doing now, I would have made it a higher priority.”Instead, Principal Global Investors has spent much of the last six years on a buying spree, with five additions to its investment business. Each new acquisition has had a particular specialisation, such as US growth equities, preferred securities or short-dated stable value funds (money market funds).Because the strategy entailed buying only businesses that fitted the Principal Global Investors philosophy, most of them have seen little change under the new regime. “On entry, we liked the investment approach. That’s why we bought it. So don’t mess with it.” This is Mr McCaughan’s simple answer to whether there
has been much integration.While Principal Global Investors gained new investment functionality, the target companies gained access to distribution and operational capabilities, he explains, citing Columbia Circle, bought nearly three years ago. At the time, it had $3bn under management, where it now has $16bn.“Another thing is that clients want the entrepreneurial spirit of a boutique, but are nervous about whether they have the institutional strength and compliance skills.”It is difficult to pin down how many of Principal Global Investors’ investment centres are effectively boutiques, since the level of integration seems to vary widely, but Mr McCaughan seems unfazed by this
fuzziness. “Our investment teams are highly autonomous, but they do have things in common: fundamental investing, risk controls, a long-term approach.”According to Mr McCaughan, even though several of the teams are newcomers to the group, “the heritage of managing pension money makes our people very aware of these things”.Principal Financial Group’s business focus on defined contribution products, in particular, the US 401k pension, has led to a concentration on participant directed pension products. This means Principal Global Investors has looked for openings in regions where such products are already standard, or are likely to become so.Mr McCaughan cites Australia and Chile as examples of countries where Principal Global Investors has established such a business and China, India and Malaysia as places likely to build participant-led pensions systems in the future.Europe, for the moment, is too fragmented and not sufficiently committed to participant choice for Principal Financial Group to build a business there, leaving its asset management arm to establish itself purely as an investment provider in this region. Mr McCaughan seems happy with progress so far."
33;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2008-04-27T21:11:54Z;Equity fund outflows bring need to adapt;;Massive outflows from equity funds, which have long been the profit mainstay of fund management companies, are accelerating a seismic shift in the $13,000bn US fund industry.Traditional money managers, which have enjoyed double-digit growth for most of the past decade, are now struggling with low growth in actively managed mutual funds, their core product, while hedge fund managers and low-margin indexed products gain strongly.The recent flight to cash by both retail and institutional investors, who put $140bn into money market funds in the first quarter of this year, has exacerbated the situation. Most of the money was taken out of traditionally managed equities funds and strategies.Kevin Parker, the president of Deutsche Bank’s $800bn money management business, told the Financial Times recently: “On one side, you have exchange-traded funds and, on the other, you have [private equity firm] Blackstone and the hedge funds. It leaves firms like ours, traditional long-only buy-side firms, needing to make some very tough decisions.“You can do nothing, which is a strategy. Milk the business for as long as it goes. But some day, maybe in my lifetime, the world will be split into passive investors and into alternatives. What’s left in the middle is an endangered species.”Jim McCaughan, the chief executive of Principal Financial Group, believes the asset management industry has, in the past two to three years, undergone its biggest change since the 1960s, which saw the advent of performance benchmarks and specialist asset managers.Like Mr Parker and others, he sees the change as being investors’ shift to either “beta” in the form of indexed money or “alpha” in the form of absolute returns. A recent study by McKinsey estimated that corporate pension plans would, in the next five years, invest at least half the total of the $2,300bn they now have in equities into different strategies. Likewise, state pension funds are continuing to lift their allocation to private equity and hard assets such as commodities and timber in an attempt to increase returns.“The changes in the next three to five years are bigger than those in the past three decades,” said the study called “The coming shake-out in the defined benefit market”.Most analysts estimate mutual fund growth will be only about 2 per cent in coming years, meaning that fund firms must find new sources of revenue. Many are developing new and more lucrative high-margin products such as 130/30 funds – a modified long/short fund – and “wrapping” products with insurance policies.Others have expanded their hedge fund offerings. Pimco, which has several hedge funds, is launching an “unconstrained” fund – a term increasingly used instead of hedge fund – which will invest in fixed-income securities without being tied to a particular asset class or strategy.Institutional managers are quietly introducing more performance fees, rather than management fees, in an effort to lift revenue.Meanwhile, retail funds that have been closed for years have reopened to new investors in an effort to staunch asset declines. Fidelity opened its Magellan fund, which had been closed for a decade, after Harry Lange, the new manager, said he was having to sell stocks to meet the steady flow of redemptions.The Sequoia fund, which is run according to the model of Warren Buffett, will reopen on May 1 after being closed for 26 years. The fund managers said investor outflows had pushed its assets down to below those of a decade ago.The big outflows from managed equity funds could also have an impact on the stock market as more funds sell to meet redemptions.
34;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
35;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2007-10-23T20:57:11Z;Healthcare burden ‘causing pension cutbacks’;;The rising cost of healthcare is cutting into Americans’ ability to contribute to their retirement accounts and save for other long-term expenses, according to a survey to be released on Wednesday.The survey – conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a non-partisan research group – found that 63 per cent of Americans have experienced an increase in the costs they are responsible for paying under their health plans in the past year. Of those, 30 per cent have decreased the amount they save for retirement, and more than 50 per cent have reduced household savings due to the burden of greater healthcare costs, according to the survey, based on telephone inter­views with 1,000 US adults.“It’s very worrisome,” said Jerry Ripperger, director of consumer health for Principal Financial Group, an investment and insurance company, one of the study’s underwriters. “As a country, we’ve experienced two consecutive years of dis-savings, meaning that we’re collectively spending more than we’re making.”The growing cost of healthcare is one of the most significant issues in the upcoming presidential election, as spending on healthcare is expected to reach $4,000bn in 2015, or 20 per cent of gross domestic product, according to the National Coalition on Healthcare, a non-partisan health lobby group.“Concern over rising costs and frustration and discontent with the system have made healthcare the num­ber one domestic public policy issue in the election,” said Mr Ripperger. “It’s not concerns over quality or con­cerns over access, it’s concerns over costs. It clearly resonates with voters.”The survey indicated that US workers place a high value on employer-sponsored health insurance. More than 90 per cent of those surveyed support an employer mandate, and nearly half said all employers, regardless of size, should be required to provide and contribute to health insurance coverage for staff.“Workers appear to understand that if healthcare costs continue to rise, it’s going to come out of their compensation somewhere down the line,” Mr Ripperger said.
36;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2007-06-27T20:42:35Z;Rydex sale aims to cash in on boom;;Rydex, a fund management group that has made its name selling sophisticated strategies to retail investors, has quietly put itself up for sale as the fund industry booms and valuations rise.Rydex, which has $14bn under management, has been asking would-be buyers for up to $1bn, according to industry executives who recently held talks with the group.Rydex is known for launching mutual funds with innovative strategies such as leveraging and shorting, bringing institutional-style management to retail investors.Close to half its assets under management are in exchange traded funds (ETFs), which might make Rydex attractive to companies wanting to boost their presence in that sector.Invesco – formerly Amvescap – recently bought PowerShares and has been mentioned by some as a possible buyer for Rydex. However, it is believed the group has not been in talks. Etrade has also been mentioned as a suitor.Skip Viragh, who founded Rydex in 1993 with the industry’s first leveraged mutual fund, died in 2003. There have been rumours of a sale ever since, and the group appears to be nearing a deal. Rydex declined to comment.Several fund management groups have changed hands this year as the industry consolidates and owners move to take advantage of high valuations.Last week Nuveen, a closed-end fund manager, was sold to private equity firm Madison Dearborn for $5.75bn, in the biggest asset management buyout to date.Also recently, Bank of America said it would sell its Marsico fund management unit back to the founder, Tom Marsico, and Washington Mutual offloaded its fund unit to Principal Financial Group.
37;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Pressure on CCB maiden fund;;The fund management joint venture of China Construction Bank, the country’s ­second largest lender, is ­facing growing pressure to attract more than Rmb4bn ($494m) of assets for its maiden fund, according to industry experts.CCB’s joint venture with Principal Financial Group, one of the biggest US pension services providers, is expected to conclude the fundraising process in mid-November, after a one-month offer period.It follows the recent launch of two rival maiden funds. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China’s joint venture with Credit Suisse First Boston raised Rmb4.4bn of assets in August. Last month, Bank of Communications said its joint venture with Schroders of the UK had raked in Rmb4.9bn. While strong demand had been expected for the maiden fund of ICBC, the country’s biggest lender, analysts were surprised at the pulling power – and distribution clout – of BoCom, China’s fifth-largest bank.Peter Alexander, head of Z-Ben Advisors, a specialist research firm, said: “When new products come out, the first one takes the cream. But the BoCom-Schroders fund bucked the trend.”Hence the pressure on CCB to raise at least Rmb4bn of assets in what has become an increasingly crowded funds market. Earlier this year, Beijing allowed three banks – ICBC, BoCom and CCB – to launch fund management joint ventures, as part of a plan to bolster the ailing stock market.Last month, it emerged that Agricultural Bank of China, the smallest and weakest of the country’s “Big Four” state banks, was in talks with Credit Agricole to form a domestic fund management joint venture.Given their distribution clout, the bank-led joint ventures were expected to squeeze out independent fund managers, including Sino-foreign joint ventures and local securities houses.However, independent fund managers have launched a flurry of new products designed to compete directly with the banks’ maiden funds. “We have seen five to six new products a month, which shows that they [the independent fund managers] are not intimidated by the banks,” said Mr ­Alexander. He pointed to the successful launch of two short-term bond funds by Boshi and E-fund, two local fund houses.There are 48 fund companies vying for investors’ attention amid a continuing equity downturn. ICBC and BoCom had been expected to launch money market funds, but finally launched equity funds. Chinese financial regulators are believed to have forced the companies to change their plans in July, when the country’s stock market hit an eight-year low.
38;PFG;Principal Financial Group Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;ResCap shrugs off GM stigma;;Residential Capital, the newly created retail mortgage unit of General Motors, sold $4bn of bonds on Tuesday, marking its debut in the capital markets and its acceptance by investors as a borrower largely independent of its troubled parent company.The deal, a package of bonds with two-, five- and 10- year maturities, was finalised in New York. Price talk suggested spreads mid-way between higher-rated, established competitors such as Countrywide, and that of junk-rated Gmac, the financing arm of GM that owns ResCap.“There was some concern whether to view this as an auto bond or a finance company bond,” said Sasha Kamper, senior fixed income analyst at Principal Financial Group. But with pricing where it is, she said, the issue was “getting a good reception”.ResCap issued $1bn of two-year bonds priced on a floating-rate basis at 1.375 per cent over three-month Libor, according to market sources. The fixed-rate paper includes $2.5bn of five-year bonds priced to yield 2.625 per cent more than comparable US Treasuries, and $500m of 10-year bonds yielding 2.925 percentage points over Treasuries, the sources said. With investors welcoming the deal, ResCap’s bankers upped the proposed size of the five-year bond from $2bn reported on Tuesday morning.ResCap secured credit ratings towards the low end of the investment grade scale – with negative outlooks – from Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s earlier this month. Fitch and S&P in May downgraded GM and GMAC, the financing arm of GM that owns ResCap, to junk status, increasing their cost of unsecured borrowing and triggering the restructuring that led to the creation of ResCap.“ResCap wants to be viewed as a Countrywide knock-off,” said David Hendler, an analyst at independent research firm CreditSights. Countrywide, the number one in the US mortgage market, had about $140bn of assets at the end of March and is rated mid-investment grade by the rating agencies.But Mr Hendler said ResCap was “not doing the homework needed to get the A-grade”. ResCap is among the top 10 mortgage originators and servicers in the US, and had profits of almost $1bn in 2004 and assets of almost $100bn at the end of March. But operating independently of GMAC, ResCap’s “sugar daddy” in the past, would present new challenges, Mr Hendler said.He also said the level of ResCap’s disclosure of financial and strategic details fell short of Countrywide’s.Such concerns appear to be reflected in the expected pricing for the issue.The company’s investment grade rating puts it in the same broad rating category – although a few notches lower – than its competitor Countrywide.But the pricing of the deal put ResCap’s borrowing cost mid-way between that of Countrywide, and that of junk-rated GMAC, at levels similar to some other high-yield issues. Countrywide sold $500m of five-year bonds this month, paying just 0.83 per cent more than five-year US Treasury yields. Meanwhile, GMAC’s bonds currently trade at yields about 4.50 per cent over US government bonds.To secure investment grade ratings for ResCap, GM and GMAC accepted restrictions on their ability to raid the company’s assets and brought in independent directors.GM is thought to be considering how it might “ring fence” other parts of GMAC in the same way and is also negotiating the sale of a stake in its separate, smaller commercial mortgage business to private equity groups.The lead managers of ResCap’s bond issue were Banc of America, Bear Stearns, Citigroup and JP Morgan.
