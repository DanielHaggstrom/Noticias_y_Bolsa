0;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-02-21T13:36:48Z;Coronavirus provides an opportunity for Chinese tech companies;Solutions for virus-related problems include contactless food delivery and anxiety tracking;"As the coronavirus crisis in China escalated, I began to notice glowing news reports about the latest technological innovation to fight the outbreak: contactless delivery.McDonald’s, Starbucks, KFC, Pizza Hut and a string of Chinese delivery companies were trialling apparently cutting-edge technology. Intrigued by the buzz, I tried it. I logged on to Meituan, my Chinese food delivery app of choice, ordered “contactless delivery” dumplings and waited. Within an hour, my groundbreaking online shopping experience was complete: the courier left my dinner at the entrance to my apartment.The coronavirus outbreak is proving a marketing boon for Chinese tech companies with products they can connect to fighting the virus — however tenuous that connection may be.An industry body affiliated with China’s ministry of industry and information technology has identified a list of over 60 companies that claim to provide tech solutions to the coronavirus problem.Are you feeling anxious because of the virus? So am I. Never fear, emotion recognition is here. A company in Shanghai says it can assess your emotional state through a 60-second video analysis of your “skin, eyeballs, corners of your mouth, eyelids and bodily vibrations”. Once the emotion recognition discovers abnormal levels of aggression or stress, please seek the appropriate psychological help.If by some chance the emotion recognition test fails, there is always crowd recognition. Police across the country are using big data, provided by a company on the list called Beiyang, to identify individuals (who may or may not have coronavirus) in crowds. Beiyang claims its technology has led to a 22 per cent drop in calls to China’s emergency hotline, a 36 per cent drop in muggings and 40 per cent fewer burglaries.If you have been identified as a coronavirus patient through emotion and crowd recognition, then Yelink, a Shenzhen-based company, will provide you with all the technology — the internet of things, more big data, cloud computing — to effectively self-quarantine at home.Your temperature, heart beat and blood oxygen levels will be tracked through bluetooth thermometers and wristbands, which feed this data to the government’s “public health cloud” to be analysed. The company will even throw in a lock for your front door which will only unlock if the company’s smartphone app deems you healthy. Don’t try forcing the door open — the police will be alerted.While in quarantine, you can pass the time playing on your phone. Just do not post anything politically sensitive. If you do, UiBot, a smart robotics company, will find out as it conducts automatic keyword searches on WeChat, the messaging app that millions of Chinese use every day and which forms the bedrock of the country’s internet.These keyword searches have been so effective that China’s internet censors have blocked students across the country — currently stuck at home because of the virus — from taking online classes in politics, modern history and Chinese literature because of “sensitive” content — or, in the case of biology, “pornographic” content.In fairness to the industry body’s carefully curated coronavirus solutions list, it includes some surveillance tech which seems genuinely helpful: increased monitoring of the health of nursing care residents who may be overlooked as medical resources are redirected towards coping with the coronavirus outbreak; AI temperature checks for crowds; and digital platforms to more transparently co-ordinate the procurement and logistics of medical supplies.How much of this technology is here to stay when the coronavirus outbreak ends? It is likely that governments and businesses that have invested in upgrading their surveillance tech will not unwind it once the crisis is over. I’m going to bet that “contactless delivery” will not disappear either: those dumplings I order online will continue to be delivered straight to my doorstep.suelinwong@ft.com"
1;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-01-29T17:53:20Z;New McDonald’s chief aims to eat rivals’ lunch to drive growth;Fast-food chain posts best sales rise in a decade but warns of ‘muted’ industry footfall;The new chief executive of McDonald’s has said the fast-food group will need to take market share from competitors to sustain growth as the industry battles “pretty muted” customer footfall.Chris Kempczinski — who took charge last November after his predecessor, Steve Easterbrook, was fired for having a relationship with a colleague — said on Wednesday that McDonald’s had “broad-based momentum” but could do more to better serve customers.Despite the pressures on the sector, results on Wednesday underlined the successes McDonald’s had under Mr Easterbrook. Like-for-like sales jumped 5.9 per cent in 2019 — the biggest rise in at least a decade.Still, in the US, the company’s biggest market, the number of transactions at outlets open at least 13 months slipped 1.9 per cent over the past year.“We need to get to transaction growth, and that’s what everybody in the US is working toward right now,” Mr Kempczinski said.He said breakfast — the only time of day when industry footfall trends were improving — was a particular focus for McDonald’s. Competitors from Wendy’s to Dunkin’ have been rolling out new menu items in recent months.This week McDonald’s moved to strengthen its breakfast offering with the introduction of Chicken McGriddles and McChicken Biscuit.“Growth in this industry at this point is going to have to come through stealing share — traffic in the industry is pretty muted,” Mr Kempczinski told analysts during his first results presentation since his promotion from president of McDonald’s USA.He said McDonald’s also had to overcome other challenges including “growing labour costs [and] continuous technological disruption”.Despite the US footfall decline last year, Americans spent more on average per visit — in part because of the rollout of self-order kiosks. “People tend to have larger orders” when they use them, Mr Kempczinski said. Comparable sales in the group’s domestic market rose 5 per cent in 2019.In its “international operated” division — overseas markets in which McDonald’s both operates its own restaurants and has licensees — comparable sales were up 6.1 per cent.Across the group, net income in the fourth quarter rose 11 per cent from a year ago to $1.57bn on revenues of $5.4bn.Among the other challenges facing Mr Kempczinski is the deadly nCoV coronavirus that originated in China’s Hubei province.McDonald’s said on Wednesday that it had closed all its restaurants in Hubei, which amounted to “several hundred” outlets, but still had 3,000 open throughout China.Mr Kempczinski said the company had enacted an “epidemic prevention and control task force” with local authorities, including using kitchens to provide meals for healthcare workers and giving medical screening for customers. “It’s really an all-hands-on-deck effort,” he said.The chief executive said that while China accounted for 9 per cent of McDonald’s outlets worldwide, they produced less than 5 per cent of its revenues and about 3 per cent of operating income.“While China is a critical market for us, and we’re very concerned about the situation over there, its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small, assuming . . . that it stays contained to China,” he said.Shares in McDonald's were up 1.5 per cent by early afternoon in New York.
2;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-01-09T15:56:10Z;Fast food: Kentucky Fried China;Yum will be hard-pressed to maintain growth as it battles rise in food expenses;Why do the Chinese like Kentucky Fried Chicken so much? This frequently googled question has yet to be answered definitively. Queues stretched over a hundred metres when the US-fried chicken giant’s first store opened in Beijing three decades ago. Rapid expansion has left the outlets with more space. But the $180bn Chinese fast-food industry has since become a crowded trade.Local offerings from McDonald’s such as Sichuan chicken burgers and sausage pasta soup have helped it catch up to about half KFC’s number of stores and local market share. But that rapid growth has come at the expense of net profit.State-owned financial services group Citic seems to have noticed. It has become less enthusiastic about its stake in the China business of McDonald’s. It will offload a 22 per cent shareholding to Citic Capital, its private equity arm, increasing the latter’s to 42 per cent. The deal gives the business an enterprise value of about $3bn, up about a half from the estimated $2bn it was valued at when it changed hands three years ago.KFC’s dominant position has given parent company Yum China a market value six times its rival’s enterprise value. Even with 5,900 outlets, KFC has managed to maintain positive growth in same-store sales. Profit margins at 18 per cent are high enough, given hundreds of new store openings each year.That is about to change. Intensifying local competition threatens top-line growth. Rising ingredient prices, chicken, in particular, adds risks to the bottom line. Amid the swine flu outbreak, demand for pork alternatives has pushed up chicken prices over a quarter in December. Rents are increasing in big cities.Shares have risen more than 40 per cent in the past year. At 27 times forward earnings, they trade at a premium to global peers including McDonald’s. Yum will be hard-pressed to maintain growth while battling an unprecedented rise in food expenses to justify the premium. Investors will be better off buying a basket of fried chicken than one of China’s fast-food stocks this year.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
3;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-01-09T03:41:33Z;Citic to sell stake in McDonald’s China unit in push to cut debt;Sale to private equity arm comes as Beijing pushes state-owned enterprises to deleverage ;Citic plans to sell its minority stake in McDonald’s China business to one of its private equity arms as part of efforts to lower its debt as Beijing pushes for large, government-backed companies to deleverage.As part of any deal, Citic Capital, the private equity arm of the state-owned financial services group, would increase its stake in the US fast-food chain’s China operation from 20 per cent to 42 per cent, according to two people familiar with the matter. The transaction would give McDonald’s Chinese business an enterprise value of about $3bn, one of the people said. It had an estimated enterprise value of about $2bn three years ago when Citic and Carlyle, the private equity firm, jointly bought a controlling stake in the operations from McDonald’s US parent. The Chinese government has in recent years prodded state-owned enterprises to reduce debt, a side-effect of a years-long investment splurge. The sale will simplify the management of McDonald’s China unit, while freeing up cash that will help Citic improve its debt position, one person said.Margins for fast-food chains in China have been squeezed over the past year owing to an outbreak of African swine fever, which has driven up the prices of ingredients such as beef and chicken.“We expect protein input costs will continue to rise. As such, more cost management efforts are expected to be put in place to offset cost inflation,” said Michelle Huang, an analyst at Rabobank. McDonald’s main competitor in the world’s second-biggest economy is Yum China, which runs the KFC and Pizza Hut franchises in the country. “McDonald’s is a laggard compared to Yum China. It’s not growing like people hoped after the Citic investment,” said Shaun Rein, founder of China Market Research Group, a Shanghai-based research consultancy. Since they were acquired by Citic and Carlyle, however, McDonald’s China operations have grown significantly, opening about 400 restaurants annually in the country. “Our top line revenue is growing a lot because we are expanding so quickly. We need a lot of” capital expenditure, said one investor in McDonald’s China business. “We aren’t looking at net profit.” In 2018, private equity groups Hillhouse Capital and KKR launched failed bid to buy Yum China for almost $18bn.McDonald’s efforts to catch up with Yum China brands have included a push to move more of its operations online, assisted by internet and social media group Tencent. However, McDonald’s still lags behind its rival in terms of its number of outlets, despite support from Citic’s property arm that has allowed the brand to secure prime locations in large cities such as Shanghai. A spokesperson for McDonald’s in China said there would be a bidding process for Citic’s stake but declined to comment further.Citic Capital declined to comment.Carlyle, whose stake would not be affected by the transaction, did not respond to requests for comment.
4;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-11-12T20:02:22Z;McDonald’s faces sexual harassment claims;Class action lawsuit alleges ‘toxic’ workplace culture;McDonald’s is facing claims that it has failed to do enough to prevent sexual harassment in the latest in a series of lawsuits filed against the fast food company.The proposed class action suit, filed in a court in Michigan, alleges there is a systemic problem at McDonald’s and that the company’s anti-harassment procedures amount to “lip service”.It claims McDonald’s has “a toxic work culture from the very top” and cites the recent firing of Steve Easterbrook, the company’s chief executive, after he engaged in a relationship with a colleague.Mr Easterbrook has not been accused of harassment. His relationship with the colleague, while a violation of company policy, was consensual. He described the relationship as “a mistake”.Employees have filed more than 50 sexual harassment complaints in a range of jurisdictions against McDonald’s and its franchisees over a period of about three years, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Some have claimed the company has retaliated against them for making internal complaints, including having hours reduced or being forced out their jobs.In the latest complaint, Jenna Ries, a 32-year-old who worked in a franchised McDonald’s outlet in Michigan, alleges a superior frequently abused her verbally and physically. She claims the individual groped and assaulted her and made sexually-charged comments, and that the treatment left her physically sick.The suit, filed on behalf of Ms Ries by the ACLU, claims several other woman in the same outlet were also victims of similar treatment and that this was emblematic of a wider problem at the company. It seeks at least $100,000 in damages per person affected.The lawsuit maintains that the general manager at the Michigan store had told workers who complained about the harassment that they were “being dramatic” and that the harasser was “only joking”. It also says workers were not provided with information about how to report sexual harassment.In a statement the company said it was “demonstrating its continued commitment to this issue” by recently strengthening anti-harassment training.In McDonald’s policy against discrimination, harassment and retaliation, the company states it does not tolerate sexual harassment.Behaviour covered by the policy ranges from unwelcome flirtation and making comments about a person’s body to more serious physical misconduct. It also disallows any type of retaliation against those who make complaints.The company encourages workers to report concerns about possible violations and has a hotline for assistance. “All employees must treat each other with respect and take steps to ensure the work environment is free from harassment,” the policy says.
5;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-11-08T19:14:32Z;Office romance in the #MeToo era;There is more than puritanism to the sacking of the McDonald’s chief executive;"In May, the race for the Democratic presidential nomination took an unlikely detour through the McDonald’s drive-through.Candidates including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro adjusted their campaign schedules to join workers at McDonald’s protests across the country.The headline grievance was a complaint about low pay. But they were also protesting about another issue: claims of rampant sexual abuse of women in McDonald’s restaurants.These rallies may have presaged the downfall this week of the company’s chief executive and embroiled a corporation that likes to view itself as an exemplar of wholesome Midwestern values into an anguished public debate about how companies should manage workplace romances in the #MeToo era.Steve Easterbrook, a 52-year-old native of Watford in England is credited with helping McDonald’s navigate the demand for healthy eating and reviving profits growth since he became chief executive in 2015. Its shares have nearly doubled on his watch.Yet Mr Easterbrook was sacked on Sunday after the company revealed that he had been involved in a romantic relationship with an employee. Mr Easterbrook is divorced and McDonald’s has said the relationship was consensual. The company’s global head of human resources followed his boss out the door a day later.Mr Easterbrook was hardly the first McDonald’s employee to have found romance at the office.Founder Ray Kroc was at a convention in 1968 selling franchises for his fast-growing southern California burger chain when he encountered Joan Smith, then married to one of his franchisees. After a long and boozy night, the two would end up leaving their spouses and running off together — seemingly without ill-effect for McDonald’s drive toward global fast-food dominance.Times have changed. Today’s workers spend long hours in offices where, in many cases, the old hierarchies and standards that governed behaviour are fast melting away. After alternatively ignoring it or trying to stamp it out, many companies have come to accept that desire — like gossip and jealousy — is an inevitable feature of office life.The challenge, then, is to devise policies to police fraternisation so that relationships do not become an abuse of power. Even consenting office relationships can corrode an organisation by distracting employees and fuelling suspicions about how certain executives have advanced their careers.Consent itself can be ambiguous. “People in positions of power tend to be oblivious to the influence they wield over others because they are less likely to take the other party’s perspective,” says Vanessa Bohns, a social psychology professor at Cornell University.As companies attempt to draft new rules, they are doing so in the glare of lurid claims emerging about men such as film mogul Harvey Weinstein using their professional power to coerce women into sexual relationships.“There are a lot of businesses looking to see what their policy is — and if one exists,” one corporate adviser says of the panic that has followed Mr Easterbrook’s ousting.To Paul Bernard, a veteran New York human resources specialist, the old codes — if far from perfect — were at least understood. Nowadays, “the rules are much more nebulous,” Mr Bernard observes. In particular, he points to “a cognitive dissonance” between companies’ desire to create a permissive culture to appeal to young talent and their sudden fear of #MeToo litigation. “Boards are very wary,” he says.According to The Conference Board, five of the 12 S&P 500 chief executives who were fired last year were #MeToo-related. Indeed, days after Mr Easterbrook’s sacking, the board of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, revealed that it was investigating how executives handled sexual harassment complaints, with a particular focus on the company’s chief legal officer David Drummond.What struck some observers is that the facts about Mr Drummond’s relationships with co-workers — and those of other top Alphabet executives — were already well known. What appears to have changed is the Alphabet board’s awareness of the broader climate.“Boards are now asking themselves: Is this consistent with our culture? Is this how we want to be portrayed?” says Johnny C Taylor, president of the Society for Human Resource Management.Mr Taylor saw the complexity of the issue when he took an informal sample of opinion about McDonald’s at a conference this week. Older men tended to understand the company’s decision. What surprised him was that many of the younger female attendees believed the company had overreacted.“This newer generation is saying: If it’s not sexual harassment, if it’s not quid-pro-quo, they should be able to do what they want,” he concludes.Some 36 per cent of workers admitted to having engaged in a romance with a colleague, according to the CareerBuilder recruitment site. Some of them even worked out. The office, after all, is where Bill and Melinda Gates and Barack and Michelle Obama found love.Mr Easterbrook’s expulsion has certainly prompted bewilderment in Japan, where long working hours mean the office is by far the most common place to meet a romantic partner, and magazines publish rankings of which companies have the most internal marriages. As one ex-chief executive puts it: if office romance was banned, nobody in Japan would ever get married.In France and elsewhere in western Europe, executives and politicians are rarely bound by McDonald's-style rules on personal relationships, and any attempt to impose them would mark a revolutionary change in corporate policy and social attitudes.Yet there are reasons beyond American puritanism to explain why McDonald’s took a hard line with Mr Easterbrook. Few companies have found it harder to distinguish between consenting relationships and harassment.McDonald’s policy forbids employees from dating or having a sexual relationship with anyone with whom they have a direct or indirect reporting relationship. “It is not appropriate to show favouritism or make business decisions based on emotions or friendships rather than on the best interests of the company,” its policy states.For Mr Easterbrook, the chief executive, that pretty much ruled out the workplace as a dating pool. His failure to comply may have been more sensitive as the company has increasingly found itself in the crosshairs of activists, who are campaigning for higher wages — the Fight for $15 — and also against sexual harassment at McDonald’s.Workers at the chain have filed nearly 50 lawsuits and complaints with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces laws on workplace discrimination. They allege groping, lewd comments, and propositions for sex. In some cases those who reported sexual harassment say they were fired or suffered retaliation.A complaint from a 17-year-old high school student working for $11.75 an hour said that she was subject to unwanted advances from an older male co-worker at a McDonald’s in Cortland, New York, including cornering her in tight spaces and trying to kiss her. A manager told her: “If you’re freaking out so bad about it, stop talking about it so it won’t get worse.”“It’s a brutal reality across the fast food industry that at least one in four workers — especially women of colour working low-wage jobs — experience sexual harassment as a routine part of their job,” Sharyn Tejani, director of the TIME’S UP Legal Defense Fund, said in May. “Every day, workers are forced to choose between getting a pay cheque or speaking up about their abuse.” Members of Congress have written to McDonald’s to demand that the company do more to prevent sexual harassment.In August, the fast-food chain unveiled its response. It created a training programme aimed at all 850,000 employees — not just managers as an earlier one had done — that included videos and in-person discussions about unconscious bias, bullying, and harassment. An anonymous telephone line to report incidents was also established.There was a catch: The training would be required only at the roughly 5 per cent of McDonald’s restaurants owned by the corporation. It was left to franchise owners who operate the rest to decide whether to use the programme.Activists were not impressed. “This is a company where the franchisee agreement is so specific that they mandate that everyone use a specialised gun to put sauce on the Big Mac, so as to ensure that every single burger has the exact same amount of sauce,” says Linda Seabrook, a lawyer at Futures Without Violence, a non-profit group. “Isn’t keeping the people who work for you safe as important as the amount of sauce?”McDonald’s Corporation says it strives to operate “safe and respectful workplaces in communities throughout the US and around the world”.Dorothy Stingley, a leader of a US federation of franchisees who herself owns 16 outlets in Arizona, says the company is actively working to encourage franchisees to take the training.“It is true that it is easier for McDonald’s corporation to mandate that we all use a certain blue spatula and then send out people to count the spatulas,” says Ms Stingley, a 67 year-old who employs two of her children and two of her grandchildren. “But changing hearts and minds to really reform the culture is another ballgame. It’s much harder
to do.”Even the punishment meted out against Mr Easterbrook struck some experts as strangely lenient, since his $37m of stock options remain intact.“What does that say to people on the front lines of McDonald’s, which is a company known to have a real problem with sexual harassment?” says Paula Brantner, who heads PB Works Solutions, which advises on harassment and toxic workplace prevention.Ms Brantner warns that sweeping prohibitions on office relationships merely risk driving them underground, creating a climate of secrecy and suspicion. “Companies need to be thinking beyond: what are my legal risks in terms of liability?” she says.Mr Taylor agrees. Before a company establishes a policy, he says, it needs to first understand its culture and values. “The board has to sit down and say: what do we stand for?” he says. “There is no one-size-fits all.”In other words, it is not like a McDonald’s hamburger."
6;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-11-05T12:05:03Z;McDonald’s and the perils of wooing at work;In the aftermath of #MeToo, companies are tightening their policies on office romances;Love is in the air in the corner office these days, and that’s not a good thing.Over the weekend, Steve Easterbrook of McDonald’s became the fifth US chief executive to step down over a consensual relationship since June 2018 when Intel boss Brian Krzanich lost his job, according to data collected by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The cluster of departures is the first of its kind since the outplacement firm began keeping records.But companies have been struggling with office romances for more than a century. Early factories were deliberately segregated by sex to limit heterosexual relationships, writes historian Jane Humphries. Until the 1970s, many companies forced women to quit when they married. This had the dual purpose of limiting the possibilities for romance and making it clear that women would pay the price if Cupid struck.However, growing opportunities for women, anti-discrimination laws and longer working hours eventually began to translate into romance. The share of US couples who met as or through co-workers trebled between the 1940s and 1995 to 19 per cent, as more women entered and stayed in the workforce, the comprehensive How Couples Meet and Stay Together survey shows.That has created dilemmas for HR departments. Anita Hill’s 1991 allegations of harassment by then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, and a series of discrimination lawsuits, led most US groups to focus first on prohibiting unwanted attention. Some also began setting rules on dating — Boeing dumped its chief executive Harry Stonecipher over a consensual relationship in 2005. But many HR departments opted to ignore romances or let managers deal with them case by case.However, the 2017 #MeToo movement forced many companies to reconsider. The sexual allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein and CBS’s Les Moonves, among others, highlighted power imbalances in the workplace. The slew of allegations made it blatantly obvious that top executives had a completely different definition of “consensual” than the people they encountered.Surveys by Challenger in 2018 found that more than half of companies had reviewed or created sexual harassment and dating policies in light of #MeToo. Among companies with formal policies on consensual relationships, three-quarters now ban them between a manager and a direct report and one-quarter require any intra-company relationship to be reported.McDonald’s, which has been dogged by allegations that it fails to protect employees from harassment, has a policy that is very clear — and very strict. According to its 2018 employee code of conduct, relationships between “employees who have a direct or indirect reporting relationship to each other are prohibited”. The code also admonishes those who “plan to enter into a relationship [to] advise your human resources representative or director immediately”.The company did not say whether Mr Easterbrook reported his relationship. But McDonald’s’ top human resources executive David Fairhurst followed Mr Easterbrook out of the door on Monday.The five recent departures show that the tighter rules are starting to bite. “If the policy applies to all the employees, it has to apply to the CEO. Everyone has to buy in,” says Charles Elson, of the University of Delaware.There is a significant, short-term share price hit when companies reveal sexual misconduct, even if the relationship is consensual, says Amy Baker, a University of New Haven psychology professor studying the issue: “The market looks at this as a signal that the company is not being properly managed.”There is a bright spot for harassed HR teams. The US couples survey suggests that this issue might be starting to go away. The share of couples who met at or through work has dropped by a third since 1995 to 11 per cent in 2017. Nearly 40 per cent of couples now meet online.brooke.masters@ft.comFollow Brooke Masters with myFT and on Twitter
7;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-11-04T18:56:45Z;McDonald’s HR boss to leave along with chief;Second departure follows firing of Steve Easterbrook over relationship with employee;The head of human resources at McDonald’s became the second senior executive to leave the company on Monday, one day after the fast-food chain fired chief executive Steve Easterbrook over a relationship with an employee that breached company policies.The departure of David Fairhurst, who had been installed as chief people officer by Mr Easterbrook when he took the top job in 2015, was confirmed by a person familiar with the move. No reason for the departure was given and the company said it did not comment on personnel matters.McDonald’s announced the exit of Mr Easterbrook on Sunday, saying he had “violated company policy and demonstrated poor judgment involving a recent consensual relationship with an employee”.But the company said on Monday that it is treating the matter as a termination “without cause”, allowing Mr Easterbrook to receive severance benefits in return for him agreeing not to work for rivals such as Burger King and Starbucks for the next two years or disparage McDonald’s on Twitter or Facebook.The company has agreed to pay Mr Easterbrook six months’ salary and allow him to cash in most of the shares and options it had granted him.The exit package includes half his $1.34m base salary in six months, a prorated share of any incentive plan payment paid to executives this year, the right to exercise any options that were due to vest in the next three years and a share of the restricted stock units the board had granted him.For the next five years, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed on Monday, he may not write a book about the company or grant interviews about his time there without the agreement of McDonald’s general counsel.Mr Easterbrook’s total compensation added up to $15.9m last year, including $254,000 for his personal use of the corporate jet, for which he was required to reimburse the company.Chris Kempczinski, the former McDonald’s US president who was promoted to chief executive on Sunday, will earn an annual salary of $1.25m, up from $725,000 last year, with a target annual bonus of more than $2.1m. Both sums are slightly below the amounts Mr Easterbrook earned last year.McDonald’s market capitalisation had almost doubled under Mr Easterbrook, and news of his firing unnerved investors, knocking the $140bn company’s shares by close to 3 per cent in Monday morning trading.The news was “a clear short-term negative”, said John Glass, a Morgan Stanley analyst, although he noted that the company had thrived after abrupt management changes in the past, such as the resignation of Jack Greenberg as chief executive in 2002 and the death of his successor Jim Cantalupo 16 months later.Mr Kempczinski faces the challenge of reversing a long-term decline in traffic to McDonald’s US restaurants, while keeping pace with competitors in areas such as plant-based burgers and striking what Mr Easterbrook called the “delicate balance” between modernising the company’s menu and technology while not unsettling franchisees.Analysts broadly echoed the message from the company that there would be little change of strategy under Mr Kempczinski, a former Kraft executive who worked with Mr Easterbrook on the strategy under which it has franchised more of its US outlets and invested in home delivery, mobile ordering and dynamic digital display technology.Barclays analysts said that Mr Kempczinski had built “strong relationships” with US franchisees since joining the company in 2015 and pointed to his record of producing 11 straight quarters of progress in the 14,000-outlet domestic business, where the company makes 45 per cent of its profits. The 5 per cent increase in US same-store sales for the year to date is McDonald’s strongest performance over three quarters since 2011, they said.“We see the McDonald’s ­train continuing to chug along on the tracks laid out by [Mr Easterbrook],” added Jon Tower of Wells Fargo.
8;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-11-04T18:47:51Z;McDonald’s: CEO takeout;Steve Easterbrook’s abrupt departure is causing some heartburn among investors;The Big Mac is now served without the big cheese. McDonald’s has fired its chief executive Steve Easterbrook. A “consensual” relationship with an employee violated company policy, the fast-food chain said. The circumstances of his departure are unclear. The business has been struggling with unrelated allegations of sexual harassment. US companies often disapprove of workplace relationships that would raise no eyebrows in Europe. But Mr Easterbrook’s abrupt exit is causing some heartburn among investors. The 52-year-old Brit is widely credited with engineering a turnround at McDonald’s since taking over in March 2015. He revamped its menus, introduced all-day breakfast in the US and made a big push into online ordering and delivery. He invested heavily in cost-saving technology. Slick electronic kiosks now allow customers to order and customise their meals.Despite an upheaval in the fast-food industry, like-for-like sales at the burger chain rose for 17 straight quarters. Operating profit margins jumped from 29 per cent in 2014 to almost 41 per cent last year. Shareholders are lovin’ it. Their returns, with dividends, more than doubled during the period.McDonald’s has promoted US head Chris Kempczinski to the top job. America remains McDonald’s single biggest market and brought in more than a third of group revenue last year.Investors should look askance at the move. The US is where Mr Easterbrook has had problems recently. His ambitious plans have not always gone down well with the company’s franchisees. They run most of McDonald’s 14,000 US stores. Mandatory investments in digital kiosks and fees to third-party delivery companies have caused growing discontent.US sales growth has begun to slow in recent quarters. Rivals including Burger King and Dunkin’ Brands are introducing more breakfast items, lowering prices and offering plant-based alternatives in an attempt to lure diners. While the company’s shares more than doubled in value from March 2015 to peak at more than $220 this summer, the stock has since lost its sizzle, trailing far behind the S&P 500’s 23 per cent gain this year.A bet on McDonald’s is therefore a bet that Mr Kempczinski can continue to execute Mr Easterbrook’s strategy. He has to keep a lid on the franchisee rebellion while ensuring rivals do not outflank McDonald’s. The danger of appointing in haste is that investors will repent at leisure.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

11;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-11-03T21:33:03Z;McDonald’s sacks chief over relationship with employee;Fast-food company says Steve Easterbrook demonstrated ‘poor judgment’;McDonald’s has fired its chief executive Steve Easterbrook after he engaged in a relationship with a colleague, the company announced on Sunday.Mr Easterbrook, who was credited with doubling the company’s share price since becoming chief executive in March 2015, “violated company policy and demonstrated poor judgment involving a recent consensual relationship with an employee”, McDonald’s said.The fast-food company has appointed Chris Kempczinski to the role of chief executive and president. He was previously president of McDonald’s US business.Mr Easterbrook, who is British and divorced, wrote in an email to McDonald’s staff: “I engaged in a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which violated McDonald’s policy. This was a mistake. Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on. Beyond this, I hope you can respect my desire to maintain my privacy.”Mr Kempczinski joined McDonald's in 2015 to oversee global strategy, business development and innovation. He described Mr Easterbrook as “a patient and helpful mentor” in a memo to staff.Joe Erlinger, McDonald’s president of international operated markets, who joined the company in 2002, will become president of the US business.The company said it will release details of Mr Easterbrook’s severance package in a regulatory filing on Monday.The dismissal comes at a time of upheaval in the fast-food business, as shifting tastes and new competitors have added pressure to established groups.As consumers switched to healthier alternatives and sales fell across the industry, Mr Easterbrook embarked on growth initiatives across its 38,000 locations that span 100 countries. These included revitalising the menu, serving breakfast throughout the day and securing a food delivery partnership with UberEats.The moves were part of Mr Easterbrook’s plan to turn McDonald’s from a waning fast-food empire to a “modern, progressive burger company”, in his words.Under Mr Easterbrook’s tenure, the group also installed electronic screens in its restaurants allowing customers to order and customise their meals. In March, the company acquired artificial intelligence business Dynamic Yield for $300m to further expand restaurant goers’ ability to craft bespoke burgers.But last month it reported disappointing sales growth in the US as it faced growing competition from rivals including Burger King, KFC and Dunkin’ Brands, which have all been revamping their menus and offering plant-based alternatives.McDonald’s dismissal of Mr Easterbrook reflects a zero-tolerance policy to senior managers having relationships with subordinates, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.“This appears to be a strict rule, strictly enforced. It sends a signal to other companies that may have less strict rules or may have no rule at all,” Mr Tobias said.The wave of attention on workplace harassment in recent years has nudged companies and their boards to pay close attention to fraternisation policies, Mr Tobias said. “Companies are much more vigilant than they used to be and that’s a good thing.”
12;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-10-22T13:25:44Z;McDonald’s sales growth slows in the US;Shares slip as fast-food chain’s earnings and revenue miss expectations;Fast-food chain McDonald’s posted disappointing sales growth in the US and reported an earnings miss in the third quarter as it faces stiff competition from rivals.The Chicago-based company reported global comparable sales or sales in stores open at least 13 months of 5.9 per cent — its 17th consecutive quarter of growth — ahead of expectations.However, in the US, its largest market, sales grew 4.8 per cent, reflecting higher menu prices and national and local promotions. That missed analyst expectations for a 5.2 per cent increase, according to a Refinitiv survey and showed momentum had cooled from the previous quarter.Shares in the company fell more than 3 per cent to $203 in pre-market trade.McDonald’s has faced growing competition from rivals including Burger King, KFC and Dunkin’ Brands, which have all been revamping their menus and offering plant-based alternatives.McDonald’s last month joined its competitors KFC and Dunkin Brands in partnering with upstarts looking to challenge the meat industry and tap environmental and health conscious consumers turning to a ‘flexitarian’ diet. The chain is partnering with Beyond Meat to test a PLT — plant, lettuce and tomato — burger in Canada.Overall revenues climbed 1 per cent from a year ago to $5.4bn in the three months ended September, just shy of forecasts for $5.49bn.Under chief executive Steve Easterbrook, the burger chain has been remodelling its stores with new features such as digital ordering kiosks and changes to its menu and has also invested in delivery services in an effort to put the customer front and centre.“As we work to build an even better McDonald’s experience for customers by providing convenience on their terms, we continue to embrace the culture of innovation that helped launch our company over 60 years ago,” Mr Easterbrook said.McDonald’s net income fell to $1.61bn in the three months ended in September, down from $1.64bn in the year ago quarter. That translated to earnings of $2.11 a share, missing analysts’ expectations of $2.21 a share.
13;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-07-26T15:57:41Z;McDonald’s restaurant and menu refresh drives sales;Burger chain joins Starbucks and Coca-Cola in highlighting US consumer power;McDonald’s on Friday posted its biggest rise in comparable sales in two years, boosted by refurbished restaurants and refreshed menus.The second-quarter results are the latest in a series of positive signals that consumer companies are sending about the health of the US economy. The Chicago-based group, which operates 38,000 outlets globally, joins other big names in US food and drink that have also reported upbeat earnings reports in recent days. Both Starbucks and Coca-Cola lifted their outlook for annual revenues and profits.McDonald’s earnings came as US data also published on Friday highlighted how personal consumption is helping fuel domestic economic growth. Under Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, McDonald’s has been revamping its outlets with new features such as digital ordering kiosks and introducing new menu options such as all-day breakfasts.Consumers have also been attracted by special offers, notably its two-items-for-$5 “Mix and Match” deal. McDonald’s has also been rolling out home delivery and this month unveiled a partnership with DoorDash to deliver in Houston, Texas.McDonald’s was “putting our customers at the centre of all our efforts”, Mr Easterbrook said in a statement on Friday. He added it was the 16th consecutive quarter the company had generated positive comparable sales, a metric that counts restaurants open at least 13 months and strips out foreign exchange.Sales were powered by a 5.7 per cent comparable sales rise in McDonald’s all-important domestic market, where the company has faced intense competition for fast food.In the group’s “international operated” division — overseas markets in which McDonald’s both operates its own restaurants and has licensees — comparable sales rose 6.6 per cent, driven by the UK, France and Germany. The global like-for-like sales rise was stronger than the 4.95 per cent analysts had pencilled in, according to S&P Capital IQ data. Shares rose 1.7 per cent in New York on Friday morning.McDonald’s produced net income of $1.52bn in the quarter compared with $1.5bn last time, equivalent to diluted earnings per share of $1.97. Revenue of $5.34bn was 6.5 per cent higher from a year ago on a like-for-like basis.
14;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-05-08T18:33:34Z;McDonald’s in talks to settle long-running India dispute;Deal with Vikram Bakshi would end episode that stifled US group’s growth in country;McDonald’s is in talks to settle a dispute with its business partner in India, a move that would draw a line under a protracted episode that has stifled the fast-food chain’s growth in the world’s second most populous market.“They are discussing the details of the settlement,” said Sudipto Sarkar, a lawyer representing the US company. “McDonald’s will take over the company, that’s all that I know.”The US group’s bitter battle for control of its joint venture with New Delhi property tycoon Vikram Bakshi, which operates more than 150 outlets in northern and eastern India, stretches back to 2008 and has led it to bleed market share in the country.McDonald’s terminated its deal with Mr Bakshi in 2017, accusing Connaught Plaza Restaurants, the joint venture, of violating “essential obligations in the franchise agreement” — including defaulting on royalty payments.But Mr Bakshi contested McDonald’s claims, saying they were part of a pattern of aggressive action by McDonald’s to force him out, and he defied the US group by continuing to run the restaurants — but often without key menu items. The brand’s regional growth stagnated and it ceded market share to American fast-food competitors Burger King, Pizza Hut and Domino’s.Mr Sakar said the two parties’ legal representatives were expected to finalise a settlement on Monday at an appearance at the National Company Law Tribunal in New Delhi for “dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s”.Mr Sarkar said he did not know how much the settlement was worth. “I don’t think anyone actually does, except for the two parties,” he said.The partnership between McDonald’s and Mr Bakshi began in 1996, when the brand launched its first restaurant in India five years after New Delhi began opening up the economy to private companies and foreign investors.It quickly gained traction in the mostly vegetarian country where cows are revered after adapting its menu to the local palate. The McAloo Tikki burger — a spicy, deep-fried potato and peas patty on a bun — and the Chicken Maharaja Mac are staples on the menu, which features no beef.McDonald’s and Mr Bakshi’s bitter dispute began in 2008 when the US company tried to buy him out of their joint venture for less than he thought it was worth. The ensuing legal battle squandered McDonald’s early-mover advantage in India.Abneesh Roy, an analyst at Edelweiss Securities, said any settlement would be “really positive” for McDonald’s, which would now be able to manage the outlets on its own or with another local partner.McDonald’s has a separate and successful joint venture for its roughly 250 outlets in southern and western India. Hardcastle Restaurants, the partnership with Mumbai-based Westlife Development, is seen as a potential candidate to take on the brand’s northern and eastern restaurants.“My sense is that giving it to the existing franchisee in India makes a lot of sense, that company knows what to do,” said Mr Roy.McDonald’s did not respond to a request for comment. Mr Bakshi did not respond to a request for comment.
15;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-04-30T16:49:55Z;Donut sticks for breakfast help McDonald’s return to form ;Like-for-like sales in key US market up 4.5% in first quarter;Americans with a taste for donuts at breakfast time helped McDonald’s return to form in the US as the fast-food chain served up sweeter domestic sales in the face of a competitive market.McDonald’s business in the US has in recent quarters lagged behind the company’s other established markets including the UK. Price competition has been fierce and the chain has underperformed at breakfast, in particular.However, figures published on Tuesday showed McDonald’s domestic like-for-like sales rose 4.5 per cent in the first three months of 2019 — almost twice the rate of the previous quarter.Footfall in the US was still negative in the quarter, but promotions encouraged customers to spend more on each visit. They included Big Mac Bacons, a two-items-for-$5 deal, and limited-release Donut Sticks, marketed as an accompaniment for McCafe coffee at breakfast. Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, said stronger morning revenues in the US had been a “meaningful contributor” to the group-wide performance. “We're still in a market share fight overall” at breakfast, he said, “but certainly to get back to that growth trajectory is encouraging”.McDonald’s was also focused on speeding up service. “Customers are noticing,” Mr Easterbrook said.Kevin Ozan, chief financial officer, said sales were benefiting as McDonald’s undertook a modernisation plan. It has redecorated and installed features such as tablet computers for use free of charge at 8,000 US outlets so far, about 60 per cent of its domestic outlets.Disruption from construction projects had been hurting footfall, but “sales leaps from completed projects now exceed the downtime”, Mr Ozan said.Across the group, like-for-like sales were up 5.4 per cent, led by strong numbers from the UK and France. McDonald’s had made a good start to the year “despite some of the continuing macroeconomic uncertainties around the world”, Mr Easterbrook said.Revenues fell 4 per cent to $4.96bn and net income dipped 3 per cent to $1.33bn, weighed down by foreign exchange and as the company shifted more of its own outlets to franchise arrangements. The company also cautioned that higher labour and commodity costs were weighing on the bottom line. Diluted earnings per share of $1.72 were flat with the prior year, although they were up 5 per cent assuming currencies were constant.Shares in McDonald’s were up 0.8 per cent by midday in New York.
16;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-03-25T23:54:10Z;McDonald’s to buy AI company Dynamic Yield;Acquisition will help burger group customise its menu displays based on differing variables;McDonald’s is spending about $300m to buy an artificial intelligence company in the fast-food chain’s latest technology investment.In a rare move for the burger group, which has for years avoided acquisitions, McDonald’s announced a deal on Monday to buy Dynamic Yield, a machine learning specialist founded seven years ago.The technology will allow McDonald’s to customise its menu displays based on variables such as the weather and the time of day — McFlurry ice creams in the heat or Sausage McMuffins at breakfast, for instance — as well as previous customer choices.It will also assess restaurant footfall to suggest food that is faster to prepare when the kitchen is busy, or more elaborate items in quieter stretches.McDonald’s, which serves about 68m customers each day from almost 38,000 outlets, plans to roll out the technology at its drive-through locations in the US this year before expanding it overseas. The Chicago-based company also plans to introduce it inside restaurants and on mobile phones.Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, said: “This technology has the capability and the flexibility to work on all of our digital platforms.”Deal terms were not disclosed but people familiar with the matter said the consideration was about $300m.Dynamic Yield, based in Tel Aviv and New York, employs 200 people. Clients include furniture retail group Ikea, football club Tottenham Hotspur and online supermarket Ocado. Following the acquisition it will continue to be run as an standalone business by Liad Agmon, co-founder. “We’re thrilled to be joining an iconic global brand,” he said.While small in the context of McDonald’s, which has a market capitalisation of about $142bn, the purchase is its biggest in 20 years. It is also strategically significant as the company turns to big data to gain an edge over rivals in the highly competitive fast food business.Self-order kiosks, mobile order and payment, and delivery via UberEats are among the tech initiatives introduced by Mr Easterbrook, a Briton who took charge in 2015.The company has also been smartening up its outlets, rolling out new decor, kiosks, free-to-use tablets and phone chargers.McDonald’s said it would be Dyanmic Yield’s sole owner and would “continue to invest” in the business following the deal. It would continue to serve its other clients, which also include beauty chain group Sephora, retail company Urban Outfitters and betting and gambling group Ladbrokes.
17;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2019-01-30T13:44:25Z;McDonald’s chief warns on ‘consumer uncertainty’;Steve Easterbrook cites rising caution from the UK to China;The chief executive of McDonald’s says the world’s biggest hamburger chain is facing “significant challenges” as a result of rising financial uncertainty among consumers from the UK to China.Its shares had rallied more than 3 per cent on Wednesday after quarterly earnings that met Wall Street forecasts, but lost the gains after Steve Easterbrook put investors on notice of “headwinds” facing the group in the year ahead.“Consumer uncertainty is growing, from France to China to the UK and elsewhere across the globe in response to tightening economies and shifting political environments,” he said.Mr Easterbrook did not specify Brexit, although McDonald’s was among the corporate signatories to a letter this week to British members of parliament that warned of a jump in food prices if the UK left the EU without a deal.4.4%the rise in like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter of 2018The CEO said he remained optimistic about the prospects for McDonald’s, which has 37,000 locations globally, as executives were “aggressively transforming” the group.The fast-food chain is revamping its outlets — rolling out new decor, self-ordering kiosks and free-to-use tablets — and introducing new menu options such as all-day breakfasts. It also seeking to become more sustainable, for instance requiring beef producers to reduce use of antibiotics.Like-for-like sales rose 4.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, a 14th consecutive year-on-year increase. In overseas developed markets such as the UK, Germany and Australia the restaurant upgrade programme is more advanced and comparable sales rose 5.2 per cent at the division it calls “international lead markets”.Growth in the US was slower, however, at 2.3 per cent. The US business passed on higher costs to customers through higher prices — up 2 per cent in the fourth quarter — but footfall was “negative”, said Kevin Ozan, chief financial officer.McDonald’s has been under pressure from changing consumer tastes and competitive pricing from rivals.The company was “experiencing intense competitive pressures” in its domestic market, Mr Easterbrook added, and had recently discussed “key challenges” with its franchisees.Total revenues fell 3 per cent to $5.16bn due to the company’s continuing effort to shift its own restaurants to a franchise model.Tax cuts helped net income double from a year ago to $1.42bn, equivalent to $1.82 per diluted earnings per share.The chief executive added: “Some will succeed and others won’t. We intend to keep positioning McDonald’s on the winning side.”Shares in McDonald’s, which have almost doubled in the past five years, were flat by early afternoon in New York.
18;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2018-10-23T13:05:48Z;McDonald’s speeds restaurant upgrades as US sales lag;Fast-food chain says it will deploy total of $2.5bn in capex this year;McDonald’s is accelerating a plan to upgrade US restaurants after the fast food group’s performance in its domestic market lagged sales growth in other countries including the UK, Australia and France.The world’s largest hamburger chain said it was deploying $2.5bn in capital expenditure this year — almost two-thirds of it in the US, a market that executives described on Tuesday as “very competitive”.Shares in McDonald’s rallied 5.5 per cent by midday in New York, adding about $7bn to its market capitalisation, after international businesses helped the company deliver a forecast-beating 4.2 per cent rise in quarterly comparable sales. Sales in the US rose 2.4 per cent on the same basis.The company’s so-called guest count — the number of people visiting its outlets — increased in most international markets during the third quarter but declined in the US.McDonald’s, which has more than 37,000 restaurants, most of them franchised, has been under pressure from changing consumer tastes and competitive pricing from rivals.The Chicago-based group, which generates almost two-thirds of its revenues overseas, has been revamping its outlets globally, rolling out new decor, self-ordering kiosks, free-to-use tablets and phone chargers.Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, said he expected the “largest construction project in our history” to pay off as McDonald’s modernises more restaurants in its home market as well.The company expected to surpass its original target to upgrade about 4,000 sites in the US so far this year, Mr Easterbrook said, and was now on track to complete more than 12,000 by the end of next year.“We are seeing encouraging response from customers in restaurants where many of these improvements already completed,” he told Wall Street analysts. “This is in line with our experience in other McDonald’s markets such as Canada, the UK, and Italy that executed programmes several years ago that were similar to the one the US is undertaking now.”Kevin Ozan, chief financial officer, cautioned that the upgrades had resulted in “a little longer downtime than we expected. We’re focused on limiting that in order to minimise the impact on sales and guest counts.”Overall revenues in the third quarter declined 7 per cent from a year ago to $5.37bn as McDonald’s converts more of its own stores to franchises. Net income fell 13 per cent to $1.64bn.However, the company said operating income rose 2 per cent when stripping out a gain from a disposal the previous year as well as prior year restructuring and impairment charges.Mr Easterbrook added it was the 13th consecutive quarter the company had generated positive comparable sales, a metric that counts restaurants open at least 13 months and strips out foreign exchange.
19;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2018-10-10T04:15:25Z;Burger King looks to expand in sub-Saharan Africa;World’s No. 2 burger chain sees ‘huge opportunity’ in countries including Nigeria;Burger King is in talks to open restaurants in sub-Saharan African countries, including Nigeria, as the US fast-food group accelerates its international expansion to better compete with rival McDonald’s. Daniel Schwartz, chief executive of parent company Restaurant Brands International, told the Financial Times that the world’s second-biggest hamburger chain was “significantly under penetrated” in the continent, where it had a “huge opportunity”. Burger King is one of many global companies drawn to Africa’s demographics. The UN predicts that the world’s 10 fastest-growing cities between 2018 and 2035 will be in the continent. With a median age of 19, Africa’s population is expected to double to more than 2bn by 2050 and to double again by the end of the century. Burger King, majority owned by the Brazilian private equity group 3G via Toronto-based RBI, is adding about two or three restaurants per day globally. Openings are expected to come in at about 1,000 this year, up from little more than 600 in 2015.Most of new foreign stores will be in Asia and Europe. The hamburger chain has opened about 600 restaurants in Russia from a standing start eight years ago, and is on track to open its 1,000th outlet in China by the end of the year. Nigeria is an amazing opportunity, we think east Africa as wellHowever, the Whopper maker’s global footprint of fewer than 17,000 restaurants — nearly all of them franchised — is less than half of McDonald’s, which has more than 37,000 restaurants, of which more than 3,000 are operated by the company itself. Shares in RBI have underperformed McDonald’s by 9 per cent in the past four years, in part because of difficulties at the Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons, which it also owns. Intense competition in its home US market has added to the pressure. RBI’s $27bn market capitalisation is about a fifth of McDonald’s, according to Bloomberg data*. “We are so under penetrated around the world relative to our peers — and ourselves in the US,” said Mr Schwartz, 38. “We’re just scratching the surface.” José Cil, president of Burger King, said fast-food restaurants “aren’t really well penetrated yet” in sub-Saharan Africa. He added: “We think Nigeria is an amazing opportunity, we think east Africa as well.” Burger King has been moving into the region over the past 18 months, striking a deal with Servair to expand in markets including Kenya and Ivory Coast. Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, was “one of the places I try to go to as often as possible to meet investors and potential partners,” said Mr Cil, adding that Burger King had “a lot of work to do” in Nigeria “in terms of infrastructure and supply chain”.“We want to do it right — and we want to do it in a big way,” he said. “We want to scale quickly. So, we’re excited about the potential.”Burger King’s interest in expanding in Africa’s most populous nation comes as Nigeria’s economy is inching out of a recession brought on by the oil price crash. Unemployment has soared to more than 18 per cent. President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has come under fire recently for its treatment of South African telecoms company MTN, the country’s largest mobile operator with more than 50m subscribers, and among its biggest non-oil foreign investors.In August, the central bank accused MTN of illegally repatriating $8.1bn in dividends. A week later, the attorney-general’s office slapped the company with a bill for $2bn in back taxes. Executives in the commercial capital of Lagos have warned that the moves will spook foreign investors. In spite of the challenges of doing business in the west African country, Nigeria has moved up 24 positions on the World Bank’s ease of doing business index, from 169 in 2016 to 145 in 2017.* This article has been amended from the original to the update the RBI market capitalisation.A call to collaborate on Nigerian citizens’ health / From Christine Hancock, London, UK
20;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2018-09-19T10:28:24Z;EU rules McDonald’s Luxembourg tax arrangements not illegal;;Brussels has decided that arrangement between McDonald’s and Luxembourg, which allowed the fast food group to pay almost no tax on its European royalties in both the EU and US, did not break the bloc’s laws.Wednesday’s decision is the first formal investigation in EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s five-year crackdown on tax rulings where she concluded that an arrangement was not illegal under the EU’s state-aid rules.Ms Vestager said the in-depth investigation had found the reason for double non-taxation was “a mismatch between Luxembourg and US tax laws, and not a special treatment by Luxembourg.“Therefore, Luxembourg did not break EU state aid rules.”As there was no illegal state aid, the restaurant chain does not have to pay any additional tax in the EU.Ms Vestager said “Of course, the fact remains that McDonald’s did not pay any taxes on these profits — and this is not how it should be from a tax fairness point of view. That’s why I very much welcome that the Luxembourg government is taking legislative steps to address the issue that arose in this case and avoid such situations in the future.”The Luxembourg parliament is currently considering new tax laws that would “avoid similar cases of double-taxation in the future”, according to the commission.To date, the commission has launched nine formal investigations and taken seven decisions that have forced Luxembourg, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands to recover billions of euros in back taxes from the likes of Apple, Amazon, Engie, Fiat, Starbucks, and more than 35 companies benefiting from a Belgium tax scheme. Many countries and companies have appealed the decisions to the European court.
21;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2018-08-29T14:58:14Z;Plan to buy out Yum China sets up fast-food fight with McDonald’s;Chains vie to find formula for success in a country they entered only about 30 years ago;It would be China’s largest ever private equity deal. An investor group including Hillhouse Capital Management and KKR was hungry enough to bid almost $18bn for the Chinese operations of Yum Brands, the fast-food group that controls KFC and Pizza Hut.On Tuesday, Yum China, which was spun off from its American parent in 2016 and trades separately on the New York Stock Exchange, rejected the offer— only for its shares to rise.Investors expect a deal to happen. If they are right, it will fuel the fast-food fight between Yum China and its biggest local competitor: McDonald’s.The chains represent a study in the merits of global versus local, in every aspect of the business from management to menus. They are vying to find the formula for success across a country where neither existed until about 30 years ago.The Chinese golden arches have just celebrated their first anniversary under the majority ownership of local investment firm Citic Capital, Citic group and Carlyle. The three paid just over $2bn for their combined 80 per cent stake in the mainland and Hong Kong operations of McDonald’s.“When they first opened, being western mattered. Going there was about the experience,” said Jeff Walters, a Shanghai-based consultant with BCG. “They were seen as light and modern.”There are no purely Chinese equivalents on the scale that the two chains have built on the mainland. “Operationally, to achieve that scale and consistency is difficult,” Mr Walters added.The two rivals are still experimenting to get the mix of foreign and local right. Many customers, for example, come to McDonald’s for the three flavours of congee for breakfast, the meal when consumers are least likely to experiment. They also drink mango bubble tea after finishing their burgers.Indeed, in new restaurants in fourth and fifth-tier cities, customers sometimes try to use straws as chopsticks when consuming french fries, said Phyllis Cheung, chief executive of McDonald’s China.The Hillhouse-KKR group that wanted to join this game via Yum China has deep pockets. In recent months, the two each raised more than $9bn, the two largest dedicated Asia funds ever. China Investment Corp, the Chinese sovereign wealth fund, joined them as did Baring Private Equity.A unit of Alibaba and investment firm Primavera, which jointly hold $460m in a pre-existing stake in Yum China, are expected to roll their shares into any deal. A former chief executive of Yum China, Sam Su, is a mentor of the current Yum China chief executive, Joey Wat, and an adviser to Hillhouse.Tuesday’s rejection, however, shows they face an uphill battle. Among the challenges: some of the investors that the two approached said they believed that Yum China was so well run that there was not much upside left, and declined to join.Since Yum China was spun off from its global parent, it has already done much of the heavy lifting. KFC has expanded aggressively across the mainland and today has 6,000 stores. It has reduced costs at a time when it is difficult to raise prices. Moreover, the macroeconomic cycle is not the most propitious: in the first half of the year, consumer spending softened.Meanwhile, McDonald’s clearly lagged behind its rival when Citic and Carlyle bought in. McDonald’s US retained a 20 per cent minority stake in the Chinese and Hong Kong operation. In 2015, McDonald’s was caught up in one of China’s many food scandals— as was Yum a few years earlier — after it was found to be using contaminated chicken and beef. Moreover, its profit margins were under pressure.Today, sales are weak as consumers cut back. But McDonald’s is expanding and investing, underscoring the advantage of being owned locally and no longer having to fight for resources. After they took over, the investment firms kept top executives, 70 per cent of whom are women.This was not surprising, said Mr Walters, adding that women made two-thirds of the spending decisions in the country. Ms Cheung in China and her counterpart in Hong Kong, Randy Lai, have both spent almost their entire careers at McDonald’s — and celebrated their birthdays there while growing up.McDonald’s China and McDonald’s Hong Kong now have ambitious expansion plans to close the gap with Yum China, which has twice as many outlets in China. Executives are envisioning the restaurant of the future, which means everything from store design to using tablets to place orders, to making food healthier (by offering customers the choice between grilled or deep fried) and eliminating the use of plastic.McDonald’s China can also extract other benefits from Citic as it seeks to close in on Yum China. For example, because Citic’s property arm has relations with all the biggest developers, it can work with developers to lock up prime space for restaurants even while a big housing estate or shopping mall is still no more than a blueprint. In addition, Citic has always been close to Tencent and has used Tencent’s WeChat extensively to help compensate for the weakness of the McDonald’s app.Before the sale, the US parent did not have much time for China, which accounted for a mere 5 per cent of sales, in contrast to Yum, where the comparable figure was about 40 per cent, argued Yichen Zhang, head of Citic Capital. “We are more focused,” he said. “China is all we do.”
22;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2018-08-13T15:12:42Z;Ikea finally opens in India, minus the meatballs;The furniture retailer is tailoring its offerings to local tastes;In 1996, McDonald’s, the US hamburger chain, opened its first store in India, an event seemingly imbued with symbolic import. Five years earlier, the government had begun to relax its tight controls over the Indian market, from which large western brands had long been excluded.The opening of McDonald’s in New Delhi was a metaphor for a country opening to the outside world. In deference to the Hindu taboo on eating beef, McDonald’s replaced its core product — the hamburger — with alternatives like mutton patties and veggie burgers. Yet Indian consumers were expected to embrace a global brand they had been long denied. I attended that milestone launch, and the hours after I ate an inaugural veggie burger was one of the few times I’ve ever had food poisoning in India. As it turned out, India hasn’t treated McDonald’s too kindly either. The brand has struggled to appeal to Indian tastes. The company also ended up in a bitter legal battle with one of its erstwhile Indian partners, triggering the collapse of its north Indian business, and severe brand damage. I recalled McDonald’s misadventures last week as Ikea finally opened its long-awaited first store in India, in the southern city of Hyderabad, a dozen years after it first applied for permission to enter a market that still tantalises foreign companies with its promise. As Ikea executives and their 950-strong Indian team cheered and enthusiastic customers thronged the store, I wondered whether India would end up as a success story for the company founded in Sweden, or if it will be a cause of perpetual heartburn. Ikea has done one thing right. It refused to compromise on its determination to have 100 per cent ownership of its Indian retail business. In 2009, as the government dawdled on a promise to relax its curbs on foreign ownership in retail, Ikea abandoned plans to enter the market rather than be railroaded into a joint venture. It only re-applied to set up shop in India in late 2012, after the government agreed to permit full foreign ownership — and relaxed a requirement that foreign retailers source 30 per cent of what they sell in India from local small and medium-sized enterprises. Like McDonald’s, Ikea has also tweaked its offerings to appeal to local sensibilities. Instead of Swedish meatballs, diners at the new store’s 1,000-seat restaurant can partake of chicken or veggie balls, dal and rice, or biriyani. Textiles on sale have brighter colours and busier patterns than in Ikeas elsewhere. But the company’s core proposition — value-for-money furniture and home accessories — seems likely to resonate with cost-conscious Indian consumers. Around 1,000 items in the Hyderabad store are priced below Rs200 ($2.86) each, which Ikea hopes will mean something for everyone. Their cheapest item is a set of four, brightly-coloured reusable plastic spoons for just Rs15. And, for those intimidated by self-assembly of the famous flat-pack designs, Ikea in India has tied up with local carpenters and delivery services. Customers on the first day seemed pleased. “This is a game changer,” said Narendranath Reddy, a 62-year-old renovating his home. “We have been on the lookout for good quality furniture at reasonable prices, which is hard to come by.” Others spoke of how long they had waited for the store’s arrival. And, back in New Delhi, a friend of mine confessed she had once bought an entire girls’ bedroom set from Ikea overseas and lugged it back for her daughter.But, as companies like Cairn, Vodafone and others can attest, creating a successful business is still no guarantee of a happy ending for foreign companies in India, where unpredictable policy changes have caused major headaches. Ikea has an additional potential vulnerability in India: its heavy dependence on imported goods. In the last year, the government has reversed two decades of steady tariff-cutting and raised import duties on a wide range of items.Ikea and its Indian fans must hope the company’s promise to provide attractive, affordable home furnishings isn’t hit by rising tariff walls.amy.kazmin@ft.com
23;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;McDonald’s sales growth tops view on overseas boost;US same-store sales growth cooled;McDonald’s on Thursday said a key sales metric grew faster than expected in the second quarter as growth in its overseas markets moderated cooling US sales.The Illinois-based company said revenues fell 11.5 per cent to $5.35bn but topped estimates of $5.2bn, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.Global same-store sales, a gauge of sales in stores open at least 13 months, rose 4 per cent, ahead of analyst estimates of 3.6 per cent.In its international markets same-store sales grew 4.9 per cent driven by the UK and France and exceeding analyst estimates for 3.9 per cent growth. In the US, they climbed 2.6 per cent — driven by higher average checks for customers as a result of higher menu prices and product shifts — but were shy of expectations for a 2.96 per cent increase and marked a slowdown from the growth registered in the first quarter.McDonald’s has had to grapple with changing consumer preferences and competitive pricing from rivals. The company has been adding healthier items and gourmet burgers to its menu and introduced new dollar menu options in an effort to rev up traffic at its stores. It has also stepped up investments in technology to beef up digital ordering. Net income in the second quarter rose to $1.5bn or $1.90 a share in the three months ended in June, compared with $1.4bn or $1.70 a share in the year ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.99 a share topped expectations of $1.92. “We’re seeing good performance across our business as our customers tell us that they value and appreciate the moves we’re making to elevate the McDonald’s experience,” said McDonald’s chief executive Steve Easterbrook. “We’re pleased with the results of our international business and the progress we’re making in the US on executing on our velocity growth plan priorities.”The fast-food chain, which is in the midst of a years-long turnround, said last month it was planning more lay-offs as part of a plan to save $500m annually by the end of next year, without offering any details on the scale of the cutbacks. McDonald’s shares had declined more than 8 per cent year-to-date, as of Wednesday’s close and were down 0.4 per cent in pre-market trade on Thursday. 
24;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s shares wilt amid foodborne illness probe;;McDonald’s shares fell on Thursday evening after two states said they were investigating whether the fast-food chain’s salads were linked to dozens of cases of foodborne illness.The company’s shares dropped 1.33 per cent in after-hours trading to $157.00.The Illinois Department of Public Health said it had confirmed about 90 cases of cyclosporiasis — an intestinal illness caused by a microscopic parasite known as Cyclospora — across the state starting in mid-May. About a quarter of those cases involved individuals who said they had eaten a McDonald’s salad before falling ill, the state agency said.Public health officials in Iowa also said they were probing an uptick in Cyclospora infections, and had identified 15 people who ate McDonald’s salads before becoming sick.McDonald’s is co-operating with the investigation, according to both states.“Although a link has been made to salads sold in McDonald’s restaurants in some Illinois cases, public health officials continue to investigate other sources,” said Nirav Shah, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health.McDonald’s said in a statement:“McDonald’s has been in contact with public health authorities from Iowa and Illinois about an increase in Cyclospora infections in those states. Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to voluntarily stop selling salads at impacted restaurants until we can switch to another lettuce blend supplier. We are in the process of removing existing salad blend from identified restaurants and distribution centers — which includes approximately 3,000 of our US restaurants primarily located in the Midwest.McDonald’s is committed to the highest standards of food safety and quality control. We are closely monitoring this situation and co-operating with state and federal public health authorities as they further investigate.”The Cyclospora parasite is commonly found in developing countries, and it has been at the centre of several US outbreaks, particularly in summer months, Iowa officials said. Infections are most commonly linked to eating fresh produce and have been linked in the past to imported products including raspberries, basil, snow peas and lettuce.

The consolidation of the US workforce comes as McDonald's is looking to keep up momentum in its years-long turnround, at a time when fast food has increasingly been shunned.The company reported global same-store sales grew 5.5 per cent in the first quarter, as customers spent more on a revamped menu with ‘gourmet’ burgers and new dollar menu options. McDonald's this week moved to a new corporate office in downtown Chicago, where it neighbours with the likes of Google – a departure from the sprawling campus in suburban Illinois that had been headquarters for nearly 50 years.Chief executive Steve Easterbrook called the move ""symbolic of our journey to transform our brand"". Shares in McDonald’s are up 3.6 per cent at $168.16 on Thursday, cutting its losses for the year to 2.3 per cent."
26;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2018-04-30T17:07:41Z;McDonald’s sales rise on back of revamped menu;Shares in fast-food chain rise sharply after results beat analyst expectations;McDonald’s reported a better than expected increase in sales in the first three months of the year as customers spent more on a revamped menu at the world’s largest burger chain.The fast-food chain reported strong sales in the US as well as key markets overseas, such as Germany and in the UK. Global same-store sales grew 5.5 per cent, matching the same growth rate for the last quarter of 2017 and exceeding analyst consensus expectations of 3.8 per cent.In the US, McDonald’s biggest market, increases in menu prices and changes in the types of food ordered by consumers sent comparable sales rising 2.9 per cent. Royal Bank of Canada estimates that the US fast-food chain sector grew about 0.5 per cent in the same period.McDonald’s shares climbed 4.7 per cent to near $166 in New York trading on Monday.We continued to build upon the broad-based momentum of our business, marking 11 consecutive quarters of positive comparable salesSince taking the reins in 2015, chief executive Steve Easterbrook has worked to simplify McDonald’s menu offering and bolster the company’s image at a time when fast food has increasingly been shunned in favour of offerings perceived to be healthier and more natural.McDonald’s has vowed to source only cage-free eggs in the US by 2025, for example, while introducing more ‘gourmet’ burgers designed to compete with the growth of smaller, premium-positioned rivals.The chain has also introduced new $1 to $3 value options, which analysts said helped boost sales in the first quarter. McDonald’s has also invested in improving its store portfolio in the US.“We continued to build upon the broad-based momentum of our business, marking 11 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales and our fifth consecutive quarter of positive guest counts,” said Mr Easterbrook.Like-for-like sales rose in McDonald’s international markets. In its main established markets, including the UK and Germany, the figure was up 7.8 per cent, while this rose 4.7 per cent for its so-called “high growth” markets, led by strength in China and Italy that was offset by a weaker performance in South Korea.At $1.79, McDonald’s diluted earnings per share in the first quarter also exceeded market expectations of $1.67. Net income rose 13 per cent to $1.38bn from a year earlier.A refranchising programme sent overall revenues down 9 per cent year on year to $5.14bn, but that was still above the $5bn expected by Wall Street.

In its main established markets, including the UK and Germany, the figure was up 7.8 per cent, while it rose 4.7 per cent for its so-called “high growth” markets, led by strength in China and Italy that was offset by “challenges” in South Korea.Shares climbed 4.8 per cent in early New York trading. They had been up 13.1 per cent over the past year as of Friday’s close despite an 8 per cent 2018 drop.Overall revenues at the chain famous for its Big Mac burgers declined 9 per cent year on year to $5.14bn because of the impact of a refranchising programme, but that was still well above the $5bn that had been pencilled in by Wall Street. Excluding the impact of a weak dollar, which polished foreign sales, the figure would have been down 15 per cent.Net income ticked up to $1.38bn from $1.21bn in the same quarter in 2017.“We continued to build upon the broad-based momentum of our business, marking 11 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales and our fifth consecutive quarter of positive guest counts,” said Steve Easterbrook, chief executive.Since taking the reins in 2015 Mr Easterbrook has worked to simplify McDonald’s menu offering and bolster the company’s image at a time when fast food has increasingly been shunned in favour offerings perceived to be healthier and more natural. To that latter point, for instance, McDonald’s has vowed to souce only cage-free eggs in the US by 2025 at the latest.

29;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s shares shaken by reports of Hep A investigation;;McDonald’s shares took a few quarter-percentage point poundings in morning trade after local health officials in Kentucky said they are investigating a case of a food handler being infected with hepatitis A.The stock sank as much as 0.6 per cent, reversing a gain of as much as 1.3 per cent during morning trade, after the investigation was first reported. Shares recovered to be marginally lower at $163.29 around midday in New York.The Madison County Health Department said it was investigating the case of a worker at a McDonald’s restaurant in Berea who was infected with hepatitis A. The health department added McDonald’s had fully co-operated with the investigation, and that the risk to patrons who ate there was “very low”.Late last year, customers at two McDonald’s restaurants in Detroit were urged to seek medical attention because they may have consumed food or drink prepared by employees diagnosed with hepatitis A.So far this year, McDonald’s shares are down 5.1 per cent. Although the company enjoyed strong sales growth in the December quarter, thanks to its cheap and cheerful dollar menu, chief executive Steve Easterbrook warned in January a competitive marketplace meant “We don’t see any significant broader market growth this year.”Rival fast-food chain Chipotle has also struggled with food safety issues in recent years, after it was linked in 2015 to an outbreak of E.coli that affected more than 50 people in 14 states.McDonald’s said in an emailed statement it was “fully cooperating with local and state health officials to investigate this matter to ensure the health and safety of our employees and guests.”

""It's a market share fight,"" Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. ""We don't see any significant broader market growth this year, so we know we're in a market share fight and value is where the street fighting really hits.""The world’s biggest burger chain said that global comparable sales rose by 5.5 per cent in the three months to the end of December, eclipsing forecasts for a 4.9 per cent rise, and capping off a year of sales gains. After suffering a big drop in customer numbers earlier this decade — it took half a billion fewer customer orders in the US in 2016 than in 2013 — McDonald’s has looked to bring people back with lower prices and better restaurant designsThe company said comparable sales in the US, its largest market, rose 4.5 per cent in the quarter thanks to “value” beverages and a promotion offering two menu items, including the signature Big Mac, for $5. The strategy has paid off: McDonald’s grew customer traffic in the US in 2017, the first year it has not bled customers since 2012.Bill Fahy, analyst with Moody’s, said the results confirm that the company’s initiatives “are continuing to take hold and resonating well with consumers”. Discounting has become a central strategy across many consumer-facing industries, as the world’s biggest brand-name companies grapple with changing shopping tastes and sluggish sales. Competition between consumer goods companies has driven down the price of groceries, making it cheaper to eat at home and further pressuring the restaurant industry.McDonald’s this month unveiled a new “value menu” in the US, with items priced at $1, $2 and $3 — including cheeseburgers and four-piece chicken nuggets for $1. Rival Taco Bell also this month rolled out a menu offering more than 20 items for $1 each. McDonald’s reported net income in the fourth quarter of 87 cents a share, plunging from $1.44 a year ago, which the company attributed to a $700m cost associated with changes to US tax law. Stripping out the impact of the new tax law, McDonald’s says diluted earnings per share were $1.71, above Wall Street forecasts for $1.59. Revenues for the fourth quarter fell 11 per cent to $5.34bn, although this was still higher than the $5.23bn analysts were looking for. The anticipated drop reflects McDonald’s ongoing sales of company-owned restaurants to franchisees.Shares in McDonald’s, which have soared more than 40 per cent in the past year, were up about 0.2 per cent in morning trading."

In the US, McDonald’s biggest market, comparable sales jumped 4.5 per cent, just above forecasts of 4.3 per cent.However McDonald’s net income came in at $0.87 a share, plunging from $1.44 a year ago, which the company attributes to a $700m cost associated with the Republican tax reform plan. Stripping out the the impact of the Tax Act, McDonald’s says diluted earnings per share was $1.71. Analysts were looking for $1.59 a share.Shares were down 0.4 per cent in premarket trading.The results confirmed that the McDonald’s turnround story remained on track at the end of the year – the company has now grown global comparable sales between 4 and 7 per cent each quarter last year.Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, said: “2017 was a strong year for McDonald’s as customers responded to the many ways we are making their experience more convenient and enjoyable”.Shares in McDonald’s have soared more than 40 per cent in the past year, as the chain has been able to turn around sales by updating its menu with bespoke sandwiches and dollar drinks, and upgrading its restaurants to include self-serve kiosks and table service.McDonald’s earlier this month unveiled a new “value menu” in the US, with items priced at $1, $2 and $3, as part of the plan to lure customers back to its restaurants through low prices.Revenues for the fourth quarter fell 11 per cent to $5.34bn, although this was still higher than the $5.23bn analysts were looking for.

32;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
33;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2018-01-22T11:50:44Z;Consumer goods groups join war on plastic;Big names from Coke to Unilever address concerns as customers and governments urge action;"When Coca-Cola announced ambitious new targets for package recycling last week, the decision was not solely driven by concern for the environment. It raised the stakes in the latest battleground for consumers’ wallets.A pledge by the US beverage company, which uses 120bn bottles a year, to collect and recycle the equivalent of all its packaging by 2030 comes as a number of large consumer groups announce commitments to reduce packaging and make more of it recyclable.Makers of everything from crisps and drinks to shampoo and laundry detergent are responding to growing public alarm about pollution as a younger generation, deemed to be more environmentally aware, becomes the biggest spending group. In addition, documentaries by Sir David Attenborough, the British naturalist, and others, have alerted people to the level of plastic in our oceans and its destructive impact on wildlife. The war on plastic is now “part of a marketing plan” for consumer goods companies says Ali Dibadj, analyst with Bernstein. “Millennials in particular are a target of these companies. And millennials are broadly looking for opportunities to do good in the world, not just financially.”Climate change was the number one issue that voters aged 18-28 wanted politicians to prioritise, according to a poll from BrightBlue, a UK centre-right think-tank. In a YouGov poll, 59 per cent of Americans under 35 said they care about how their habits affect the environment, compared with 39 per cent of those age 55 and older.The trend stretches beyond recycling plastic. Brands that promote themselves as “natural” or “green”, such as Seventh Generation, a Vermont maker of plant-based cleaning products, have gained market share in recent years. Unilever last year bought Seventh Generation, a move the Anglo-Dutch group said would help it “meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose”. Erik Solheim, executive director of the UN’s environment agency, welcomes companies’ new-found enthusiasm for recycling as a “climb to the top rather than a dive to the bottom”.“Both business and government have been sleepwalking up to now,” he says. “Just a couple of years ago there was very little action on plastic and packaging. Now there’s been a sea change.”If one product is more sustainable than the other, they’ll choose it, but they don’t want to pay more for itMcDonald’s, which last week announced goals to make all of its packaging from renewable or recyclable sources by 2025, says packaging waste is the top environmental issue customers have asked the company to address. Just 10 per cent of McDonald’s restaurants offer recycling, which the world’s largest restaurant chain plans to raise to 100 per cent by 2025.Iceland, the UK grocer, citing the “scourge” of pollution, promised last week to eliminate plastic packaging from its own-brand products by the end of 2023. Evian, the water brand owned by Danone, pledged to make all of its bottles from recycled plastic by 2025. Companies are unveiling these strategies just as governments are stepping up their intervention. Theresa May, the UK prime minister, this month set a target of eliminating avoidable plastic waste by 2042, as part of a 25-year plan to improve the environment. The EU said last week it would ensure plastic packaging within the bloc would be recyclable by 2030.James Quincey, president and chief executive of Coca-Cola, which also aims to make all of its bottles with an average of 50 per cent recycled content by 2030, says the new targets will be an integral part of the company’s business model. He intends to use his trip to the World Economic Forum at Davos this week to encourage other businesses to make similar commitments. “Consumers around the world care about our planet and they want and expect companies to take action,” he says. Unilever, Mars, PepsiCo, Marks and Spencer and Procter & Gamble are among companies that have made similar commitments. Nestlé last year teamed up with rival Danone to help build a greener plastic bottle, made from waste such as sawdust or cardboard. Unilever, which has had a target since 2010 of doubling its sales while halving its environmental footprint, set a goal last year to make the plastic it uses recyclable or reusable by 2025.The maker of Sunsilk shampoo, Axe deodorant and Surf detergent, says 2bn people use a Unilever product every day. It buys 2m tonnes of packaging a year, but says it has managed to cut back, citing a “28 per cent fall in the amount of packaging waste per consumer since 2010”.P&G, whose brands include Tide detergent and Gillette razors, has set a goal of ensuring90 per cent of its packaging is recyclable by 2020, and says it is well on its way. One of the big challenges in converting the remaining 10 per cent is “flexible packaging”, such as the plastic film for paper towel rolls, or small sachets of individually packaged shampoo, says Steve Sikra, director for solid waste management at the US group. This is especially problematic in developing countries, where low-income consumers tend to buy individual sachets of shampoo or soap. To tackle this, P&G is offering discounts and coupons to encourage people to recycle, while also backing investments to build recycling facilities in countries where there are none. “If one product is more sustainable than the other, they’ll choose it, but they don’t want to pay more for it,” says Mr Sikra. “That puts the onus on companies.”John Sauven, of Greenpeace UK, says Coke should be more ambitious, citing Iceland’s 2023 deadline. Ben Jordan, head of environmental policy at Coke, justifies its target date by saying much of the collection “is not within our control”.“The most advanced collection systems typically bring in bottles at the 80 per cent collection rate,” says Mr Jordan. “But you’ve got a large part of the world with very little visible management structures at all.”Coke has not calculated how much investment will be required to meet its goals, but it has spent $2bn over eight years on its last major environmental campaign, water replenishment, according to Mr Jordan. The company made $40bn in annual sales and $6.5bn in profits in 2016. Research in 2015 by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charitable groupthat promotes environmentally-friendly business models and a so-called circular economy, found that 40 years after the introduction of the recycling symbol on packaging, only 14 per cent of such packaging was collected and only 2 per cent actually recycled. Rob Opsomer, the foundation’s head of systemic initiatives, says: “Not every company is saying what Coke is and not every company is going far enough, but we’ve seen a significant change from 18 months ago.“There will be greenwashing efforts but we see those big companies are truly changing the way they look at this issue.”A global army of scavengers gathering plastic waste will be key to Coca-Cola to meeting its target of collecting and recycling 100 per cent of its packaging by 2030, writes John Aglionby in Nairobi.Ben Jordan, head of environmental policy at Coke, says so-called informal systems will be one of the pillars of its strategy. The others are government-run and owned infrastructure and industry-owned infrastructure.“More recycling happens where you have a formal infrastructure, whether that’s government- or industry-run,” he says. “But if you look at an apples-to-apples comparison of the percentage of bottles and packaging coming back, [the different systems] are currently equal.“We aren’t going to be collecting those bottles physically in most markets. We’re going to be partnering.”Scavengers will also not be paid a premium to collect Coke bottles, Mr Jordan insists.“In many places there’s enough inherent value in the product for that to be the incentive,” he says. “People make their livelihoods by collecting the highest-value material from the garbage, including from New York City apartments.”He recognises, however, that consumers “need motivation” to recycle. Coke is therefore considering incentives such as scan-and-win programmes, in which consumers will be entered for prize draws when bottles are returned.John Sauven of Greenpeace UK believes Coke’s policy will motivate scavengers. “I don’t have a magic bullet solution but if something has value, and Coke bottles now do, it will be collected.”But Rob Opsomer at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation says a focus on scavengers is not the solution.“The most effective thing to do is for these major companies to positively engage with governments on recycling systems,” he says. “Is the most effective thing really for every company to do its own little thing?”In the longer term companies should “go beyond recycling”, says Mr Opsomer.“It’s absolutely critical we recycle the packaging; it’s more critical we reduce the packaging we’re putting into the market in the first place,” he says. “Can we get products to people without using all this single-use packaging?”"
34;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-11-16T05:02:08Z;McDonald’s flips fortunes with back-to-basics approach;;It is the “dead zone” lull between lunch and dinner, yet McDonald’s is bustling with customers tapping their orders on huge screens. The Chicago store is acting as a blueprint for an overhaul of the world’s biggest fast-food chain in its biggest market. A glass case displays freshly baked apple pies and croissants. Smiling employees, dressed all in black, carry trays of burgers and fries to minimalist tables. “It doesn’t even smell like a McDonald’s,” says a colleague.When asked why he is spending $1.1bn to remodel thousands of US restaurants to mimic this one, Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, is interrupted by a customer who asks for his Instagram handle. “You have IG, right?”, he shouts, waving his iPhone. He is an aspiring photographer looking for social media followers, and his question answers mine — this is the consumer the 62-year-old burger chain is chasing.Mr Easterbrook, a soft-spoken British accountant, has worked at the fast-food chain for more than two decades. He took over in 2015 charged with reviving its reputation and regaining some of the half a billion customer orders it had lost in the US since 2012 and made it his mission to reinvent McDonald’s as a “modern, progressive burger company”.It is a phrase he used with investors when he first took the top job a month after the company reported its first annual drop in same-store sales in the US in 12 years. At the time observers declared the company, which helped define American diets, had lost its identity. Mr Easterbrook repeated the words throughout subsequent earnings calls.“That was sort of their North Star,” says Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bernstein. A former employee is more blunt, describing it as a “cliché phrase” that could mean “anything and everything”.However vague the plan remains, it does appear to be working. It is a challenging time for the US restaurant business. The industry has seen “little to no” growth in visits to restaurants in the past two years, according to market researchers NPD Group, while trade publication QSR declared last year the worst for restaurants since the financial crisis, after sales dropped sharply in the second half of the year. Grocery price deflation has made a stronger case for cooking at home, and a glut of restaurants has given people more choice if they do decide to go out.But after four years of shrinking traffic, McDonald’s this summer lured people back through its doors, posting a rise in customer visits in the second and third quarters. Comparable sales rose between 4 and 7 per cent each quarter this year. Investors have lauded Mr Easterbrook’s progress: the company’s share price has soared 70 per cent to $168 since he took over. The makeover has already been rolled out in much of Europe, with about one-third of French and German restaurants having been remodelled.McDonald’s feeds nearly 70m people every day, making the tale of how it dug itself out of “staggering” customer losses a case study for the business of eating. McDonald’s executives insist the success is built on a return to low prices and convenience, rather than chasing the whims of diners. With $25bn in annual sales and one of the most recognisable brands, the odds were in its favour to stage a comeback. But the way in which McDonald’s achieved it came as a surprise even to its own bosses.Back in 2014 the prevailing wisdom was that McDonald’s was being dethroned by new rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, in a sector dubbed “fast casual”. These outlets emerged after the financial crisis with price points a few dollars higher than traditional fast food, but with a perception that the food might be healthier.Growth in global same-store sales for McDonald’s had been hovering around zero for the past few years, with demand sagging across the US, Asia and Europe, before plunging more than 3 per cent towards the end of 2014. This compelled Don Thompson, then chief executive, to promise “decisive action to fundamentally change” its business.He pledged to slash costs by $300m and open fewer stores, before being replaced by Mr Easterbrook four months later. Its market share of US fast food slipped from 17.4 per cent in 2012 to 15.4 per cent in 2016, according to Euromonitor.Last year Mr Easterbrook hired Lucy Brady, a longtime Boston Consulting Group executive, to investigate what was going wrong. She led a wide-ranging study to dissect where people were eating. Her results, which Mr Easterbrook describes as “frustrating, but actually reassuring”, showed that the majority of the missing McDonald’s customers were going to other burger chains, such as Wendy’s and Burger King rather than rival fast casual outlets.Customers didn’t stop wanting fast food, they just didn’t want McDonald’s fast food. Mr Easterbrook’s response was to adapt the “modern progressive” doctrine and adopt a less aspirational focus: “the day-to-day basics”. This has materialised in cutting prices for coffee and soda, serving breakfast all day, offering mobile ordering and delivery, and improving the quality, if not the nutritional value, of its food.“To Steve’s credit, he is not stubborn,” says Larry Light, McDonald’s former chief marketing officer. “Instead of trying to come up with new kale and bean salads, fix the familiar. Fast food is not in decline, and I think it will always be the number one way the world eats.”McDonald’s share of the US fast food market last year, down from 17.4% in 2012The market capitalisation of the fast-food chain. Its share price has risen 70% since 2015People eat at McDonald’s every day. The company has 37,000 restaurants worldwideTo walk through the McDonald’s campus is to go back in time. Four levels of faded brick balconies envelope a 1970s atrium, making it feel more like a bare bones public library than the headquarters of a $136bn burger company. The group is about to shift its offices to downtown Chicago, where its neighbours will include the likes of Google, after six decades sprawled across 150 wooded acres in suburban Illinois.Since first opening in 1955, McDonald’s has billed itself as a place to eat cheaply. It embedded fast food into American diets as the US industrial farm system developed to make $1 cheeseburgers feasible.McDonald’s executives, former employees and analysts all agree that pricing is one reason the company has bled customers.“McDonald’s lost the plot on value,” says Ms Senatore. “After the company stopped marketing its dollar value menu in 2013, they never came up with anything that was equally compelling.” The dollar menu accounted for about 14 per cent of total US sales at the time.After keeping a lid on prices for years, rising commodity costs and wages put pressure on the independent franchisees who operate most of its 37,000 worldwide restaurants. They began increasing prices, which “destroyed the overall value message”, says Richard Adams, former director of franchising for the western US, who has since sold his restaurants and now consults for other franchisees. “They couldn’t advertise the dollar menu [nationally] because franchisees had raised prices way above that.”Wendy’s and Burger King churned out deals such as four items for $4, helping each preserve a market share of about 11 per cent of the US fast food market, while growth in smaller chains such as Sonic Burger and Jack in the Box loosened McDonald’s grip on the market.Some question the wisdom of the company’s decision to begin customising its menu by region in 2004. Mr Light, who led the effort, says it was internally “controversial” for a company who had codified its menu down to how many pickles are placed on different burgers.By 2014, facing fast casual insurgents, McDonald’s took it one stage further, offering mixed and sometimes awkward messages about its menu. The company put clementines into Happy Meals and avocado on chicken sandwiches, while still trying to tap into burger nostalgia with adverts mocking the new lifestyle trends. “There will never be kale here,” declared a 2015 advert for the Big Mac.Under Mr Easterbrook’s watch, the company has taken a “barbell approach” to its menu, beefing up its offers on both the low and high end of prices. Discounts are a core part of the Easterbrook ethos, with McDonald’s churning out $1 and $2 offers for coffee and soda.In a nod to more health conscious consumers the chain has also promised to strip antibiotics from its chicken meat and corn syrup from bread buns, replaced butter with margarine and is working towards using fresh beef in its Quarter Pounders.But can the food be cheap and higher quality? “It’s about balance,” says Mr Easterbrook. “You can’t just go all in on the premium end, because then you disenfranchise more price-driven customers.” A new “value menu” will be unveiled next year, with price points of $1, $2 and $3.The premium offerings are not necessarily healthy. Its maple-bacon dijon sandwich with buttermilk crispy chicken contains 740 calories and 1,780mg of sodium, nearly 80 per cent of the recommended daily intakes. “American palates have become more sophisticated,” says Ms Senatore. “It’s not necessarily about lower calories, it’s about using whole foods, and McDonald’s is playing to that. But fundamentally the food is still pretty indulgent.”Mr Easterbrook spent much of his tenure in the UK defending the golden arches’ image, going so far as to request the Oxford English Dictionary change its definition of the phrase McJob from “an unstimulating, low-paid job”. The OED refused. But his tactics paid off, and he was credited with reviving British sales in 2006.For decades the company has taken flak for its implied role in the global obesity crisis. Governments are stepping up their healthy eating campaigns, which analysts warn could threaten McDonald’s recovery.They caution that the company is not out of the woods. “We may have seen the end of market share losses,” say analysts at RBC. “[But] in the past, headlines related to the obesity epidemic have resulted in negative publicity for McDonald’s.”Any new regulations, such as mandated calorie counts, could “negatively impact margins”, they added. Still, analysts who cover McDonald’s remain bullish: more than two-thirds rate it as a “strong buy” even after its stock has already soared by more than 40 per cent in the past year.The trend towards organic, customised products has jolted large consumer groups from PepsiCo to Procter & Gamble. While fielding online questions ranging from “do you even sell real food?” to “do you use pink slime in your burgers?”, McDonald’s now assures customers that it uses freshly cracked eggs in its Egg McMuffins and ground pork shoulder in its McRib sandwiches.“One of the most significant changes for all businesses since the financial crisis is consumers are more demanding and expect to know more about you,” Mr Easterbrook says. “They are more questioning of all authority . . . you are no longer in control of your message.”Bernstein’s Ms Senatore says it is “hard to argue that they haven’t improved the perception among at least some customers”.“Two years ago the question was whether [Mr Easterbrook] could bring what he did in the UK to the US, because it was such a bigger market,” she says. “It turned out that he could.”Ten years after the global financial crisis, America’s lopsided recovery can be seen in restaurants across the country. Unemployment has reached historic lows and wages are slowly rising, but consumers are still cautious with their money. The compound annual growth rate for the US restaurant industry was 6.4 per cent from 1970 to 2007, but that rate has slowed to about 4.3 per cent a year since the crisis.As the gap has widened between income groups, middle-of-the-pack restaurant chains such as Chili’s and Applebee’s are now struggling. With higher price points and largely outdated menus, analysts say these “casual dining” restaurants, where a customer can buy dinner at the mall for about $15, are more likely to have been the losers of the rise of Chipotle rather than McDonald’s.Meanwhile, “the price part of value remains the greater part of the overall restaurant selection decision, particularly with lower income consumers”, says Bill Fahy of Moody’s.This has supported fast-food sales, which have been resilient even as a cut-throat battle has broken out in the $800bn US restaurant industry. Executives say there are simply too many restaurants, and a lot of them are mediocre. There are now more than 600,000 places to eat and drink in the US, which has grown at nearly double the rate of the population, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.One of the biggest offenders in overbuilding has been the shiny new trend “fast casual”, as more and more companies have tried to replicate Chipotle’s success.However, it seems supply has outpaced demand, with the number of fast casual restaurants growing by 9 per cent last year, while sales in the segment slipped two per cent.
35;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-10-24T12:21:34Z;McDonald’s same-store sales growth tops estimates as turnaround continues;;McDonald’s global same-store sales climbed 6 per cent in the three months to the end of September, eclipsing analyst forecasts and reaffirming that the world’s largest burger chain’s turnround is on track.The organic sales figure exceeded consensus forecasts for a 4.7 per cent rise. Last quarter, the company reported global same-store sales jumped 6.6 per cent — its best rise in 5 years.Shares were down about 0.5 per cent in premarket trading. McDonald’s shares have grown more than a third this year as a comeback appears to be picking up.Total sales in the third quarter fell 10 per cent to $5.75bn, although this was in line with consensus forecasts, due to a refranchising effort in China that was expected to weigh on revenues in the quarter.Net income jumped to $1.88bn, or $2.32 a share, from $1.28bn or $1.50 a share a year ago. Analysts had predicted $1.77 a share. Net income was padded by the sale of about $850m of Mcdonald’s businesses in China and Hong Kong as the company shifts to a franchise model. Excluding that impact, diluted earnings were $1.76 a share.In the US comparable sales climbed 4.1 per cent. Analysts were looking for a 3.6 per cent rise.McDonald’s under the lead of Steve Easterbrook, has looked to adapt to shifting customer appetites, introducing healthier menu options and customised burgers. The company this summer also said it would overhaul its coffee offerings with espresso-based drinks, which was viewed as a move to lure millennials away from Starbucks.Mr Easterbrook on Tuesday said the results “demonstrate broad-based momentum throughout our business”.

But pursuing perfection is no longer a panacea. For one thing, it could actually drive you crazy.But millennials aren’t buying the idea of the perfect brand to begin with and will tune out any organisation that underestimates their intelligence. Today, perfection is passé and it’s your flaws that make you fascinating.Take YouTube sensation Jenna Marbles. She has built a one-woman, multimillion-dollar empire out of being imperfect. Jenna will talk openly about her “before” looks and the sheer effort it takes to get them to a socially acceptable “after” state. Her “How to Trick People into Thinking You’re Good Looking” video has had more than 66m views.Onison, aka YouTube’s Perfect Villain, uses a striking similar strategy. He voices his controversial views on anything from rape to depression and is best known for his inane “I’m A Banana” song, which is approaching 59m YouTube views and was “Video of the Week” on Comedy Central’s web-soup series Tosh.0.My research revealed the extraordinary influence these celebrities have on young audiences. And it’s this level of imperfection that audiences now expect from all brands.It’s not easy being imperfect. Despite what old-school rules would have us believe, we no longer need to know exactly what we want and our actions don’t have to align with our stated ideals. Why? Because leaders start engaging in the risky business of covering up their flaws under the guise of policies and procedures, and savvy audiences can sense these shady facades in a heartbeat.Remember the public fury United Airlines experienced when its chief executive, Oscar Munoz, issued his first statement after a passenger had been violently wrenched from his seat and removed from an aircraft, bloodying his face? United Airlines went from flying the “friendly skies”, according to its slogan, to the airline that put the “hospital in hospitality” on social media — a bitter pill to swallow but a necessary imperfection for the brand to embrace.It was only when Munoz stopped standing, as he put it, “emphatically” behind procedures and issued a second apology that audiences stopped boycotting the brand.Consumer goods giant Unilever, owns both Axe and Dove, two products with seemingly contradictory brands. The former uses sexualised advertising to suggest that women, generally portrayed as sex symbols, will forsake their bodies for body spray. Dove, on the other hand, makes feminist statements about beauty standards and encourages women to reject the idea of needing to be sex symbols in the first place.The contradiction is a powerful flaw, allowing for a more honest, open and authentic image. Unilever understands that a parent can both be moved by the message of Dove for her daughter and still want her teenage son to use Axe and get lucky with girls.Other brands have broken through by challenging these labels of “moral inconsistencies”. Cable channel BET broadcasts R&B videos showcasing gyrating women all week long, but come the sabbath it switches gears to gospel music.L’Oréal, even though it tested its cosmetics products on animals, once bought the Body Shop, which was firmly against the practice. Fast-food chain McDonald’s took a 33 per cent stake in “natural food” champion Pret A Manger.Flaws have never been a greater force for change and innovation. They make leaders challenge the status quo and help them tap into ideas outside their comfort zone. Today, there’s no shame in your imperfections. They help organisations differentiate themselves from the misguided perfection of competitors and make brands genuinely compelling and human.The pursuit of perfection is less about improving ourselves but more about making ourselves acceptable to others and conforming to norms of society.And what’s exciting or meaningful about that?‘The Kim Kardashian Principle: Why Shameless Sells (and How To Do It Right)’ by Jeetendr Sehdev (Piatkus, £13.99/St Martin’s Press, $26.99)@JeetendrSehdev
37;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-10-18T04:00:37Z;US fast-food chains chase growth in small-town China;McDonald’s and KFC push deep into backwater cities where the brands still have cachet;The Chinese county-seat of Zouping, with a population of 700,000, is a backwater by Chinese standards, its bustling high street almost bereft of overseas brands. But it is firmly on the radar of fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken.Two KFC outlets there are magnets for families dining out and young people planning romantic meetings. “It’s pricier than other restaurants, but it’s more special,” says Kong Jianzhi, 35, treating her four-year-old daughter to a chicken burger. KFC and McDonald’s outlets are opening at a rate of more than one a day in China, mostly in smaller towns such as Zouping, to revive growth in China’s fast food market, which generates annual sales of $125bn, according to Euromonitor.Both outlets began to see falling revenues from their China operations after 2012, caused by declining same-store sales as health-conscious consumers lost their taste for fast food.New restaurants will help Yum China, the New York-listed company that operates KFC in the country, increase its revenues by about $180m this year, roughly half of its projected revenue growth, according to Anson Chan, analyst at Daiwa Securities. Yum’s China sales had been flat or falling since 2013, and last year reported annual revenues of $6.7bn.“We operate in 1,100 cities in China, but there are about 900 we are researching. That just shows the potential,” says Joey Wat, Yum China’s chief operating officer and soon to be chief executive.Yum operates 5,300 KFC outlets in China, double that of McDonald’s, which will open 2,000 Chinese outlets in the next five years to roughly double its total.McDonald’s handed 80 per cent of its China franchise to Chinese state-owned investor Citic and private equity group Carlyle in August in what was seen by analysts as an effort to raise capital for expansion. It says that 45 per cent of its restaurants will be located in so-called lower-tier cities by 2020.The brands are looking to tap rising wages in these typically poorer cities. Average incomes rose 5.4 per cent in fourth-tier cities last year, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, significantly faster than the 4.6 per cent growth in the largest cities — although from a lower base.McKinsey defines China’s fourth-tier cities as centres with less than 2.6m people. Consumers in such cities visit western fast-food chains as often as their big-city peers and spend more money in them when they do, according to McKinsey. Analyst Daniel Zipser attributes the higher spending to the fact that trips are often for a “family occasion”. There are other benefits in smaller cities, he says, such as “substantially lower” costs for real estate and labour, meaning greater profitability. But there are pitfalls, too. “It’s easy to hire a person to oversee 100 stores in Shanghai, but not to cover 100 stores in different cities,” says Vincent Lui, analyst at the Boston Consulting Group. More restaurants in far-flung locations means more managers, and more cost, he adds. Maintaining food safety is key to both brands after the 2014 scandal which revealed that McDonald’s and Yum China restaurants had used expired meat. But longer supply chains with stretched oversight increases risks that such mistakes will be repeated, says Mr Lui. Meanwhile, domestic Chinese imitations have established a strong presence in smaller cities, pressuring prices. Dicos, a no-frills fried chicken chain that resembles KFC, has more than 2,000 outlets mostly in small cities. “There is tough competition. In some of these cities the price is decisive,” says Cheng Ke, a partner at Roland Berger, a consulting group. Yum China says its prices are lower in smaller cities.The long-term risk is that consumers in smaller cities might grow tired of fast food like their big-city peers. In the city of Zibo, neighbouring Zouping, local Chen Hao, 41, says: “I don’t think KFC is that healthy. I will only buy it if I’m in a rush.” In an attempt to lure consumers such as Mr Chen, McDonald’s and KFC are altering their offerings in larger cities. McDonald’s has renovated nearly all of its China outlets to give them a more fashionable feel and added coffee bars. It is also sponsoring running events to project a healthier image.With a menu of salads and paninis complemented by freshly squeezed fruit juice, coffee and craft beer, Yum China’s KPRO restaurant opened in the eastern city of Hangzhou last month has little in common with other KFC outlets except that fried chicken is available — without batter. Aimed at “tech-savvy” urban professionals, the restaurant made headlines for its use of facial-recognition payment designed by internet giant Alibaba. Manager Tony Tan says another element of KPRO’s appeal is that “fewer children are seen here than in KFC”.The upgrading efforts seem to be working for KFC which reported same-store revenue growth of 7 per cent in the three months to August 31, after four years in which sales declined or stagnated. “Compared to other local restaurants the environment and the service is better,” says Wang Jiqing, 19, as he sips a KFC latte in Zouping. “It’s a place to bring a date.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueqiao in Hangzhou
38;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-10-01T12:21:45Z;McDonald’s battles to regain control of brand in India;Restaurants still open 6 weeks after fast-food giant ended deal with franchise partner;McDonald's restaurants across north India are still open and selling their McAloo Tikki burgers six weeks after losing their contract to do so, as the global fast-food chain battles to regain control of its brand from its local business partner.In August, the fast-food group cancelled the franchise agreement for its 169 restaurants in north India following a nine-year conflict with New Delhi property tycoon Vikram Bakshi, its partner there since 1996. Yet six weeks later, the restaurants are still open and Mr Bakshi remains in charge, with McDonald’s now involved in several parallel lawsuits.McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in India in 1996 — its first outlet not to serve beef or pork — as part of a joint venture with Mr Bakshi called Connaught Plaza Restaurants. It now has more than 400 restaurants across India, serving dishes such as the Maharaja Mac, a chicken version of the Big Mac, and the McAloo Tikki burger, a spicy potato patty in a bun.400-plus McDonald’s restaurants across IndiaMcDonald’s has told its Indian suppliers that it has cancelled the franchise agreement, but most have continued to sell to Connaught Plaza, because their contracts are with the Indian joint venture rather than the US fast-food group. McDonald’s said the ending of its franchise agreements means Connaught Plaza “is no longer authorised to use the McDonald’s system and its associated intellectual property. We are now in the process of working to enforce our legal and contractual rights consequent on termination through the appropriate legal forums”.Connaught Plaza insists it has the legal right to serve branded food and drinks following a ruling from an Indian tribunal that McDonald’s should reinstate Mr Bakshi as chief executive and not “interfere with the smooth functioning” of the business.Madhurima Bakshi, a director of the company and Mr Bakshi’s wife, said: “This is way beyond smooth functioning, by cancelling the franchise McDonald’s is being very interfering.”The US group has just one other option, according to those close to the dispute: to physically remove its branding from Mr Bakshi’s stores. But one person who has advised McDonald’s said: “We would not want to be in the situation of physically going and stopping him.”For Mr Bakshi, the dispute is an example of a global behemoth bullying a local partner. But for people close to McDonald’s, it is a sign of the difficulties many international companies have when trying to do business in a country where contractual wrangles are common and legal processes tortuous.McDonald’s and Mr Bakshi first fell out in 2008, when the US company tried to buy him out of their joint venture for far less than he thought it was worth. The dispute rumbled on— in both the boardroom and the courts — before coming to a head in August when McDonald’s unilaterally cancelled its franchise agreement.Mrs Bakshi, who said she and her fellow directors were willing to sell their stake for a fair value, said: “If they tried to remove our signage, we would involve the police. There is a lot that can go wrong if you try and physically disturb a running business.”India is Asia’s third-biggest fast-food market, worth $18.9bn according to Euromonitor.

Analysts are predicting overall same-store sales growth of 4.5 per cent for the quarter ending this month, and 3.4 per cent for the US market, according to Factset data.Investors are also nervous about the impact that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma may have on the burger chain’s sales for the quarter, if numerous locations are forced to shutter for prolonged periods due to power outages or flooding.McDonald’s is coming off a strong quarter in which it reported its best showing for global comparable sales in five years, showing that it has kept pace with shifting consumer appetites, defying a broader slump in the casual restaurant sector.
40;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-09-10T19:33:40Z;Farewell to the McAloo Tikki burger?;Nostalgic diners eat up as McDonald’s north India franchise stores enter final days;McDonald’s franchise agreement in northern India formally ended last week, with clients coming to restaurants for their last chance to eat what was once an exciting novelty food for the country.“We don’t know what’s going on. We have to open the newspapers every morning to find out if we still have a job,” said one staff member. As many as 6,500 others across the region were in a similar position.The franchisee, Connaught Plaza Restaurants Limited, said that it continued to receive McDonald’s supplies, however, because its contract with the supplier did not involve McDonald’s headquarters.McDonald’s did not comment on this, but it said: “The notice of termination is the first step. The notice period ran out on September 5. We are now taking steps to enforce the termination.”Like many Indians, the first time Jagjot Singh ate a burger was at McDonald’s. In the 1990s, soon after the multinational chain opened its first restaurant in India, Mr Singh and his family used to go to the restaurant for exotic meals out, a change from the usual chapatti and vegetables they ate at home.Now, standing outside a bustling McDonald’s in central Delhi, Mr Singh is eating what might be his last McAloo Tikki burger, after the company cancelled its contract for the whole of north India.“My father used to come here, now I come here,” said Mr Singh. “We’ve been eating McDonald’s burgers for generations.”McDonald’s has been fighting its joint-venture partner CPRL for years . In 2008, the company tried to buy out its owner, property tycoon Vikram Bakshi, but he demanded 20 times the offered price of $5m. Following that, McDonald’s refused to support his re-election as managing director.Forty-three restaurants were closed in June after their licences lapsed. A month later a tribunal ruled that Mr Bakshi should be allowed to resume his position at the joint venture, but McDonald’s terminated the franchise agreements, citing missed royalty payments.Madhurima Bakshi, a director of CPRL and Mr Bakshi’s wife, accused McDonald’s of deciding to “terminate franchisee licenses in their desperation to annihilate the partner and destroy the business and company he created”.McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in India in 1996, five years after the government began to open the economy to private companies and foreign investors. Indians, hungry for a taste of western-style burgers and fries, queued around the block to get in.That first restaurant in New Delhi was also the first McDonald’s anywhere in the world not to serve beef or pork, offering instead versions of the kind of snacks sold for years by street vendors across the country. The McAloo Tikki burger is a spiced and deep-fried potato patty, covered in burger sauce and served in a regular McDonald’s bun.Market data from Euromonitor show that McDonald’s has been steadily losing market share in India to competitors such as Domino’s Pizza.A report last month by the market research firm Kantar IMRB, however, found that in the places where McDonald’s still has outlets, it dominates its rivals, with double the local market shares of both Domino’s and Burger King.Puneet Avasthi, who wrote the report, said the finding was a sign that McDonald’s could recover its position in India if it reached an agreement with Mr Bakshi or found another franchisee.
41;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-08-23T04:41:11Z;Panera spells out sugary drink details to customers;Sandwich chain uses cola cups listing teaspoons of sugar in move away from sodas;Panera is unveiling cups that list how many teaspoons of sugar have been added to drinks, as the sandwich company battles for the lunch money of more health-conscious American consumers.The new cups, which post sugar and calorie counts in large letters, reveal to customers that a 20oz serving of Pepsi, the cola Panera sells, has 17 teaspoons of sugar. This is more than double the sugar in Panera’s chocolate chip cookie, and also exceeds the daily limit of 12.5 teaspoons that the US government recommends.The move comes amid growing pressure from regulators and consumers for a reduction in sugar and salt, which are linked to obesity and diabetes.Panera has been a bright spot in an increasingly tough environment for eating out in the US. While traditional fast food stalwarts such as McDonald’s have grappled with a global shift in demand towards fresh food, Panera has benefited, with comparable sales growing between 4 and 5 per cent.This year JAB, the investment group backed by Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, bought Panera for $7.5bn, a marker of how investors value so-called “fast casual” restaurants. Panera’s move comes ahead of new government requirements for all packaged food and drinks to label added sugars, with a compliance date of 2018 recently pushed back. However, the sugar requirements did not apply to restaurants. “It’s up to companies to take the lead on transparency, not wait for legislation,” said Ron Shaich, Panera chief executive.It’s up to companies to take the lead on transparency, not wait for legislationAnother piece of Obamacare legislation requiring restaurant chains with at least 20 stores to post calorie counts on menus has also been delayed. Panera and some other restaurants already list nutrition information on food menus, but drinks increasingly have been a target in the battle against obesity. The company aims to shift more customers away from sodas, and the decision to post sugar in teaspoons instead of grams was deliberate, said Mr Shaich: “the only people who know what grams are are drug dealers”. Panera in March unveiled a new line of drinks with less or no sugar added, and says that since then 8 per cent of customers have opted for these drinks over soda.US soda sales have been falling for more than a decade as sweet drinks have come under fire from regulators and health officials for contributing to obesity. This week Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and other soft-drink makers agreed to limit the amount of sugar they use in beverages sold in Singapore. In the US, local governments in cities such as Seattle and Chicago have raised the idea of so-called soda taxes. Panera aims to roll out the cups across its 2,100 restaurants by next month. This year the Missouri-based company said it had stripped artificial ingredients from its food as part of a campaign to position itself as the healthier alternative to the likes of McDonald’s. McDonald’s has taken steps to stay relevant amid disruption by Panera and Chipotle. The world’s largest burger chain has removed artificial ingredients from chicken nuggets and said it would use fresh beef in quarter pounders. Shares in Panera have risen 46 per cent in the past year, while rival Chipotle’s stock has dropped 21 per cent.
42;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-08-22T18:04:29Z;McDonald’s serves notice on India joint venture;End to tie-up follows dispute with partner New Delhi property tycoon Vikram Bakshi;McDonald’s has terminated the franchise agreement underpinning its 169 restaurants in northern and eastern India, after nine years of conflict that have weighed on its efforts to expand in the country.When the US burger chain entered India in 1996, it launched two joint ventures, including one with New Delhi property tycoon Vikram Bakshi, which was responsible for McDonald’s outlets from Punjab to Kolkata.But McDonald’s has issued that joint venture, Connaught Plaza Restaurants, a notice of termination of agreement, giving it 15 days from August 21 to stop using McDonald’s branding and recipes.The US group said that its action against Connaught Plaza had been forced after it “violated certain essential obligations in the franchise agreements”, including defaulting on royalty payments. It also noted the lapsing of licences for 43 restaurants in New Delhi, which have been closed since June.Mr Bakshi said McDonald’s had known for years that royalties were going unpaid without raising any objection. He added that his company had been unable to pay them because of falling sales, as well as a demand by McDonald’s that Connaught Plaza repay its bank debts rather than rolling over loan facilities.He said that he had refused to sign the 43 licences because of concerns over the quality of food supplies, which are managed by a separate team in Mumbai which also services Hardcastle. “I would be very careful about eating at one of my own restaurants,” he said.Mr Bakshi said this amounted to a pattern of aggressive action by McDonald’s in an attempt to force him out, accusing the company of “oppression, oppression, oppression”. He has vowed to fight its latest action in the courts.McDonald’s said it would not comment on individual allegations from someone with whom it was engaged in a legal dispute.The end to the tie-up throws into doubt McDonald’s presence in northern and eastern India, although it said that it was seeking a new partner. Hardcastle Restaurants, a joint venture with Mumbai-based Westlife Development, controls 260 McDonald’s outlets in south and west India and is unaffected.The fast-food group’s drastic action against Connaught Plaza follows a lengthy dispute with Mr Bakshi, which had shown no signs of resolution.In 2008, McDonald’s had sought to buy out Mr Bakshi’s stake in the business, but he balked at its offer of $5m, demanding at least 20 times that sum.Five years later, McDonald’s tried to force the matter by exercising a buyout clause while refusing to support Mr Bakshi’s re-election as managing director. After an extended legal battle, the National Companies Law Tribunal ruled last month that he should be allowed to resume that role.Amid the power struggle, McDonald’s has failed to match rivals in a fast-food market that has grown to account for 16 per cent of the Rs3.1tn ($48bn) food-service sales in India, according to a report in 2016 by KPMG.Euromonitor estimated last year that McDonald’s had 7.6 per cent of that market, against 10.9 per cent for Domino’s Pizza, which is now market leader. McDonald’s does not break out sales figures for the country.Abneesh Roy, an analyst at Edelweiss Financial Services, said: “McDonald’s growth rate in India over the last three or four years has come down”, citing disappointing growth in urban incomes, as well as the rise of food delivery apps. The US group has had a happier experience with Hardcastle, its other joint venture with Westlife.Westlife, which runs restaurants in cities including Mumbai and Bangalore, made a net profit of Rs2.3m in the quarter to June, up from a loss of Rs21m a year before.Shares in the company jumped 6 per cent on Tuesday, suggesting that investors saw an opportunity for it to benefit from the breakdown of McDonald’s other key Indian relationship.“The issue with Connaught Plaza is just an issue with that one franchisee,” Mr Roy said.This article has been revised to reflect updated figures from Euromonitor about the market share of McDonald’s and Domino’s Pizza in India
43;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-08-15T13:31:51Z;McDonald’s links with Evergrande to push into China’s hinterland;Fast-food group strikes deal with developer for restaurant sites in smaller cities;McDonald’s has struck a deal to place restaurants in Evergrande’s residential complexes in China. The arrangement helps solve two problems for both parties: it will provide space for the fast food chain to expand, facilitating its goal to almost double its number of outlets in China within five years and, in particular, giving it access to the untapped markets of the country’s smaller cities.For Evergrande, China’s second-largest and most indebted developer, the arrangement is an opportunity to lease out storefront properties, of which it has excess supply, say analysts.“The presumption is they’re going to fill up some of the empty properties with McDonald’s,” said Nigel Stevenson, an analyst at Hong Kong’s GMT Research. Mr Stevenson’s firm said it had visited 40 Evergrande developments and found that much of the space that had been labelled as “investment properties” in the company’s accounts — and therefore valued higher than residences — was instead empty shops or unused parking lots.In 2016 Evergrande increased its land reserves by more than 40 per cent from the year before, with more than three-quarters of its land in or near third- or fourth-tier cities, according to last year’s annual report. The company’s empty lots are exactly the type of properties the new majority owners of McDonald’s Greater China operations — Citic and Carlyle — are looking for as they look to push into China’s hinterland as part of their strategy of competing better with Yum China, which owns the Pizza Hut and KFC brands in the country.By partnering with Evergrande, McDonald’s is betting that it can more efficiently access these untapped markets, serving a ready residential base by piggybacking on Evergrande’s property network.“To break the current bottleneck for growth, McDonald’s inevitably needs to partner up with a major property development player,” says Chen Ke, a Shanghai-based retail partner at Roland Berger. “Evergrande’s commercial property projects in a vast number of cities in China give exactly such direct access to key locations for setting up new outlets.” The upside is likely to be limited for Evergrande, whose land-buying and construction spree is threatened by declining property sales.In April, rating agency Fitch downgraded its outlook for the company from stable to negative, citing the developer’s low likelihood of reducing debt, almost 40 per cent of which is due this year. Evergrande’s net gearing ratio is hovering around 430 per cent, according to Raymond Cheng, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CIMB.“Evergrande’s commercial property has been under operating pressure for a while now, and the addition of McDonald’s as a partner will not solve their problem,” says Deng Haozhi, chief analyst at Guangzhou-based property developer Fineland Group. “Given the scale of [Evergrande’s] investment property assets, this will make no real dent to the existing backlog,” says Mr Stevenson. The announcement of the tie-up comes a week after McDonald’s announced it aimed to almost double the number of its stores in China, a move that the company’s leadership has explicitly stated is to keep up with Yum China.Twitter: @emilyzfeng
44;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-08-08T11:29:34Z;McDonald’s to double number of China restaurants;Citic and Carlyle aim to revive brand as they take ownership of mainland chain;McDonald’s has announced plans to double the number of its stores in China within five years as the company under new management aims to overtake rivals in the world’s fastest-growing consumer market.The company outlined its “Vision 2022” plan on Tuesday to increase Chinese stores from 2,500 to 4,500 within five years.The plan also illustrates a shift in McDonald’s focus away from big cities to penetrating China’s less-developed urban areas: 45 per cent of the new restaurants will be located in third or fourth-tier cities (smaller, typically poorer cities in China) while 75 per cent of them will provide take-out and delivery services. The expansion announcement comes just days after McDonald’s finalised a deal with Citic and Carlyle to sell a controlling interest in the fast-food company’s China and Hong Kong operations for 20 years. McDonald’s new owners are bankrolling a risky approach to revive declining global sales and revamp the company’s perception as a cheap alternative to rival fast-food brands. “[McDonald’s] sold to Citic really out of a position of weakness. You don’t sell your entire China operation in the fastest consumer growing market because you’re doing well,” says Shaun Rein, the managing director for Shanghai market consultancy CMR China. “In order for Citic and Carlyle to make money, they need to grow McDonald’s faster.” The company with the instantly recognisable golden arches logo has seen its revenues plateau in China, where competitive local brands and mobile delivery apps have siphoned consumers away from restaurants. After expanding quickly in Asia, McDonald’s growth hit a wall in 2013, with revenue in high-growth markets (including Asia Pacific) declining 1.9 per cent. Globally, revenues have continued to slide year on year, from a high of $28.1bn in 2013 to $24.6bn in 2016. As a result, the company has adopted a global “asset light” model in recent years by focusing on selling franchise operations, instead of opening its own restaurants. It will transform 4,000 restaurants into franchise operations by the end of 2018 with the long-term goal of eventually having 95 per cent of its restaurants operate as franchises. Meanwhile, McDonald’s has struggled to catch up to rival fast food brands such as KFC or Pizza Hut in China, which are both managed by Yum China, the China spin-off of Yum Brands of the US. Despite years of operating in China, McDonald’s still lags behind Yum China in both market share and number of stores.Meanwhile, Yum China sold a $460m stake to a Chinese private equity firm and Alibaba before listing on the New York Stock Exchange last year. At the time, the company said the sale could fund a tripling of their China stores to 20,000. McDonald’s revenues and market image are still recovering from a tumble in 2014, when a Chinese supplier was found to be supplying rotting meat to both KFC and McDonald’s China stores. As a result, McDonald’s has sought to cultivate a perception of cleanliness and safety in China. In July, the corporation was quick to reassure Chinese consumers after pictures of mouldy ice cream servers in a US franchise surfaced online. However, the company’s ambitious growth plans may encounter similar challenges under its new owners.“I’m not convinced Citic and Carlyle know how to run a fast food business,” says Mr Rein. “You run into issues of quality control and standardisation if you double in size in such a short time.”Twitter: @emilyzfeng
45;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-08-01T17:20:56Z;Big backers beef up Impossible Foods’ plant-based burgers;Bill Gates among investors in funding round for mass production of beef substitute;Investors including Bill Gates, Li Ka-shing and a Facebook founder are backing a new fundraising round by Impossible Foods, a Silicon Valley company that is developing plant-based alternatives to meat, starting with juicy burgers that look like beef.Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek is leading Impossible’s new $75m round, alongside existing investors Mr Gates, Mr Li’s Horizons Ventures and Khosla Ventures. Open Philanthropy Project, a fund led by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna, is also joining the round.Impossible was founded in 2011 by former Stanford University biochemistry professor Pat Brown, who wanted to find a way to improve health and reduce the environmental impact of meat without having to change people’s carnivorous cravings.Mr Brown, Impossible’s chief executive, sees soy leghemoglobin, or “heme”, as a vital ingredient to making its plant-based burgers taste like ordinary meat. It is produced using genetically modified yeast and fermentation, creating something the company claims is “identical” to what humans have eaten in meat for thousands of years.The company was recently granted a patent for its use of heme in its meat substitutes and plans to submit studies showing it is safe to eat to the US Food and Drug Administration later this month.The new funds, which take Impossible’s total financing to date to more than $250m, will help the Redwood City-based company to accelerate its expansion, as it prepares to open its first large-scale production facility in nearby Oakland.A year after its heme burgers were first served at New York restaurant Momufuku, Impossible is now sold in nearly 50 restaurants. The Oakland facility, which opens in the coming weeks, will help it move from selling a few thousand burgers a month to millions, according to chief operating and financial officer David Lee.“It dramatically changes the unit economics and the reach of the brand,” Mr Lee said in an interview. “By the end of this calendar year, for every burger we produce we will be generating gross profit dollars that can fund continuing expansion.”Crucially for chefs preparing meals, the Oakland facility will produce ready-made patties, rather than loose, mince-like material that takes longer for restaurant kitchens to turn into a burger they can serve.Asked at a launch event at the Gotts mini-chain of Bay Area burger restaurants whether Impossible could one day be served in high-street chains such as McDonald’s, Mr Brown replied: “Anyone who is a large-scale vendor of meat products, burgers or whatever, we would ultimately want to be their supplier . . . Our intention is to make products that compete in the market for current consumers of animal products anywhere those products are sold.”Impossible is one of several companies trying to replace traditional animal products in food, including Beyond Meat and Memphis Meats. Hampton Creek, known for its Just Mayo mayonnaise alternative, recently said it plans to develop a meat-free burger too.Eventually, once its burgers are being produced and distributed at scale, Impossible hopes to use a similar process to launch meat-free alternatives to other proteins, from cheese to fish and sausages. “We have a whole suite of things we know how to make,” Mr Brown said. “When we have resources to start producing them, we will do that.”
46;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;The man who introduced kale to McDonald’s;Steve Easterbrook is revamping the fast-food chain, and shareholders are lovin’ it;"Shortly after being promoted to the top job at the world’s largest restaurant chain in 2015, Steve Easterbrook introduced himself to investors with a 23-minute video.Speaking in monotone and staring straight into the camera — unkind viewers noted that he “barely blinked” — the new McDonald’s chief executive’s web presentation was heavy on corporate platitudes about “nimble decision-making”, “unlocking growth” and “value propositions”. McDonald’s stock fell about 1 per cent that day.Shareholders wondered whether a soft-spoken British accountant was the right person to reinvent the quintessential American burger company after a long period when meat scandals, protests and a seismic shift in consumer tastes had hit its sales. Two years after that underwhelming debut, the 49-year-old former Watford Grammar schoolboy has clearly won over investors: McDonald’s shares have risen more than 60 per cent on his watch. The company this week reported its best set of global sales numbers in five years.Mr Easterbrook earned his stripes in Europe, where he was credited with turning round McDonald’s UK business through the 2000s. Now the board and investors are betting he can work similar magic in resuscitating the reputation of the entire company, which commands $25bn in sales across 100 countries.“He was the back-up quarterback who was ready to play in the Super Bowl,” says Trip Miller, managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners, a 13-year McDonald’s shareholder. When Mr Easterbrook entered McDonald’s headquarters in Illinois in 2015, the company faced an identity crisis. Consumers were opting for healthier alternatives to its Big Macs and fries, and McDonald’s had reported its first annual drop in same-store sales in a dozen years. Observers say what sets Mr Easterbrook apart is his open mind and willingness to engage. While previous leaders have dug their heels in, the father of three instead aims to transform a company known for greasy food into a “modern progressive burger company”. He was the back-up quarterback who was ready to play in the Super BowlMr Easterbrook quickly moved to mend McDonald’s image, particularly with millennials who seek food they perceive as healthier. Just months before he became chief executive, McDonald’s was mocking the trend in a TV advertisement for the Big Mac, declaring “there will never be kale” — but shortly after he took over, McDonald’s unveiled breakfast bowls with kale in California.The company has since begun using chickens mostly without antibiotics and fresh beef instead of frozen patties in its Quarter Pounders and experimenting with home delivery through Uber. Mr Easterbrook, who has said he eats a McDonald’s meal every day, also embraces the new communications landscape. He is active on Twitter, where posts about Watford Football Club are intermixed with motivational quotes and photos of McDonald’s store workers. “He’s a humble guy and a realist,” says Mr Miller. “He isn’t just in his ivory tower; he’s very hands on.”Mr Easterbrook studied natural sciences at Durham University, where he played cricket in a team captained by Nasser Hussain, who went on to lead England. After graduating he worked as an accountant at PwC before joining the McDonald’s finance department in 1993. Aside from two years when he left to work for PizzaExpress and the Japanese restaurant chain Wagamama, he has spent the rest of his career at McDonald’s. The executive’s competitive streak from playing cricket has carried into his strategy in recasting McDonald’s well-known — and frequently disparaged — brand name. When he took over the UK business in 2006, McDonald’s was beset by accusations it exploited low-wage workers in “McJobs”. Mr Easterbrook hit back, going so far as to request the Oxford English Dictionary alter its definition of the phrase McJob from “an unstimulating, low-paid job”. And just a month into his tenure as head of McDonald’s UK, he appeared on BBC’s Newsnight to debate with Eric Schlosser, author of the anti-fast food bestseller Fast Food Nation, where he argued: “Everyone likes a burger now and then, and that’s absolutely fine.”"
47;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-07-25T15:05:46Z;McDonald’s serves up best sales rise in 5 years;Menu overhaul and discounts bring more Americans back into restaurants;McDonald’s has reported its best showing for global comparable sales in five years, reassuring investors that the world's biggest burger chain can keep pace with shifting appetites.The company known for Big Macs and supersized fries said it drew more Americans into its restaurants in the three months to the end of June, the first time in years, as it looks to adapt to healthier consumer tastes and compete with new rivals in the fast casual food industry.Global like-for-like sales, a key metric, rose 6.6 per cent in the three months to the end of June, beating Wall Street estimates for a 3.7 per cent gain. The results help validate a two-year campaign by chief executive Steve Easterbrook to lure people back to the golden arches, after losing 500m restaurant visits in the US since 2012. “We’re building a better McDonald’s and more customers are noticing,” Mr Easterbrook said on Tuesday.McDonald’s has defied a gloomy outlook for the US casual restaurant sector, with shares up 25 per cent this year, boosted by the better sales performance. Shares were up 4.4 per cent to $158.44 in morning trading on Tuesday. The 77-year-old company has looked to overhaul its menu under the guidance of Mr Easterbrook, who took over as chief in 2015 and faced sagging sales. The 49-year-old British executive has aimed to win customers back through upmarket burgers, digital ordering and aggressive price promotions, such as $1 soft drinks and $2 coffee. Shares in McDonald’s have climbed 60 per cent since Mr Easterbrook took over in March 2015, from his previous role as head of UK and Europe. Same-store sales in the US, where McDonald’s derives a third of sales, rose 3.9 per cent in the quarter, surpassing forecasts for a 3.2 per cent lift.The company says the US growth reflected the success of cheaper drinks and its introduction of upscale sandwiches made with what it describes as artisanal bread, to compete with an upscale and expanding Shake Shack.Net income rose 36 per cent to $1.70 a share, on sales of $6.05bn. This exceeded analyst forecasts for earnings of $1.62 a share on sales of $5.96bn. “The consumer is finally coming first for McDonald’s” as the company undergoes a “multi-faceted brand turnround”, said David Palmer of RBC. McDonald’s in March said it would start using fresh beef instead of frozen patties in its Quarter Pounders across the US by next year, a significant shift for one of its biggest-selling products as the company looks to meet customer demand for fresh products.The US restaurant business is undergoing seismic change as Americans seek out healthier food. At the same time, the price of groceries in the US has fallen for 18 straight months, the longest stretch since the 1950s, making eating at home cheaper and adding pressure to the likes of McDonald’s.An explosion of entrants in the fast casual food chain business, such as Chipotle and Five Guys, and rising labour costs have also squeezed the business.“A lot of people had really not given McDonald’s a chance in the last 5 years,” says Trip Miller, a partner at Gullane Capital Partners and a McDonald’s shareholder for 13 years. “This is a business that had been in turnround mode [under Mr Easterbrook] and we are starting to see some of these positive results now.”

50;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-06-23T04:01:33Z;LuxLeaks: Luxembourg’s response to an international tax scandal;Damaging attacks on sweetheart deals have forced policy changes;Jean-Claude Juncker was a man under pressure when he appeared before the European Parliament’s tax investigation committee in September 2015.The European Commission president and former Luxembourg prime minister was under tremendous scrutiny due to the LuxLeaks scandal, which centred on revelations that hundreds of multinational companies with offices in the grand duchy had constructed complex strategies to reduce their tax bills to near zero.Having fended off calls to resign when the scandal erupted in 2014, the veteran politician sought during the parliament hearing to deflect the blame from Luxembourg’s politicians, including himself. Instead, he emphasised the independence of the country’s tax authorities from political interference and the international nature of the problem.In the packed committee room, Mr Juncker told MEPs that when people talk about LuxLeaks “really what they are talking about is a kind of common practice in many member states”, adding: “In fact, that is why I’d rather say EULeaks than LuxLeaks.”Nearly three years on from the LuxLeaks revelations, scrutiny from the public and politicians of corporate tax deals remains intense. The response from Luxembourg and the EU has had a profound impact on the decisions companies make when deciding where to base international operations.The LuxLeaks scandal broke in November 2014 when the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published thousands of pages of documents, many of them leaked by Antoine Deltour, a whistleblower and former employee of PwC.The documents revealed details about how more than 300 companies with operations in Luxembourg had cut their tax bills by moving profits around different parts of the corporate group and playing national tax systems off against one another.The companies had worked with big accounting firms and secured rulings from the Luxembourg tax agency that such arrangements did not flout national laws. Those involved included household names such as Ikea, Pepsi and Fiat.One tactic revealed in the scandal was companies arranging loans between different subsidiaries within the same group at high interest rates. The result was that profitmaking businesses in high tax countries had to pay back loans to entities in lower-tax countries, effectively transferring profits from where they would have been taxed most.Multinationals also routed investments through “brass-plate” companies in Luxembourg, which had very little presence in the country other than a registered legal address. This was done to take advantage of the grand duchy’s favourable treaties with other countries, allowing the companies to avoid certain taxes in other jurisdictions they had invested in.The scandal brought public attention to these practices, known as “base erosion” and “profit shifting”, and put pressure on politicians to tackle them.Mr Deltour says the problem with the practices is not so much legal as moral. “The big issue is not whether or not Luxembourg respected EU law,” he says. “The main issue is that the European single market allows member states to compete with their tax systems. In the end if you still allow that then it leads to a race to the bottom.” Within Luxembourg, he adds, “no one really took responsibility for this, for the scandal and for all the practices.”Mr Deltour along with Raphael Halet, another former PwC employee, and Edouard Perrin, a French journalist, were prosecuted for their roles in exposing documents.Mr Deltour received a six-month suspended sentence and a €1,500 fine on appeal in March, while Mr Halet was fined €1,000 and Mr Perrin was acquitted.Since the LuxLeak scandal broke, Luxembourg’s politicians and senior financial services figures have argued that the problems exposed were down to international rather than national failings. They say the government has worked with other countries to improve information-sharing among national tax authorities and fix the divergences between tax codes that made it possible for companies to hide their profits from tax collectors.Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg’s finance minister, says he aims to create an international “level playing field”. “We need more transparency, and everyone has to play along,” he says. “Now the European Union is doing that and we are expecting others to follow.”The grand duchy has insisted that, in the years when multinationals were making their tax deals, Luxembourg was not doing anything different from other EU countries. Its says its tax agency was simply providing clarifications to companies, on request, as to whether their arrangements were legal or not. The granting of these “tax rulings” is standard procedure in many countries.But this explanation has been challenged in Brussels, where MEPs held their investigation into the scandal in 2015. The European Commission has picked through tax rulings in Luxembourg and elsewhere over concerns that companies enjoyed special treatment not available to competitors.The affair has had wider implications. McDonald’s, the US fast-food chain, responded to the increased scrutiny of its affairs after LuxLeaks by announcing last year that it would move its non-US tax base out of the country. LuxLeaks has also reignited concerns about the country’s tax affairs that its current government, elected in 2013, had been working to dispel.The LuxLeaks revelations emerged as the country was trying to move on from a different, and long running, dispute with its European partners about tax — one focused on banking secrecy.For years, Luxembourg, Austria and Belgium had opted out of EU arrangements that meant national tax authorities shared data about the bank accounts Europeans set up in other EU countries. The intention of these arrangements was to make sure that people did not hide money abroad to avoid tax.In exchange for being allowed to maintain their banking secrecy, the three countries had to levy a so-called “withholding tax” on foreign savings.Banking secrecy had been one of the cornerstones of Luxembourg’s rapid development as a financial centre, which began in the 1960s when the grand duchy set about transforming an economy previously reliant on steel.Luxembourg had argued that if it shared information it would hand the advantage to non-EU financial centres in Europe such as Liechtenstein and Switzerland. By the time current prime minister Xavier Bettel’s government took office in December 2013, the position had become untenable.The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis had galvanised international work to combat tax evasion. The nadir for Luxembourg came in November 2013 when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development branded the country as non-compliant with international standards on tax transparency, and placed it on a blacklist of non-co-operative jurisdictions.The country then set about reforming its tax laws, effectively bringing an end to banking secrecy. The strategy was endorsed by the OECD, which took the country off its blacklist in October 2015.“When we took the decision in 2014 that we had to embrace transparency, we had no guarantee that our financial centre would not only survive but eventually do better,” Mr Gramegna says. “It wasn’t easy. Quite a few players at the financial centre of Luxembourg were telling us that we shouldn’t do it.”He adds: “Because it was done at a time when the international environment was evolving, it had less impact on our financial centre than many had anticipated.”LuxLeaks posed an entirely different, and reputationally more dangerous, problem, especially because of the role of Luxembourg’s tax authorities in signing off their rulings.“In the first days of LuxLeaks it was presented in such a way that . . . rulings in Luxembourg were responsible for all the [tax] problems in the world,” Mr Gramegna says. “We managed to explain that it was a combination of factors that were at work, that rulings exist in 26 countries out of 28 in the EU, and that it is the combination of rulings of different countries — together with international tax conventions between countries — that could lead to companies paying very little or no taxes.”Luxembourger politicians, including Mr Juncker, have insisted the country operates a strict division of responsibilities where politicians are never involved in granting tax rulings. That task falls to the Luxembourg tax agency known as Sociétés 6 which the government says is fully independent. But this has not prevented the country coming under intense international pressure.Michael Theurer, a German MEP and co-author of the European Parliament’s reports into LuxLeaks, says that, while the scandal revealed an international problem, Luxembourg is a special case given the volume of tax rulings produced by Sociétés 6.“We [had] big doubts whether the economic substance underlying these rulings was checked in a diligent manner,” he says. “We couldn’t prove a lack of diligence, but there was significant evidence if we looked at the cases and if we looked at the time they spent on checking each ruling.”While the schemes helped reduce tax bills, they also led to companies carrying out business in Luxembourg and so bolstered the grand duchy’s finances, Mr Theurer says.“We could see that for Luxembourg the result was net positive because the tax amount was increasing,” he adds. “Although the companies overall gained an advantage, Luxembourg was also increasing its tax take.”Luxembourg also faced European Commission probes. Brussels ruled in October 2015 that a tax ruling given by Luxembourg to a subsidiary of carmaker Fiat in 2012 was a sweetheart deal that “unduly reduced the company’s tax burden by a total of between €20m and €30m”.The Commission said Luxembourg had been too flexible in accepting the tax plans the Fiat subsidiary put on the table, allowing the company to use “an extremely complex and artificial methodology to calculate Fiat Finance and Trade’s taxable profits, which cannot be justified by economic reality”.Since then, Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, has opened in-depth probes into Luxembourg tax rulings given to GDF Suez — the French utility company now known as Engie— and McDonald’s. The cases are based on concerns that the companies could have been given an unfair edge over competitors.In McDonald’s case, Brussels says it is assessing whether the Luxembourg tax agency “selectively derogated” from the country’s tax law and from the terms of a tax treaty with the US, which handed the fast-food group an unfair advantage.Luxembourg is not the only country Brussels has probed since the scandal began. Ms Vestager has challenged tax rulings handed down in the Netherlands and Ireland, and has ruled against an “excess profits” scheme in Belgium that she said unfairly benefited multinationals.We should leave this monolithic economy based on the finance industry. It’s a golden cageLuxembourg officials, politicians and finance professionals insist that the scandal and its aftershocks are not deterring businesses from setting up in the grand duchy. They argue that McDonald’s decision to relocate should be seen in the light of the steps taken by the OECD and EU to close the loopholes that companies exploited.The new restrictions are forcing companies to reorganise their international operations — something they argue could lead to arrivals in Luxembourg as well as departures.Mr Gramegna says that the scandal was “an important event, but it’s been digested”. In his meeting with companies, he says, “everybody talks to me about Brexit not about LuxLeaks”.Luxembourg reformed its tax laws in December, ushering in penalties for fraud and making “aggravated tax evasion” a criminal offence. The country has also reviewed the way its tax agency works.But for David Wagner, an MP from Luxembourg’s opposition Left party, whatever the specific consequences of LuxLeaks on policy and legislation, repeated tax scandals are leading to a growing realisation that the country should diversify its economy.“We should leave this monolithic economy based on the finance industry,” he says. “It’s a golden cage.”

Past deals have typically generated $100m over each four-year Olympic cycle.Last week, the IOC announced that it had “mutually agreed” to end its decades-long sponsorship deal with McDonald’s, the fast food giant. That contract was due to run until 2020, but was abandoned early on financial terms that were not disclosed.McDonald’s became the latest US brand to abandon its Olympic sponsorship in the past two years, following Budweiser, Citi, Hilton and AT&T.Securing Intel as a sponsor helps the IOC with two of its priorities: completing deals in the US, its largest and most lucrative broadcast market; and securing partnerships with technology companies that can help the organisation shift its operations into the digital era.In January, it announced that Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba would sponsor the next six Olympics, in a deal expected to deliver at least $600m for the IOC’s coffers.The Intel deal comes at a time the IOC is struggling to convince cities to take on the multibillion-dollar costs of staging the event. Last week, the body moved towards awarding the 2024 and 2028 summer Olympics to Paris and Los Angeles in an unprecedented double vote.The French capital and the US city are the remaining bidders for the 2024 games, after Budapest, Hamburg, Boston and Rome pulled out citing cost concerns.Sponsorship and broadcasting revenues are split with the host cities, helping to soften the financial cost of holding the games.

54;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-04-25T19:19:34Z;McDonald’s hits all-time high on strong Q1 results;Nasdaq Composite pushes beyond 6,000 for the first time;Shares in McDonald’s, the world’s biggest burger chain, reached an all-time high on Tuesday after it delivered first-quarter results that beat market expectations and assuaged concerns that recent growth momentum could be fading.The stock was one of the day’s top gainers, climbing 5.6 per cent to $141.70.Aggressive price promotions such as $1 soft drinks and $2 McCafes powered a 4 per cent rise in global like-for-like sales at the company during the first three months of the year, trouncing Wall Street estimates for a 1.1 per cent rise.In the US, the company’s biggest market, McDonald’s also surprised on the upside with a 1.7 per cent gain in same-store sales, compared with expectations for a 0.8 per cent drop.The outperformance contrasts with the wider gloom in the US restaurant industry, where many have struggled to adapt to changing consumer tastes and tough competition.Since taking over as chief executive in 2015, Steve Easterbrook has moved to reverse the chain’s sales decline by revamping its menu and driving traffic with the introduction of the all-day breakfast, which has given consumers a cheaper option for lunch and dinner.“There’s a sense of urgency across the business as we take actions to retain existing customers, regain lapsed customers and convert casual customers to committed customers,” said Mr Easterbrook.Tuesday’s results suggest that recovery at McDonald’s remains on track. Revenue for the quarter came in at $5.68bn, exceeding analysts’ estimates for $5.53bn. Net income rose 8 per cent to $1.21bn, or $1.47 a share, also ahead of expectations of $1.33 a share.The stock has gained more than 16 per cent since the start of the year and is up more than 42 per cent since Mr Easterbrook became CEO.PulteGroup shareholders proved harder to please, however. The US homebuilder posted a solid 14 per cent jump in first-quarter revenue as relatively low interest rates and the steady recovery in the US economy continued to fuel demand for new homes.But the sales growth fell short of the market’s very high expectations, prompting shares to drop as much as 7.2 per cent — the most in 18 months — before they recovered slightly to trade 3.8 per cent lower at $22.20.Revenue for the three months to end of March came in at $1.62bn, up from the $1.43bn recorded in the year-before period on a combination of higher closings and price increase. However, the revenue figure was lower than $1.76bn the market was expecting.Net income was up nearly 10 per cent at $91m, or 28 cents a diluted share, during the quarter — below the 29 cents a share analysts had predicted.Investor optimism over first-quarter earnings, along with the possibility of tax reform, helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 1.1 per cent to 20,996.12. The S&P 500 was 0.6 per cent higher at 2,388.61, while the Nasdaq Composite crossed the 6,000 mark for the first time after climbing 0.7 per cent to 6,025.49.
55;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-03-30T18:15:36Z;McDonald’s to use fresh beef in top-selling Quarter Pounders;Fast-food group ditches frozen patties as part of effort to win back customers;McDonald’s will start using fresh beef patties instead of frozen ones in its Quarter Pounders across the US by the middle of next year, marking a change to one of its biggest-selling products at a time when it is trying to lure back customers.The world’s largest fast food company has been testing out the popularity of fresh patties in Texas and Oklahoma in more than 300 stores, and said on Thursday that a “majority” of stores would be using them by mid-2018. McDonald’s said it does not anticipate a “significant impact” on the price of the burger, adding that any increases would be made at the discretion of each franchisee. It declined to say what proportion of total burger sales were Quarter Pounders.While it is a significant shift for McDonald’s given its size, it is not a first for a fast-food chain. Smaller rivals such as Wendy’s use fresh meat in burgers, as do some of the younger start-up fast casual chains.“This has been driven by consumer demand,” said RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar. “Look across the rest of the industry, consumers are genuinely more concerned about where their food is coming from, exacerbated by the Chipotle food safety scare. There has been increasing demand for natural and fresh products and that’s been driving industry sales.”Under the leadership of Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s has been undertaking a sweeping revitalisation after losing 500m restaurant visits in the US since 2012. It is trying to recover that business by improving its menu and digital ordering, as well as entering the delivery business.McDonald’s buys about 2 per cent of beef produced globally every year, making it one of the world’s biggest purchasers. Although the shift to fresh from frozen is limited to Quarter Pounders in the US, Mr Hottovy said it could potentially be used in other burgers as well.He said there would be costs associated with using fresh patties on the distribution side, which was likely to be borne by both McDonald’s and its suppliers.John Nalivka, president of Sterling Marketing, a meat consultancy, said the change could be marginally bullish for US beef demand. Currently a portion of US ground beef arrives frozen from overseas sources such as Australia.With the US cattle herd expanding again, “this is the right time” to move towards fresh patties because domestic supply will be plentiful, Mr Nalivka said. US beef production is forecast to rise 4 per cent this year to 26.3bn lb, while imports are likely to fall 9 per cent to 2.7bn lb, the US Department of Agriculture estimates.
56;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-03-28T19:37:08Z;Chipotle removes last preservatives from ingredient list;;Chipotle has banished preservatives from its tortillas as the US burrito chain that is in the midst of a rebound from a food-safety scare looks to bolster its appeal among ingredient-conscious diners.The Denver-based chain said it is now the only national restaurant brand with no added colours, flavours or preservatives in any of its ingredients, heightening the claims of its already popular ad campaign that emphasises quality ingredients.The Mexican-food inspired chain has been recovering from a 2015 food-safety debacle that sparked a deep decline in sales and sent its shares tumbling from all-time highs.The roll out of better ingredients through its “food with integrity” mission should enhance the appeal of Chipotle’s brand over time, according to analysts at Baird Equity Research. “Using such products results in better-tasting food and leverages a concept that is highly popular with consumers,” wrote David Tarantino, a senior research analyst.To drive sales in 2017 and beyond, Mr Tarantino said marketing and menu innovations would play a key role, especially in the group’s aim to win back customers.Chipotle disclosed a 4.8 per cent fall in same-store sales in the fourth quarter, representing a recovery from the 21.9 per cent drop in the previous three-month period. The group said in February that it expects the key sales metric to increase in the “high-single digits” this year.Shares in Chipotle, which are down 9.9 per cent over the past 12 months, gained 3.1 per cent on Tuesday to $427.74. They peaked at $758.61 in August 2015.
57;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Earlier, the chain said Twitter had notified it that its account had been “compromised”. McDonald’s quickly deleted the tweet and “secured” the account.Mike Huckabee, a former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, tweeted, “If somebody @McDonaldsCorp tweeted hateful remark re:@POTUS and not fired & apology given, then hope stock goes down as badly as the burgers.Shares in McDonald’s were slightly higher at $128.37 on Thursday afternoon in New York.The hack comes at a sensitive time for companies in the US. As political views have polarised, consumers have expressed their opinions through their wallets, avoiding brands that they perceive to be supporting values antithetical to their own.Trump supporters have boycotted Starbucks after it pledged to hire refugees in the wake of Mr Trump’s first immigration ban, and cereal group Kellogg’s, which pulled advertising from Breitbart, the far right news site.On the other side of the equation, a campaign boycotting stores selling Trump-branded products has gathered steam among women who feel Mr Trump’s daughter Ivanka should not stand by her father after revelations that he made derogatory comments about women.Last month, Nordstrom, the department store, stopped stocking the Ivanka Trump brand, citing poor sales. Mr Trump tweeted out his dissatisfaction at the decision — claiming she had been unfairly treated.Some Trump supporters took to Twitter on Thursday to demand a boycott of McDonald’s following the tweet, though it is too early to say whether the effort will gain any momentum.McDonald’s has 14,000 stores across the US, and it has been struggling to woo back customers after a period of falling sales.

60;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-03-02T02:49:26Z;McDonald’s to take a bite at $100bn global delivery market;New focus on growth comes as company unveils digital push;McDonald’s plans to roll out its own delivery services, starting in the US this year, the world’s largest fast-food chain said on Wednesday as it unveiled a digital push to win back customers.The new focus on the $100bn global delivery market marked the company’s shift from turnround mode to growth, chief executive Steve Easterbrook told investors.McDonald’s, which said it had lost 500m restaurant visits in the US since 2012, is testing delivery with companies including Uber in several cities in Florida, although it declined to detail which companies it had decided to work with. It said the pilot was going well, and it would roll out delivery services in other “major international markets” as well as the US.In a bullish presentation, the company said it saw significant untapped opportunity for delivery in its top five markets — the US, UK, France, Germany and Canada. In each, there is a McDonald’s restaurant within three to five miles of 75 per cent of the population, a key component to getting food delivered while it is still hot.Mr Easterbrook said most delivery orders come in at the end of the day when its restaurants are less busy, giving the company a big market to exploit.It already has a $1bn delivery business in Asia focused in China, South Korea and Singapore, where it hires its own drivers.“Restaurant delivery is a $100bn market and it’s exploded,” said Lucy Brady, McDonald’s chief strategy officer. “There’s significant opportunity that we haven’t even tapped into yet.”Mr Easterbook has led a turnround of McDonald’s US operations in his two years as chief executive, helped by the introduction of the all-day breakfast, which reversed two years of sales declines. However, in a sign of how much work it still has to do at home, sales again fell in the final three months of last year amid stiff competition from rival chains and falling grocery prices.Executives told investors McDonald’s would roll out a mobile ordering and payment system across 20,000 of its 36,000 restaurants by the end of this year.Andy Barish, an analyst at Jefferies, said that while he was “impressed” with the technology-related plans, news about new food items “fell a bit short”.“The focus appears [to be] on making McDonald’s better in the US, not different, although we wonder if that will be enough,” Mr Barish said.Mr Easterbrook admitted the company was late in investing in digital, given that rivals from Starbucks to Panera have had mobile order and payment apps for years. And while McDonald’s plans on introducing a loyalty programme, Panera’s already has 25m members and Starbucks has more than 12m.Restaurant delivery is a $100bn market and it’s exploded. There’s significant opportunity that we haven’t even tapped into yetThe use of mobile ordering and kerbside pick-up will help improve efficiency at its restaurants and drive-thrus, the company said.The digital investments and push into delivery are aimed at producing earnings-per-share growth in the “high-single digits” from 2019. This is slower than 2016’s 13 per cent increase, but last year’s sharp increase came after two years of declines.McDonald’s predicted sales growth of 3-5 per cent for the same period.It said operating margins would rise from nearly 30 per cent to the “mid 40 per cent” range from 2019, as it benefits from the sale of its restaurants to franchisees, reducing operating expenses and capital expenditures.Executives added that they planned to meet “untapped demand in the afternoons and evenings” by adding snacks such as pasties alongside existing menu items such as fries. The company had already announced plans to boost coffee sales, with some of its restaurant revamps featuring separate café areas.

Its margins currently stand at nearly 30 per cent, it said.McDonald’s also pledged to increase earnings per share in the “high-single digits” from 2019. This is slower than 2016′s 13 per cent increase. However, last year’s sharp increase came after two years of declines. It added that it will grow “system-wide sales” between 3 and 5 per cent from the same period.The new targets came on the two-year anniversary of Steve Easterbrook’s taking the top leadership role at McDonald’s. He has been guiding the company through a turnaround to make it more relevant, particularly to younger consumers.The company said that it had conducted its biggest consumer survey in its history and had found that it had not lost customers to newer fast-casual rivals but to more traditional rivals, and had the opportunity to win those back through offering value, convenience and experience. It added that while offering value meals was important, it would not engage in a “race to the bottom”, and quality was just as key.It played up the importance of digital and aims to build out its presence in the global $100bn delivery market. It claimed that in its “top five markets of the US, UK, France, Germany and Canada”, nearly 75 per cent of the population lives within three miles of a McDonald’s, giving it a huge pool to tap.
62;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-02-09T20:37:05Z;Dunkin Brands aims to boost ‘on-the-go’ image to increase 2017 traffic, sales;;Who has time to wait in line for their morning java fix? Dunkin Brands — the operator of the Dunkin’ Donuts stores — says it is trying to distinguish itself from rivals like Starbucks and McDonald’s as the ultimate destination for “on-the-go” beverages and food as its targets modest sales growth this year.The company’s shares were up nearly 5 per cent on Thursday — and poised for their best day in a year — after the company announced quarterly earnings for the three-month period ending December 31 that came in better than expected on most counts. Earnings per share were 64 cents for the quarter, compared to the 61 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, on net income of $56.1m, versus analysts’ predictions of $53m profit. Revenue came in as expected at $215.7m.Same-store sales at its core Dunkin’ Donuts stores were slightly softer than expected, improving 1.9 per cent versus expectations of a 2 per cent rise. Its Baskin-Robbins stores fared less well, with declining traffic pushing same-store sales to a loss of 0.9 per cent, compared with expectations of a 0.7 per cent decline.Dunkin said that it is guiding for low single-digit comparable sales growth for both brands this year, and low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth.At the core of its growth strategy will be to push its “on-the-go” offerings to help position it as the more convenient and affordable option in the competitive market for morning beverages, Dunkin executives said in a call with analysts after the earnings report.“The brand positioning of the beverage-led On-The-Go brand is clear, progressive and forward-leaning,” said David Hoffmann, president of Dunkin’ Donuts US and Canada who joined the company late last year after more than two decades with McDonald’s.For instance, it is hoping to ramp up the number of customers who use its mobile ordering, which has been available for just about six months. The ability to order before arriving at the restaurant and breeze past the line is “a huge unlock,” said chief digital officer Scott Hudler – and something that coffee competitor Starbucks is already taking advantage of.Dunkin is also eyeing a streamlined menu, in order to make food faster, and has begun testing out curbside delivery at some stores in Massachusetts, designed to be a speedier alternative to drive-through windows – a test it plans to expand in 2017 as franchisees clamour for that option.One perk to being the on-the-go choice? Restaurants may gradually require less space, said Dunkin Brands chief executive Nigel Travis, adding, “I think ultimately, we will require less capital investment because we’ll need less space for people to sit inside the store.”

Or if they don’t, as was the case with McDonald’s, they will leave.“We’re going to lose companies, but those that we are going to keep are going to add substance.”The European Commission is scrutinising the tax arrangements of several companies with Luxembourg operations, including French utility Engie, Italian carmaker Fiat and online retailer Amazon, as well as McDonald’s.This comes at the same time as the G20 drive to limit the practice of “base erosion and profit shifting”, or Beps, which refers to tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps in rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations.These comments have been interpreted as a threat. It’s obviously jeopardising the whole Beps exercise . . . this is a pity because we want to create a level playing fieldIn December McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast-food chain, announced it would relocate its non-US tax base to Britain from Luxembourg. The move was seen as a response to Luxembourg’s increased measures to counter treaty abuse.Analysis by the FT of McDonald’s main Luxembourg operation found it had paid an average tax rate of 1.49 per cent on $1.8bn of profit since 2009.Mr Gramegna added that the UK’s bullish approach to Brexit negotiations with the EU were threatening the international Beps initiative.The UK has been one of the biggest proponents of the framework to counter corporate tax avoidance. But Theresa May recently said that Britain would bring in more competitive tax rates and policies if Europe tried to impose a “punitive” arrangement on Britain after it left the EU. This showed the UK might be less likely to support an international agreement, Mr Gramegna said.“These comments have been interpreted as a threat. It’s obviously jeopardising the whole Beps exercise. I think this is a pity because we want to create a level playing field,” he said.However, Bernhard Gilbey, a UK-based partner at law firm Squire Patton Boggs, said any reduction in tax rates that the UK brought in would not necessarily indicate it was breaking ranks with the rest of the G20 over the framework.“There is no danger of the UK upsetting the Beps apple cart,” he said, adding that companies choosing to relocate their headquarters to the UK would be doing so because they already had substantial operations in the country. Their decisions, he said, would not be solely based on benefiting from a competitive tax rate.
64;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-01-23T21:48:30Z;US consumer groups face tough earnings season;Sector has seen the biggest downgrade in expectations bar energy companies;Evidence is mounting that US consumer groups will face a “tough” earnings season, Bank of America Merrill Lynch warned on Monday as Wall Street embarked on the heaviest week of fourth-quarter corporate reporting.The discretionary sector, which tracks companies facing customer demand that fluctuates in line with the broader economy, has experienced the biggest downgrade in earnings expectations bar groups in the energy industry.McDonald’s, the world’s biggest burger chain, underscored that risk after it reported its quarterly results early on Monday. The Illinois-based group disclosed better than expected global sales growth, but investors fretted that the momentum from its launch of all-day breakfast had cooled.The shares ended the day down 0.7 per cent to $121.38 in New York, leading a decline in restaurant industry-related stocks, with Yum Brands down 0.3 per cent to $64.41 and Sonic off 0.8 per cent to $25.20.Analysts have cut their fourth-quarter earnings expectations for discretionary stocks by 1.3 per cent, and now expect essentially no growth, BofA data show.The earnings figures could take on added significance since the sector has climbed 3.2 per cent this year, outpacing the 1.2 per cent gain for the broader market.Early reports from retailers have shown that the key holiday-shopping season may have been a disappointment. At the same time, a tightening labour market that has finally begun to put more vigorous upward pressure on wages, could present another challenge to the sector.Consumer staples, or companies that sell products where demand tends to be consistent regardless of economic swings, have also had a tough time of it. With six of 37 staples groups having posted earnings, only a third have beaten Wall Street profit calls, with less than a fifth topping sales estimates.US stocks have risen by about 6.3 per cent since the election of Donald Trump as president last year. That has propelled the valuation on the broad S&P 500 index to about 17 times expected earnings a year out, from 16 times at the start of last year, according to FactSet data.The more elevated valuations suggest groups face a higher bar in impressing investors.“Valuations for the market remain elevated, but multiples may be anticipating an outsized earnings pick-up,” BofA said.The broad S&P 500 has struggled to move higher since the Federal Reserve meeting in December, hovering in a range of roughly 1 per cent as investors await clarity from companies on their 2017 outlooks.The benchmark index, which fell 0.3 per cent to 2,265 on Monday, remains positive for the year. Smaller capitalised companies, which tend to be closer geared to domestic growth, fell by 0.3 per cent on Monday as the Russell 2000.Highlighting that sentiment, of the companies that have reported earnings so far, groups that have beaten on both the top and bottom lines have outperformed by 1.6 percentage points on average the following day, while those below have underperformed by 4.7 percentage points, BofA said.

The menu changes made so far have not completely reinvigorated the brand with younger and more discerning consumer segments, many of whom still shun the chain in favour of what they see as more premium offerings from other players.”Mr Saunders said the all-day breakfast had given consumers a cheaper option for lunch and dinner, resulting in lower spending per visit for those meals instead of markedly increasing traffic.Group-wide global revenue dropped 5 per cent to $6.03bn in the fourth quarter, dragged down by the weak performance in the US and the impact of the strong dollar, which generated 2 percentage points of the fall, and as it carried out its plan to sell restaurants. However, the decline was not as steep as analysts had forecast.Its international business outperformed the US, with global comparable store sales rising 3.8 per cent, also ahead of analysts’ expectations for a 1.5 per cent rise.Earnings increased 10 per cent to $1.44 a share, or 12 per cent excluding the impact of the strong dollar. Profit was bolstered by one-time gains from restaurant sales.“2016 was a year of purposeful change as we focused on the key elements of our turnround plan,” Mr Easterbrook said in a statement.“As we begin the first quarter of 2017, we are mindful of the comparison we face against first-quarter 2016 results, which benefited from leap year, favourable weather and continued momentum from all-day breakfast in the US.”

In the US, the company’s biggest market, McDonald’s notched a 1.3 per cent fall in the closely-watched gauge, edging out estimates of a 1.4 per cent fall.McDonald’s shares climbed as much as 3 per cent on the news, but had reversed course and declined by 0.8 per cent by 8:36 am in New York.Total revenues of $6.03bn topped expectations of $6bn. Meanwhile, per-share earnings of $1.44 came in ahead of estimates by three cents.Net income climbed in the fourth quarter to $1.19bn from $1.21bn in the same period in 2015.
67;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-01-12T18:02:38Z;McDonald’s: lovin’ it no longer;It looks like CEO Easterbrook can have his fries and eat them, too;While some ponder whether coffee will outperform burgers this year, McDonald’s has concluded a $2.1bn sale of 80 per cent of its business in China and Hong Kong. Here, consumers prefer competitor Yum’s chicken over the food chain’s red meat.The transaction should be seen in light of McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook’s attempt to update menu offerings. The company is under pressure to respond to millennials’ healthier eating habits. At the same time, Chineses sales growth is slowing for western fast food groups. Chains such as McDonald's and (Yum-owned) Kentucky Fried Chicken have lost their lustre (after a 2014 food safety scandal) and their novelty.The new owners CITIC, a state owned investment company, and Carlyle, the private equity group, are well placed to experiment with relevant menu offerings and expand to those cities in China where foreign sandwiches are still seen as exotic. Over the next five years they plan to increase the number of locations (currently 2,640) by 1,500, a quarter more than the number opened in the previous half decade. Kentucky Fried Chicken, by contrast, already runs 5,000 stores in China.McDonald’s does not disclose figures by country, but Euromonitor estimates 2015 revenues were roughly $3.7bn. The enterprise value of the Chinese operations implied by the deal amounts to 71 per cent of that. That seems small compared with McDonald’s overall enterprise value of roughly five times revenues. But if net cash proceeds of $1.5bn, according to Credit Suisse, are used to buy back stock then the deal should boost earnings per share.In addition, McDonald’s will replace most of its China income with a more stable royalty stream. The amount is not yet known, but in other markets it is worth about 5 per cent of sales. Seems that Mr Easterbrook can have his fries and eat them, too.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
68;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-01-10T18:26:32Z;McDonald’s faces test after ceding control of China restaurants;Group hopes switch to franchise can help revive country’s appetite for US fast food;When Beijing’s first McDonald’s outlet opened near Tiananmen Square in 1993, about 40,000 people queued round the block to place an order, a sign of a voracious appetite for fast food that would propel China to become the company’s third-biggest market by outlets, trailing only the US and Japan.But a quarter of a century later the Golden Arches have lost some of their lustre for Chinese consumers, and amid falling sales McDonald’s on Monday sold control of 2,700 China restaurants to a consortium led by state-run investor Citic. The $2.1bn deal follows KFC-owner Yum Brands’ spin-off of its much larger China operations in October.While both groups will continue to receive royalties from Chinese sales, analysts say ceding control of assets and handing decisions to local management will allow the brands to expand more rapidly and localise more nimbly in a crucial market.But both new units will struggle to improve the image of US chains. Where once they were perceived as an exotic, upscale choice for dates, business meetings and even weddings they are now increasingly looked upon as mundane. Sales at both groups were also hit after scandals over expired meat in 2014, while ordering apps have spurred increased competition for deliveries. “China has grown out of the American fast food craze,” says Junheng Li, founder and president of New York-based equity research group JL Warren Capital. KFC’s market share fell to 3.6 per cent in 2015 from 6.4 per cent in 2012, according to Euromonitor, with same-store sales declining in absolute terms. McDonald’s does not separate out its China revenues but said like-for-like sales in the country had fallen almost 2 per cent in the third quarter. China became crucial to both brands, especially for Yum, whose 7,200 KFC and Pizza Hut branches there generated $6.9bn in 2015 — the highest of any region. KFC was seen as a model of overseas management, adapting to local tastes by adding porridge and rice to its menu. McDonald’s China, in which two Citic affiliates will have a 52 per cent stake, with US private equity firm Carlyle Group taking 28 per cent, is expected to back plans to open 1,500 McDonald’s outlets over the next five years, mostly in smaller cities. In such locations “the market is still expanding at a fast rate and western outlets are still highly regarded”, says Kamel Mellahi of Warwick Business School, adding that “the franchise model will enable McDonald’s to localise its offerings in China”.But, says Mr Mellahi, “the franchise brings its own challenges, not least . . . lack of talent and managerial skills in third and fourth cities and, most of all, loss of control”.Founded in 1979 and best known for investments in property and natural resources, Citic has deep pockets and impeccable political connections but no experience of running restaurants. It was attracted to McDonald’s by the opportunity to gain a foothold in one of corporate America’s most iconic brands, according to people close to the deal.Under the terms of the 20-year McDonald’s franchise agreement, the new owners are barred from altering management or suppliers for two years, or exiting through a public offering. The FT reported last month that potential buyers including Bain Capital and its Chinese partner had dropped out of the auction over the terms.McDonald’s will receive higher royalty fees from future China operations than the 3 per cent of sales that Yum gains from its spun-off China unit, which listed on the New York Stock Exchange in October, people close to the deal say.Yum sold a $460m stake in the China unit to Primavera, a China-focused private equity firm founded by an ex-Goldman Sachs banker, and the finance arm of Chinese internet behemoth Alibaba before the listing. The company said at the time that the proceeds could fund a plan to nearly triple its restaurants in China to 20,000.“They are both focusing on franchising, which is a more profitable model,” says Jeffrey Towson, a business professor at Peking University. But he likens McDonald’s private equity-style model, which allows for debt-funded expansion, to “Yum China driving a sedan [while] McDonald’s has just upgraded to a Ferrari”.One challenge both brands face is the rise of mobile apps through which consumers can order food delivery from a wide range of restaurants. Groups such as Ele.ma and Meituan “are doing to the food sector what [online retailers] Alibaba and JD have done to bricks-and-mortar retail”, says Shaun Rein, managing director of Shanghai-based China Market Research Group. “McDonald’s had been known as fast, cheap and convenient. But now Ele.ma has become more fast, cheap and convenient.”Yum’s China business returned to sales growth in the past year even before the spin-off, as new management cut the number of food offerings and renovated outlets to give them a more upmarket feel. On Monday, it opened the country’s only Taco Bell outlet in Shanghai’s financial district. Decorated in a “California-inspired” style with surfboards hanging from the ceiling, the restaurant sells shrimp and avocado burritos, which the company says are “unique to Taco Bell restaurants in China”.Additional reporting by Don Weinland in Hong KongTwitter: @hancocktom

After making changes to the deal – to just put the China and Hong Kong stake on the block – the transaction was expected to fetch between $1bn and $2bn.Citic and Carlyle emerged as the most likely to secure the deal, which had attracted several Chinese bidders. However, many of these were said to have been turned away because they were not deemed suitable to run the business.The 20-year old franchise spans some 2,400 stores in Hong Kong and the mainland.Hong Kong-listed shares in Citic were down 1.1 per cent before the lunch break in the territory.
70;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-01-06T05:32:37Z;McDonald’s fast-food king battles to retain supremacy;Steve Easterbrook has revived US sales but he must stay on top of consumer trends;"When Steve Easterbrook took the helm at McDonald’s in 2015, the world’s largest fast-food company was grappling with an identity crisis.As it entered its sixth decade, sales were falling in its critical home market, consumers were opting for healthier alternatives to its Big Macs and fries, and smaller rivals with fresher menus were eating into its market.Having been a symbol of American capitalism across the globe, McDonald’s had started to represent much that can go wrong at a mature company: it was slow to react to changing consumer tastes and reluctant to take risks, raising questions about its relevancy.Nearly two years into Mr Easterbrook’s leadership, sales in the US are rising again, McDonald’s margin on earnings before interest and tax has increased by 3.4 percentage points over two years to an estimated 32.3 per cent by the end of 2016, and the company’s shares are up nearly a quarter compared with the S&P 500 index’s 7.5 per cent gain since he became chief executive.But the market’s initial enthusiasm for McDonald’s under Mr Easterbrook has waned. By the end of his first year, McDonald’s market value had risen more than $20bn to a peak of $116bn in April 2016 but it has since fallen back to just over $97bn. Now Wall Street analysts are asking whether Starbucks, whose market value topped $86bn last month, can steal McDonald’s crown as the world’s most valuable restaurant chain.In a global company with more than 36,000 restaurants in 100 countries and annual sales of $25.4bn, there are as many challenges facing Mr Easterbrook as those he has already tackled. In a fast-evolving industry, staying abreast of consumer trends — be they related to food or digital innovation — is vital. But analysts are optimistic that the 50-year-old Briton is the best person to steer McDonald’s.“He’s clearly done a lot in a fairly short amount of time,” says Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bernstein. “When he came on board his message and philosophy was if there’s a good idea they’ll find a way to do it. The all-day breakfast is the most obvious evidence of this.”This menu item, launched in October 2015, was rolled out in six months, a timeframe analysts say was swift given the complexities involved for a company with more than 14,000 restaurants across the US alone, and helped McDonald’s reverse a two-year slide in domestic sales.The company’s upcoming earnings report for the three months to December will offer its first full year-on-year sales comparison since the all-day breakfast was introduced — a crucial test of its impact.The fourth quarter capped a tough year for the US restaurant industry. Food deflation, increasingly attractive deli counters at supermarkets and convenience stores, more spending on big-ticket items such as home improvement, and uncertainty around the US election helped drive demand for eating at home, analysts say.Restaurant sales rose just 0.3 per cent in November after falling 0.5 per cent in October, according to MillerPulse. Andy Barish, an analyst at Jefferies, suggests fourth-quarter operating conditions were “difficult” and 2017 will also be “challenging”.Tough market conditions have contributed to a slowdown in the pace of McDonald’s US same-store sales recovery. It reported growth of just 1.3 per cent in the third quarter, a far cry from the 5.7 per cent lift in the fourth quarter of 2015.However, McDonald’s showed signs of gaining on its competitors in the third quarter, when its share of traffic to quick-service restaurants increased by 3 percentage points to 31 per cent, according to xAd, which provides real-time data to companies.Mr Easterbrook has a long to-do list — from modernising restaurants for the digital era to selling off Asian operations — all while keeping promises to return $30bn to shareholders by the end of 2016 and achieve annual cost savings of $500m by 2018.But executives and analysts say he has made meaningful moves to shake up the company’s culture and push staff to take more risks, stripping out a layer of management to improve communication across regions and hiring outsiders to bring fresh perspectives.“It’s the culture change that’s made the biggest impact,” says Christopher Kempczinski, McDonald’s head of US, who joined from Kraft Heinz a year ago. “That, as in every company — but especially one that’s as established as McDonald’s — is a big deal.”The revamp planned across many of McDonald’s US restaurants includes self-service kiosks and table service, as well as store redesigns that it hopes will appeal to younger customers and families. It is experimenting with home delivery in Florida with Uber.“We’re allowing technology to take out the non-value added manual elements of the McDonald’s experience,” Mr Easterbrook said in an interview with the FT in November.———————1.

3. Jul 26 2016 McDonald’s revamped offering falls flat
4. Nov 17 2016 Chain attracts millennials with mobile ordering———————Mr Easterbrook has also reviewed the McDonald’s menu, cutting the number of items on offer while testing its ability to meet consumers’ individual tastes with “signature crafted recipes” in stores and at some drive-throughs in a revision of an earlier customisation experiment that proved too complex.It is introducing different sized Big Macs — the first time it has tinkered with its signature dish. Regional variations are also appearing on menus — the McLobster in Maine and New England and peaches and mango pie in Hawaii. It is also adding to its coffee offerings, including a value offer of $1 Americanos and $2 small lattes, mochas and hot chocolate, undercutting Starbucks at a time when the coffee chain has been building up its food menu, taking it into closer competition with McDonald’s.Having removed antibiotics important to human medicine from the chickens it uses, and promising to switch its annual purchases of 2bn eggs to the cage-free variety by 2025, it is now testing whether to use fresh instead of frozen beef patties. If adopted nationwide this would have enormous implications for suppliers as the company buys 2 per cent of all US beef.“We have often somewhat mistakenly seen our size and scale as a barrier for change,” says Mr Easterbrook. “What I’ve enjoyed doing . . . is really encouraging our appetite for risk, for our leaders to be confident in making bigger and bolder decisions.”But pushing through change is not easy, particularly in digital and mobile. Rivals from Starbucks to Panera and Chick-fil-A already have mobile ordering and payment systems, which provide easy payment and a rich source of customer data. McDonald’s plans to introduce a mobile payments system later this year, while around 8m Starbucks customers already use mobile pay. Pizza companies such as Domino’s are even further ahead.“He deserves a lot of credit for what he’s done so far, but consumer tastes change so quickly,” says Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy. “The stable core menu is simple and good, but McDonald’s needs to continue to work on nimbleness.”Too lazy to click your smartphone to order pizza?Domino’s has the answer for you with its “zero-click” app, introduced last year, where order preferences are stored and users simply open the app, setting off a 10-second countdown after which your pre-saved order is automatically sent.When it comes to innovating around convenience, pizza companies such as Domino’s have outclassed restaurant rivals such as McDonald’s with technology that allows consumers to order via personal assistants such as Google Home and Amazon’s Echo.The innovations have helped woo customers and drive up share prices at a time when food deflation, higher consumer spending on expensive items such as home improvements and healthcare, and general uncertainty around the presidential election was blamed for fewer people eating out at restaurants.Domino’s shares have risen 47.9 per cent over the past year, while Papa John’s has jumped 58.2 per cent, compared with the S&P 500’s 12.3 per cent gain.The gains underscore just how important convenience has become to US consumers, at a time when millennials — rarely parted from their smartphones — have overtaken baby boomers as the biggest demographic group. They also explain why restaurant chains are having to sharpen their focus on digital ordering and delivery."
71;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2017-01-03T21:36:24Z;Starbucks tipped to take McDonald’s crown;Wall Street analyst expects the coffee chain’s market value to eclipse that of the burger chain;Starbucks has already established itself as the undisputed king of retail coffee chains. Now one Wall Street analyst thinks it can overtake McDonald’s as the world’s most valuable restaurant chain.The Seattle-based coffee chain’s shares fell 7.5 per cent last year, as investors warily eyed a deceleration in same-store sales from the first half to the second. The announcement last month that long-serving chief executive Howard Schultz would step down — although stay as executive chairman — didn’t help.However, the drop in the stock could make it that much more attractive to investors as it aims to maintain its steady growth in the coming year, according to Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski, who picked Starbucks as his top large-cap US-based restaurant stock pick for this year.Starbucks will expand its worldwide store count by more than 8 per cent for the fiscal year ending in September, according to Mr Kalinowski, and grow worldwide same-store sales by about 5 per cent. As its presence grows, Starbucks could see revenue expand in double-digits, and earnings per share increase 12 per cent, he added.The chain’s tailwinds include “consistent same-store sales, unit growth potential and ongoing innovation”, Mr Kalinowski noted. It also benefits from a lack of direct head-on competition, as a beverage-first chain that also sells food, as opposed to more food-focused chains.The prediction from Mr Kalinowski is a bold one, but the bullishness towards Starbucks on Wall Street is widespread. Of the 33 analysts who cover the stock, 29 recommend buying it, according to Bloomberg. By contrast, 15 of the 35 analysts who track McDonald’s advise investors to buy into a stock that has rallied almost 30 per cent since Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, was appointed in early 2015.One thing that has set Starbucks apart from would-be rivals is its remarkably consistent growth over a long span of time, Mr Kalinowski added. For 26 of the past 28 fiscal years, it has achieved same-store sales growth of at least 5 per cent, and appears on track to extend that streak during the current financial year.Those dynamics have made Starbucks the second-largest US restaurant chain by market cap. Could it eventually claim the number-one spot?“We believe that it is only a matter of time before Starbucks overtakes McDonald’s as the largest market cap restaurant stock, although likely not in 2017,” according to Mr Kalinowski.Starbucks still has some way to go. Its current market cap currently hovers at about $80bn, compared with the $98.7bn market cap of the ubiquitous burger chain.However, if Starbucks can hit its goal of expanding its number of units by more than 8 per cent every year until 2021, it may be the first restaurant chain in decades to take the Golden Arches’ crown.On Tuesday, Starbucks closed 0.3 per cent lower at $55.35. McDonald’s also had a bite taken out of it, down 1.7 per cent at $119.62.The overall markets did better, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both gaining 0.9 per cent to 2,257 and 5,429, respectively. The Dow resumed its climb towards 20,000, closing 0.6 per cent higher at 19,881.
72;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Starbucks closes in on McDonald’s as most valuable restaurant chain – analyst;;Starbucks has already established itself as the undisputed king of retail coffee chains. Now one analyst thinks it can overtake McDonald’s as the world’s most valuable restaurant chain.The Seattle-based coffee chain’s shares fell 7.5 per cent last year, as investors warily eyed a deceleration in same-store sales from the first half of 2016 to the latter half, as well as the recently announced departure of long-time chief executive Howard Schultz, who will retain his executive chairman seat and oversee the chain’s higher-end Starbucks Roastery and Starbucks Reserve efforts.But the dip in share value could make it that much more attractive to investors as it aims to maintain its steady growth in the coming year, according to a note on Tuesday from Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski, who crowned Starbucks as his top large-cap US-based restaurant stock pick for the coming year.Mr Kalinowski projected Starbucks would expand its worldwide store count 8.4 per cent for the fiscal year 2017 ending in September, and grow worldwide same-store sales by about 5 per cent. As its presence grows, Starbucks could see revenue expand in a double-digit percentage range, and earnings per share increase 12 per cent in 2017, Mr Kalinowski added.Starbucks has numerous factors going for it as it heads into the new year, Mr Kalinowski wrote, citing its “concept differentiation, consistent same-store sales, unit growth potential and ongoing innovation.” It also benefits from a lack of direct head-on competition, as a beverage-first chain that also sells food, as opposed to more food-focused chains.Even McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts, which both sling plenty of coffee, have positioned their brands differently, competing against one another more directly than Starbucks, whose coffee- and tea-focused menu has “near universal” appeal, Mr Kalinowski wrote.One thing that has set Starbucks apart from would-be rivals is its remarkably consistent growth over a long span of time, Mr Kalinowski wrote. For 26 of the past 28 fiscal years, it has achieved same-store sales growth of at least 5 per cent, and appears on track to extend that streak during this year.Those dynamics have made Starbucks the second-largest US restaurant chain by market cap. Could it eventually claim the number-one spot?“We believe that it is only a matter of time before Starbucks overtakes McDonald’s as the largest market cap restaurant stock, although likely not in 2017,” Mr Kalinowski wrote.Starbucks would still have some ways to go. Its current market cap currently hovers around $80bn, compared to the $98.7bn market cap of the ubiquitous burger chain, whose shares have tacked on 3 per cent during the past calendar year.But if Starbucks can hit its goal of expanding its number of units by more than 8 per cent every year until 2021, it may be the first restaurant chain in decades to take the Golden Arches’ crown.
73;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-12-12T03:08:13Z;McDonald’s trims plans to sell parts of Asian operations;Company fails to find suitable buyer in South Korea, and reduces China deal;McDonald’s has downsized plans to sell parts of its Asia franchise after failing to find a suitable buyer in South Korea.The world’s largest fast-food retailer has a stringent list of terms for the deal, including keeping management and existing suppliers in place for a period of time in the hope of protecting the brand.Potential buyers balked at those demands, and prompted the decision to cut the country out of the current deal, said two people close to the matter.McDonald’s also plans to take a minority stake in the sale of the franchise in China and Hong Kong of up to 25 per cent, in an attempt to exercise greater control over the business that has in the past suffered from food safety scandals.The changes to the deal, which is near closing, with China’s Citic Group Corp and US private equity house Carlyle as the buyers, would reduce the size of the transaction to between $1bn and $2bn from what was originally expected to be as much as $3bn.The deal could close by the end of the month, said one of the people close to the deal.The sale of the 20-year franchise of 2,400 stores in China and Hong Kong has forced McDonald’s to strike a balance between reducing its exposure to China while also protecting its brand in the region.The deal attracted several Chinese bidders but people close to the process said the company turned many of them away because they were not deemed suitable to run the operation. The list of bidders included Sanpower Group, the owner of UK retailer House of Fraser, as well as Cinda Asset Management, a state-run bad-debt investor.The terms of the deal were unappealing to some of the private equity funds that originally were interested because McDonald’s has insisted the franchise not be publicly listed. Some private equity investors hoping to squeeze value out of the franchise considered terms such as maintaining management and suppliers for two years oppressive.US private equity house TPG, which partnered with Chinese retailer Wumart Stores, dropped out of the process at an early stage, followed later by Bain Capital and Shanghai-based partner GreenTree Hospitality.Yum Brands, which is nearly double McDonald’s presence in China, struggled with similar problems earlier this year.Yum Brands spun off its China business in a New York Stock Exchange listing in October with China-based private equity fund Primavera Capital and Ant Financial Services, an affiliate of Alibaba, taking a $460m stake in the operation.One investor has raised concerns about McDonald’s Latin American partner’s performance and whether McDonald’s would face similar issues in Asia by stepping back from operations on the ground.CtW Investment Group, which has a 0.2 per cent stake in McDonald’s and is affiliated to a federation of unions representing more than $250bn in assets, wrote to McDonald’s earlier this year citing worries over corporate governance at the fast-food chain’s master franchiser in Latin America, Arcos Dorados, which it says is hampering the chain’s performance in the market.
74;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-12-08T18:34:18Z;McDonald’s to move its non-US tax base to UK;Fast-food chain’s arrangements in Luxembourg have come under sustained attack;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast-food chain, is moving its non-US tax base to Britain, away from Luxembourg where its tax arrangements have come under sustained attack.It is setting up a new UK-based holding company responsible for the majority of the royalties from licensing its intellectual property rights outside the US.Heather Self, a partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, said the move was likely to generate tens — possibly hundreds of millions — of pounds of extra tax revenue for the UK.McDonald’s said it had selected the UK because of “significant number of staff based in London working on our international business, language, and connections to other markets”.It said the new structure would reduce expenses and increase its flexibility, adding that “this change has a clear business rationale in matching our corporate structure to our new functional structure”.The decision makes McDonald’s the latest multinational to dismantle structures used to minimise their European tax bills, following moves by Amazon, Starbucks and Facebook.Ms Self said the decision to move from Luxembourg was likely a response to measures to counter treaty abuse that are being introduced as part of the G20-led crackdown on “base erosion and profits shifting”, or Beps.“This is the Beps project starting to bite. US companies with complicated structures that paid very little tax on their European operations are finding that the game is becoming too difficult.”US companies with complicated structures that paid very little tax on their European operations are finding that the game is becoming too difficultThe company is under investigation by Brussels over a tax ruling underpinning its European structure, which permitted McDonald’s to pay no corporation tax — either in the US or Luxembourg — on royalty income from restaurant franchises across Europe.In an interview last month, Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, defended McDonald’s tax position in the EU and France, where it is also being investigated. Luxembourg also denies any wrongdoing.“We’re very transparent about the tax we pay and the tax we pay in the different countries around the world,” Mr Easterbook said, adding that French authorities are “exploring our situation and we’ll engage with them when they come to us and ask for our perspective on it”.The Luxembourg office will retain responsibility for McDonald’s restaurants in the Grand Duchy but other functions will transfer to the UK-based holding company. Its operations in Geneva will be closed.1.49%Average tax rate on profits from McDonald’s main company in Luxembourg since 2009The UK is now likely to be the recipient of large flows of royalty payments. A recent FT review of McDonald’s main company in Luxembourg found it had earned $1.8bn profit since 2009, on which it paid an average tax rate of 1.49 per cent.But Ms Self said the tax paid in the UK on these royalty payments was likely to be less than some people expected because of the depreciation on the intangible assets transferred to the UK.Dan Neidle, a partner of Clifford Chance, a law firm, said multinationals were under pressure to align holding company structures with the substance of where employees are based and where business is actually carried out.The UK is seen as an attractive jurisdiction for a holding company because it has a low corporate tax rate of 20 per cent, no withholding taxes on dividends and a good treaty network.McDonald’s said that from 2011-2015, it paid more than $2.5bn in corporate taxes in the EU, with an average tax rate approaching 27 per cent.
75;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-12-07T08:45:17Z;Profits in China: not safe;Limits on repatriation of earnings have broad implications;Making money in China can be tough for foreign companies. Those that do have the secret sauce are finding it tougher yet to send profits home. The EU Chamber of Commerce in Beijing said on Tuesday that several European companies have been unable to remit dividends overseas due to tighter capital controls. It is the first sign that new rules from China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange will hamper foreign entities operating in China. There are implications for sales of China-based assets, too.Last week, bankers revealed that Safe permission is now required for transfers out of China for as little as $5m, down from a previous limit of $50m. The heightened oversight is initially likely to be more inconvenient for European than US companies. Due to tax reasons, the latter have tended not to remit overseas earnings back to their home country. Apple, which garners one-fifth of its sales from greater China, has chosen to issue debt in the US to fund returns to shareholders, rather than send its profits home.Doubtless, some US companies will already have moved their China profits elsewhere, not least due to concerns over the weak renminbi. Those that have built up funds in the country will be hard hit by the constraints. The incoming Trump administration is expected to alter the tax regime in order to encourage repatriation of earnings, including any “trapped” cash.Foreign companies that are trying to sell assets in China, such as McDonald’s, may also feel the pinch. Sales of China-based US fast food operations have already proven unpopular. In September, having failed to find an outright buyer, Yum Brands chose to spin off its China business instead. Buyers of those shares will also find their profits caught by Safe’s new rules, without the same recourse as Apple to cheap debt. Last week, just one group remained in the running to buy McDonald’s assets, a Sino-US team of Citic Group Corp and Carlyle, the private equity house. With meagre earnings trapped in China, a hard sell may just have become impossible.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
76;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-12-01T11:29:12Z;Citic and Carlyle team takes pole position for McDonald’s China;Just one contender remains for franchise worth as much as $3bn;A team led by Chinese conglomerate Citic Group Corp and US-based private equity house Carlyle has emerged as the final global group seeking to buy McDonald’s China franchise, a deal that could fetch between $2bn-$3bn.TPG Capital and Bain Capital, two other global contenders originally involved in the deal for the fast-food chain’s 2,800 outlets in China, have dropped out of the process, according to two people familiar with the deal. That has left Citic Group and its partner Carlyle as the favoured bidder.TPG had partnered with Wumart Stores. It was unclear if the Beijing-based retailer was still in the running for McDonald’s China outlets and the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bain had partnered with GreenTree Hospitality.The sale of the China franchise of world’s largest fast-food retail chain struggled to attract investors when it was announced earlier this year. Investors that looked at the deal in the first half of 2016 said many of the terms, such as keeping existing management and suppliers for two years, were unappealing. The deal also barred the buyer from listing the company.The terms were meant to protect the group’s reputation in Asia but investors have argued that they gave little opportunity to add value to the brand.Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, who is leading a turnround effort at the company, has defended the move to sell its Asian business, after an investor raised concerns about its Latin American partner’s performance in that region and whether McDonald’s would face similar issues in Asia by stepping back from operations on the ground.“As you evolve operating models you get a lot of things right and some things incorrect. We’re very clear about the partners we’re looking for in Asia and why,” said Mr Easterbrook in an interview in November. “The reality is we’re looking for a partner that can help McDonald’s China grow quicker than it would do if it was just McDonald’s in charge.”CtW Investment Group, which has a 0.2 per cent stake in McDonald’s and is affiliated to a federation of unions representing more than $250bn in assets, wrote to McDonald’s earlier this year citing worries over corporate governance at the fast-food chain’s master franchisor in Latin America, Arcos Dorados, which it says is hampering the chain’s performance in the market.The McDonald’s sale follows that of competitor Yum! Brands, which spun off its China business in a New York Stock Exchange listing in October. China-based private equity fund Primavera Capital Group and Ant Financial Services Group, an affiliate of Alibaba, took a $460m stake in the operation.Shares in Yum China Holdings have climbed nearly 10 per cent since the initial public offering to $28.12. McDonald’s closed at $119.27 on Wednesday, up slightly from the start of the year.Both McDonald’s and Yum have suffered from food safety scandals in China over the past five years, troubles that have in some cases knocked the company’s share prices in the US. The sales have been viewed as a means of reducing exposure to China.
77;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-12-01T02:55:54Z;Michael ‘Jim’ Delligatti, Big Mac creator, dies aged 98;McDonald’s franchisee created signature burger that became symbol of US capitalism;The creator of McDonald’s Big Mac signature burger, a symbol of American capitalism whose ubiquity inspired the Economist’s eponymous index for comparing currency values, has died aged 98.Michael “Jim” Delligatti, who was also one of McDonald’s first franchisees, invented the burger in 1967 at his Uniontown restaurant in south-west Pennsylvania, just over a decade after McDonald’s the company was established.Delligatti had no help initially from corporate headquarters, he told a local Pittsburgh television station in 2007. “The way they did it was they said you have to do it with what you have in the store. I said OK. That meant I had to make the sandwich without the centre cut bun.”But the centre bun was crucial to give the burger some structure, given the long list of ingredients of two beef patties, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions. So the addition of that, along with his still “special sauce”, came the following day, Delligatti said. A year later, recognising its success and in need of a menu item to compete more effectively with rival Burger King, McDonald’s took the Big Mac nationwide and it is now sold in more than 100 countries.For all its success, Delligatti appears not to have received any royalties for his invention, telling the Pittsburgh TV stations he had only received a plaque.He was not the only franchisee to put signature dishes on McDonald’s menu. Lou Groen invented the Filet-o-Fish to compete against the Big Boy chain in Catholic districts of Cincinnati in the 1960s when many abstained from meat on Fridays, according to the autobiography of Ray Kroc, who bought McDonald’s restaurants from the founding brothers and made the chain into a global phenomenon. Meanwhile, Connecticut-based Harold Rosen invented McDonald’s Shamrock Shake to celebrate St Patrick’s day and Herb Peterson created the Egg McMuffin.The Big Mac will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2017, and has until recently been left untouched. However, as the world’s largest fast-food chain undertakes a turnround to revive sales and its image across the globe, it is experimenting with its menu. This means that early next year it will test out two new sizes of Big Mac: Mac Jr and Grand Mac, while it recently started testing a Big Mac with its own sriracha spicy sauce.Delligatti, who also played a role in introducing breakfast at McDonald’s as well as the hotcakes and sausage menu item, opened 48 McDonald’s restaurants during his career. This made him one of the largest owner-operators across the franchisee business. He passed his profession down through two more generations — the family owns and operates 18 McDonald’s in western Pennsylvania.The second world war veteran is survived by his wife Ellie, sons Jim and Michael and five grandchildren.“We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honourable gentleman who left a legacy of four generations of family members running great restaurants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina,” McDonald’s said.
78;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-11-17T23:43:53Z;McDonald’s to roll out in-store mobile ordering;Fast-food chain aiming to attract millennial consumers in next stage of turnround plan;McDonald’s will introduce in-store mobile orders and payments next year as the world’s largest fast-food chain embarks on the next stage of its turnround plan to improve its image and attract millennial consumers.The move is part of the company’s so-called experience of the future that includes offering table service to customers and digital ordering at kiosks. The strategy was first tried out in countries outside the US, including Australia and the UK. McDonald’s has redesigned 500 of its 14,000 US restaurants and plans to roll out the strategy across the market as soon as it can.“Ordering should be the most enjoyable experience but at McDonald’s it can be one of the most stressful points in time,” said Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, who was brought in to revamp sales at the company after turning round its UK operations. “Bringing out service staff on to the dining floor does change the atmosphere.”Given McDonald’s size, rolling out the strategy may take time, while smaller rivals such as Panera Bread have been faster and more nimble introducing their own digital programmes. Panera introduced plans for its sandwich shops a couple of years ago and said in its most recent earnings that, excluding mobile, its in-store digital orders accounted for 22 per cent of sales, double a year ago. Pizza companies were the earliest adopters, with digital utilisation estimated at 50 per cent.“We want to move on this quickly, we don’t want to be delayed,” said Chris Kempczinski, McDonald’s new head of the US business, who added that so far kiosk ordering was accounting for about 25 per cent of total orders.McDonald’s move follows a year where it has made promises to improve the quality of its food including removing artificial flavourings and high-fructose corn syrup, said it has simplified its menu, and introduced new items such as the all-day breakfast.In the US, under the leadership of Mr Easterbrook, the company’s sales declines have been reversed, but the next few quarters will be key to assessing whether the turnround is going to be sustainable as the introduction of the all-day breakfast reaches its first-year anniversary.Ordering should be the most enjoyable experience but at McDonald’s it can be one of the most stressful points in timeMcDonald’s declined to say how much investment was required for the overhaul of its restaurants, which also include some redesign of the layout as well as spending on technology for the digital kiosks. However, a significant portion of the investment will be shouldered by the franchisees.The changes mean that there will be more McDonald’s staff waiting tables rather than taking orders. However, the company would not be shifting to a tipping system, it said.On the election of Donald Trump last week, Mr Easterbrook said that the company was in “wait and see mode” over what policies might be introduced and how they might impact McDonald’s, but he added that it was not going to “interrupt any decisions”.“We don’t expect there to be anything of such magnitude that we have to adapt our plans,” he said.

Steve Easterbook, chief executive, said:Excluding the impact of temporary protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea, China’s comparable sales would have been positive for the quarter.Chinese nationalists have been calling for a boycott of Western brands in the country amid accusations that the US had encouraged the Philippines to bring a legal case against China’s claim to most of the South China Sea to The Hague.Beijing reacted with fury to the verdict of the international tribunal, given in July, which found there was “no legal basis” under the United Nation’s Convention on the Law of the Sea for China’s claims to more than 80 per cent of the South China Sea.McDonald’s China sales woes echoed those seen at Yum Brands, the company behind KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. The company, which will separate its China business at the end of this month, said same stores slid 1 per cent in China in the third quarter, and that without the protests like-for-like sales would have been positive for the three month period.Greg Creed, chief executive of Yum, said:Sales were off to a good start in the first six weeks of the quarter in the China Division. However, anticipated tougher laps in the second half of the third quarter were compounded by an international court ruling on claims regarding the South China Sea, which triggered a series of regional protests and negative sentiment against a few international companies with well-known Western brands. If not for this event, we believe the China Division would have delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth.

The introduction of chicken raised without antibiotics and hamburger buns without corn-syrup, helped lift sales 1.3 per cent. Growth was not limited to the US. Sales strengthened in the UK, Australia, Canada and Japan where the company rolled out technological improvements as well.“Customers today are more informed and demand greater choice and variety when they dine out. That’s why we’re evolving the McDonald’s experience to provide more high quality, affordable food and beverage options and convenient solutions for customers on the go,” said chief executive Steve Easterbrook.Mr Easterbrook, who took the helm at the burger chain last year, has introduced all-day breakfasts and removed artificial preservatives from a number of menu items as he seeks to win back consumers looking for less processed, healthier food.The efforts appear to be paying off. The company said on Friday that its consumer satisfaction had climbed 6 per cent so far this year in the US and Canada.Profits slid to $1.28bn in the three months ended September, compared with $1.31bn in the year ago period. But earnings of $1.50 a share topped analysts’ expectations for $1.32.McDonald’s sales slid 3 per cent to $6.4bn as it cuts the number of company-owned stores.As part of his turnround plan, Mr Easterbrook has pushed to sell about 4,000 restaurants to franchisees by the end of 2018 — a move that resulted in about $130m in pre-tax charges, or about 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis in the third quarter.“McDonald’s third-quarter results should improve its standing with investors, many of whom had given up on the US turn around momentum,” said John Glass, analyst at Morgan Stanley. “While the potential for [fourth quarter/first quarter 2017] comp declines still exists, better earnings growth this quarter should assuage some of those concerns,” he said.As Mr Easterbrook rights the ship at McDonald’s, however, the chain remains under investigation by Brussels over a tax ruling granted by Luxembourg that allowed the company to pay no corporate tax on its European royalties either in Luxembourg or the US.McDonald’s shares, which have declined more than 6 per cent so far this year, rose 3.1 per cent to $114.

That was above analysts’ forecasts of 1.5 per cent growth.Profits slid to $1.28bn in the three months ended in September, compared with $1.31bn, or in the year ago period. Earnings of $1.50 a share, topped analysts’ expectations for $1.48.Sales fell 3 per cent to $6.4bn, impacted in part by the company’s refranchising efforts.“Customers today are more informed and demand greater choice and variety when they dine out. That’s why we’re evolving the McDonald’s experience to provide more high quality, affordable food and beverage options and convenient solutions for customers on the go,” said McDonald’s chief executive Steve Easterbrook.Mr Easterbrook, who took the helm at the burger chain last year, has introduced all-day breakfast, removed artificial preservatives from a number of menu items and started using eggs from cage-free hens as he seeks to win back consumers looking for less processed, healthier food.As part of his turnaround plan, Mr Easterbrook has pushed to sell about 4,000 restaurants to franchisees by the end of 2018 — a move that resulted in about $130m in pretax charges, or about 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis in the third quarter.As Mr Easterbrook rights the ship at McDonald’s,however, the fast-food chain remains under investigation by Brussels over a tax ruling granted by Luxembourg that allowed the company to pay no corporate tax on its European royalties either in Luxembourg or the US.McDonald’s shares, which have declined more than 6 per cent so far this year, rose 3.5 per cent in pre-market trading.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis.

Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language.

84;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-09-29T13:09:12Z;Fast food loses its lustre in China;Segment under pressure as consumer tastes grow increasingly sophisticated;Next year marks the 30th anniversary of the arrival of western fast-food chains in China. It will be a subdued affair: growth has been slowing, and not just because of the impact of a spate of food safety scandals. Rather, the Chinese consumer has changed in those three decades as incomes have risen and technology broadens the range of food delivery options on offer.The growth rate of the fast-food sector has lagged that of the food service industry as a whole since 2013, for both Western and Asian operators. Organic growth is driving the business now: the number of outlets increased 10 per cent last year while sales rose just 5.2 per cent, according to the China Hotel Association (see chart).Same-store sales of KFC’s China operations fell 4 per cent in 2015. Due to a low base effect, same-store sales for KFC and McDonald’s were positive year-on-year in the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016. But this is tepid growth at best compared with the double-digit gains recorded in the early years of this decade, prior to food safety scandals in 2012 and 2014 (see chart).The same-store sales of Japanese-style ramen chain Ajisen fell 7.5 per cent last year, and another 7.7 per cent in the first half of 2016, while those of Yoshinoya dropped 5 per cent in 2015, though they were up a weak 1 per cent in the first half of this year.Despite their slowing growth, western-style fast-food chains, including McDonald’s and Yum Brands’ KFC and Pizza Hut, are still the most popular fast-food brands in China, according to FT Confidential Research’s latest consumer brands survey. Their popularity edged up in the second quarter, compared with our last survey in the fourth quarter of 2015, shaking off the impact of earlier food safety scandals (see chart).The popularity of most Asian-style fast-food brands declined over the same period. Younger respondents showed a clear preference for Western-style fast-food chains, with 56.9 per cent of respondents aged 18 to 24 saying they preferred these. This share was just 44.7 per cent among diners over 35 (see chart).While these Western giants may remain the most popular fast-food options, their market share has eroded in recent years as China’s fast-food sector has become increasingly crowded. KFC’s market share fell to 3.6 per cent last year from 6.4 per cent in 2012, according to Euromonitor. McDonald’s has seen its China market share drop to 2.1 per cent from 2.4 per cent in that time, while that of the top 10 chains has dropped to 8.9 per cent from 11.7 per cent.Indeed, fast-food chains no longer dazzle. A growing number of domestic, full-service restaurant chains are catering to consumers with rising incomes. These chains have brought some of the characteristics associated with the western fast-food chains – standardised products and menus, efficiency and cleanliness – to the Chinese restaurant model with great success. Speed and convenience are no longer sufficient for consumers: China Hotel Association data show that hot-pot restaurant sales grew 15 per cent, while those of Chinese restaurants rose 13 per cent, eclipsing the 5.2 per cent increase among fast-food retailers.So KFC is no longer finger lickin’ good. The Colonel opened his first outlet in China in November 1987, on the south-west corner of Tiananmen Square in Beijing. It now has over 5,000 restaurants across the country, its reach highlighted by the 45.2 per cent of third-tier city residents who said KFC is one of the two fast-food outlets they visited most regularly.But a visit to KFC offers the same, predictable experience, and consumers are turning to aggressively expanding new chains that offer new tastes. Social networks are helping drive this shift. In September last year, 62 per cent of Chinese consumers shared their dining experiences on social networks, according to Weber Shandwick, a far higher share than in Australia (29 per cent), South Korea (42 per cent) and Singapore (40 per cent).We expect rapidly expanding local players, such as Grandma’s Home, a Hangzhou-based chain of Chinese restaurants with over 90 outlets across the country, and Xibei Youmian Cun, which specialises in the cuisine of central China’s Shanxi province, to continue grabbing market share.Fast-food chains have spent years trying to localise their menus – KFC sells egg tarts and chicken with rice – but their homogenised offerings cannot generate the social media buzz that these upstart domestic chains can.Even for these rising chains, the restaurant business is notoriously tough. In Shanghai in the second half of last year more than 60,000 restaurants closed their doors – more than 30 per cent of the city’s total dining establishments. Grandma’s Home has launched restaurants under 16 different brands to try to cater to fickle Chinese consumers.The proliferation of food delivery apps has also eroded the advantage of Western fast-food chains. McDonald’s and KFC once maintained an edge with dedicated couriers and specialised delivery websites. But competition between Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, China’s technology giants, across a range of online-to-offline (O2O) services has spilled over into food delivery. Deliveries to the home or office now account for 8.4 per cent of restaurant sales, more than double that of seven years ago, according to Euromonitor (see chart).O2O food delivery sales increased by an annual average of 77 per cent between 2010 and 2015, with annual revenues of ele.me (backed by Alibaba), Meituan (backed by Tencent) and Baidu food delivery (backed by Baidu) rising to Rmb161.6bn last year from just Rmb9.2bn in 2010, according to iResearch, a Beijing-based research company. These apps have exposed market-leading fast-food chains to competition from hundreds of local restaurants, which have in turn been liberated from the constraints of limited footfall.Multinational fast-food chains have revamped stores and menus to win back Chinese consumers. Both McDonald’s and KFC have expanded their café businesses while Burger King has been renovating stores to provide larger dining areas and expanded its pork and chicken choices to cater to Chinese demand for these meats. McDonald’s took a step further last year with its “Create Your Taste” promotion, allowing consumers to customise their burgers via touch screens. KFC launched a points-based loyalty scheme in December 2015.Although these are all tried-and-tested methods of regaining market share, the core dining experience remains unchanged and, given the fundamental shifts in Chinese consumer tastes, we doubt their efficacy.In response to its struggles, and mounting shareholder pressure, Yum is spinning off KFC’s China operations, announcing the sale of a $460m stake to private equity firm Primavera Capital Group and Alibaba’s Ant Financial Services Group. McDonald’s is seeking bids for franchise rights to its restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea.These strategies will allow headquarters to step back and hand over the reins to local operators. In Yum’s case, the involvement of Ant Financial raises the prospect of a tie-up with Alipay, Alibaba’s ubiquitous mobile payments platform. Theoretically, local operators will be able to respond more quickly and effectively to the challenges posed by local competitors. The Chinese consumer landscape has, however, changed radically since 1987, and with fast-food market growth slowing success will require more than just localisation.FT Confidential Research is an independent research service from the Financial Times, providing in-depth analysis of and statistical insight into China and Southeast Asia.

85;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-09-18T15:11:55Z;McDonald’s faces prospect of EU order to pay $500m in back taxes;Chain under investigation by Brussels over ruling underpinning European structure;"McDonald’s could face an order to pay nearly $500m in back taxes to Luxembourg, according to a Financial Times analysis of an investigation by Brussels into state-supported tax avoidance.Last month the European Commission imposed a €13bn tax penalty on Apple in Ireland, triggering a storm of protest from Washington and corporate America. As the commission steps up its crackdown on so-called sweetheart tax deals, two US multinationals — McDonald’s and Amazon — are potentially next in line.According to an FT review of the commission’s McDonald’s probe, it paid an average tax rate of 1.49 per cent on the $1.8bn profit earned by its Luxembourg-based European headquarters since its 2009 reorganisation.The fast-food chain is under investigation by Brussels over a tax ruling underpinning its European structure, which permitted McDonald’s to pay no corporation tax — either in the US or Luxembourg — on royalty income from restaurant franchises across Europe. Luxembourg and McDonald’s deny any wrongdoing.If the standard Luxembourg tax rate of 29.2 per cent applied to those earnings — following the broad principles the commission applied in the Apple case — McDonald’s would owe the Grand Duchy nearly half a billion dollars.McDonald’s said: “We pay the taxes that are owed and have not received any preferential treatment.” Of the tax paid by its European network, it said: “From 2011-2015 McDonald’s Companies paid more than $2.5bn just in corporate income taxes in the European Union, with an average tax rate approaching 27 per cent.”Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, has yet to take a decision in the McDonald’s case. But she begins a tour of the US this week showing no sign of yielding to the political outcry over the Apple tax penalty by reining in her probes.Apple insists it has paid all the taxes required and that it will pay US tax on some of its offshore cash pile. Tim Cook, chief executive, dismissed the case as “political crap”; the US warned Brussels against acting like a ““supranational tax authority”. Last week, 185 US chief executives said the penalty was a “grievous self-inflicted wound” for Europe’s economy.Multinational companies have come under fire in the past decade for shifting profits between subsidiaries to use the gaps between countries to minimise taxes. US corporations hold an estimated $1.1tn offshore cash pile, according to rating agency Moody’s.The commission’s probes developed a legal framework that casts advantageous tax rulings as state support to a company. This is illegal under EU law if it grants an unfair competitive advantage.The commission launched its investigation into McDonald’s last December, soon after the “Luxleaks” scandal revealed secret tax deals in Luxembourg of hundreds of multinational companies.The commission states that McDonald’s obtained two tax rulings — letters clarifying tax obligations — from Luxembourg in 2009 that ensured that it paid no corporate tax on the profits of McDonald’s Europe Franchising. This entity received royalty payments for know-how and branding from restaurants in Europe and Russia.In the first tax ruling, Luxembourg granted a tax exemption to McDonald’s provided that it demonstrated on a yearly basis that its “profits have been declared and are subject to tax in . . . the US”.McDonald’s returned to request a revision to the ruling, claiming that the US- Luxembourg tax treaty did not require it to prove it actually paid US tax. The Grand Duchy agreed and granted the exemption.When Ms Vestager launched the investigation, she said: “A tax ruling that agrees to McDonald’s paying no tax on their European royalties either in Luxembourg or in the US has to be looked at very carefully under EU state aid rules. The purpose of double taxation treaties between countries is to avoid double taxation — not to justify double non-taxation.”"

Sales rose 23 per cent year-on-year to ¥104.9bn. Japan is the second-biggest market for McDonald’s, after the US. It maintained its full year revenue forecast of ¥220bn, with net income of ¥1bn.The Japan business has had a difficult few years, hurt by falling sales in one of the world’s most challenging consumer markets in part due to a series of food safety scandals. The fast-food chain has been closing or overhauling stores in the past year.The stock has also benefited of late from news that some stores would become features in the wildly popular Pokémon Go smartphone game.
88;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s overhauls its menu ingredients;Cutting preservatives and antibiotics shows the impact of consumer pressure on US food culture;McDonald’s has eliminated controversial ingredients in about half of its menu in a move that highlights how pressure from US consumers is driving changes to the country’s food culture.The $100bn fast-food chain said on Monday it had removed artificial preservatives from its Chicken McNuggets, sausage patties, omelettes, bagel and biscuit breakfast sandwiches and its scrambled eggs.It has swapped high-fructose corn syrup in its buns for sucrose and has met a pledge a year early to remove antibiotics important to human medicine from chickens it uses, amid concerns that these pose health risks. It is also working towards a goal of using only cage-free eggs by 2025, a move it said about 100 companies were following.Consumer demands for healthier food options, fewer artificial ingredients and more transparency in the food chain were until a few years ago met mostly by smaller innovative companies, which had to rely on a limited supply chain.However, spurred on by pressure from social media, those demands have been pushed into the mainstream, forcing McDonald’s and its rivals to make significant changes to the food they offer, and having a knock-on effect on companies such as Tyson in their supply chain.McDonald’s has faced criticism for not moving fast enough given that smaller rivals such as Chick-fil-A had already made similar moves, including banishing the use of all antibiotics in its chickens.But the sheer size of McDonald’s, with its 14,200 US restaurants, means that when it starts making such changes it has a far bigger impact on supply chains. After it introduced apple slices as a side dish in 2004, the group was soon purchasing 10 per cent of the domestic harvest.McDonald’s said that while some of these changes create higher costs, it would not be passing them on to the consumer. It said it was able to offset those costs through savings in its purchases of other food commodities and by using financial hedging tools.As farmers scale up to meet demands of a company as large as McDonald’s, and other companies make similar changes, prices are also expected to come down.Mike Andres, president of McDonald’s USA, said the changes to its supply chain had posed challenges but he was pleased with the progress.“If you look at the food industry today, any time that you’re dealing with this many different suppliers, certainly from the farmers’ perspective, it’s going to be challenging,” he said.Marion Gross, senior vice-president of supply chain management, added that planning and collaboration with suppliers were vital so it could be sure the infrastructure was in place to scale up changes to its ingredients.The moves come at a time when restaurant chains are facing slowing sales and fierce competition from each other and from supermarkets. The inflation gap between eating at home and outside is at its widest in a decade, said Mr Andres. This has produced stiff competition in the form of promotions across restaurants.Grocers from Kroger to Walmart have been beefing up their offerings of fresh and organic produce, and making their deli counters more exciting as they too seek to benefit from consumers’ shift to fresher ingredients.
89;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-07-26T17:00:55Z;McDonald’s new US menu buzz falls flat;Fast-food shares fall as second-quarter sales fall short and industry demand fades;McDonald’s US sales growth slowed in the second quarter, underscoring a fast food industry-wide weakening of demand and raising questions over the longevity of the company’s turnround in its most important market.The chain posted a 1.8 per cent increase in comparable sales at home during the three months to June, despite a weak annual comparison. The rise is slower than the 5.4 per cent rise in the first quarter and missed consensus estimates from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a 3.2 per cent increase.The result cements what has been a tough quarter for casual dining and coffee outlets in the world’s largest economy, with companies including Yum Brands, which owns KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, as well as Starbucks and Dunkin ’ Brands all complaining of weak consumer confidence.It also raises questions about whether the promotional buzz over McDonald’s new menu items, the cornerstone of its turnround, is beginning to wane, while competition to lure customers via discounts has intensified.“Broader spending growth is not translating to same-store sales,” warned Jefferies analyst Andy Barish in an industry report on Monday. He added that “the fierce promotional environment and competition from grocery and convenience stores are making it tougher”.McDonald’s total sales for the quarter dropped 4 per cent to $6.27bn as the company sold a portfolio of company-owned stores to franchisees. The sale, which reduces operating costs, helped increase profit margins in its home market, boosting North American operating profits 10 per cent.Earnings fell 1 per cent to $1.25 a share, hit by $230m in one-off charges partly related to its refranchising plan, and the impact of the strong dollar on its overseas profits. Excluding these costs, earnings increased 13 per cent, the company said. Global comparable sales rose 3.1 per cent.Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, said: “I am confident in our system’s ability to stay the course and execute our turnround plan to achieve our goals.”We don’t expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the UKThe company, which derives 10 per cent of profits from Britain, said the impact from the UK vote to leave the EU was mainly from currency fluctuations.The volatility of sterling since the Brexit vote has prompted McDonald’s to increase the amount it expects foreign exchange movements to hit full-year earnings per share to between 9-11 cents, from 5-7 cents before.The broader implications were limited, however. “We don’t expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the UK,” chief financial officer Kevin Ozan said. “While the long-term impact of Brexit is uncertain, in the near term, the most significant impact on our business will be currency translation.”McDonald’s efforts to reduce the number of its store-owned restaurants could help it circumvent another pressure that the industry is facing: higher wages.It has been the focus of the “Fight for $15” campaign for higher hourly wages across America. McDonald’s has raised wages at its own stores, but as it sells off stores, the onus to raise wages will fall on to the franchisees. It said it did not have plans for a further one-time increase at the moment.Jefferies’ Mr Barish said that across the industry restaurants were facing wage inflation in the mid single-digits on a gross basis.McDonald’s shares were down more than 3 per cent to $123.33 in early New York trading.
90;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-07-12T19:49:17Z;McDonald’s struggles to attract bidders for China franchises;US group would prefer companies with more fast food experience;McDonald’s is struggling to attract the calibre of bidders it envisioned in the sale of its China and Hong Kong franchise, according to people familiar with the situation.With the auction, announced earlier this year, the company is seeking to reduce its direct exposure to China, where food supply scandals have hurt its share price, and to halt capital expenditure in the region.But McDonald’s is also looking to fortify its reputation with the sale, which has moved into a second round of bidding and could fetch $2bn-$3bn, according to people briefed on the deal.Pressure from investors for better quality control in Asia has been reflected in the terms of the deal, said these people, who say some of the conditions, such as keeping management intact for two years and a restriction on taking the franchise public, are onerous.“They aren’t getting the top-tier companies they wanted. They have had to turn down a lot of the [unqualified] bidders,” one person briefed on the auction said.McDonald’s said: “We are making solid progress as we look for long-term strategic partners with local relevance who have complementary skills and expertise.”The shortlist includes some Chinese groups that have shot to fame after aggressive buying sprees but have little to no experience in fast food.Sanpower Group, which has struggled to manage the UK‘s House of Fraser department store after buying it in 2014, said it had made an offer in partnership with state-owned Beijing Tourism Group.State-owned ChemChina, which agreed in February to pay $44bn for Swiss agrochemical company Syngenta and owns a chain of noodle shops in China, was also an early bidder, though it is unclear if the company has made it into the next round.China Cinda Asset Management, a state-owned bad-debt manager, and dairy company Beijing Sanyuan Foods have alsolodged bids, Bloomberg has reported.McDonald’s share price has risen more than 23 per cent over the past 12 months, since Steve Easterbrook took the reins and outlined a turnround effort. The plan for Asia involved one or more local partners taking over the China and Hong Kong franchise of 2,800 outlets for 20 years while paying royalties to McDonald’s.But some investors are uneasy about handing over the franchise and McDonald’s brand reputation to a Chinese group, particularly after a food safety scandal there in 2014 that hit sales.“There has always been a massive disconnect between what is happening here and what the company in the US thinks is going on,” said Ben Cavender, principal at China Market Research, which advises multinational chain restaurants in China.Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW Group, which is affiliated with a federation of unions holding more than $250bn in assets including 0.2 per cent of McDonald's, wrote a letter to the company in March expressing concern about the idea of an master franchising strategy for Asia.CtW said the royalties McDonald’s receives from the owner of its Latin America franchise, Arcos Dorados, have declined 23 per cent over the past two years.“Our concern is that if McDonald’s attempts to replicate the master franchisee model it has established with Arcos Dorados in other regions, it will replicate the poor performance and absent accountability currently plaguing that company,” Mr Waizenegger wrote.
91;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-07-01T10:01:59Z;Push for higher wages squeezes US corporate profits;McDonald’s and Walmart caught between workers’ demands and investor concern;The entrance to McDonald’s Chicago headquarters was transformed into a tent community in May when Fight for $15 campaigners camped out in protest at low wages at its shareholder meeting.But inside the sprawling, red-brick complex in the Oak Brook suburb, the representative of a shareholder of the world’s largest fast-food chain saw matters differently.“At last year’s meeting McDonald’s crowed about artificially increasing the minimum wage for some of its workers. Well look, the barbarians are back at the gate demanding more,” said Justin Danhof referring to McDonald’s entry-level wage increase to $10 an hour at its company-owned restaurants.As general counsel for the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think-tank, Mr Danhof was speaking on behalf of Amy Ridenour, his boss and McDonald’s shareholder. “They didn’t see your concession as a victory for workers. They saw it as a sign of weakness that they could exploit and are trying to right now,” he added, his voice rising in indignation.Mr Danhof’s remarks and the Fight for $15 campaign represent polar opposite views with which many US companies are having to grapple. As US workers lobby for higher wages and some politicians demand that America is given a raise, investors are watching corporate profits warily. Following a period of record profits as a share of the economy, margins are being whittled away.One key measure of non-financial companies’ collective profit margins — the net operating surplus as a share of net value added — has fallen to 19.8 per cent, the lowest since the end of 2009, and well down on the peak of 23 per cent in the second quarter of 2013, according to JPMorgan Chase analysis.Michael Feroli, the bank’s chief US economist, said the trend may have further to go, with workers’ share of economic output remaining low looking back in history. “There is room for some further margin compression,” he argued. “It is a pretty big issue.”Driving the trend is rising wages, which are coming at a time of poor productivity growth in the private sector. Unit labour costs, which measure how much companies need to pay their staff to deliver a unit of output, rose 3 per cent in the 12 months ended in the first quarter of 2016. Business output prices rose only 1.2 per cent in the same period, suggesting companies struggled to hold on to their margins.The Federal Reserve has suggested this trend has further to go. With the Brexit vote roiling global markets, the US central bank is even less likely to be lifting short-term interest rates in the coming months, a dovish stance that could give further room for wage demands.Average hourly earnings rose 2.5 per cent in May on the same month a year earlier — still well below the growth rates of more than 3 per cent before unemployment hit 10 per cent during the recession. The Atlanta Fed’s wage tracker, which focuses on people in continuous employment, is running at a much quicker pace of 3.5 per cent.Companies are experiencing further pressure because of rising minimum wages. While the federal minimum wage has remained stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009, 15 states mandated increases in their minimums at the start of 2016. California, the biggest state by population and economic size, introduced a law in April that will boost its minimum wage gradually from $10 to $15 an hour by 2022. New York has introduced rules that will boost its minimum to $15 an hour.Companies ranging from Walmart and McDonald’s to Costco and TJ Maxx have felt sufficient pressure to increase their entry-level wages voluntarily. Following growing customer complaints about store cleanliness and service, Walmart, America’s largest private-sector employer, is spending $2.7bn on increasing wages and training over a two-year period.The company estimates that this spending, combined with increased investments in store improvements and ecommerce, will translate into higher profits in three years, as more motivated staff encourage consumers to spend more in their stores thanks to a better service and improved shopping environment.The trend towards higher wages comes as Walmart’s founding family, worth a net worth $130bn according to Forbes, has been a target in the debate over inequality, which has gained traction in this presidential election year. It has also highlighted the extraordinary wealth of one family while many of its staff struggle to make ends meet.Nita Fischer, a single mother, says she was coerced into leaving her Walmart job paying $10.14 an hour when she was pregnant and to reapply after three months. She said she is earning $9 an hour and is reliant on the US government to pay her $294 a month in food stamps — which are spent at Walmart.“I do want something to change,” she said. “Walmart is treating some people like dirt.”Walmart said its store “worked with Ms Fischer during her pregnancy to provide appropriate accommodations, including providing her with light duty work. Unfortunately she didn’t always work all of the hours she was scheduled, causing extra work for the other associates in her store.”The Conference Board, a think-tank, has predicted further increases in wage growth to 3-3.5 per cent in the coming years as the working-age population stagnates and unemployment hovers comfortably below 5 per cent. Lines of work that face significant labour shortages include occupational therapists, nurses, plant operators and machinists, while the states with the tightest labour markets include Texas and Colorado.Craig Donohue, executive chairman of Options Clearing Corp, a financial services company, also expected upward pressure on salaries in his sector, particularly in areas such as enterprise risk management. OCC has hired more than 100 people in the past 18 months and plans to hire up to 100 more.“There’s definitely been a change to competition for candidates . . . as everyone is looking for people with these backgrounds,” Mr Donohue said. “Given we’re a financial services sector firm, we’re very attentive to that.”Each 100 basis point acceleration in US labour costs above 3 per cent growth drags on earnings across the S&P 500 by 0.7 per cent, according to Goldman Sachs. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector may prove most vulnerable to margin compression because they are labour-intensive and may not be able to sharply lift prices.Revenue generated by each employee in the consumer discretionary sector is $245,000 as opposed to the $432,000 earned across companies in the S&P 500 index, according to analysis from JPMorgan. Restaurant chains, retailers and leisure businesses are the most sensitive to rising labour costs across the sector. Manufacturing, airlines and healthcare services companies are also vulnerable to higher labour costs.This was highlighted this week when workers in the home healthcare sector were handed a victory, when a court upheld a law requiring the payment of overtime.Fight for $15 is showing no signs of letting up on the pressure on McDonald’s and US companies across the country. George McCray, 36, a McDonald’s cashier in Chicago, has joined the campaign as he struggles to feed his family of six and also relies on food stamps.“Technically there’s three of us with jobs but we don’t make a consistent enough amount of money to survive as a family,” Mr McCray said. He feels his hours have fallen since he joined the campaign. “[Colleagues] feel the same way as me, but I’m not afraid to go out there on the front line.”When it comes to jobs in the US, the good news is that there are more available now. The bad news for some employers is that there are not enough people with the skills to fill those positions. That means upward pressure on salaries, writes Lindsay Whipp.“As unemployment rates fall, the availability of labour — particularly skilled — will become a significant challenge for the middle market,” says Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, which provides tax, audit and consulting services for medium-sized companies.“We believe incentive compensation will become a significant factor in firms’ ability to not only attract and retain skilled workers, but to grow revenue overall.”But it also means training, if it is available.In Chicago, Advocate Health Care, one of the largest healthcare providers in the Midwest, and JPMorgan have teamed up to create the Healthcare Workforce Collaborative, a programme to help train potential employees to fill the estimated 14,000 middle-skilled job openings a year in the sector to the end of 2019. The project aims to prepare more than 1,000 participants from parts of the city plagued with unemployment or underemployment to become medical assistants, home health support workers and technicians.“There is a limited talent pool for certain hard-to-fill positions, and it can take months to fill these openings with qualified, experienced candidates,” says Kevin Brady, chief human resources officer for Advocate Health Care.The UK is experiencing a similar skills gap. A survey published this year by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that British companies are facing the biggest difficulty finding skilled workers in a decade.

Culinary history has left burger, fries and soda behind. How come the company’s shares are not getting the message?They were tumbling at the turn of the century, as a new idea — preparing food to order — proved cumbersome for the fast-food specialist. The company closed old stores, stopped adding new ones and rejigged the menu. It sold more breakfast food and coffee. And the stock quadrupled. The sales stalled again in 2011. Had avocados and quinoa won at last? No. A new boss and a simplified menu got sales going again, sparking a sharp rally in the latter half of last year. The stock has whipped the S&P over the long run.The meal has been less happy for investors in the company’s publicly traded Japanese affiliate. Sales at McDonald’s Holdings Japan have fallen in each of the last seven years. The rate of decline has been steepest in the last year or two, because of food quality scandals. A nascent recovery is under way, but net profit margins — which have never been very good — will be razor thin this year after going negative in the last two.How much of this is down to Japan’s greying demographics and chronic deflation, and how much is failure to emulate the agility of its protean parent? Hard to say. But for the few remaining Japan bulls the shares merit a look. Valuation is one reason. The unit’s enterprise value is twice its sales against five times for the parent. Its turnround plan follows the parent’s successful template: menu tweaks, lower prices and sprucing up shops while closing underperforming ones.McDonald’s Japan has nearly 3,000 restaurants, 8 per cent of the global total. Only the US is a larger national market. The parent company has a nearly 50 per cent equity stake in Japan and has said it might reduce this, which could hurt the shares. But McDonald’s will not want to do so while the smaller company’s value is depressed and whether it sells or not it will not want to see the brand wither in such a crucial market. McDonald's — a proven winner across the decades — has good reason to support the Japanese turnround.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
93;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Brussels serves up McDonald’s secret ex­changes with Grand Duchy;Commission probe shines spotlight on sweetheart tax arrangements;McDonald's proposition was an audacious one to put to a taxman: there is “no requirement” for royalties from European franchises to be taxed anywhere in the world. Even more remarkably, Luxembourg accepted it, according to documents released from an EU probe.The disclosure of McDonald’s secret exchanges with the Grand Duchy, made public on Tuesday by the European Commission, provides a glimpse into the kind of tax treaty arbitrage that has helped US multinationals stash away more than $2tn of untaxed profits since the 1990s.The commission investigation into McDonald’s arrangements with Luxembourg is emerging as an important legal test case for Europe and the US. The probe turns on whether the Grand Duchy failed to apply its own tax laws and thereby supported the restaurant chain with illegal state aid.While the commission has targeted a series of alleged sweetheart tax deals in Europe — including for Apple, Amazon and Starbucks — the charges in the McDonald's case are its first attempt to tackle a country for failing to check that a US multinational was properly taxed in the US.The probe strikes at the heart of the so-called “check-the-box” tax planning, where legal blind spots in international double-taxation treaties are used by some US multinationals to route profits to tax havens via “disregarded entities”. The US administration has harshly criticised the commission for unfairly targeting American companies that will eventually repatriate their profits.The commission states that McDonald’s obtained two tax rulings — letters clarifying tax obligations — from Luxembourg in 2009 that ensured that it paid no corporate tax on the profits of McDonald’s Europe Franchising, which were more than €250m in 2013. This entity received royalty payments for know-how and branding from restaurants in Europe and Russia. In the first tax ruling, Luxembourg granted a tax exemption to McDonald’s provided that it demonstrated on a yearly basis that its “profits have been declared and are subject to tax in . . . the US”.However, McDonald’s returned to request a revision to the ruling, claiming that the US-Luxembourg tax treaty allowed for exemptions on income that “may” be taxed in the US. “There is . . . no requirement that the other contracting state (US) effectively taxes this income,” an adviser to McDonald’s wrote.This written request was accepted by the Grand Duchy. It is a decision that the commission argues amounts to a “misapplication” of its tax treaty with the US and unlawful state aid. When launching the probe in December Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, said: “The purpose of double taxation treaties between countries is to avoid double taxation — not to justify double non-taxation.”127%Profits reported by US companies in Luxembourg as proportion of its GDP in 2010 — against 18% in 2004The cases are highly contentious. Luc De Broe, a tax litigation partner at Laga, warned that the commission was in danger of overreaching to become Europe’s “tax police”. The McDonald’s case rested on a tax treaty interpretation “for which only a Luxembourgish tax judge would be competent”, he added. Brussels has the power to force Luxembourg to recover unpaid taxes. Luxembourg rejects the accusation that it illegally favoured McDonald’s. The restaurant group also denies any wrongdoing.US multinationals have made increasing use of Luxembourg as a low-tax bridgehead into Europe. The profits reported by US companies in Luxembourg rose from 18 per cent of its gross domestic product in 2004 to 127 per cent in 2010. Much of this profit has not been repatriated to the US, contributing to more than $2tn in lightly taxed foreign earnings being held outside the US.While some of these earnings have been reinvested, Moody’s, the rating agency, has estimated there is $1.2tn cash in the stash of profits held overseas. The money will be taxed when it is eventually brought back to the US, but companies are delaying its return in the hope of a rate cut, as part of wider tax reform. US politicians, such as Kevin Brady, who chairs the House ways and means committee, have attacked the commission’s investigations as “a money grab targeted on US companies”.
94;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-04-26T11:18:03Z;McDonald’s snags some cheap euros;;US-based fast food chain McDonald’s is selling euro-denominated bonds today, becoming the latest company to take advantage of knock-down borrowing costs after the European Central Bank announced plans to start buying corporate bonds this summer.McDonald’s is selling three benchmark bonds with maturities of four, seven and 12 years. The total amount of debt on offer is €2.5bn, writes Gavin Jackson.The three bonds are set to yield about 0.51 per cent, 1.06 per cent and 1.89 per cent in order of maturity. Order books breached €14bn.Demand for euro-denominated corporate debt has been strong after the ECB said in March that it would extend its quantitative easing program to include these securities. Investors have sought to jump in first, bringing interest rates down and tempting more companies into the market.After clarification this month by the ECB that the corporate bond buying would extend to companies whose parent was not incorporated in the eurozone, there has been speculation that this would help along a resurgence in the market for US-based companies selling euro debt.US issues in the euro market are known as reverse yankees. Last year, these types of borrowers were the biggest by value in the euro-denominated market.
95;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Menu change revives McDonald’s US sales;Turnround under Steve Easterbrook is working but fast-food chain is still not reaching millennials;McDonald’s got a boost this week when @coleson, a 20-year-old YouTube celebrity with more than a million subscribers and nearly 35,000 Twitter followers, tweeted that “McDonald’s all-day breakfast was the best thing to ever happen”.He has lots of company. The extension of the breakfast menu has powered a revival for the 61-year-old company. US comparable sales rose 5.4 per cent per cent in the first three months of 2016 — marking the third quarter in a row of improvements.The company on Friday said net income for the quarter jumped 35 per cent to $1.1bn, even though worldwide sales fell 1 per cent to $5.9bn.“I’m pleased to report that our turnround is taking hold,” said Steve Easterbrook, chief executive.After years of watching McDonald’s lose ground to fast casual chains such as Panera and Shake Shack, investors have welcomed the resurgence, pushing up the share price to trade around all-time highs above $125.Many analysts are enthusiastic about Mr Easterbrook, who won the top post last January after reigniting McDonald’s sales in the UK several years ago.He has promised to revive sales at the world’s largest fast-food chain by simplifying the organisational structure and the menu. It is also using better-quality ingredients and trying to attract more young customers to its 36,000 restaurants.“This one’s on him. Certainly things were in works before [he] arrived, but he brought a new sense of urgency, so I give him a lot of credit,” says RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar.“The all-day breakfast has been a hit and the important thing is that they managed to bring this . . . from a test phase to market in six months, which shows it’s more nimble,” he added.Under Mr Easterbrook, the menu improvements have been accompanied by plans to cut $500m in annual costs by 2017. The company is also finding franchisees to open new restaurants in Asia and take over 4,000 of the restaurants it owns. Bringing the ranks of company-owned restaurants down to 5 per cent will cut capital expenditure and operating costs, while pushing up royalty income.But McDonald’s may not be out of the woods yet in its vital home market. Andy Barish, an analyst at Jefferies, says much of the sales improvement in the US has been driven by heavy spending on advertising.Mr Barish says that McDonald’s is mostly benefiting from overall growth in the restaurant sector. “Improvements are not coming at the expense of other US brands . . .[McDonald’s] still has relevancy issues with millennials,” he says.Sales at fast casual restaurants such as Panera have grown more than 10 per cent annually over the past five years to $23.7bn in 2015, according to Euromonitor. The sector has benefited from young adults in their twenties, who are prepared to spend far more eating out than older customers, economists say.Fast food sales have increased between 2-4 per cent annually over the same period, though the market size is far bigger at $204.5bn.But analysts wonder if the higher costs associated with this effort will end up undercutting one of the chain’s main selling points, its relatively low prices.McDonald’s is trying to win more business from younger customers by featuring food that is perceived as healthier and more natural. The chain has shifted to eggs from cage-free hens, chickens that have not been injected with antibiotics used in humans, and milk from cows that have not been treated with artificial growth hormones. It also buys a “portion” of its beef from “verified sustainable sources”.“There are a lot of customers who go there because they can get a fair amount of food there pretty fast and that’s the primary rationale,” Mr Barish says. “Can they move more premium [items], where higher-quality ingredients are almost the price of entry? I have my doubts on that.”The chain is seeking to address those concerns with the McPick value menu where two items cost $5.Mr Easterbrook insists the breakfast revival is just the start. Traffic in stores rose in the first quarter after three years of declines, the company said.“All-day breakfast has clearly been a very strong catalyst for momentum and we’re in a nice situation now where we’re challenging how much more we can do,” Mr Easterbrook said on Friday. “[In terms of] operational improvement, I’d celebrate that as much as the all-day breakfast. I can’t emphasise enough how important it is to get the nuts and bolts right.”
96;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s hit by French tax bill;US fast-food chain could face a demand for up to €300m following European Commission investigation;McDonald’s France has been sent a bill for alleged unpaid taxes, as part of a crackdown by French authorities on multinational companies that shift their profits abroad.According to people familiar with the case, the French finance ministry has taken issue with the amount of money McDonald’s France paid to a Luxembourg-based affiliate for services — including its use of the fast-food restaurant brand name — which helped to reduce McDonald’s taxable profits in the country.McDonald’s France declined to comment on reports of the bill, which some media reports have suggested could be as high as €300m — including €100m in fines.Instead, the company said in statement: “McDonald’s is one of the biggest taxpayers in France and we are proud of it.” It added that McDonald’s and its franchises had paid €1.2bn in taxes since 2009, invested €1bn and created more than 15,000 jobs in France.France’s finance ministry declined to comment on the matter, pointing out that it was governed by tax secrecy rules.News of the tax bill, first reported by French business magazine L’Expansion, follows a European Commission investigation into a deal that McDonald’s struck with tax authorities in Luxembourg.In December, the commission accused Luxembourg of establishing a tax scheme for McDonald’s that allows the US fast-food group to pay no tax on its European royalties, either in the US or in the Grand Duchy.Margrethe Vestager, competition commissioner, said at the time that Luxembourg had acted against the spirit of a US-Luxembourg double taxation treaty.“A tax ruling that agrees to McDonald’s paying no tax on their European royalties either in Luxembourg or in the US has to be looked at very carefully under EU state aid rules,” she said. “The purpose of double taxation treaties between countries is to avoid double taxation — not to justify double non-taxation.”As the G20 pledges to crack down on multinational tax avoidance, the FT looks at the issues surrounding corporate taxation and why governments are willing to help companies reduce their tax burdenFrance’s move against McDonald’s comes as the EU continues a broader crackdown against aggressive corporate tax planning. Brussels issued its first verdicts in tax cases in October, ordering Luxembourg and the Netherlands to claw back tens of millions of euros of underpaid tax from Italian carmaker Fiat and US coffee shop chain Starbucks.A report published last year entitled “Unhappy Meal” also claimed that McDonald’s and its subsidiaries had undertaken an aggressive European restructuring in 2009 that “led to the avoidance of significant amounts of tax across the continent”.This report, written by several trade unions and the charity War on Want, claimed that the restructuring could have meant the French government missed out on up to €713m in taxes between 2009 and 2013.France now represents a big market for McDonald’s — thanks to the rise in popularity of fast food in the country over the past few decades. According to its website, the French business had outlets at more than 1,000 locations in the country in 2014, more than in the UK.Sending it a tax bill appears to be part of a bigger push by the national government to scrutinise the tax practices of multinationals. In February, the country’s Socialist government ruled out the possibility of a tax deal with Google — only days after the US search engine struck a £130m settlement with the UK government over back taxes.McDonald’s is one of the biggest taxpayers in France and we are proud of itMichel Sapin, finance minister, said at the time that the bill Google would eventually have to pay in France would be “way bigger” than the amount it had settled with UK authorities.At a European level, multinational companies have also been facing more scrutiny on tax — especially since the leak of the so-called Panama Papers, which reveal how a Panamanian law firm has set up offshore funds to help companies and individuals hide their wealth.This month, Lord Hill, EU commissioner for financial services, unveiled a set of draft rules that would compel companies with global revenues of more than €750m per year to provide a public country-by-country breakdown of key financial information — claiming the move would expose complex corporate arrangements intended to avoid tax.However, these measures need approval from the European parliament and national governments to become law, a requirement that will almost certainly mean months of debate on amendments.
97;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;US workers on nationwide strike to raise minimum wage;Fast-food and healthcare workers picket McDonald’s in 320 cities;"Pickets outside McDonald’s restaurants in 320 US cities on Thursday were expected to draw tens of thousands of fast-food employees, healthcare staff and other workers as momentum to raise the minimum wage gathers pace across the world’s largest economy.Rising inequality has become a central topic in the US presidential primaries amid growing concern that lower-income families are not benefiting from the US recovery, at a time when companies are raising executives’ salaries, increasing dividends to shareholders and reporting buoyant profit margins.A protest was planned outside the sold-out New York State Republican gala dinner on Thursday evening, which cost $1,000 a seat.The focus of the nationwide strike was on McDonald’s, one of the country’s largest private sector employers, which the Fight for $15 campaign said was a “symbol of everything that is wrong with the economy”.Kendall Fells, national organising director for Fight for $15, said that due to the fast-food chain’s size, its business practices set a precedent for other companies, influencing pay and the treatment of employees.McDonald’s, which last year pledged to raise its minimum wage to $10 an hour by the end of 2016, said in a statement that it invested in its employees’ futures, helping staff earn high school diplomas and get work towards earning college degrees.Angel Mitchell, 26, who works at a McDonald’s on the south-east side of Chicago and is on strike, said she had not been offered any of these opportunities.She argued that if McDonald’s paid more she would not need food stamps — she receives $180 a month.For many people, working at McDonald’s was not a temporary job while at college, she added: “The reality of our society in America and everywhere else in this world is that adults are making careers out of this; women are taking care of children and families on this.”Some measures of wage growth are starting to stir. The Federal Reserve’s so-called Beige Book survey on Wednesday reported that the firming labour market is starting to deliver higher wages in nearly every region of the country.Average hourly earnings growth is approaching its quickest pace in five years, as unemployment hovers at half its crisis-era levels. While Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has sounded cautious about the wage gains, for some companies the topic has risen rapidly up the boardroom agenda.Big companies including Costco, Target and Walmart — whose founding Walton family has amassed a $149bn fortune — have lifted entry-level wages, as have several states and municipalities. Last year 11 states and the District of Columbia lifted minimum wages, while 11 other states increased them via regular indexation.California and New York are planning to boost wage floors to $15 an hour, well ahead of the Federal minimum of $7.25. Analysis from Goldman Sachs this week estimated that labour costs as a share of S&P 500 companies’ revenues rose to 9.8 per cent last year compared with 9.1 per cent in 2014, and were set to jump further.“A healthy labour market combined with a dovish Fed and political focus should drive continued acceleration in the trend of higher labour costs,” said analysts led by Ben Snider at Goldman. “Labour-intensive sectors with low margins are the most vulnerable”, including consumer discretionary and industrial companies, they said.Concerns about growing inequality are widespread across developed economies, and experts will be closelywatching the UK, which this month introduced the biggest raise in the minimum wage in its history — reaching £9 an hour by 2020.Thursday’s pickets followed a strike on Wednesday by nearly 40,000 employees of Verizon, the US telecoms group, which entered a second day. There was support from overseas, with workers from McDonald’s and Disneyland in Paris also going on strike, according to Fight for $15."

Its stores in China and Korea account for 7.8 per cent of McDonald’s outlets worldwide.RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar, said it was a “smart strategy” to work with local partners in Asia, pointing to similar moves by companies such as 3G-owned Restaurant Brands International’s Burger King.“[It’s a] situation where they can find a large private equity or other franchising company in those regions and effectively put a lot of capital responsibility on to those guys [with] sub-franchising rights,” he said. “Burger King has had great success with this.”The expansion plans come as China — where McDonald’s has already said it plans to open 250 restaurants this year — becomes increasingly competitive in the fast-food market with changing consumer tastes, rising labour costs and higher rents, and slower economic growth. Along with rival Yum Brands, which owns and operates the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell franchises, sales suffered following a meat mislabelling crisis in 2014 that also affected its Japanese operations.“These actions build on our turnaround efforts and will advance local ownership, enable faster decision-making and achieve restaurant growth,” said Steve Easterbrook, chief executive of McDonald’s, in a statement on Thursday.The expansion in China also comes amid big changes at Yum, which is spinning off its Chinese operations, and is in talks with KKR to acquire a minority stake.McDonald’s, which is based in Oak Brook, Illinois, is undergoing a transformation led by Mr Easterbrook. In the US, he is steering the company back to sales growth in its all-important home market after a tough few years losing out to younger companies with healthier menus.Abroad, in what it calls its “high-growth markets” including China, Korea and Russia, McDonald’s is looking to expand with the aid of local partners, as part of a broader plan to reduce the number of restaurants it owns and operates. Last year it said it had made an agreement with a local partner to expand in western Siberia.It has also said it is looking for partners in Japan, where half of the company’s shares are listed, and Taiwan.The headway that McDonald’s has been making in reversing losses at home with simpler menus, all-day breakfasts and healthier offerings has helped push the company’s stock to record highs.However, McDonald’s is not without its controversy. The European Commission has accused Luxembourg of establishing a tax scheme for the company, allowing it to pay no tax on European royalties. And in Brazil federal prosecutors have launched an investigation into alleged violations of labour, tax and franchise laws.
99;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2016-03-04T01:35:19Z;McDonald’s under investigation by Brazilian federal prosecutors;Action follows complaints from union over alleged violations of labour, tax and franchise laws;Brazilian federal prosecutors have opened a formal investigation into McDonald’s following complaints from one of the country’s biggest unions over alleged violations of labour, tax and franchise laws. According to documents confirmed by the prosecutors’ office in São Paulo on Thursday, the inquiry launched on Monday focuses on McDonald’s as well as Arcos Dorados, its main operator in Latin America, which prosecutors say may have also violated competition laws. UGT, the Brazilian labour federation whose petition sparked the investigation, has long been at war with the fast-food chain in the country, accusing it in the past of mistreating workers and paying staff less than the minimum wage.Speaking for McDonald’s, Arcos Dorados has vehemently denied those claims in the past. In August last year, Brazil’s Senate held a hearing where unions, alongside workers and politicians, made accusations against the company over workers’ rights and its tax practices. Meanwhile, McDonald’s has faced growing scrutiny worldwide for allegations over workers’ rights and health and safety, as well as tax evasion in Europe.Marcos Gomes Corrêa, the prosecutor who launched this week’s investigation in Brazil, said he was looking into claims by UGT that Arcos Dorados was a “frequent infringer” of national labour legislation. At the Senate hearing in August, unions said McDonald’s workers were not paid for extra hours, adding that workers in the kitchen also did not use protective gear, causing them to suffer burns. As soon as we receive notification, we will present the pertinent information and clarification to the [federal prosecutors]Mr Gomes Corrêa said he was also investigating claims by UGT that Arcos Dorados created specific corporate structures to lower its tax bill. In response to the investigation, Arcos Dorados said it had not officially been notified of the issue. “As soon as we receive notification, we will present the pertinent information and clarification to the [federal prosecutors],” it said, adding: “The company provides every assurance that it complies with all the laws in all of the markets in which it does business.” Once Brazilian prosecutors have completed their investigation, they would decide whether to drop the case or file a civil lawsuit over the claims, the prosecutors’ office said.

Italy’s distinctive coffee culture is based around independent cafés and bars, which account for nearly 90 per cent of the market, according to Euromonitor.“The dream of the company always has been to sometime complete the circle and open in Italy, but we haven’t been ready,” said Mr Schultz in a statement on Sunday. His own experiences in Italian coffee bars inspired the Starbucks coffee shop concept, he explained.Starbucks is working with Percassi, the company that partnered with Benetton for 30 years, brought Zara to the Italian market and has worked with a string of American brands including Nike, Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger. It also runs Kiko, a make-up company.Antonio Percassi, the company’s founder and president, acknowledged the tricky nature of opening a coffee chain in his home market.“We know that we are going to face a unique challenge with the opening of the first Starbucks store in Italy, the country of coffee, and we are confident that Italian people are ready to live the Starbucks experience, as already occurs in many other markets,” Mr Percassi said.Starbucks said that “espresso will clearly be star of the show” in Italy, but that it had not yet settled the menu. “We plan to tailor our offerings to the Italian customer in a way that will demonstrate the respect and learning we’ve acquired” in Italy, a spokeswoman said.We plan to tailor our offerings to the Italian customer in a way that will demonstrate the respect and learning we’ve acquiredStarbucks’ move comes on the tail of another US chain attempting to bring an American interpretation of classic Italian fare to the market. Last October Domino’s Pizza announced its intention to open in Italy.As with Starbucks, Dominos emphasised that its pizzas would be customised to fit with Italian sensibilities, with locally-sourced ingredients and promising “ultimately a local pizza menu”. Its outlets will be operated by a local master franchiser.Starbucks, which is planning about 1,800 net store openings globally in fiscal 2016, has 21,000 coffee shops across the world. However, there have been bumps on the way, and it has not met with success in every market. In 2008 it closed most of its stores in Australia, leaving just 25.Italy is one of the largest consumers of coffee in the EU, which in itself is the largest importer of coffee beans in the world, but being one of the most competitive means Starbucks has a big job on its hands.

It has also reorganised its corporate structure so decisions can be made more swiftly.Total revenue dropped 4 per cent to $6.34bn in the three months ended December as the stronger dollar ate into overseas sales. Excluding currency swings, sales rose 5 per cent. Operating profit rose 7 per cent to $1.88bn, while net income rose 10 per cent to $1.21bn, or $1.31 a share.Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, said the company would not shift its turnround plan into a longer-term growth plan until around the middle of 2016, or after McDonald’s has shown a few more quarters of recovery.“The idea of outperforming is something we want to maintain. [All-day breakfasts] exceeded launch expectations and we expect it to settle down, so we’re working on a number of initiatives to follow-up. We don’t want it to be a single-item turnaround plan,” Mr Easterbrook said.This includes improving the quality of ingredients, revamping some its core menu items and building out its digital strategy — its app has garnered 7m downloads since the end of the third quarter.In the US, operating profit jumped 30 per cent. The company drew back customers with regional menu items such as mozzarella sticks, which, following success in the New York area, are being rolled out nationwide. It cited the milder weather as an additional helping hand in increasing traffic, while the sale of a property also pushed up profit.Although Japan recorded its best sales in four years, the company admits sales remain weak there after several supply-chain scandals. It is looking for a “strategic investor” to buy a portion of its 49.9 per cent stake in McDonald’s Japan.McDonald’s shares have outperformed the S&P 500 during the past year, rising 35 per cent compared with a 7.5 per cent drop for the broader market. Shares were up 1.3 per cent at $119.88 on Monday.McDonald’s US improvement comes amid trouble at smaller fast-food burrito chain Chipotle, which, along with other younger companies, had been winning market share from its older rivals thanks to its image of offering healthier fare. However, several food-safety scandals have ripped into demand and investor confidence.Overseas, McDonald’s increased sales in “lead” markets by 4.2 per cent, thanks to robust performances in the UK and Australia, while higher margins pushed up operating profit 8 per cent on a constant-currency basis. However, the company highlighted the French market as being particularly difficult, blaming its broader economic underperformance.In high-growth markets such as China — where it plans to open 250 restaurants this year — and Russia, sales rose 3 per cent, while operating income jumped 45 per cent excluding the impact of the strong dollar.McDonald’s said it was on track to return about $30bn to shareholders in share buybacks and dividends by the end of 2016 in a three-year plan. In the past two years it has returned $15.8bn. It said it would achieve the “vast majority” of its plan to reduce annual costs by $500m by the end of 2017.For the full year, sales dropped 7 per cent to $25.4bn, while net income fell 5 per cent to $4.53bn.

Can it last? Mr Easterbrook reckons so and, for now, investors believe him.
103;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Politically correct McDonald’s is on a roll;The burger chain is adjusting to more modern marketing methods;Last year was a tough one for many of the world’s biggest brands. Familiar fare ranging from presidential candidates named Bush to Kraft American cheese slices fell out of favour. Spicier offerings such as Sriracha hot sauce and Donald Trump were all the rage.But, as the new year arrived, one member of the US corporate elite was demonstrating that it is possible for a well-known — and frequently disparaged — brand name to regain its marketing mojo in fairly short order.McDonald’s is on a stock market roll, months after it appeared to be the Fortune 500 equivalent of toast. Shares in the restaurant chain have rallied by roughly a third since their lows in January 2015, when the company named Steve Easterbrook to replace Don Thompson as chief executive. McDonald’s same-store sales in the US rose — 0.9 per cent — in the third quarter for the first time in a couple of years.When Mr Easterbrook, a 48-year-old native of Watford in England, grabbed the company reins, it was easy to see McDonald’s as being on the wrong side of history. Younger consumers are opting for healthier food and new burger chains, such as New York celebrity chef Danny Meyer’s Shake Shack, have appeared on the scene to offer consumers chopped meat that actually tastes like something that came from a cow.What fascinates me about Mr Easterbrook is that he responded to these travails with the corporate equivalent of political correctness. He didn’t argue with his company’s critics or mock the millennials. He tried to engage them. Tieless and with the straightest of C-suite faces, Mr Easterbrook appeared on video to describe McDonald’s as a “modern progressive burger company” that would “be more progressive around our social purpose in order to deepen our relationships with communities on the issues that matter to them”.Gone are the days when advertisers could control their ‘narrative’ with 30-second TV commercialsGranted, this pronouncement was kind of vague. But so was Ronald Reagan’s verdict that it was “morning in America again” or Barack Obama’s “yes, we can” slogan. The key point is that as a marketer, Mr Easterbrook opted to go with the new-age sociopolitical flow. McDonald’s pledged that by 2017 its US restaurants would only use chickens that are “not raised with antibiotics important in human medicine”. In Germany, it trotted out its first 100 per cent organic beef burger, using meat sourced from farms that eschew synthetic chemical fertilisers and pesticides.To be sure, many of his innovations have been little more than variations on the old business axiom that holds the customer is always right. Mr Easterbrook is giving the people what they want, such as all-day breakfast in the US, a splendid innovation in the view of this reporter, who has not willingly eaten a McDonald’s burger since the days when colour television still seemed novel, but doesn’t mind an Egg McMuffin or a cup of McDonald’s coffee at a pinch (they do keep it hot, don’t they?).What’s new is that Mr Easterbrook is adjusting to the new communications landscape facing even the wealthiest corporations and the most well funded politicians. Long gone are the days when leading advertisers could control their “narrative” by bombarding the public with 30-second television commercials. Instead, they have to figure out ways to join the “national conversation”, as it is known in the advertising game.The order of the day is to lead from behind, as it were, and jump into the dialogue unfolding on social media when it suits a marketer’s purposes. A well-timed press release or tweet in this context can be just as meaningful as the most artful advertisement. Indeed, Mr Easterbrook’s “modern progressive burger company” formulation recalls one of the great marketing campaigns in McDonald’s history. Devised by Keith Reinhard, most recently of the DDB advertising agency, it was meant to assure the growing number of working mothers in the US of the 1970s that it was OK to take their kids out for a fast-food meal. “You deserve a break today,” went the celebrated jingle.By casting himself as a progressive burger flipper, Mr Easterbrook is also taking a page out of the playbook of one of today’s most successful consumer companies: Starbucks. When it comes to corporate do-gooders, there is no one quite like its chief executive, Howard Schultz. So political has his persona become that it has seemed at times as if he were auditioning for a role as a stunt double for Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermont senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination.The apotheosis came last year when Mr Schultz told his employees to write the words “race together” on beverages in the hope of stimulating conversations on US race relations. The Twitterati responded with derision, which was understandable, because sometimes people go to Starbucks for the coffee.Lost in all the online snark was the fact that Mr Schultz’s share price was also climbing rapidly. His shares have been trading recently around 50 per cent above their levels at the start of last year. Maybe that’s just a coincidence. But maybe it’s more than that. Maybe executives such as Mr Schultz and Mr Easterbrook are showing us all how successful capitalists behave nowadays.gary.silverman@ft.com
104;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;EU launches probe into McDonald’s tax deal with Luxembourg;Investigation focuses on payment of royalties from franchisees in Europe;The European Commission has accused Luxembourg of establishing a tax scheme for McDonald’s that allows the US fast-food group to pay no tax on its European royalties, either in the US or in the Grand Duchy.Margrethe Vestager, competition commissioner, launched a formal probe into the arrangement on Thursday and said Luxembourg had acted against the spirit of a US-Luxembourg double taxation treaty.“A tax ruling that agrees to McDonald’s paying no tax on their European royalties either in Luxembourg or in the US has to be looked at very carefully under EU state aid rules,” she said. “The purpose of double taxation treaties between countries is to avoid double taxation — not to justify double non-taxation.”The McDonald’s case comes as the EU pursues a broad crackdown against aggressive corporate tax planning. Brussels issued its first verdicts in October by ordering Luxembourg and the Netherlands to claw back tens of millions of euros of underpaid tax from Italian carmaker Fiat and US coffee shop chain Starbucks.Further decisions in relation to Amazon, the online retailer, and Apple, the technology group, are expected early next year.The commission’s case against McDonald’s focuses on the payment of royalties from franchisees operating restaurants in Europe and Russia to a company called McDonald’s Europe Franchising in Luxembourg.The transfer of royalties attributable to branding, recipes and know-how to low tax jurisdictions is a hallmark of several of the commission’s inquiries, as many companies argue that this intellectual property is generated outside the EU and should be deducted from taxable European profit.The commission said McDonald’s had obtained two tax rulings — letters clarifying tax obligations — from Luxembourg in 2009 that ensured that it paid no corporate tax on the profits of McDonald’s Europe Franchising, which were more than €250m in 2013.If the commission concludes that Luxembourg was granting an unfair advantage to which other companies were not entitled, it can declare the tax scheme to be illegal state aid.It argued that Luxembourg issued the second tax ruling to McDonald’s despite knowing that the royalties were not taxed in the US either, something that it had assumed when issuing the first tax ruling.Brussels has the power to force Luxembourg to recoup any unpaid taxes.Luxembourg rejected any suggestion that it offered an illegal advantage to McDonald’s.“Luxembourg considers that no special tax treatment nor selective advantage have been granted to McDonald’s. Luxembourg will fully co-operate with the commission in the investigation,” the government said in a statement.McDonald’s also denies any wrongdoing.
105;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-12-02T15:37:09Z;Brussels poised to launch tax investigation into McDonald’s;Inquiry into fast-food group follows allegations of tax avoidance;The European Commission is poised to launch a formal probe into alleged tax avoidance by McDonald’s in Luxembourg as Europe steps up its fight against aggressive corporate tax planning.The investigation into the fast-food group could come as soon as Thursday, said several people involved in the case.McDonald’s came to the attention of the commission in February during the “Luxleaks” scandal, which revealed that hundreds of companies had agreed secret deals in Luxembourg saving them billions of dollars in taxes. The charity War on Want and three unions, which trawled through the leaked revelations, accused the company of avoiding €1bn in tax payments across Europe.Brussels issued its first verdicts in October by ordering Luxembourg and the Netherlands to claw back tens of millions of euros of unpaid taxes from Fiat, the Italian carmaker, and Starbucks, the coffee shop chain. Further verdicts in relation to Amazon, the online retailer, and Apple, the technology group, are expected early next year.The McDonald’s case is especially sensitive as US officials accuse EU competition authorities of picking on American companies rather than their European rivals. Brussels denies allegations of bias.Washington is also concerned that big back-tax bills on companies such as Apple could ultimately be footed by the US, because companies can claim credits for tax paid abroad.The report by War on Want and the unions focused on tax payments between 2009 and 2013, when McDonald’s relocated its European headquarters from London to Switzerland and set up a holding company for intellectual property in Luxembourg.Stopping its base from eroding demands a host of makeshift solutionsRead moreThe authors of the report allege that the holding company was used to receive royalties and work down taxable profit. They said that McDonald’s paid tax of €16m on €3.7bn of royalties.Royalties and intellectual property are a focal point of many of the EU investigations into tax. Many companies argue that their international operations are bread-and-butter businesses that owe their profits mainly to branding, recipes and know-how generated outside of the EU.The creation of McDonald’s Luxembourg division came a year after the Grand Duchy introduced a generous tax regime allowing companies to benefit from a tax rate of 5.8 per cent on income generated from intellectual property. But, according to the report, McDonald’s paid a €3.3m tax bill from revenue of €833.8m in 2013.This was seen as a sign by the charity and unions that Luxembourg had given a preferential deal to McDonald’s beyond the 5.8 per cent, meaning that it could have been offering the company unfair state support.An examination of the issues surrounding corporate taxation and why governments are willing to help companies reduce their tax burden.Read moreThe case would officially be levelled against the government of Luxembourg to determine whether it was in effect giving illegal state subsidies to McDonald’s by offering a sweetheart tax deal. If it is found to have given illegal state aid, the commission can order Luxembourg to claw back any underpaid taxes.McDonald’s denied any wrongdoing.“McDonald’s pays significant amounts of corporate income tax across Europe. Additionally, we pay social, real estate and other taxes. Our independent franchisees, who own and operate approximately three-quarters of our restaurants in Europe, also pay corporate and many other taxes,” the company said.“In the period from 2010-2014, the McDonald’s companies paid more than $2.1bn just in corporate taxes in the EU. The average tax rate was almost 27 per cent.“While we have not been notified by the European Commission, we are confident that should an inquiry occur, it would be resolved favourably.”The European Commission and Luxembourg government declined to comment.
106;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;McDonald’s: extra value meal;Special sauce includes just a pinch of operating momentum;Put down those artisanal burritos and kale smoothies. Nothing hits the spot like an Egg McMuffin for dinner, it seems. Shares in McDonald’s, once abandoned like a Big Mac sweating under a heat lamp, have rallied 14 per cent in the past six months (hipster burger upstart Shake Shack is down 33 per cent). That is partly due to operational improvements, but financial leverage has helped add sizzle.After two years of embarrassing declines, McDonald’s recorded a 0.9 per cent jump in like-for-like store sales at US locations in the recently reported third quarter. True, that was against weak comparatives. But part of the recovery was down to the decision, fully implemented at the beginning of the fourth quarter, to make its breakfast menu available throughout the day. And McDonald’s says customers have responded to other initiatives, such as toasting buns for longer.In the midst of its recent malaise, some called for the chain to take its 8,000 owned stores and create a new real estate company that could charge $2bn in rent to the store operators. Many retail chains such as Darden Restaurants have used this property arbitrage to great effect.McDonald's this week declined to go down that path. But it will boost leverage in other ways, raising its dividend by 5 per cent and pledging to borrow $10bn to increase share buybacks. It has committed to paying out $30bn in total between 2014 and 2016. The thinking is that between its strong cash flow — capital expenditure has come down from $3bn to $2bn as new store growth is cut and 95 per cent of locations become franchised — and a healthy credit rating, it can be more aggressive in juicing returns.Many old-school stalwarts such IBM have tried to emphasise their cash-cow credentials, only to find shareholders dubious.

107;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-11-10T21:57:48Z;DR Horton leads rally among homebuilders;Gap shares under pressure on the back of weaker than expected October sales;DR Horton revealed a bigger climb in its quarterly profits than expected on Tuesday, lending a lift to the homebuilder sector.Net profits jumped 44 per cent from the year prior to $238.9m in the group’s fiscal fourth quarter. The results cover a choppy period for the US real estate market.A measure of sales of newly constructed single-family homes from the commerce department rose 24.8 per cent in July from the year before, but the pace dipped to 2 per cent in September.Shares in DR Horton, the largest US homebuilder by sales, climbed 8.2 per cent to $31.14, bringing the year-to-date advance to 23 per cent.In the same sector, PulteGroup advanced 3.6 per cent to $18.19.Elsewhere, Gap came under pressure on the back of weaker October sales figures than expected and a disappointing profit outlook for the third quarter.The retailer’s troubles deepened in late September after Stefan Larsson, who had been credited with a turning round the lower-end Old Navy Brand, left to become the chief executive of Ralph Lauren.Gap slumped 1.4 per cent to $27.29, widening its retreat this year to 35 per cent.On the other side of the spectrum, Chipotle said 43 restaurants in the US Northwest would reopen after an outbreak of E. coli. Health authorities, which have yet to determine the cause, will oversee the reopenings.The chain — known for its burritos and guacamole — is testing fresh produce, raw meat and dairy items to ensure there is no contamination, and has deep-cleaned the restaurants and discarded all stock.Chipotle shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $629.51, helping cut this year’s loss to 8 per cent.In the healthcare sector, Valeant dropped after its chief executive warned of “significant” near-term risks to its dermatology division, which accounted for 16.7 per cent of third-quarter sales. The biotechnology company has been mired in controversy over decisions to raise prices on certain drugs and its relationship with a speciality pharmacy.The shares slid 2.1 per cent to $83.64 in volatile trading. They have collapsed by nearly 70 per cent since August.Another weak performer on the day was materials. Freeport-McMoRan, the big copper miner, slumped 6.2 per cent to $9.84, as the price of copper fell for a fourth day amid concerns about demand from China.Trade data released on Monday, and a reading on consumer-level inflation on Tuesday, came in below economists’ expectations.McDonald’s wavered in late-morning trading as investors eagerly awaited an investor meeting, which was set to begin later on Tuesday. The world’s biggest burger chain has undertaken measures, including the introduction of all-day breakfast, aimed at reigniting customer enthusiasm. The shares were little changed at $113.29, but have rallied more than 20 per cent this year.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 2,081.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 17,758.21 and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 0.2 per cent to 5,083.24.
108;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-10-22T17:20:23Z;New menu boosts US sales at McDonald’s;Revenues and profits at fast-food chain hit by strong dollar;McDonald’s showed the first signs of a recovery in its home market, with third-quarter sales there rising for the first time in two years.Comparable US sales at the world’s largest fast-food chain rose 0.9 per cent in the three months to September, helped by sales of new items on its menu, including the premium buttermilk crispy chicken deluxe sandwich, it said on Thursday. However, higher wages at company-owned restaurants pushed operating profit at the US business down 1 per cent.Shares in McDonald’s rose 8.1 per cent to $110.86 by the close of trading in New York.Like many multinationals, McDonald’s total revenues and profits were hit by the strong dollar, leading to a decline in overall sales of 5 per cent. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, sales would have risen 7 per cent.McDonald’s posted earnings of $1.40 a share, a 28 per cent rise from last year. This was mainly because the third quarter in 2014 was hit hard by food scandals in China and Japan, and a requirement to increase tax reserves, the company said.Under chief executive Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s has been undertaking a turnround plan to entice customers back to its eateries amid big changes in consumer tastes. Many consumers are opting for alternatives that offer more wholesome options in trendier settings.Mr Easterbrook is introducing what he hopes will be more attractive menu options, including the all-day breakfast, which was brought in this month. He is also making menu additions using local specialities in different states to lure back customers, while removing other items. The return to sales growth comes even as the company was forced to close more stores than it opened in the US this year — the first time in its 60-year history.Mr Easterbrook said in a statement he was “encouraged” by the performance of the third quarter, highlighting the US and a sales recovery in China. The company said of the US that “rebuilding customer traffic remains a top priority”.As part of its turnround plan, McDonald’s has also restructured its business to regroup markets on the basis of their pace of growth rather than geographically. Through this process Mr Easterbrook has eliminated one layer of management, leaving, for example, just three executives in charge of the five “lead markets” — which are established overseas markets such as the UK.He said this had improved visibility into the performance of those markets, speeding up decision making and helping markets pool knowledge. He said he wanted fewer “pockets of excellence” and instead a broader spectrum of excellence at the top.McDonald’s comparable sales in its “leading”, or established, overseas markets rose 4.6 per cent, bolstered by Australia, the UK and Canada. In “high growth” markets, comparable sales rose 8.9 per cent. Chinese sales increased 26.8 per cent as it recovered from the food scandal, but the market is still not back to pre-scandal levels, the company said.
109;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Chipotle shares slide on growth concerns;Kimberly-Clark is latest US company walloped by the strong dollar;Chipotle shares dropped 5.8 per cent on Wednesday after the chain reported leaner profits than had been expected, fuelling worries about a slowdown in the burrito restaurant’s rapid growth.Late on Tuesday Chipotle said its net profits climbed to $144.9m, from $130.8m in the same period in 2014. On a per-share basis, the fast-food chain earned $4.59, missing Wall Street estimates of $4.62.Sales rose by 12 per cent to $1.22bn, meeting estimates. Same-store sales, a key metric for retailers, climbed 2.6 per cent. Chipotle said it expected same-store sales to rise in the “low to mid single-digits” this year.The chain known for its guacamole and tacos has experienced rapid growth in recent years. Revenues, for example, climbed 27.8 per cent last year.However, the company this year experienced issues sourcing pork that was raised to its standards for its carnitas product, weighing on sales in certain markets.In many ways, Chipotle is representative of a shift in consumer taste that has troubled other performers in the fast-food realm.For example McDonald’s, the world’s biggest burger chain, has seen its sales stall as it has struggled to drum up demand.Chipotle’s third-quarter results “demonstrate the continued success of our vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food,” said Steve Ells, founder and co-chief.Shares in Chipotle have fallen 3 per cent this year, while shares of competitor Shake Shack has shrunk 8 per cent and McDonald’s shares are up 9 per cent.Kimberly-Clark, the consumer goods company best known for its Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues, was the latest US company to be walloped by the strong dollar.It warned on Tuesday that is now expected full year sales to fall between 10 and 11 per cent, a touch beyond the previous guidance for a 10 per cent drop, due to currency headwinds.Sales in developing and emerging markets decreased 11 per cent, including a 25 per cent negative impact from changes in currency rates.Stripping out foreign currency impact, Kimberly-Clark said organic sales would grow 4-5 per cent and adjusted earnings per share would be $5.70-$5.80.The company had previously predicted organic growth of 3 to 5 per cent and adjusted EPS of $5.65 to $5.80.The forecast revisions came as Kimberly-Clark reported a drop in sales and earnings for the third quarter, although it still beat analyst estimates, leading the shares 0.7 per cent higher on Wednesday.Shares in Yahoo were down 5.2 per cent, building upon Tuesday’s 2 per cent loss, after the struggling internet company missed expectations on both earnings and revenues in the third quarter. Yahoo’s stock has dropped 38 per cent so far this year.GM shares rose 5.9 per cent after the company said strong US car sales boosted its earnings to record levels for the three months to the end of September.The Michigan-based company saw net profits up more than a third to 3.1bn, powered by cheap gasoline prices in the US that have fuelled sales for larger vehicles.Stocks on Wall Street were weaker on Wednesday after mixed corporate earnings. The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent at 2,018.94, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent at 17,168.61. The Nasdaq Composite shed 0.8 per cent at 4,840.12.
110;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-10-08T18:36:26Z;Yum: Yuck;The fast food group is having trouble in China;"Fast food is bad for you, whether in your stomach or your portfolio. This week, fried chicken, taco and pizza vendor Yum Brands delivered soggy results. It blamed the poor performance on slower than expected growth in China, which accounts for more than a third of its operating profit. The stock slumped nearly a fifth in response.Everyone agrees that China’s economy is slowing; the only debate is how much and why. So, many will assume that Yum’s problems are macroeconomic. They are not.The issue is not that the Chinese consumer is choosing to save rather than spend. Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo, owned by Fast Retailing, fell short of expectations for its full year numbers this week — but not because of China. That market delivered profits up two-thirds year on year.The spending stretches to food as well. Starbucks’ China revenues are still growing, for example. It is Yum in particular that is going sideways.In fact, the fast food category is stumbling worldwide. Junk food popular in the 1980s and 1990s has been losing its appeal. McDonald’s top line has stood still for four years, despite efforts to introduce healthy menus. Even in the US, where unhealthy is the national pastime, golden arch revenues have gone nowhere.More importantly, for companies operating in China, the Chinese consumer learns quickly — about both the good and the bad. As social media spreads, brand destroying food safety scandals (of which Yum has had a few) are hard to contain. And as tastes become more sophisticated, lost consumers may not return. Yum’s numbers in China have bounced back from the scandals, just not as strongly as expected. Middle-class preferences do not extend to the cheap and cheerful.China’s economic growth may be slowing, but the economy is still growing and with it retail sales. Capturing that growth, however, is no longer easy: foreign brands are not assured cachet irrespective of product. Chinese diners have moved on from junk food.

But the defiant head of Fifa pushed back in a statement through his lawyer, refusing to heed the companies whose deals with Fifa contributed to more than $1.6bn in sponsorship revenue for the body between 2011-14, according to consultancy IEG.The demands from Coke, McDonald’s and Budweiser’s owner Anheuser-Busch InBev are the strongest yet. All three have urged Fifa to make swift progress in cleaning itself up but to date they had not called outright for Mr Blatter’s resignation.“For the benefit of the game, the Coca-Cola Company is calling for Fifa President Joseph Blatter to step down immediately so that a credible and sustainable reform process can begin in earnest,” the company said.“Every day that passes, the image and reputation of Fifa continues to tarnish. Fifa needs comprehensive and urgent reform, and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach.”McDonald’s said: “The events of recent weeks have continued to diminish the reputation of Fifa and public confidence in its leadership. We believe it would be in the best interest of the game for Fifa president Sepp Blatter to step down immediately so that the reform process can proceed with the credibility that is needed.”Brewer AB InBev added to the pressure with its statement. “Following recent developments, AB InBev believes it would be appropriate for Mr Blatter to step down as we believe his continued presence to be an obstacle in the reform process. We strongly support the call for an independent reform process.”Visa, which in July had pushed for leadership change, reiterated its stance, along with increasing pressure for the appointment of an independent, third-party commission to lead the reform of Fifa.“We believe no meaningful reform can be made under Fifa’s existing leadership. And given the events of last week, it’s clear it would be in the best interests of Fifa and the sport for Sepp Blatter to step down immediately,” the company said.Mr Blatter said in June that he would step down after an extraordinary congress, and an election to replace him was scheduled for the end of February.However, last week the Swiss prosecutor said it was placing Mr Blatter under criminal investigation for suspected criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of funds. He potentially faces a prison sentence of up to a decade. The Fifa president’s lawyer has said that Mr Blatter is co-operating with the authorities and denied that any mismanagement had occurred.Every day that passes, the image and reputation of Fifa continues to tarnish. Fifa needs comprehensive and urgent reformMr Blatter’s lawyer said Fifa valued Coca-Cola as a sponsor but refused the call for the president to step down.“Mr Blatter respectfully disagrees with its position and believes firmly that his leaving office now would not be in the best interest of Fifa nor would it advance the process of reform and, therefore, he will not resign,” said Richard Cullen of McGuire Woods.In the event Mr Blatter does resign it is unclear who would take over. Michel Platini, the president of Uefa, has campaigned to succeed him and has been a frontrunner but has also become entangled in the scandal.The Swiss prosecutors statement last week said that the charge of misappropriation related to a SFr2m ($2m) payment allegedly made by Mr Blatter to Mr Platini.
112;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-09-29T16:44:17Z;Healthy gain for McDonald’s on upgrade;Sales improvement suggests revenue contraction could turn, say analysts;McDonald’s shares moved higher on Tuesday after analysts at Credit Suisse upgraded the stock, citing improvements in same-store sales, a key industry metric.Analysts at Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “neutral” and raised their price target to $112 a share, from $100, suggesting the stock could rally 16.7 per cent from here. This sent shares of the company 1.6 per cent higher to $97.47.The burger chain has come under pressure as consumers have become increasingly focused on a healthy lifestyle. This trend has been reflected in the company’s sales data: adjusted revenues have contracted for four consecutive quarters on a year-on-year basis, and Wall Street expects another drop in the current quarter.Credit Suisse argues this is changing. “Our checks indicate that US same-store sales trends are starting to turn, which we do not believe is reflected in consensus thinking and has been a key overhang on the stock,” Jason West, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said.He said new chief executive Steve Easterbrook’s plans to turn round the Illinois-based company were already starting to work, and more improvements were likely to be on the way. McDonald’s has indicated that global comparable sales should turn positive in the third quarter, led by strength in overseas markets such as UK, Australia and Canada.Credit Suisse also sees more upside in 2016 forecasts and expects the low $90 a share mark is probably a floor for the stock. It closed Monday at $95.96 a share.Shares of McDonald’s have climbed 4 per cent this year, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500, down 8.5 per cent for the year.Yahoo shares gained more than 2.4 per cent to $28.26, after the search engine said it was proceeding with plans to spin off its stake in ecommerce site Alibaba.Aabaco, the name of the planned new company, was due to be formed by the end of the year, containing Yahoo’s 15 per cent stake in Alibaba and Aabaco Small Business, a newly formed entity that will own Yahoo Small Business. Yahoo said the spin-off was still subject to certain conditions.Shares of Nexstar Broadcasting Group rose 8 per cent to $46.99 after IT announced a proposal to acquire Media General in a cash and stock transaction valued at $4.1bn.The proposal is valued at $14.50 per Media General share, including $10.50 per share in cash and 0.0898 Nexstar shares for each Media General share. This represents a 30 per cent premium to its closing price on September 25. Media General shares gained 1.2 per cent to $13.80.The benchmark S&P 500 snapped a five-day losing streak led by a 0.9 per cent gain in the healthcare sector.By close, the S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent to 1,884.09, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 16,049.13 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 4,517.32.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

A simple phone call will do next time,” he added.

Last year, as the EU and US were announcing sanctions against Russian companies, McDonald’s suddenly found itself subject to an extensive investigation into its food safety standards, forcing the temporary closure of 200 of its more than 500 restaurants.While all restaurants subject to that investigation have since been reopened, it reportedly then became the subject of close to 100 court cases related to the findings of the probe, compared with only 10 in the previous seven years.Another more recent investigation forced the closure of one of its Moscow restaurants for 30 days at the end of the first quarter, which it is waiting to reopen once delivery issues have been ironed out, McDonald’s said.“We are confident that the agreement with GiD will help enhance the McDonald’s brand in Russia, build the business over the long term and further strengthen the relationship with our customers,” said Khamzat Khasbulatov, president of McDonald’s Russia.McDonald’s employs more than 40,000 people in Russia, which have about 1m customers. It accounts for less than 5 per cent of the company’s operating profit.As part of its turnround plan led by new chief executive Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s is cutting about $300m in costs and revamping its menus to entice customers back to its restaurants and drive-thrus.New chief promises improvement in third quarter after disappointing American salesContinue readingThe move to expand in Russia comes in the same week that union leaders, politicians and workers from a number of countries testified at the Brazilian senate over McDonald’s business practices. The speakers raised concerns over the way it or its franchisees treat staff, the level of wages and its tax payments in Europe.Following the hearing, the labour prosecutor said he would form a task force to investigate allegations of labour law violations by McDonald’s in Brazil. Two Brazilian members of Congress called for the reopening of a parliamentary inquiry into slave labour to investigate allegations including poor working conditions at the company.McDonald’s restaurants in Brazil are operated by regional company Arcos Dorados, employing about 40,000 people.It did not attend the hearing. In a statement after the event, Arcos Dorados said it will co-operate with the authorities and said that it pays its staff, which are unionised, above the minimum wage. “We are certain we are acting responsibly and fulfilling all Brazilian laws and accords.”
115;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-07-24T00:08:43Z;Visa chief Charlie Scharf adds to pressure for Sepp Blatter exit;Digital payments group says ‘no meaningful reform’ possible while Fifa head stays;The chief executive of Visa has increased the pressure on Fifa president Sepp Blatter to leave immediately, saying that “no meaningful reform” is possible under the organisation’s current leadership.Mr Blatter, under fire for presiding over a massive corruption scandal, resigned last month but said he would continue in his post until an extraordinary congress to be held some time between December and March next year. Until then, he said he would work to install new reforms to make world football’s governing body more honest and transparent.But during a quarterly results presentation on Thursday afternoon, Charlie Scharf, chief executive of the digital payments company, described such moves as “wholly inadequate”, and a sign of Fifa’s “lack of awareness of the seriousness of the changes which are needed”. He called for the creation of an independent, third party led by one or more “impartial” leaders to formulate reforms. He also implied that Mr Blatter should go now, if Fifa wanted to preserve its relationship with Visa, which became a top-tier sponsor in 2007 and recently extended its relationship until 2022.“We want to be proud to be associated with Fifa and hope and look forward to working with them to that end,” he said.Mr Scharf’s remarks are similar to those made by other heavyweight World Cup sponsors, which have argued that Fifa’s efforts to improve its governance have not gone far enough. Last week Coca-Cola, which has sponsored each event since 1950, called for Fifa to set up an independent commission to lead reform, “overseen by one or more eminent, impartial leaders”.McDonald’s, which has been a World Cup sponsor for two decades and is sponsoring the 2018 World Cup to be staged by Russia, said it was not satisfied with the way Mr Blatter had handled the crisis, which had “severely tarnished Fifa in a way that strikes at the very heart of our sponsorship”.Departing president pledges term limits and pay transparency.Continue readingThe new line from Visa also marks a significant toughening of its position since last month, when it responded to Mr Blatter’s staggered exit by saying: “Transparency, integrity and fair play must be the hallmarks of the new administration and Visa stands ready to work with Fifa towards these principles.”This week Mr Blatter pledged he would ensure a fresh start for the organisation by the time he steps down, including term limits for top Fifa executives and transparency on pay. But his announcement after a Fifa executive committee meeting in Zurich was short on details — and his press conference was interrupted by a British comedian who threw fake bank notes over the Fifa president to protest against corruption in the sport.Mr Blatter’s announcement followed US allegations in May that Fifa executives took bribes of more than $150m in a culture of “rampant, systemic and deep-rooted corruption”. Last week, an official arrived in the US from Switzerland, the first of seven arrested at a Swiss hotel in May and held in connection with FBI inquiries.Additional reporting by Ralph Atkins and Lindsay Whipp
116;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s struggles to rekindle US appetites;New chief promises improvement in third quarter after disappointing American sales;McDonald’s sales and profits sank in the second quarter, underlining the struggle the world’s biggest fast food brand is having rekindling consumers’ love for its burgers and fries, particularly at home.Steve Easterbrook, the Chicago-based company’s recently installed chief executive, called the results “disappointing” and told investors on Thursday that operations in the US were working to bring “more discipline back in business [and] react better to trends”.He promised that the third quarter would finally bring a rebound in global comparable sales, and that this rise would happen regardless of the bounce it would receive from a recovery from the Asian supplier scandal last year.Sales tumbled 10 per cent to $6.5bn, while net income fell 13 per cent to $1.2bn, or $1.26 a share. The results, however, were in line with analysts’ estimates, sending shares 0.5 per cent lower to $97.09 by close of trading in New York.The company said it was also reviewing its dividend policy but declined to give any indication of whether this would be a positive or negative for investors until November as the process was ongoing.The earnings statement highlighted the particular problems McDonald’s is having in its home market, where it will have net restaurant closures for the first time in its 60-year history this year. The company blamed about 80 per cent of the second-quarter decline in operating profit on the US and Japanese markets.Comparable sales in the US fell 2 per cent and operating income was down 6 per cent, adding to nearly three years of declines for the market.It blamed the declines on a lack of response to some of its menu features, which have included a “summer break menu” and an “artisan grilled chicken sandwich”, and its promotions.McDonald’s is testing all-day breakfasts and menu simplification to boost the US market, but it faces stiff competition from Taco Bell, the Yum Brand chain, which has seen some significant success in this area.Amid concerns that McDonald’s plans to simplify would be compromised by something as complex as all-day breakfast, Mr Easterbrook emphasised that there would have to be simplifications elsewhere in McDonald’s operations.He said it was important to understand that the improvements the group was making to its core menu — whether better quality beef or tastier salads — were just as important as the locally sourced meals it was developing for the regions, such as a lobster dish in Boston.McDonald’s is also being challenged in the US by new rivals such as Mexican food chain Chipotle and the Shake Shack burger outlets, which have captured the millennial demographic.The group’s struggle to revive its brand and popularity also comes at a particularly difficult time for its international operations as, like other multinational companies, it is hit by adverse currencies, a struggling eurozone amid the Greek debt crisis, and slowing emerging markets.Mr Easterbrook said he was confident of a turnround, however.“I am confident that we will create the transformation necessary for McDonald’s to become a modern, progressive burger company delivering a contemporary restaurant experience,” Mr Easterbook said in a statement, reusing a phrase from his turnround plan announced when he took over earlier this year. That plan left many analysts and investors hungry for more detail.McDonald’s is relying on Mr Easterbrook to bring some of the success that he had in stoking growth in the UK and other European markets to the company’s global operations.The region outperformed others in sales, posting a comparable sales increase of 1.2 per cent, thanks to demand in the UK and Germany mitigating a difficult quarter in France. However, on an operating basis, income in the region sank by a fifth, reflecting the tricky macroeconomic environment that many multinationals are facing, the euro weakness and some restructuring charges.
117;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-07-22T22:41:05Z;Wages of New York fast-food staff set to double;Move by Cuomo joins minimum pay trend in US;Tens of thousands of fast-food workers in New York are in line to have their wages almost doubled, in one of the biggest drives in a campaign for a higher minimum wage that has swept the US.A committee formed by Andrew Cuomo, governor, plans an increase from $8.75 an hour to $15, starting with New York’s 180,000 cooks and cashiers.The proposal — which would see wages rise gradually to $15 by the end of 2018 in New York and by 2021 in the state — would make New York’s minimum wage one of the highest in the country along with that in some other big cities.It comes as a national debate over income inequality has spurred protests in hundreds of cities over the past two years in a push for a $15 minimum wage and union rights for low-wage workers.Seattle, San Francisco and most recently Los Angeles, where low-wage workers are squeezed by the high cost of living, have in the past year decided to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour.Protest movements have been mainly aimed at corporations such as McDonald’s and Walmart, both of which have responded with wage rises.Mr Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed raising New York’s minimum wage to $10.50 earlier this year, but was blocked by the state senate, where Republicans hold a majority.He then sought another route, via a law that gives the state’s labour commissioner power to investigate whether wages in a specific industry are “sufficient to provide for the life and health of those workers”. The recommendations are the result of an investigation started in May and the formation of the wage board committee which has held six public meetings since then.The rules would apply to fast-food restaurants that are part of a chain with 30 or more locations in the US.“Nowhere is the income gap more extreme and obnoxious than in the fast-food industry,” Mr Cuomo wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times in May. “Through the (wage board), New York can set fast-food workers on a path out of poverty, ease the burden on taxpayers and create a new national standard.”The recommendations do not need approval from the state legislature, but must be ratified by labour commissioner Mario Musolino.McDonald’s in April raised wages by at least $1 for about 90,000 US workers. However, critics claimed the rise was too small and applied to just 10 per cent of US outlets, excluding the employees who work at roughly 13,000 franchise-run locations.In February, Walmart, the largest private sector employer in the US, said it would spend $1bn to boost wages of half a million low-paid workers to at least $10 by 2016.“This is a stunning repudiation of McDonald’s meagre one dollar increase, which was a marketing ploy,” Sriram Madhusoodanan, of Corporate Accountability International, a public health and human rights watchdog, said on Wednesday about New York’s move. “I imagine tough questions from investors as to why (McDonald’s) didn’t see the writing on the wall here.”Opponents to New York’s wage rise have argued that it targets only fast-food restaurants, excluding other low-wage jobs.Jack Bert, owner of a New York-based McDonald’s franchise, said the decision was “unfair and discriminatory”, and put small business owners in the fast food industry at a “competitive disadvantage”.
118;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Ex-Fifa official to face charges in US;Jeffrey Webb alleged to have received millions of dollars in bribes;"Jeffrey Webb, a former Fifa vice-president, has arrived in the US from Switzerland to face corruption charges for his alleged role in a $150m bribery scheme.Prosecutor Evan Norris said on Friday at a court hearing in Brooklyn involving a sports marketing executive that Mr Webb was in New York state after voluntarily coming to the US and waiving extradition proceedings. He estimated it could be “several months” before any of the other six officials arrested in Switzerland on the eve of Fifa’s annual congress this summer would be brought to the US to face charges.Mr Webb, who is also a former president of Concacaf, the governing body of football in North and Central America, is a citizen of the Cayman Islands. It is not clear if he is co-operating with authorities.US authorities allege that Mr Webb, who sat on Fifa’s finance and World Cup organising committees, received millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for awarding sports marketing rights for World Cup qualifying matches among other games to Traffic Sports USA and others.Mr Norris and a lawyer for Aaron Davidson, a US citizen who worked for Traffic Sports USA, confirmed during the court hearing that they were negotiating a guilty plea to some of the charges.Mr Davidson, who is free on bail, has been charged as part of the overall bribery conspiracy and specifically in connection to bribes allegedly paid to Mr Webb.The head of Traffic Sports, José Hawilla, has pleaded guilty in connection with the bribery scheme and is co-operating with US authorities.If Mr Davidson agrees to co-operate, this would also aid prosecutors in their case against Mr Webb.If Mr Webb agrees to co-operate it could help authorities explore other aspects of the investigation, including the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments to Russia and Qatar.Mr Webb replaced Jack Warner, the Trinidadian former head of Concacaf who has also been charged in the alleged scheme.Bidding for the 2026 World Cup has been postponed as Fifa seeks to rehabilitate its image and organisation.On this episode of FT Alphachat, Shannon Bond and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson discuss the fallout for Gawker after a bad editorial decision; Lex’s Rob Armstrong guides listeners through the tech sector; and Kara Scannell and Matt Garrahan reflect on the Fifa scandals. Cardiff Garcia hosts.On Monday Fifa’s executive committee is expected to unveil moves aimed at addressing the corruption allegations, including banning countries that are bidding to host the World Cup from funding the construction of any stadiums or pitches elsewhere. Some Fifa officials believe that arrangement could have been used to buy votes.According to the court documents, Mr Davidson is recorded discussing the alleged bribery scheme with Mr Hawilla.“Is it illegal? It is illegal. Within the big picture of things, a company that has worked in this industry for 30 years, is it bad? It is bad,” Mr Davidson said during a 2014 meeting, according to court filings.The court hearing and Mr Webb’s arrival in the US came as two heavyweight World Cup sponsors ramped up pressure on Fifa. Coca-Cola, which has sponsored each World Cup since 1950, demanded the scandal-riddled organisation create an independent commission to lead its reform.“Coca-Cola has asked Fifa to support an independent, third-party commission overseen by one or more eminent, impartial leaders to manage the efforts necessary to help reform Fifa’s governance and its human rights requirement,” the company said in a statement.McDonald’s, which has been a World Cup sponsor for two decades and is sponsoring the 2018 World Cup won by Russia, said it was not satisfied with the way Fifa had handled the crisis, and had expressed its concerns.Recent allegations and indictments had “severely tarnished Fifa in a way that strikes at the very heart of our sponsorship,” it said, adding that Fifa’s internal controls and compliance culture were “inconsistent with expectations McDonald’s has for its business partners”.“Fifa must now implement meaningful changes to restore trust and credibility with fans and sponsors alike. The world expects concrete actions and so does McDonald’s.”"
119;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-06-18T18:06:42Z;McDonald’s to slim down in home market;Fast-food chain will close more US stores than it opens for first time in its history;US consumers have not been “lovin’ it” at McDonald’s for some time, but this year will be the first in its 60-year history that the fast-food chain will close more stores in its home market than it will open.The company said there would be a net reduction in US restaurants this year, without giving a figure, but added that “the impact is minimal in comparison to the 14,000 restaurants we operate across the country”.The company plans to open about 125 restaurants this fiscal year, according to its annual report, without stating the number of closures. AP first reported the net closings.McDonald’s is grappling with changing consumer tastes in its domestic market, where smaller rivals perceived to be more healthy — such as Chipotle and Shake Shack — are growing. It has reported many declining monthly sales in the US for more than a year.But overextension as consumers’ palates change is not the problem of McDonald’s alone in the US, but an issue forcing some of the biggest brands in the US to rethink their place in corporate America.Many consumers have become more prudent with their disposable income as wages have stagnated since the financial crisis.Millennials, a prized demographic group in which US consumer companies and retailers are rushing to grasp market share, are displaying changing tastes not only by choosing healthier foods but also by opting for craft beer and new fashion retailers.Those that have been slow to meet the stylistic needs and shopping habits of twenty-somethings are also being forced to close stores. Gap announced this week it would shut 175 speciality stores in North America over the next few years, including 140 this fiscal year.Art Peck, Gap’s CEO, is aiming to increase productivity and improve consumers’ experience as its more conservative, or preppy, clothing appears to be missing the mark among millennials. J Crew is similarly trying to change after reporting a widening of its net loss in the first quarter.Steve Easterbrook, the new McDonald’s chief executive, has pledged to make the chain a “more modern, progressive burger company”, hoping to replicate globally the success he had in the UK and other European markets.Many analysts were underwhelmed by a plan he unveiled earlier this year, though McDonald’s shares have edged higher since the start of the year.Mr Easterbrook has been pulling in new executives to help implement the overhaul of its operations and image. Last week the group named Robert Gibbs, US President Barack Obama’s former press secretary, as its global communications officer.
120;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-06-16T08:11:14Z;Skimping tax can still leave a bitter taste for coffee companies;A once unlikely selling point has become a big issue for consumers;When Ethical Consumer magazine cast a critical eye over coffee shops’ tax affairs this year, it singled out small companies for praise. Citing AMT, which runs coffee stalls in railway stations, it said it “even boasts about [this] on its counter, with a sign saying: 100% taxes paid”.Paying tax would once have been an unlikely selling point. But corporate tax avoidance has become the number one issue that the public wants companies to address, according to research by the Institute of Business Ethics.The question of whether coffee shops skimp on their tax payments has once again moved into the headlines. It has been raised by MPs angered by Caffè Nero’s decision to stop stocking milk from farms in badger cull areas, which the chain said was in response to threats from animal rights activists.MPs drew attention to Caffè Nero’s business structure, which involves Luxembourg and the Isle of Man, and the absence of corporate tax payments since 2008. Ian Liddell-Grainger, a Conservative MP for west Somerset, called for a boycott earlier this month saying: “If they paid UK corporation tax, I might have had some sympathy, but they don’t.”Caffè Nero is not alone in facing criticism. Earlier this year, McDonald’s, the fast-food group that serves the largest number of cups of coffee in Britain, was accused of avoiding €1bn of taxes over five years by funnelling royalties through Luxembourg. Unions accused the company of not paying its “fair share”. The company said it complied with all relevant tax rules.Tax also remains a potentially toxic issue for Starbucks, not least because it is still waiting for the outcome of a Brussels state aid inquiry. The 2012 row over its tax affairs has cast a long shadow, despite its denial of avoidance, a voluntary tax payment of £20m and moving its European headquarters to London.Why are coffee shops in the front line of consumer activism over tax? Jeffrey Young, managing director of Allegra, a consultancy, says they have been unfairly targeted by journalists. But there are good reasons why they arouse strong emotions, not least their social role as a meeting place. “This is an industry that relies on being perceived as good citizens.”Moreover, it is easy for disgruntled consumers to steer clear of coffee shops that offend them. Even so, Mr Young is sceptical about how much most customers really care about a company’s tax strategy. He says for the majority, liking the coffee and convenience are more important.Daniel Johnson of the Institute of Business Ethics is also cautious about the impact of public anger on sales. “People are well intentioned but it is not clear when push comes to shove they will act,” he says.For the conscientious consumer, tax is just one of myriad factors — from sourcing to how well a company treats its employees — that they might want to take into consideration.Another difficulty is that it can be hard to judge whether companies are unfairly minimising their tax bills. The complexity was underlined when Ethical Consumer initially gave Costa its worst mark for potential tax avoidance. Later, after it received more information, it changed this to its top mark.Caffè Nero is another complex example. The company says it is not shifting profits out of the UK and its operational profits have been wiped out by interest payments to UK banks. In short, it strongly denies that it avoids tax, adding that its Isle of Man parent company is simply a tax-neutral way for foreigners to invest in the UK.Even so, some people prefer to patronise businesses with simple structures. The Fair Tax Mark— a Kitemark for “responsible” taxpayers based on questions about transparency and tax havens, was introduced to help companies set themselves apart.A similar message can be sent out by individual business owners using the “Fair Tax Pledge”, a free, self-certified declaration of opposition to tax avoidance that was launched last Friday.
121;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s recruits Obama’s former press secretary Robert Gibbs;Appointment as head of communications comes as US fast-food chain seeks to revamp image;McDonald’s has tapped former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs to head its communications as the US fast-food chain seeks to revamp its image and battle falling sales.It has also appointed a new global chief marketing officer, Silvia Lagnado, who worked at Unilever and spirits maker Bacardi.The two moves come three months after McDonald’s replaced its chief executive as it tackles stiff competition in the US from Chipotle Mexican Grill and Shake Shack, and declining customer traffic in China and Japan, where meat safety concerns damaged its reputation.Mr Gibbs will help McDonald’s to become a “more modern, progressive burger company”, said Steve Easterbrook, the chain’s new chief executive.The company’s shares have fallen 5.3 per cent since Mr Easterbrook, a Briton, took over from Don Thompson in March, closing at $94.73 on Tuesday.McDonald’s sales have suffered in recent years as US consumers shifted from burgers and fries to food they perceive to be healthier.In April, McDonald’s also said it was closing down underperforming stores in Japan, its second largest market. Sales dropped in the three months to the end of March, reflecting “negative guest traffic”. Revenue fell 11 per cent to $5.95bn compared with the same quarter last year, while net income plunged a third to $812m, or 84 cents a share.Earnings, excluding some items, were $1.01 a share, missing analyst forecasts of $1.06 a share.After serving as President Barack Obama’s first White House press secretary, Mr Gibbs co-founded the Incite Agency, a communications company.At McDonald’s he will replace Bridget Coffing, who retired earlier in the year after 30 years at the Illinois-based company.McDonald’s this year announced plans to reorient its business towards a more heavily franchised model. By the end of 2018 it expects 90 per cent of its restaurants globally to be owned by franchisees compared with 81 per cent currently.
122;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-06-02T05:33:29Z;Given the chance, older workers can fill the gap;Employers that ignore the over-50s face a skills crisis;Working lives are being extended as life expectancy rises and public health improves — and employers are starting to value older workers more. However, campaigners say that company attitudes and practices need to change faster if serious labour shortages are to be averted in future.Barclays Bank and coach operator National Express recently announced apprenticeship schemes aimed at older workers, putting them in the forefront of corporate initiatives to widen the age diversity of workforces.The National Express scheme aims to recruit people for whom age and extended career breaks can pose a barrier to finding employment, including the over-50s, women returning to work after raising children, the long-term unemployed and full-time carers.“We place a high value on a diverse workforce because it reflects our broad customer base and we believe our business is strengthened by a wide range of skills and experience,” says Tom Stables, managing director for the company’s UK coach division.National Express joins retailer B&Q, a longstanding champion of employing older staff, and companies such as fast-food chain McDonald’s, pub operator JD Wetherspoon and Lloyds Banking Group in taking steps to encourage older employees.Baroness (Ros) Altmann, the government’s former business champion for older workers, now pensions minister, said in a report in March that a growing number of employers understood the benefits of employing older staff. But, she added: “They are still a minority. Age discrimination and unconscious bias remain widespread problems in the UK labour market.”While some people choose to work longer because they enjoy it, for others it is a financial necessity when facing a long retirement. The government has addressed this issue by abolishing the default retirement age, so that staff can no longer be forced out at 65, and extending the right to request flexible working. The state pension age for women is rising to 65, in line with that for men — both will reach 66 by 2020 and 67 by 2028.Employment rates for people in their 50s and 60s have been rising for two decades and have grown more sharply than for other age groups since the financial crisis. The rate for people aged 65 and over has climbed from 7 per cent in 2007 to 10.7 per cent. The number of self-employed over-65s has doubled in the past five years to nearly half a million.“The evidence suggests that a lot more employers are keeping people on for longer. Where there is a problem is in recruitment. People who are older find it difficult to get a job if they haven’t got one,” says Dianah Worman, adviser on diversity at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.People who are older find it difficult to get a job if they haven’t got oneEmployers that fail to tackle age diversity risk losing out in the search for staff. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills says between 2012 and 2022 some 12.5m vacancies will be opened up through people leaving the workforce and an additional 2m new jobs will be created, yet only 7m young people are due to enter the workforce. Net immigration at 300,000 a year is unlikely to fill the gap. Baroness Altmann called for more apprenticeships for those over 50, flexible and part-time working and better training for line managers.“We are in the early stages in terms of a strategic response from employers,” says Rachael Saunders, age at work director at the charity Business in the Community. BITC found that 1m people over 50 had been pushed out of the workplace during the past eight years through redundancy, ill health or “forced” early retirement.Ms Saunders, who is working with organisations such as Nationwide Building Society and the Co-operative Group, praises outsourcer Sodexo, a finalist in BITC’s Responsible Business Awards, for a scheme to help employers understand the needs of different generations of workers.At Stoke-based tableware manufacturer Steelite International, 360 of the company’s 877 UK employees are aged 50 or over. “Employees who have been with the company for a long time are often a fountain of knowledge,” says Louise Griffin, human resources manager.She says it is important to carry out a review to identify what an individual needs and can offer. Flexible working and redeployment are among techniques used to find the right role. In one department, two employees who wanted to retire from full-time work agreed to share a job.Ewen MacLeod, director of A.T. Brown, a family-owned coach hire company based in Shropshire in the west of England, says employing older workers has helped the business to grow from four employees 18 years ago to 32 today.Currently it has four working beyond the usual retirement age and two coming up to it. The oldest employee is a 79-year-old driver who does a school run every morning in term time, and the youngest a 19-year-old apprentice mechanic.“The main logic is economic,” Mr MacLeod says. “We have a business that peaks at two parts of the day and it suits older workers to come in in the morning, take some children to school and come in in the afternoon to take them home again.”But, he adds: “We value the other benefits as well. They have a positive effect on younger workers and a wealth of experience they can pass on, particularly in terms of customer service.” Mr MacLeod is himself 59 and has no plans to retire.“Anybody who discounts an employee on the basis of age is missing out,” he says. “Our older workers are not as physically fit as they once were, but the skills and experience they bring to the table more than compensate for that.”
123;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-05-26T23:12:42Z;Changing consumer tastes hurt McDonald’s and Coca-Cola;Greasy burgers, fries and fizzy drinks take a pounding as consumers switch to healthier foods;This month, McDonald’s unveiled a sweeping restructuring plan. It was widely expected after years of slumping sales growth, and an admission by the newly installed chief executive that the company had not kept up with a revolution in consumer tastes.Analysts applauded the plan’s $300m in cost savings, and an organisational restructuring that should streamline operations and strip out layers of bureaucracy.But many wondered where exactly — in the 23-minute unveiling video, the press release and the hour-long analyst call — was the meat of how McDonald’s would revive a brand that has been battered, as consumers shift from greasy burgers and fries toward food marketed as fresher and more natural. The company’s shares traded down nearly 2 per cent in the hours after the announcement.“Consumers vote with their dollars, and right now the brand has seemed to stagnate in the eye of the consumer,” says RJ Hottovy, analyst at Morningstar in Chicago. “[Addressing] that was the big hole in the presentation.”McDonald’s, the world’s largest “restaurant group”, is among the biggest victims of a shift in consumer tastes toward health and wellness that extends from food and beverage to apparel and cosmetics. While strong brands are as important as ever, this change has transformed the way consumers interact with them, and created an environment in which authenticity is highly regarded.Chipotle, the burrito chain that is exploding in growth and — many analysts say — eating McDonald’s lunch, is a master of authenticity, says David Garfield, head of the consumer products practice at consultancy AlixPartners.“They’ve never said: ‘We’re the healthiest alternative to quick serve or fast casual dining’,” he says. “What they’ve said is that they will try to bring natural and fresh ingredients to their consumers and bring interesting and flavourful meals to their customers. I think they are an authentic brand in that respect.”Consumers believe that Chipotle’s dedication to antibiotic-free meat and organic ingredients is sincere. So they are considered “healthier”, despite the fact that a Chipotle burrito with chicken, white rice, pinto beans, cheese, guacamole and salsa contains 1,100 calories — 60 more than a Big Mac and large fries.McDonald’s has tried to counter its reputation as a purveyor of fatty, unnatural junk food with a video series in which a host marvels at the real meat that goes into its Chicken Nuggets. It has also launched a marketing campaign that allows consumers to ask questions about the company’s food. But the user-submitted questions speak to the scale of its challenges: “Is the McRib made from real pork?”, “Are there worms in your beef?”, “Do you make fries with real potatoes?”It is important that brands strive for transparency, because in the age of Google and social media, consumers demand it, says Shilpa Rosenberry, of consultancy Daymon Worldwide.“In the early years, consumers were infatuated with brands. The notion of quality was assumed and consumers were very content that brands were a primary marker,” she says. “Authenticity goes far beyond brand today — consumers must understand how it was made and who made it. Is the company being true to fair trade practices? How does it treat its employees?”The driving force behind these changes is millennials, who are “more than ever looking for this type of authenticity and honesty from companies they want to do business with”, she adds.For decades, sales of Big Macs grew along with their natural accompaniment, Coca-Cola. At the same time, portion sizes and American waistlines were also expanding.Coke, too, has found itself on the wrong end of the shift in consumer tastes. Fizzy drinks sales volumes in the US fell for the 10th consecutive year in 2014.The company has diversified into juices and bottled water in order to compensate. But it has taken a radical approach to rebranding Coke itself, by reframing a product it once tried to get consumers to drink in half-gallon portions to one that comes in an 8-oz glass bottle and is, according to US head Sandy Douglas, a “treat”.“Strategically, I think of Coca-Cola as the greatest treat,” he says, noting that that is how the brand was marketed when he was growing up.This is Coke finding a way to engage within the new, health-obsessed environment.Mr Garfield says: “If you have a product that really doesn’t have any of the core health and wellness aspects, you have to be honest and say this is the once-in-a-great-while selective indulgence for when you grow weary of the drive to be healthy and well.”The goal is to bring the brand back to its roots through the use of smaller cans and bottles, which currently make up 5-6 per cent of total sales, but are growing at 10-15 per cent annually.“I believe that the Coca-Cola brand in 2050 will be [in a] 6.5 oz and 8 oz bottle,” he says. “The consumer will take it back to that special experience.”
124;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-05-22T18:11:39Z;Where’s the beef? McDonald’s uncertain recovery;Fewer people are going to the fast-food chain and the decline is accelerating;Where’s the beef? is a catchphrase in the US. It originated as an advertising slogan for the fast-food chain Wendy’s in a TV commercial in 1984. Since then it has become an all-purpose phrase questioning the substance of an idea, event or product. It strikes me as relevant to the current predicament of McDonald’s.McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food operator, is experiencing serious problems. Global same store sales have now been down for four consecutive quarters and six of the past nine quarters.US same-store sales have now been down for six consecutive quarters. European same-store sales have been down for four consecutive quarters and for seven out of the past 10 quarters, and you shouldn’t ask about what is happening to McDonald’s Japanese sales if you are squeamish.Perhaps even worse is the fact that the number of customers visiting McDonald’s in the US fell 1.6 per cent in 2013 and then 4.1 per cent in 2014. The European guest count fell 1.5 per cent in 2013 and then 2.2 per cent in 2014.Nor are things any better in the developing world. Same-store sales in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa have been down for eight of the last 10 quarters and the guest count fell 3.8 per cent in 2013 and 4.7 per cent in 2014.In other words, fewer people are going to McDonald’s and the rate of decline is accelerating.Some commentators would have you believe that the problem rests with the entire sector, for which they use the pejorative term “junk food”. Yet Domino’s Pizza reported results for its first quarter ended March 2015 with US same-store sales up by 14.5 per cent, and this is not an isolated example.Nor can McDonald’s blame the economy: the company managed 3.8 per cent same-store growth in 2009 and 6.9 per cent in 2008. Comparable global sales grew in every month in 2008 and 2009.The fact is, there is something fundamentally wrong with McDonald’s rather than the whole fast food sector. It affects all regions of its operation and it is getting worse.At least McDonald’s has figured out that it has a problem. The result is a new chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, who ran the relatively successful UK operations, and the obligatory “turnround plan” launched at an investor conference.My misgivings about this plan began with the news release which preceded the conference. It said the new chief executive identified the company’s priorities as threefold: “driving operational growth, returning excitement to our brand and unlocking financial value”. It continued, “the first critical step of our operational growth-led plan is to strengthen our effectiveness and efficiency and drive faster and more customer-led decisions”. I’m not sure I know what this means, but what will he do to achieve it?Restructure the business, of course, into four new segments. As well as the US, the business will have three other segments — “international lead markets”, “high growth markets” and “foundational markets”. How rearranging the reporting segmentation will help is beyond me — a phrase about the rearrangement of the deck chairs on the Titanic springs to mind.Note that the word “food” was entirely absent from the release and the word “burger” was only mentioned once, as in “burger company”.Language which felt like it had been lifted from a management consultancy lexicon continued in the chief executive’s presentation: “As we turn around our critical markets, we will create strategies which leverage our scale and competing power, bring disruptions to life and sharp brands on the move. We will also seek to be more progressive around our social purpose in order to deepen our relationships with communities on the issues that matter to them.” Note, still no mention of the food.I think that the first thing McDonald’s needs to address is whether its target customers like the food it sells, and if not, figure out why this is and what it can do about it. Domino’s Pizza did this in 2009 when it made a very public mea culpa about the quality of its pizzas, publishing some damning findings from a customer survey along the lines of “the cardboard box tastes better than the pizzas”. This is the sort of action you only take if you intend to change and Domino’s has been reaping the benefits since.But I don’t think we should solely blame McDonald’s management for this lack of focus on the one thing that matters more than any other — the food. The analytical and investment community must share the blame. To illustrate why, here are the first three questions from analysts in the Q&A session following the chief executive’s presentation:1. The first questioner asked whether the increase in the percentage of franchised restaurants, which McDonald’s is planning, would be dilutive or accretive to earnings per share (“EPS”).2. The second questioner suggested that the higher franchised percentage should enable the company to support a higher level of debt.3. The third question was on whether the company had considered an Opco-propco structure in which a company’s properties are held in a “PropCo” and leased to the Operating Company or “OpCo” with the PropCo then usually sold to “unlock the value” in the company’s real estate.In other words, all these analysts seemed to be interested in was financial engineering. They do not seem to realise that without a business selling something which customers want, no amount of financial wizardry will create lasting value. But faced with this obsession with financial legerdemain among the analysts, you can hardly blame the management for sharing some of the same focus.If you are thinking of investing in McDonald’s or any other potential “turnround” situation I suggest you hold back until you encounter a CEO who talks about the need to improve the company’s product or service in a basic manner. Someone who can answer the question, “Where’s the beef?”Terry Smith is chief executive of Fundsmith LLP
125;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-05-19T22:31:50Z;Los Angeles boosts fight on minimum wage;City council votes for $15 an hour level by 2020;Los Angeles on Tuesday became the largest city in the US to embrace a movement to raise minimum wages, when its city council voted to increase the guaranteed pay for workers in the city to $15 an hour by 2020.With income inequality securing growing political attention and Republicans in Congress reluctant to act, campaigners in the US have successfully turned to cities and states to push for an increase in the $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage.The campaign has had success in places such as San Francisco and Seattle where local governments have voted to raise the wage. It has also led companies like Walmart, the largest private sector employer in the US, to pledge to increase the wages of its lowest-paid workers.LA is the country’s second-largest city by population, and with an estimated 800,000 people affected its move represents arguably the biggest victory so far.“Today, help is on the way for the 1m Angelenos who live in poverty,” Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement after the 14-1 vote. “The minimum wage should not be a poverty wage in Los Angeles.”The plan, which had been opposed by local business groups and involved months of backroom haggling between city politicians, is still subject to a final vote. It will also take years to implement.The measure that won preliminary approval from the city council on Tuesday would see LA’s minimum wage rise from $9 currently to $15 an hour for companies with more than 25 workers in 2020 and all companies a year later. Beginning in 2022, wages would be adjusted each year based on local inflation.Business groups reacted angrily to the decision, saying it would cost jobs rather than help vulnerable workers.$25.76 an hour…or $53,581 per year, needed by working single adult with one child to survive in LA County, according to experts at MITRuben Gonzalez of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce said the higher wage was likely to lead to job cuts.“It’s going to hurt,” he told the Los Angeles Times. “It’s simple math. There is simply not enough room, enough margin in these businesses to absorb a 50-plus per cent increase in labour costs over a short period of time.”Labour groups had called for an even more aggressive increase in wages, arguing that LA’s high housing and other costs justified it.Based on some calculations the new level of pay may still fall short of the “living wage” promised by its backers, particularly for any workers with a family to support.According to a “living wage calculator” built by experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from local data on food, housing, transportation and medical costs, a single adult working full time would need to earn $12.34 an hour, or $25,673 per year pre-tax, to survive in Los Angeles County. With just one child that figure goes up to $25.76 an hour, or $53,581 per year.
126;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-05-18T22:11:22Z;US blue-chips sell euro-denominated corporate bonds;McDonald’s sells €2bn and United Tech issues €750m;McDonald’s and United Technologies were the latest big US companies to take advantage of lower borrowing costs in the eurozone on Monday, with hefty debt sales that suggest recent market turmoil has abated.The issuance of debt in euros by US companies, called “reverse Yankee’’ bonds has been increasingly popular, this year, as borrowing costs in dollars and euros have diverged thanks to the launch of the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing programme.McDonald’s sold €2bn in debt, while United Technologies Corporation, which produces aircraft engines and helicopters sold its inaugural euro-denominated bond on Monday, with a size of €750m and a maturity of eight-years. The sales provided further evidence of the eurozone bond market stabilising after deal activity contracted sharply in late April as yields, which move inversely to price, rose sharply.The US companies, who are both constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, join other blue-chips such as Coca-Cola, Blackstone and BlackRock in crossing the Atlantic and selling reverse Yankees in recent months. The total raised by US companies issuing euro-denominated debt so far this year is just over €34bn, not including the latest two deals. This is more than double the previous record for the same period of €17bn in 2007.However, the recent period of higher volatility in eurozone government bonds has left investors reluctant to own longer term debt, with underwriters unable to attract sufficient demand for a proposed 20-year offering from McDonald’s.Investors’ waning appetite for long term euro-denominated debt comes after the sector has been hit hard in recent weeks. The price of longer dated debt is more sensitive to changes in underlying yields that shorter term issues, and the sector has led the bond market lower. British American Tobacco issued a 30-year bond in March at par, which after rising to 103 cents in mid-April, has declined to 86 cents on the dollar in value.“Investors have been forced by the dynamics of QE to buy the type of instruments that are very sensitive to rate volatility — this is an unintended consequence of QE,” said Frazer Ross, a managing director on the global risk syndicate desk at Deutsche Bank.“The long end is currently facing challenges and demand will take some time to recover,” he added.The fast food giant sold a triple tranche deal on Monday worth a total of €2bn. The debt offering consisted of a €600m 4.25-year, €800m seven-year and a €600m 12-year. McDonald’s also issued $2bn of bonds in the US market, with the maturities ranging from five to 30 years.Hyung-Ja de Zeeuw, a strategist at ABN AMRO said “placing a 20-year bond in the current market environment of rising yields, is difficult”, while he added: “McDonald’s posted disappointing results in [the first quarter] and S&P’s and Moody’s downgraded the issuer.”
127;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-05-10T17:22:15Z;The end of the Golden Arches doctrine;After decades of agreeing to lower global barriers, we are as likely to put up new ones nowadays;Nearly two decades ago, Thomas Friedman came up with his “Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention”. No two countries that had McDonald’s restaurants would go to war. The idea suited the heady post-cold war 1990s when people thought humanity would turn to post-ideological goals, like ending hunger. It offered the prospect of ‘homo economicus’ replacing its appetite for war with a Big Mac and fries. Alas, war is now back on the menu and McDonald’s is in trouble. Could the age of globalisation be going into reverse?The safe answer is no. McDonald’s and other US consumer icons, such as Coca-Cola and Kraft, are certainly stagnating. Their sales at home and abroad have been heading downwards. McDonald’s suffered a big drop in Asian revenues last year after it was found using expired meat in China while a human tooth turned up in a burger in Japan. But tastes are also changing. The king of fast food is now toying with artisanal sandwiches and kale. It calls this “brand recovery”.But the woes of old-fashioned US consumer icons hardly qualify as a retreat from globalisation. Newer American brands, such as Apple, Uber and Starbucks, are powering ahead. Mr Friedman also updated his (self-admittedly playful) aphorism to the “ Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention”. No two countries that are part of the same global supply chain will fight each other: the economic penalty would be simply too high. Unfortunately, events are challenging the updated version as well. Insightful though Mr Friedman is, neither theory has emerged intact from what some call the post- post-Cold War world.Even when societies turn middle class, conflict is endemic to our species. The return of great power rivalry in the 21st century reminds us that we are not purely economic animals. Were that the case, we would long ago have lowered transaction costs by abolishing nation states and currencies.The fact that diverse cultures share bad habits and use the same technology should not be over-interpreted. China’s politburo has been dressing in business suits for years. Jihadi fighters wear jeans and surf on their iPhones (doubtless some have a weakness for chicken McNuggets). They still revile the global hegemon. The presence of hundreds of McDonald’s outlets in Russia did not stop Vladimir Putin last year from annexing Crimea, which also had McDonald’s outlets. The chain has since withdrawn from the peninsula but not from the rest of Ukraine. Nor is McDonald’s presence likely to prevent a fifth war between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile China’s global integration does not seem to have checked its sense of nationalism.Geopolitics is clearly back. There are also signs the global economy is integrating more slowly than before. In some respects it is going in the opposite direction. In the decades before the 2008 financial meltdown, world trade expanded at roughly twice the pace of global economic growth, according to the Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis. Since then trade has slowed to the same pace as growth. Some of this is due to structural factors, chiefly China’s shift from an export-led growth model to one based more on internal consumption.After decades of agreeing to lower global barriers, we are as likely to put up new ones nowadaysTechnology is also playing a role. Automation enables manufacturers to move closer to customers without incurring high wage bills and exorbitant shipping costs. If 3D printing takes off, that trend will deepen.But some of the slowdown is also happening by choice. Last week’s election in the UK followed the most inward looking campaign in memory. Britain’s internationalism can no longer be taken for granted. Nor should its message be ignored: Britain remains a democratic bellwether. The rise of more nationalistic politics in the west is likely to remain a problem for some time to come.Incomes in the developing world are catching up with those in the west, in some cases at the expense of the west’s middle class. At least, that is how many voters perceive it. After decades of agreeing to lower global barriers, we are as likely to put up new ones nowadays. This affects financial regulations, rules on how to govern the internet, tolerance of immigrants and non-tariff trade barriers. Britain’s largest bank, HSBC, is even thinking of returning its headquarters to Hong Kong.Meanwhile, that which most connects the world — cyberspace — is turning into its battlefield of choice. Rising powers are no likelier than the old Soviet Union to use nuclear weapons, or to deploy conventional armies, against the US. But the doctrine of mutually assured destruction has scant relevance to cyber warfare. Deterrence works when the culprit can be identified. Instead of a cold war, anonymity is fuelling a “cool war”, which gets a little less cool every year. The spread of cyber weapons — and the willingness of China and Russia to deploy them — presents a different kind of challenge to the “Golden Arches” concept. The hope was that mutual economic interests would persuade us to lay down our arms. In practice, diverging geopolitical ambitions are pulling in the other direction. Belligerent players can launch deniable attacks at a trivial economic cost. In a sense, this may be an elevated form of globalisation. But it is a far cry from what we once so cheerfully anticipated.edward.luce@ft.com
128;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-05-08T12:25:09Z;McDonald’s can sell burgers the way Obama wins votes;The problem that faces McDonald’s and its ilk is that younger Americans are turning against them;The Barack Obama era is growing curiouser and curiouser. Six years after the former community organiser moved into the White House, a strange form of mimicry has become evident in the land. Some of the leading corporate chief executives in the US are starting to sound as if they want to be local political activists themselves.The latest example is Steve Easterbrook, a 47-year-old product of Watford in England, who was installed this year as chief executive of McDonald’s after its US sales and share price slumped. Briefing Wall Street analysts this week on his plans, Mr Easterbrook sounded at times like a man perched atop a soapbox — pledging to act in solidarity with the people he serves in more than 100 countries around the world.Mr Easterbrook vowed repeatedly to transform McDonald’s into what he called a “modern progressive burger company” — a concept that he defined in surprisingly explicit political terms.His company, he said, will seek to “ be more progressive around our social purpose in order to deepen our relationships with communities on the issues that matter to them”. Or, as they say in business school: ¡Viva la Revolución!It’s a long way, of course, from two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a sesame-seed bun. But it has been a long time since such high-calorie sales pitches worked particularly well at McDonald’s or many of the other big US food and beverage purveyors — and desperate times call for desperate measures.The fundamental problem facing McDonald’s and its ilk is that younger Americans are turning against them. These consumers want fresher, organic fare, prepared by people they respect. Processed-food makers, industrial brewers and old-fashioned fast-food chains are all struggling to find ways to win over the millennial generation.The challenge for corporate leaders is to get on the right side of essentially left-leaning consumers without looking silly in the process. “Progressive” can be a pretty slippery little adjective — as many of us learned the hard way during the 1970s when the word was used to describe some of the pretentious rock bands to ever plug in a Moog synthesiser — and accidents will happen.Even a master marketer such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks was tripped up in March when he urged his employees to talk with customers about racism in the US. Widespread mockery followed in social media and Mr Shultz toned it down for a while (one wonders, however, whether the subsequent Baltimore riot chastened his critics).The challenge is to get on the right side of left-leaning consumers without looking silly in the processIn his brief time at the top, Mr Easterbrook has displayed a tendency to mix his messages, particularly on the question of his workers’ pay. In one of the first big moves of his tenure, McDonald’s said in April it would lift its minimum wage to $1 above the local standard at 1,500 company-owned outlets in the US (but not at the 12,500 US restaurants owned by franchise holders, who play by their own rules). As part of this week’s presentation, he outlined a plan to increase the percentage of stores around the world that are franchises to 90 per cent from 81 per cent.When asked whether any US stores would be “refranchised”, as McDonald’s puts it, a spokesperson, replying via email, said the “announcement does not largely affect the US, where we are already 89 per cent franchised”. With apologies to readers for that cumbersome construction (life was simpler when people spoke by phone!), I believe it means more company-owned US stores could become franchises, raising the possibility that some minimum-wage employees who thought they would be making more money could be in for a nasty surprise down the road.Yet however effective they ultimately prove, the Obama-esque public poses being struck by some of our corporate leaders are a fascinating sign of our marketing times. Chief executives such Mr Easterbrook or Mr Schultz could be talking about other things — reducing their taxes or their regulatory burden, for example — but they are opting instead to thrust their corporate fists into the air in the progressive manner. They undoubtedly have their reasons — and plenty of research to support them.To my mind, the resulting spectre serves as a reminder that for all the ups and downs of the Obama administration, the president remains one of the more successful marketers in American history. If you are trying to sell stuff to US consumers, particularly of the younger, poorer or non-white variety, you can do a lot worse than copy the “yes, we can” man.At the same time, I suspect this kind of corporate marketing can only serve Mr Obama’s own interests. When he ran for president, Mr Obama said he hoped to tilt the country’s political conversation to the left, just as Ronald Reagan shifted it to the right in the 1980s. The wannabe community organisers of the C-suites suggest he is having an effect.With less than two years to go in the Obama presidency, the progressive brand is doing well enough to rate a place among the offerings at McDonald’s. Go figure.gary.silverman@ft.com…Letter in response to this article:McDonald’s urged to reach millennials in landlord role / From Mark M Spradley
129;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s may struggle to replicate British success;Investors cautious over Steve Easterbrook’s formula for fast-food giant;Remember those fuchsia and red T-shirt-clad volunteers at the London Olympics back in 2012 who won so much admiration for their cheery help guiding visitors to and from the sporting events?They were trained by McDonald’s UK, which was at the time being run by Steve Easterbrook, who pushed to rid the company of the negativity surrounding “McJobs” — a phrase used to depict low-status jobs — by introducing much more staff training.Mr Easterbrook was credited with transforming McDonald’s UK business between 2006 and 2011 from being a purveyor of “fast-food junk” to “family-friendly food”, as Maureen Hinton, global research director at research agency Conlumino, says.But he now faces a more daunting task. He must resuscitate the reputation of the entire company. The brand of the world’s largest restaurant chain by market value, which is more than twice the size of Yum Brands, KFC’s owner, has soured amid scandals in Asia and a global revolution in consumer tastes.Investors were underwhelmed this week when Mr Easterbrook unveiled his recipe for revival, involving cost cuts and reorganising the business structure to reduce bureaucracy. The company is targeting $300m in net annual savings by the end of 2018.Mr Easterbrook says he will use the UK as a “major market pacesetter” for his global plans. Some analysts say the British market, in which McDonald’s is still the biggest restaurant chain, is a good model to follow.Under Mr Easterbrook’s leadership, the UK operation went back to basics, analysts say, by focusing on customers. McDonald’s UK spent hundreds of millions of dollars on making stores more contemporary, introducing products such as coffee and cappuccinos, working with farmers to improve standards and open up to consumers about the supply chain, while engaging directly in the growing debate over the growing health concerns of fast food.He also realised that McDonald’s was not just competing against fast food restaurants but with everything from gourmet burgers to Starbucks, Nandos and sandwich shops, says Peter Martin at industry analyst Coffer Peach. He says while Mr Easterbrook still has to prove himself in the top job, he has plenty of ambition.“Can anyone do a big job like that — it’s one of the biggest companies on the planet?” Mr Martin asks. “He’s the best placed of anyone I know to do it.”But Mr Easterbrook’s goal scoring in the UK and Europe will not necessarily translate into home runs in the US and the rest of the world.In the UK, McDonald’s benefited from the shift to cheaper eating during the recession that followed the financial crisis. The casual dining market still has lower per capita spending than the US, so there is plenty of room for growth, analysts said.There was a lack of detail and focus on the consumer in Mr Easterbrook’s plans, according to Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy.Some aspects, such as menu changes, local decision making and local sourcing “would resonate in most markets”, he said. However, much of what the company said on job cuts and streamlining was reminiscent of what private equity group 3G has done with Burger King.“It didn’t seem to have the next big innovation,” Mr Hottovy says. “It seemed to be keeping up with its peers instead of showing something brand new.”McDonald’s also faces the more immediate task of putting a line under scandals in China and Japan. In China, the company found that one of its suppliers had been relabelling expired meat, while in Japan consumers found objects including a human tooth in its products. This is something it did not face in the UK.“After food scandals, it is hard to get consumer confidence and loyalty back — if at all,” says one branding executive, specialising in the Asian region.
130;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s revival recipe leaves investors hungry for more;New chief promises to restructure, cut costs and create ‘a modern, progressive burger company’;McDonald’s has pledged to restructure and cut costs in a long-awaited plan to revive flagging sales, but analysts questioned whether its new chief executive had done enough to catch up with a revolution in consumer tastes that he admitted it had failed to navigate.“In the last five years, the world has moved faster outside the business than inside,” Steve Easterbrook said in a 23-minute video on Monday. “I will not shy away from the urgent need to reset this business.”The British chief executive, who took over from Don Thompson in March, said the plan to become a “modern, progressive burger company” acknowledged the reality that “our recent performance has been poor”.McDonald’s sales have suffered in recent years as US consumers shifted from burgers and fries to food they perceive to be healthier. Mr Easterbrook said new marketing and menu items would highlight its use of fresher and more natural ingredients.Analysts applauded the $300m in annual cost savings the company plans to deliver by 2017, and a restructuring that will allow it to focus on its most important markets. Yet by the close of trading on Monday, shares were down 1.7 per cent following the announcement, as some analysts saw the plan as sparse on details, given the expectations that had been building since Mr Easterbrook’s appointment.Standard & Poor’s also downgraded the company’s credit rating from A to A- after it said it would ratchet up share buybacks to return $8bn-$9bn to shareholders this year. S&P said it could cut the rating another notch if US and Chinese sales do not pick up.“We think the big challenge will be wooing millennials and turning around [comparable] store sales,” said Efraim Levy, analyst at S&P Capital IQ. Traditional fast-food joints like McDonald’s are losing millennial consumers to so-called fast-casual restaurants like burrito chain Chipotle, which are growing two to three times as fast.Under Mr Easterbrook’s plan, the company will be reorganised into four segments, grouping markets with similar characteristics. The two biggest, each accounting for 40 per cent of operating income, are the US and “international lead markets” including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK.High-growth markets — China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands — account for 10 per cent of operating income, while the “foundational markets” segment includes about 100 other countries.“Having clusters of similar markets run by a single person will create urgency and speed”, Mr Easterbrook said, helping McDonald’s remove layers of bureaucracy.The company will also accelerate refranchising, bringing the total to 90 per cent of restaurants by 2018, from 81 per cent today, while opening 1,000 new restaurants a year.“The business cannot ignore what customers are saying when the message is clear — we are not on our game,” Mr Easterbrook said.Mark Kalinowski, of Janney Capital Markets, wrote to investors that while the company had offered “broad commentary” and some details, it was not as much “as many had hoped for”.Mr Easterbrook had already announced a number of moves intended to revive the brand, including revamping the chain’s complicated menu, new marketing campaigns and curbing the use of antibiotics in its chicken.But the efforts have done little so far to lift sagging US same-store sales, which fell 2.6 per cent in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarterly sales decline in a row.Some decisions seem to have backfired, including the move to raise wages for around 90,000 employees at McDonald’s-owned restaurants, which has come under fire because it does not affect workers at franchisee-owned outlets.The company has also struggled overseas, with same-store sales falling 0.6 per cent in Europe and 8.3 per cent in Asia in the first quarter. The company’s image has been hit by a chicken nugget scandal in China, while objects including a human tooth and pieces of vinyl have been found in its food in Japan.Mr Easterbrook previously led a turnround of the group’s UK operations, and he said his home market would serve as a major market pacesetter for global plans.
131;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;McDonald’s China supplier hit with record fine for pollution;French fries maker penalised by Beijing city council for water pollution;McDonald’s is facing more brand damage in China after one of its suppliers was slapped by Beijing’s largest environmental protection fine for violating water pollution regulations.Beijing Simplot, a Chinese joint venture involving J.R. Simplot of the US, supplies French fries and hash browns to McDonald’s in China, one of its biggest global markets.McDonald’s sales in China slumped last year after a meat supplier suspended operations following a media report alleging that workers doctored labels on expired meat supplied to the US company and to Yum Brands’ KFC, China’s biggest foreign fast-food chain.The latest scandal involved not food quality but environmental regulations — another sensitive topic in China as public opposition is growing to air and water pollution.State media reported that the chip supplier had allowed polluted water to flow into city pipes where it was processed by a waste water treatment plant. Beijing Simplot said it had accepted and paid the Rmb4m ($650,000) fine imposed by the Beijing city government, its highest environmental protection fine.“As soon as we discovered that we had a waste water issue, we co-operated with the local environmental protection authority, shut down the waste water discharge and transported excess waste water to an approved facility for processing,” the company said.“McDonald’s China takes this infraction by Simplot very seriously,” McDonald’s said, adding that “all McDonald’s suppliers must comply with all relevant local laws and regulations”.Recent scandals have dented the reputation of foreign fast food brands, which have long traded on an image of providing better cleanliness and higher quality than local chains.The negative headlines have exacerbated rising market pressures on foreign food brands also hit by escalating competition from local players, rising rents, labour shortages, and a fundamental change in the way urban Chinese prefer to dine.McDonald’s said last week that global sales dropped in the three months to the end of March, reflecting “ negative guest traffic”, including in China.“I think this is going to have a negative impact on sales,” said Benjamin Cavender of China Market Research in Shanghai, adding that the scandal was “going to make it that much harder for the company to restore consumer confidence in the brand”.A raft of local fast-food chains are building market share in the highly fragmented Chinese market, offering food that is closer to local tastes and marketing themselves as healthier.A recent report from Mintel noted “a fundamental shift towards healthier Chinese-style cooking is redefining the fast-food industry, and consequently propelling domestic fast-food chains to challenge the foreign fast-food leaders”.Additional reporting by Jackie Cai

Apple, the world’s most valuable company, reports results on Monday and warned in January that the currency move could slice more than $2bn from quarterly revenues.So far during the current reporting period, General Motors, IBM, Procter & Gamble, Amazon and Johnson & Johnson have experienced $1bn-plus haircuts on sales as they translated revenues earned abroad back into US dollar terms.Known as “top-line growth”, revenues reflect how quickly a business is growing. In recent years, large multinational US company’s sales have benefited from the combination of a weaker dollar and robust expansion across emerging market economies.However, a sustained rise in the dollar since last summer and weakening global activity has weighed heavily on a host of blue-chip US companies.While 71 per cent of S&P 500 companies have eclipsed first-quarter earnings expectations, 55 per cent of corporates have failed to beat revenue forecasts, according to S&P Capital IQ.“Top-line growth is incredibly challenged. The dollar is even a bigger problem than people thought,’’ said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG.However, US equities indices have reclaimed record territory, with investors cheered by overall earnings topping lowered expectations of analysts. The S&P 500 closed last week at a new peak of 2,117.69, while the Nasdaq has surpassed the dotcom bubble high set in 2000.“While earnings are not great, they’re better than expected,’’ said Mr Greenhaus.The analysis of earnings statements, slide presentations, conference calls and executive commentary spanned more than 100 of the roughly 190 S&P 500 constituents that have reported first-quarter results.The FT analysis showed a $20.1bn reduction in sales, which would have lifted the groups’ reported revenues of $762bn by 2.6 per cent. When excluding financials, sales would have been more than 3 per cent higher. While the technology industry has been particularly exposed to the shift in the dollar — it generates more of its sales abroad than any other sector — a broad swath of companies have warned of the effects.$20.1bnReduction in sales of the more than 100 S&P 500 constituents that have reported so farMcDonald’s, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Tyco, Coca-Cola, Kimberly-Clark, 3M, Caterpillar and PepsiCo were among the dozens that pointed to currency swings when delivering results.“Currency has been powerful headwind for all multinational companies,” said Dan Kelley, portfolio manager at Fidelity. “It is something companies are having to think differently about — what the implications are going forward and whether it makes sense to alter their cost structures.”Only half of the companies disclosed enough information to calculate the dollar’s effect on sales — itself a somewhat nebulous figure as executives must consider changes to underlying operations, volume of goods sold and divestitures or acquisitions along with foreign exchange swings.

Revenues advanced by a fifth to $1.1bn, with volumes at the average restaurant reaching $2.5m.Analysts on Wall Street had expected the chain to report earnings of $3.63 a share on sales of $1.1bn.Chipotle is a momentum-driven stock, having gained more than 400 per cent in the past five years. However, investors have grown more cautious as same-store sales growth at the company declined for the second consecutive quarter.Shares of Chipotle, which have climbed 26 per cent in the past year, declined more than 7 per cent to $641.23.Boeing shares fell 1.4 per cent to $151.19, after the company said first-quarter profits climbed as it delivered more aircraft.Profits rose to $1.3bn, or 1.97 a share, from $965m, or $1.28 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 8 per cent to $22.1bn.Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $1.77 a share, on sales of $22.5bn.Revenues at its commercial aerospace business climbed 21 per cent in the period to $15.4bn.Shares of McDonald’s were buoyed by promises of a “turnround plan”, despite reporting first-quarter results that missed Wall Street forecasts.The company said Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, would reveal the plan “to improve our performance and deliver enduring profitable growth” on May 4.The announcement came alongside an 11 per cent drop in sales to $5.95bn for the three months to the end of March. Net income fell by a third to $811.5m, or 84 cents per share. McDonald’s shares rose 3 per cent to $97.84.Disappointing first-quarter results pushed shares of Intuitive Surgical more than 5 per cent lower to $516.93.The surgical robot maker reported profits of $97m or $2.57 a share, on sales of $532.1m. This fell short of estimates for earnings of $2.59 a share, on sales of $536.4m.Technology and energy stocks led the S&P 500, as US stocks fluctuated between gains and losses.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 2,107.96 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 18,038.27.

134;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s sees drop in customers as scandals start to bite;Global chain struggles to overcome controversy and the switch to healthier alternatives;"McDonald’s has tried to overhaul an image mired by a chicken nugget scandal in China; objects, ranging from a human tooth to pieces of vinyl, found in its food in Japan; and protests over wages in the US. But customers are not biting.The world’s biggest fast-food chain said global sales dropped in the three months to the end of March, reflecting “negative guest traffic”.Revenue fell 11 per cent to $5.95bn compared with the same quarter last year, while net income plunged a third to $812m, or 84 cents per share. Earnings, excluding some items, were $1.01 per share, missing analyst forecasts of $1.06 per share. The strong dollar compounded McDonald’s performance, pulling earnings per share down $0.09, the company said.It was the third consecutive quarter of declining sales and the fifth quarter of profit falls for McDonald’s, whose cheap burgers and fries have lost lustre among consumers, particularly millennials, seeking healthier alternatives.However, shares in McDonald’s rose 3.1 per cent on Wednesday in anticipation of a turnround strategy that Steve Easterbrook, the company’s new chief executive, said would be unveiled on May 4.“We need to act now,” Mr Easterbrook told an investor earnings call. “We intend to make meaningful impact with customers and how they perceive our brand and our food.”Mr Easterbrook, who took the helm on March 1, has announced moves to revive McDonald’s brand — including curbing the use of antibiotics in its chickens, revamping the menu and a marketing campaign to pay for food with “lovin”. He also announced plans to raise wages for workers in McDonald’s-owned restaurants.But his efforts have done little so far to turn around revenues in the chain’s core US market, where like-for-like sales fell 2.6 per cent in the first quarter, compared with the same quarter last year. McDonald’s has suffered six like-for-like US sales quarterly declines in a row.Like-for-like sales in Europe slipped 0.6 per cent but tumbled 8.3 per cent in Asia.The weak start to the year follows an ugly 2014, when the company recorded its first annual same-store sales decline in a dozen years amid stiff competition in the US from Chipotle and Shake Shack, and declining customer traffic in China and Japan, where meat safety concerns damaged its reputation.McDonald’s said last week it would close 131 underperforming stores in Japan, its second biggest market, and warned that it expected global like-for-like sales in April to be negative."

In February the company did a deal with Mr Brand to produce a 45-minute podcast every Wednesday and Sunday.The company said that had more than 2,400 active content partners by the end of March — an increase of more than 150 during the month. Recent additions include BBC Radio 4’s Six O’Clock News and the Wimbledon Tennis Championships.Rob Proctor, Audioboom chief executive, said the figures “show the progress we have made in a short period of time, with March being comfortably our best month since launch”.
136;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-04-16T10:30:36Z;Japan McDonald’s to axe stores and jobs amid widening losses;Burger chain world’s largest restaurant group to shutter 131 outlets and axe and will aim to reduce about 100 jobs, jobs in Japan amid fallout from food-safety scandals;In contrast to a recent move to raise wages for its US employees, McDonald’s in Japan is enacting a more stringent performance-based pay for workers and forecast a widening of losses in its second-biggest market.The fast-food chain on Thursday said it would close 131 underperforming stores in Japan and axe 100 jobs, amid the fallout from a string of food-safety scandals.McDonald’s Japan — which has 3,100 outlets and 2,700 employees in the country — said it expected its net loss to widen from Y21.8bn in 2014 to Y38bn ($318m) this year, on sales forecast to contract 10 per cent. Last year’s loss was its first swing to the red in 11 years.McDonald’s will also renovate 500 stores this year, and said it was unsure of the size of its 2015 dividend, given the grim outlook for the restaurant chain.The Japanese unit, half owned by its US parent, has implemented a six-month pay cut of 20 per cent for Sarah Casanova, its chief executive, while other executives will have their monthly salary reduced by up to 15 per cent.The struggling burger chain has grappled with declining sales worldwide amid changing consumer tastes and questions over the quality of its products.In Japan, McDonald’s had enjoyed nearly a decade of strong growth but sales began slowing as consumers became disgruntled with its service and food offerings.Its troubles were exacerbated by a chicken safety scare at its China-based supplier last July, and an incident earlier this year when objects — including a human tooth and pieces of vinyl — were mixed inside its products.Sales at Japanese stores have fallen for 14 consecutive months with the decline accelerating this year. Sales fell 29 per cent in February and March after sliding 39 per cent in January year-on-year.Ms Casanova said she hopes to return the company to profitability by 2016 through “every measure possible” from improving the menu line-up and renovating 2,000 stores over the next four years.McDonald’s Japan also said that a revamped pay system would result in salary cuts for employees with low productivity, while wages for high-performing workers would be raised. Last year, wage levels were unchanged regardless of the performance of its employees.The move in Japan comes in the wake of McDonald’s decision this month to raise its US minimum wage to $1 more than the local standard for 90,000 workers at 1,500 company-owned restaurants.The nationwide protests over raising the minimum wage have deepened McDonald’s home market challenges, with protesters criticising the increase for applying to just 10 per cent of the company’s US stores.Letter in response to this report:Extraordinary example of worker productivity / From Stanley M Guralnick
137;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-04-14T18:19:06Z;US labour: High stakes on low pay;Social media becomes a battleground at loggerheadsover raising wages for millions of low-income workers;"The class struggle has come to this: the leading business lobbying organisation in the US is now preparing to step up its scrutiny of the tweets and selfies served up by burger flippers and fry cooks across the land.The impetus for the surveillance comes from protests planned on Wednesday in more than 200 cities by activists seeking an increase in pay to $15 an hour for McDonald’s and other low-income workers. Funded by the Service Employees International Union, the group known as “Fight for $15”, promises “the biggest mobilisation of low-wage workers in US history” — complete with one-day strikes and “die-ins” — to dramatise the plight of Americans who struggle to make ends meet on the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.The US Chamber of Commerce will be monitoring social media so that it can respond to any online pictures or accounts of the action that it believes to be exaggerated. Of particular concern, says Glenn Spencer, vice-president of the chamber’s workforce freedom initiative, is the possibility that union activists will quickly move from event to event, creating the impression of a mass grassroots uprising for casual observers following the action on the web.“We pay attention to the tweets and photos the other side puts up,” Mr Spencer says. “You need to be more attentive to what is going on online. If they are claiming 200 cities, we start looking through their Twitter feeds, and you gather it is more like 60. There are some where you can tell pretty clearly it’s 10 guys with a selfie stick.”Whatever the offline reality, the cyber battle to gain support from the American people points to one of the more surprising developments in recent US labour history. After decades of relentless decline the push by the unions for a higher minimum wage is gaining currency. And their use of social media to rally their troops and to court public opinion is working.The Fight for $15 effort traces its roots to November 2012, when 200 fast-food workers in New York — assisted, but not represented, by the 2m-member SEIU — staged one-day strikes in support of higher wages. Meanwhile, non-union retailer Walmart was being targeted by a similar effort, called “OUR Walmart”, backed by the 1.3m-member United Food and Commercial Workers union.The big pay-off for the campaigners came in February, when Walmart said it would spend $1bn to lift its minimum wage to $9 this year, benefiting about half a million of its workers. McDonald’s then said this month that it would raise its minimum wage to $1 more than the local standard for about 90,000 workers at 1,500 company-owned restaurants, The move, however, did not affect workers at the 90 per cent of its outlets that are owned by franchise holders.Although President Barack Obama’s call for a $10.10-an-hour federal minimum wage has little chance of success in the Republican-controlled Congress, more left-leaning cities such as San Francisco and Seattle have approved measures that will lift their minimum wage to $15 later this decade.Such successes are out of character for the US labour movement. Unionisation rates have fallen from nearly 35 per cent of wage and salary earners in the 1950s to 11.3 per cent last year. Only 6.6 per cent of private sector workers belong to a union. Even in the old industrial Midwest, the movement is losing its appeal. In March Wisconsin became the 25th state to enact a “right-to-work” law, making it harder for unions to negotiate contracts requiring that all workers belong to a union or pay union dues as a condition of employment.Yet the minimum-wage campaigns show US unions are capable of making lemonade with the lemons available. Instead of simply protecting the prerogatives of their shrivelling ranks, they are seeking benefits for workers that they do not represent. It is a risky strategy because there is no guarantee that the workers being helped will ever wind up paying dues to any union. The achievement at this point, according to one of the architects of the successful Seattle minimum-wage campaign, is starting to repair the public image of a labour movement that has lost its lustre.“We aren’t winning dues, we are winning workers,” says David Rolf, president of SEIU Local 775, representing 43,000 long-term healthcare workers in Washington and Montana. “One of the criticisms I would have about the incumbent labour movement is that it was all too often concerned about members first and not justice for all. If we want to rebuild the brand, we have to make the reality different. Too many unions were about the 400-page contract for their members and didn’t care about anyone else.”The union argument today is that the minimum wage is not a living wage. A study released this week by the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley, found that the US government spends $153bn a year on food stamps and other assistance for low-wage workers, many of whom are adults raising children.Jessica Davis, 26, who supports a son on the $9.28 an hour she earns at a McDonald’s in Chicago, says she joined Fight for $15 after being approached by an organiser at the restaurant where she works. “Although I always thought I deserved better as an employee, I didn’t know other people felt the same way,” she says. “I went to a meeting and found a lot of people felt the same way.”The corporate case against raising the minimum wage boils down to simple mathematics; lifting wages for workers at the lowest rung means fewer people can be hired. But union arguments are being buttressed by economists who say paying more can reduce turnover, increase productivity and lure discouraged workers back on to payrolls.The minimum wage issue is also gaining prominence in other developed economies as they struggle with the weak average wage growth that has followed the financial crisis. Germany has introduced its first national minimum wage in response to a rise in low-paid jobs over the past decade. In the UK, low pay will be a key issue in next month’s general election.The US campaign to increase the minimum wage has clearly been aided by the emergence of social media. Even as the influence of the institutional labour movement is eroding, wage earners today only need a smartphone to shape history — and shake up the Chamber of Commerce.Without this means of communication, for example, minimum-wage employees would be difficult to organise. Many work irregular shifts and some lack a fixed address, “couch surfing” with friends or relatives or sleeping in shelters or on the streets, according to Kendall Fells, organising director of the Fight for $15. Yet with a mobile phone, such employees can keep in touch with each other and influence people in places they could never afford to visit.“I have been fascinated seeing workers spontaneously engaging in actions in different parts of the country because they see workers doing things,” says Ken Jacobs, chair of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley. “There are some places where no organisers have been.”This transformation of workers into opinion shapers can also hit businesses where it hurts. Gone are the days when corporations such as Walmart or McDonald’s could dominate the discussion about their brands with a stream of 30-second advertisements on a small number of television networks. Consumers, particularly of the millennial variety, are relying on social media contacts for information about brands, and that increases the incentives for employers to keep their workers from complaining about their lives — either at work, or on Twitter or Facebook.The name of the game in corporate public relations today is to be seen as a “progressive employer”, says Marian Salzman, chief executive of Havas PR North America. Raising the minimum wage or granting other benefits makes workers less likely to join a union and more inclined to sing the praises of their company. “It’s almost like the greatest defence is an offence,” she says.Jim Stengel, former global marketing officer at Procter & Gamble and now chief executive of an eponymous consultancy, says brands benefit from employee “advocates”. He adds: “High-growth companies look at their people in a different way — as an extension of the brand. Advocacy is great marketing. Now, when it is very complicated to get a mass audience, it is very important.”Walmart raised its minimum wage because it was worried about the quality of service in its stores, believes Brian Yarbrough, analyst at the Edward Jones brokerage. “They have come to realise that having happier and more engaged employees will lead to better customer service, less turnover, fewer training costs,” he says.The question facing the unions is what they will make of the opportunities created by the appeal of the minimum-wage campaign.Mr Fells — who is “on loan” from SEIU, as he puts it, to help Fight for $15 — emphasises that the effort has two goals: raising the wages of low-income workers; and securing the rights of such people “to form a union without retaliation from their employers”.The US Chamber of Commerce believes the latter reason is the true purpose of the movement. Mr Spencer said the protests are the “public relations offshoot” of a broader campaign to end the current legal separation between fast-food franchises and their corporate parents and push them to negotiate with the SEIU. “I would suggest these new protests are not a new movement,” he says. “They are a means to an end and that end is for the SEIU to get collective bargaining rights for fast-food workers.”However, more sympathetic observers hold out the possibility that the labour movement is evolving, becoming more of a social movement that might one day unite low-wage workers from various sectors into a unified force.Nelson Lichtenstein, history professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, sees parallels with the strategy of unions in the Progressive era of the early 20th century, before legislation in the 1930s made it easier for them to secure collective bargaining rights.“We are dealing with one labour market now,” he says. “If they improve the labour market at the bottom, it makes it easier to negotiate their next contract in some hospital, or organise janitors somewhere else. That was the idea of the Progressive era — let’s improve the situation for the entire working class.”The challenge, he adds, is to find an institutional framework that will support such new activity, an assessment that is shared by Mr Rolf of the SEIU in Seattle. He believes unions need to engage urgently in a variety of experiments — “rapid prototyping”, he calls it — to find new ways of raising revenue now that collective bargaining units have lost so much of their influence. “We can debate whether the labour movement was assassinated or committed suicide,” Mr Rolf says. “It was probably some combination of both. But we need new models.”It could turn out to be an impossible dream. New business models could elude Mr Rolf and his fellow campaigners and the long decline of the US labour movement might gain pace. But until their fate becomes clearer, it is a good bet these activist-unionists will retain their Twitter followers in high places. They could be on to something."
138;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Rising demand for protein fattens Cargill’s profit;Australian beef venture benefits as imports to US and Asia rise;A resurgent meat business has propelled a one-third rise in net profit at Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural commodities company, reflecting how demand for animal protein continues to grow even as emerging economies slow down.Privately owned Cargill’s sprawling food business includes operations that raise and slaughter pigs and produce Chicken McNuggets for McDonald’s. Its meat and animal nutrition divisions led the company to a net profit of $425m in its third quarter ending February 28, up 33 per cent from $319m a year ago.Cargill’s beef processing joint venture with Teys Bros of Australia was among the businesses buttressing performance. A drought in Australia forced cattle owners to sell herds to its slaughterhouses, boosting supply, a Cargill spokeswoman said. Beef processors tend to improve their profitability when they run at higher volumes.Australia’s weaker dollar also drove beef exports to countries including the US, which puts Australian beef in hamburgers, and to Asia. Australia is the predominant foreign supplier of beef to China, where beef imports have risen by a factor of five in the past three years.Global meat consumption is growing as populations and incomes rise. The need to feed herds and flocks is also spurring greater world trade of grains such as sorghum and barley, primarily used in livestock feed.The US Department of Agriculture on Thursday raised its estimate of sorghum exports by 50m bushels to “accommodate the continuing strong demand from China”, it said.Cargill’s origination and processing division, which buys grain from farmers and ships it around the world, also improved results from a year ago as it handled last year’s record US crops.Cargill noted that the economic slowdown in China, Brazil and Indonesia and the stronger US dollar had reduced earnings in its food ingredients business, which makes products including sweeteners, starches, flour and cocoa.David MacLennan, chief executive, said: “Faced with slowing growth and currency shifts in a range of markets, our food segment lagged expectations.”Meanwhile, the company’s recently reorganised energy team rebounded as it traded through the recent plunge in oil prices, the company said.The North American beef processing industry, in which Cargill ranks second, has struggled with excess capacity in the face of a cattle herd that has just begun to rebuild after years of decline. During its latest quarter Cargill divested a Texas cattle feedlot near a slaughterhouse it idled in 2013.Cargill’s meat business was caught up in a recent scandal over foreign objects found in food sold at McDonald’s in Japan. Cargill said a piece of blue plastic found in one McNugget had not come from one of its production facilities.
139;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s to raise wages for 90,000 US workers;Increase of at least $1 an hour follows Walmart’s move to lift pay;McDonald’s will raise the wages of roughly 90,000 employees in the US, as the struggling burger chain follows the likes of Walmart in lifting pay amid a national debate over income inequality.The world’s largest restaurant group will pay employees at the 1,500 stores that it owns at least $1 an hour more than the local minimum wage beginning July 1, and will allow them to accrue paid time off. The increase will raise the average US employee wage from around $9 to more than $10 by the end of next year.Critics have already blasted the increase because it does not apply to employees who work at the roughly 13,000 US outlets owned by franchisees, who the company says are free to set their own wages. Those employees will be eligible for a new education financial aid programme.The move comes a month after Steve Easterbrook took over as chief executive amid a two-year slump in sales growth. The British Mr Easterbrook pledged to work urgently to turn the business round and revive McDonald’s image amid a revolution in consumer tastes.“We are acting with a renewed sense of energy and purpose to turn our business around,” Mr Easterbrook said. “We know that a motivated workforce leads to better customer service so we believe this initial step not only benefits our employees, it will improve the McDonald’s restaurant experience.”The company has become the main target of a national campaign that advocates for a $15 minimum wage and union rights for low-wage workers, coming under fire at strikes and walkouts across the country over the past two years.The campaign, which is planning a new round of strikes in 200 cities on April 15, criticised the hike for applying to just 10 per cent of US stores. Supporters issued a statement by a McDonald’s worker in North Carolina in response to the increase.We’re going to keep fighting until we win $15 and union rights for all fast-food workers and our families“Because we joined together and stood up, McDonald’s was forced to raise pay. Still, this is too little to make a real difference, and covers only a fraction of workers,” said Kwanza Brooks, who earns $7.25 an hour, the federal minimum.“It’s a weak move for a company that made $5.6bn in profits last year. We’re going to keep fighting until we win $15 and union rights for all fast-food workers and our families.”McDonald’s joins Target, TJ Maxx, Gap and Ikea in raising wages. In February, Walmart, the largest private sector employer in the US, said it would spend $1bn to boost the wages of half a million low-paid workers to at least $10 by early 2016.President Barack Obama, who has called income inequality “the defining challenge of our time”, applauded Walmart’s decision. He has been unable to convince a Republican-controlled Congress to raise the federal level to $10.10 an hour.But raising the minimum wage has become a bipartisan issue outside of Washington. In January, 29 states introduced their own higher minimum wage bills, including GOP-dominated states like Arkansas and Nebraska and liberal outposts like Oregon.McDonald’s shares closed down more than 1 per cent.

A host of new entrants is piling into the business of providing time-pressed consumers with their caffeine shots.Pubs are stepping up investment in the segment, fast-food operators are improving their coffee offerings, and even the baker Greggs is revamping its shops to get in on the act, fuelled by Britons’ growing thirst for coffee outside the home.About 1.7bn cups of coffee are sold each year in the UK from more than 18,000 outlets, a total set to grow to almost 21,000 by 2020, according to Allegra Strategies, the consultancy.Compared with the rest of Europe, even this is small beans. In the UK people consume an average 2.8kg of coffee each year, far less than 12.2kg per capita in Finland.At the top end, specialist coffee retailers charge premium prices for high-quality beans, but in the rest of the sector, pubs and fast-food chains are jostling for market share with cut-price coffee that can often still compete on flavour.“The gap [in coffee quality] between the premium coffee purveyors and the likes of McDonald’s is much narrower now,” says Simon Matthews, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers.Costa is the market leader, with almost 2,000 stores in the UK and like-for-like growth of 6 per cent for the 50 weeks to February 12. The chain, owned by Whitbread, has plans to open another 250 stores worldwide in the next financial year.But it is now facing competition from some unlikely quarters. Last week JD Wetherspoon, the cut-price pub chain, brought the coffee price war to the boil by cutting the price of its Lavazza filter coffee to 99p, with free refills.The gap [in coffee quality] between the premium coffee purveyors and the likes of McDonald’s is much narrower nowThe company now sells almost 1m coffees a week and more people visit the pubs for breakfast than Pret A Manger or Caffè Nero, according to CGA Peach, the food and drinks consultancy.By the end of 2016, chairman Tim Martin aims to triple its coffee and breakfast sales, further blurring the distinction between pub and coffee shop.Wetherspoon already sells almost as much coffee as it does real ale, he says, even before the price cut.“It’s possible we’ll be selling more coffee than draught beer in 15 years, which will make pub aficionados blanch,” he adds.Peter Martin, director at CGA Peach, says the chain should be treated as a serious contender in the coffee market.“[The coffee] may be at an attractive price point, but it doesn’t mean to say they’re playing at it and it isn’t good quality,” he says.1.25mCups of coffee sold by Fuller’s annuallyOther pubs have taken a similar path. Fuller’s, the brewery and pub chain, now sells more than 1.25m cups a year and opened a coffee shop last October as a centre to train its staff as baristas.But pubs are not the only sector chasing consumer demand for breakfasts, food-on-the-go, and above all coffee.“It doesn’t matter where you go, specialist chains, fast-food operators, we’re all looking to offer coffee because customers want it,” says Roger Whiteside, chief executive of Greggs.When he joined the company in 2013, Mr Whiteside abandoned the trial of a sit-down coffee shop format and instead set about revamping the entire estate to make it easier to sell coffee and food-on-the-go. Over the next two years the remaining 400 stores of its 1,650 estate will be completed.Coffee is its fastest-selling product line, and has been growing at double digit rates for six years, though Mr Whiteside declined to put a precise figure on the growth. Last year, Greggs sold £1m-worth of coffee each week.It doesn’t matter where you go, specialist chains, fast-food operators, we’re all looking to offer coffee because customers want itAlthough the coffee comes cheap, often as part of meal deals, Mr Whiteside says they cannot rely on low prices to attract coffee drinkers.“If we want people to drink our coffee, it has to be as good as the coffee operators,” says Mr Whiteside.In turn the coffee operators have had to up their game, says Mark Brumby, an independent analyst at Langton Capital. “There’s no market for bad service and bad coffee. There’s just so much choice,” he says.That choice has encouraged Starbucks to focus on “dessert drinks” to differentiate themselves from the wide availability of good coffee on the market, according to Mintel, the market research company.Despite the increased activity, the coffee sector is still far from saturation, says Stuart Gordon, an analyst at Berenberg.The average spend in a coffee shop continues to rise and consumers are also visiting coffee shops more frequently, he adds. Five years ago, one in nine people visited a coffee shop daily. That has risen to 1 in 5 people.“More importantly this growth has not been slowing,” he says. “In a nutshell it does not look like we are anywhere near saturation despite the mushrooming number of options.”
141;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Halfords recruits Jill McDonald as CEO;Head of McDonald’s UK operation tapped to replace Matt Davies;Halfords has ended its two-month search for a chief executive by poaching Jill McDonald from McDonald’s, after Matt Davies defected to Tesco to rebuild its flagging UK business.Ms McDonald (pictured) has headed McDonald’s UK business since 2010, as well as being president of the fast food giant’s north west Europe division. She has been with McDonald’s since 2006, joining initially as chief marketing officer for the UK and northern Europe. She will switch burgers for bikes when she joins Halfords, the cycling and car maintenance group, on May 11.Mr Davies, who dispensed with half the senior management team and oversaw a share price rise of 30 per cent during his two-year reign, joins Tesco in June. He had been widely credited with the continuing growth of Halfords, which has also been spurred by the booming popularity of cycling in the UK.In its most recent trading update in January, Halfords said revenues had risen 6.5 per cent over the 15 weeks to January 9, buoyed by cycling sales and a record quarter for its car-maintenance division. In December, it relaunched its premium Cycle Republic chain, alongside 464 customer stores across the UK and Ireland, following an 11 per cent boost to pre-tax profits at its half-year results in November.“I’m really excited that we have attracted someone of Jill’s calibre who will build on what we’ve achieved over the past few years and we all really look forward to working with her,” said Dennis Millard, Halford’s chairman.“Halfords is a business and brand that resonates with me and the UK public and I am delighted to be joining the company,” said Ms McDonald, who is also a non-executive director of InterContinental Hotels Group.“Halfords has already made significant progress in delivering its service-led growth strategy and I look forward to joining such a strong team to continue to build on that success.”Ms McDonald’s appointment brings the number of female FTSE 250 companies to eight. She will be paid a £500,000 salary, and a bonus and share award of up to 150 per cent of her salary. She will also be handed £165,000 to compensate her for her existing long-term incentives and share options at McDonald’s.Mr Davies gave up his bonus for this financial year and his share incentive scheme is set to lapse after his departure. His pay last year was £1.37m, including a £736,000 bonus.Halfords’ shares were flat during early trading in London at 453.5p.
142;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-03-09T13:55:46Z;McDonald’s warns of ‘urgent’ need for change;Sales fall more than expected, driven by US decline;McDonald’s warned it faced an “urgent” need to change in an attempt to win back customers as it reported a drop in monthly sales that was much larger than expected.The fast-food chain said on Monday global sales dropped 1.7 per cent in February, much worse than the 0.3 per cent fall that analysts had forecast.Its performance was hit by sharp drops in the US and Asia-Pacific, where sales fell 4 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively.The news comes just days after Steve Easterbrook took over as chief executive. He replaces Don Thompson, whose roughly 3-year tenure saw the world’s largest restaurant chain struggle to navigate big changes in consumer tastes.The company is facing problems in many of its main markets. It blamed “ongoing aggressive competitive activity” for the poor performance in the US, its biggest market, and said it was taking action “designed to deliver renewed energy and focus around the elements of the restaurant experience that matters most to customers”.US consumers are opting for food that is perceived to be more natural and healthy at fast-casual restaurants that offer organic options. That segment is growing at two-to-three times the rate traditional fast-food restaurants are, as shown by the explosive growth of burrito chain Chipotle.But McDonald’s problems are global. The weak performance in Asia was “primarily” due to a “broad-based consumer perception issue in Japan”, where it has had recent problems with suppliers. This was partly offset by a boost from the timing of Chinese new year, which helped lift sales in China and other markets.“Consumer needs and preferences have changed, and McDonald’s current performance reflects the urgent need to evolve with today’s consumers, reset strategic priorities and restore business momentum,” the company said.Europe proved a bright spot, with a better showing in the UK and Germany driving sales up 0.7 per cent. It said it had suffered a “negative result” in Russia, where it was put under investigation by the consumer protection agency and is now the focus of dozens of court cases.Consumer needs and preferences have changed, and McDonald’s current performance reflects the urgent need to evolve with today’s consumers, reset strategic priorities and restore business momentumEfraim Levy, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said it may take McDonald’s a while to recover from the slump, which has lasted years.“The same-store sales challenge isn’t something that will be turned around overnight but they need to get to it as soon as possible,” he said. “Part of [the solution will have to be] product driven — they’ve got to find something that resonates with consumers to bring them back into the door.”Mr Easterbrook had previously been in charge of product innovation at the company, at a time when the company came under fire for what some charged was an overly complicated menu that confused diners.The company has warned that results are likely to remain under pressure this year. McDonald’s is also facing renewed scrutiny from a top US labour regulator, which is investigating complaints that the company violated worker rights, including wage theft.McDonald’s shares were up marginally in early New York trading at $97.72.
143;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Report links McDonald’s to EU tax avoidance scandal;Fast-food group accused of avoiding €1bn of taxes by funnelling royalties through Luxembourg;McDonald’s has been linked to the growing scandal of tax avoidance within the EU after the fast-food group was accused of avoiding €1bn of taxes by funnelling royalties through Luxembourg.A report by the charity War on Want and three trade unions revealed that between 2009 and 2013 McDonald’s paid a total of €16m in tax on royalties of €3.7bn.Its authors called for the fast-food chain’s relationship with the Grand Duchy to be investigated by the European Commission in a move that would drag the US group into the row over tax avoidance within the trading bloc.In November, the leaking of 28,000 pages of documents from auditor PwC revealed how large companies reduced their tax bill by pushing revenues through the Grand Duchy.This revelation triggered an unsuccessful vote of no-confidence in Jean-Claude Juncker, the new European Commission president, who had been prime minister of Luxembourg while these tax rulings had been made.A spokesperson for McDonald’s, which has almost 8,000 outlets across Europe generating more than €20bn of sales, said: “McDonald’s complies with applicable laws, including payments of the taxes that are owed in each country in which we operate.”McDonald’s set up an intellectual property holding company in Luxembourg in 2009 as part of a restructuring that saw its European headquarters move from London to Geneva in Switzerland.The creation of the Luxembourg division came a year after the Grand Duchy introduced a generous tax regime allowing companies to benefit from a tax rate of 5.8 per cent on income generated from intellectual property. But, according to the report, McDonald’s paid a €3.3m tax bill from revenue of €833.8m in 2013.The European Commission is investigating whether sweetheart tax deals between Luxembourg and Amazon, the online retailer, as well as the financing arm of Fiat, the carmaker, amounted to illegal state aid. It has launched similar investigations into the operations of Apple, the technology company, in Ireland as well as Starbucks, the coffee chain, in the Netherlands.A spokesperson for the commission said that the report would be “carefully processed”. He added: “Combating tax evasion and avoidance is a top priority of the European Commission.”In December, the commission widened its probe into sweetheart tax deals — and whether they equate to illegal state aid — to include all 28 EU member states. Previously the EU’s executive arm had only been looking at Cyrpus, the Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and the UK.“The steady drip-feed of investigations and leaks gives a partial picture at best,” said Nienke Palstra, a senior policy officer at Transparency International EU, the anti-corruption group. “A transnational problem needs a transnational solution. That is why the EU must act to ensure that companies report this information as a matter of routine.”
144;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;McDonald’s franchisee sued by Brazilian unions;Case alleges Arcos Dorados violated labour laws;Brazilian unions have sued the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee over allegations that it violated labour laws through time-clock fraud and unsanitary working conditions.The suit, filed on Monday, alleges that the Brazilian operations of Arcos Dorados paid below legal minimum wages, maintained an unhealthy work environment and failed to make severance or retirement insurance payments. Arcos Dorados operates more than 800 McDonald’s restaurants in Brazil, which accounts for more than half of its roughly $4bn in annual sales in the country.Some of Brazil’s largest labour groups, including Contratuh, CUT and UGT, are backing the lawsuit, which seeks to refer the case to Brazil’s antitrust regulator and ban McDonald’s from opening any more outlets in Brazil until it remedies the allegations.Ricardo Patah, president of UGT, or general workers union, said McDonald’s had ignored Brazilian legislation and trade union conventions and operated as if “this was a country of savages”.“We will do everything that can be done to stop companies coming to our country, violating labour laws and taking the profits out of our nation,” he said. “In the same way, we express our solidarity with American workers, principally those of Walmart and Nissan.”McDonald’s, which has long maintained that it is not responsible for working conditions or wages at franchised restaurants, referred questions to Arcos Dorados.The franchisee said it had not yet been officially notified of the lawsuit but that it is “absolutely confident in our labour practices and comply with all laws and regulations”.“All our employees are registered according to the law and receive remuneration and benefits complying with collective agreements reached with unions,” the company said.The Buenos Aires-based company operates more than 2,000 restaurants, making it the largest franchisee in terms of number of outlets and system-wide sales. The company employs more than 90,000 people in 20 countries and territories throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.But it has struggled recently, hit by the deepening economic crisis in Venezuela, another important market, high inflation in Argentina and currency depreciation and a slowdown in consumption in Brazil. It accounts for around 6 per cent of McDonald’s global sales.The suit has “informal support” from the Service Employees International Union, the US labour group that is backing the fight for a higher minimum wage and union rights for US fast-food and retail workers. It comes just days after Walmart, the largest private sector employer in the US, said it would raise the minimum wage it pays its 1.4m workers.The news comes weeks before a top US labour regulator is set to hold hearings over allegationsthat McDonald’s and its franchisees have violated worker rights, including wage theft. Late last year, the National Labor Relations Board filed complaints in 78 cases against the company and franchisees across the country for “violating the rights of employees”.In a landmark decision that could deal a severe blow to the franchise system, the NLRB had earlier ruled that the restaurant chain is a “joint employer”, meaning it may be liable for unfair labour practices at its over 14,000 US restaurants.McDonald’s has vowed to fight the complaints.Additional reporting by Joseph Leahy in São Paulo.
145;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-02-12T03:27:23Z;McDonald’s hit by beef with India partner;A legal battle over outlets has brought expansion to a standstill;"The Golden Arches are the same, but McDonald’s menus in India would look decidedly odd to anyone from the fast-food chain’s US homeland. There are no hamburgers on them.When the company opened its first restaurants on the subcontinent in 1996 — arguably before local tastes, or wallets, were ready — it replaced its signature beefburgers with mutton, potato and paneer alternatives out of sensitivity to the country’s Hindu majority, for whom cows are sacred.Today, western-style fast food is being embraced by a new generation of Indian youth. But rather than profiting from its early-mover advantage, McDonald’s has found its Indian expansion stymied by a bitter dispute with an estranged local partner.A legal battle with businessman Vikram Bakshi over control of 185 McDonald’s outlets has brought the US chain’s expansion in half of the country — including Delhi and the prosperous states of Haryana and Punjab — to a standstill.It is one of many challenges awaiting the company’s incoming CEO Steve Easterbrook, who has been tasked with reviving the brand after a 4.8 per cent drop in same-store sales in Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa in the past quarter.On Monday, the group reported a further 12.6 per cent fall in sales in the region in January, year on year, as it continued to deal with problems ranging from food safety concerns in China to changing tastes in the US.India is still a small outpost in McDonald’s global empire. But rivals such as Burger King, Wendy’s and Carl’s Jr as well as western pizza franchise Dominos have been expanding through new branch openings — drawn to a fast-food market of 1.3bn people, half of whom are under the age of 25.McDonald’s has struggled to keep pace as its joint venture with Mr Bakshi remains mired in Indian litigation that could take years to play out.Although McDonald’s says it cannot comment on India or its differences with Mr Bakshi because of the continuing legal process, one of its filings with India’s Company Law Board — which hears business disputes — states: “The trust and faith reposed in [Mr Bakshi by McDonald’s], which had been steadily depleting, is now irretrievably lost.”In the mid 1990s, it seemed very different. McDonald’s entered India by forming separate 50-50 joint ventures with two businessmen, to help it navigate the terrain. It chose Mr Bakshi, a Delhi-based real estate investor, for the north and east, and Amit Jatia, scion of a Mumbai-based industrial family, for the south and west.After some initial problems catering for local palates — its mutton burgers proved too rubbery and incompatible with “special sauce” — sales began to pick up. By 2012, Mr Jatia’s Hardcastle Restaurants had become a full franchisee, through a friendly buyout of McDonald’s stake in their venture. Today, Hardcastle has 185 outlets — 85 of which opened in the last three years — and it plans to open between 175 and 250 more by 2020.But McDonald’s relationship with Mr Bakshi had soured due to a clash of business cultures and expectations.“I guess I was never an easy person to work with,” says Mr Bakshi in an interview with the Financial Times. “I was not the usual subservient partner that most franchisers look at.”Back in 2008, McDonald’s had approached Mr Bakshi about buying out his half of the joint venture, which is called Connaught Plaza Restaurants. He was initially amenable, until McDonald’s offered $5m — roughly equal to his original investment 13 years earlier.As McDonald’s serves no beef burgers in India, out of sensitivity to the country’s Hindu majority, nearly 65 per cent of its menu offerings are not available anywhere else in the world. These include lots of chicken burgers, both grilled and spicy. But the mutton burgers that it initially tried to serve as an alternative to beef were discontinued, as mutton’s lower fat content made the meat patties rubbery, rather than juicy. It has had more success selling vegetarian alternatives, including wraps and burgers made from paneer – an Indian cheese – vegetarian patties, and potato burgers called McAloo Tikkis.A year later, accounting and advisory group Grant Thornton valued the joint venture, which then boasted 85 outlets, at $330m excluding debts. Mr Bakshi told McDonald’s any negotiation for his half would have to start at $100m.Matters came to a head in August 2013, when McDonald’s nominees on the Connaught board refused to support Mr Bakshi’s re-election as managing director. McDonald’s tried to exercise a clause giving it an option to buy him out. Mr Bakshi went to court.In a September 2013 filing to the Company Law Board, McDonald's accused Mr Bakshi of violating their partnership agreement by leasing properties in Delhi to McDonald’s rivals, including Domino’s, Dunkin’ Donuts and India’s own Café Coffee Day.It also alleged that Mr Bakshi lost focus on McDonald’s by pursuing private interests in property and hospitality; improperly pledged his stake in the joint venture as collateral for an unrelated loan; and took Rs70m ($1.1m) out of the business for a private transaction, although the money was later returned.In his legal rejoinder, Mr Bakshi denies any wrongdoing and calls McDonald’s claims “stale, unfounded and baseless”. His petition says McDonald’s knew of his other business interests and never objected to them. He also says he took out the Rs70m to facilitate the opening of a new McDonald’s outlet — with the US company’s prior knowledge — and never pledged his shares against any loan.With the legal battle raging, Mr Bakshi says he and his wife are still effectively running the chain’s day-to-day affairs. But the dispute has taken its toll.Just nine new McDonald’s outlets opened in the disputed region in 2014 and, at most, seven will open this year.“There is no vibrancy in the restaurants,” Mr Bakshi says. “With limited growth and no direction, the incentive to excel is completely missing.”As McDonald’s waits for the legal process to unfold, Mr Bakshi admits customers are not “lovin’ it” as much as the company’s advertising suggests. “Our regular customers . . . are constantly flooding our website with complaints,” he says.——–Foreign fast-food chains hungry for a slice of IndiaAs their country’s economy continues to grow rapidly, ever more Indians are eating out — mostly at local restaurants serving quick, filling meals at reasonable prices.According to Euromonitor, India’s quick-service restaurant market was estimated at Rs995bn last year, up from Rs486bn in 2008. A large majority of these meals are still provided by independent, family-owned restaurants, sidewalk food stalls, or small local chains with a handful of outlets.But many western restaurant chains sense growing opportunity in this market.Brands such as McDonald’s, KFC and Subway accounted for a meagre 4 per cent of total quick-service restaurant sales last year, but that was up from 2.5 per cent in 2008.This share is expected to grow, as customers opt for chains offering high levels of hygiene, convenience and predictability.Burger King has just opened its first 10 Indian outlets, in Delhi and Mumbai. Carl’s Jr is expected to launch in India in April. Wendy’s will soon follow suit.Foreign brands have already tasted success in India’s fast-growing pizza market. Last year, Indians ate Rs27.5bn worth of pizza, up from Rs9.5bn in 2008 — and Domino’s cooked most of them. It is the market leader with a 67 per cent share of the Indian pizza market, followed by Yum Brands’ Pizza Hut, with an 18 per cent share. However, Yum is trying to catch up: it has just announced plans to open another 100 Pizza Hut outlets in India over the next 12 months."

These conditions have been exacerbated by weak demand. Meanwhile, aluminium premiums, which represent the cost of physically delivering the metal to the buyer, are also expected to decline.“While Alcoa’s efforts over the past several years to reduce its costs in the upstream and grow its downstream should help to offset some of the these pressures, we think a neutral rating is warranted given the downside risk to the stock given just how much aluminium premiums have increased over the past several years,” Michael Gambardella, an analyst at JPMorgan, said.Mr Gambardella did add that Alcoa was in a better position to deal with lower aluminium premiums and prices than it was several years ago.Last month, Alcoa said it expected sustained growth in aluminium from demand in the automotive and aerospace industries.Alcoa shares, which have gained 40 per cent in the past year, declined 6 per cent to $15.65.Better than expected fourth-quarter profits and a new buyback programme pushed shares of toymaker Hasbro up 7 per cent to $59.66.The Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based company reported a profit of $169.9m, or $1.34 a share, in the three months ended in December, compared with $129.8m, or 98 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Sales climbed 1 per cent to $1.29bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of $1.20 a share, on sales of $1.33bn.Hasbro’s board authorised a $500m share buyback programme, on top of a $64.2m programme that was available at year-end.Shares of McDonald’s declined more than 1 per cent to $92.72, after the fast food restaurant chain reported a 1.8 per cent decline in global same-store sales in January, steeper than the 1.2 per cent decline that Wall Street analysts had forecast.Energy was the best performing sector on the S&P 500 as Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, climbed nearly 1 per cent to $58.34 a barrel.Transocean was the best performing energy stock on the US benchmark, advancing 10 per cent to $20.44, while shares of Noble Corp gained 6 per cent to $19.28.The S&P 500 declined 0.4 per cent to 2,046.74, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5 per cent to 17,729.21.

147;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Take inspiration from new British chief of McDonald’s;Steve Easterbrook has a CV that makes him a welcome role model;"“Being a McDonald’s employee can be the launching pad to a wide variety of opportunities”. So reads the fast-food chain’s website.Last week, the company announced it had given the biggest opportunity of all to a Brit, Steve Easterbrook, who has been appointed its new global chief executive.I mostly use female role models to advise women on their careers, but for once I have found a man to do the job.Mr Easterbrook started his McCareer in 1993, but let us start even further back in his life. Bearing in mind the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission’s 2014 report, which lamented the severe over-representation of those educated at independent schools and Oxbridge among our political and business leaders, Mr Easterbrook’s schooling at state-funded Watford Grammar School for Boys is worth noting. He later took a degree in natural sciences at Durham and played cricket for the university.As a headhunter, I like all these things: a state school, a Russell Group university, a Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) degree, and a sports career while studying — what I call a third-dimension activity. What he did next is even better. Mr Easterbrook went and qualified as an accountant with PwC.I am known for my almost obsessive views on accountancy. But in this instance it is also the big brand that will have helped him land the financial reporting job at McDonald’s.All these are good things for a man to have on his CV and even more powerful if you are a women battling career prejudice.And don’t make the mistake of thinking that, as a bean counter and a man, Mr Easterbrook was shielded from working behind the counter and in the kitchens.Not only that, but he also took on a new third-dimension activity, becoming a visiting fellow of the Oxford University Centre for Corporate Reputation in 2008.I found it instructive to look back over his progress. What can we learn from it?His next move would help him even further. He left McDonald’s briefly to run PizzaExpress and then Wagamama, before rejoining the company. Since his appointment, some commentators have said McDonald’s should have appointed a chief from outside; but he has been outside, having worked for three other companies.I hope his example will encourage others — especially women — to apply to good universities, study Stem subjects, get professional qualifications, work their way up a company’s ranks, leave and return, and combine this with a third dimension activity or two.Mr Easterbrook was famous during his time as the boss of McDonald’s UK for tackling head-on the negative perceptions of a ‘McJob’.His appointment should show us that every McJob has the potential to become a McCareer, facilitated by an inspiring CV.——————————————-Twitter: @mrsmoneypennyft"
148;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-01-29T18:03:43Z;McDonald’s: big game hunter;Buffett won’t snap up McDonald’s. Someone should;Did Warren Buffett back the wrong burger joint? Last year he put $3bn of preferred stock behind Burger King’s merger with Canadian doughnut chain Tim Horton’s. Mr Buffett is a well-known fan of the Brazil private equity firm 3G Capital, which has been an owner of Burger King for years. But with Berkshire Hathaway searching for an “elephant”, struggling McDonald’s, with a market value of $90bn, is a match for his prodigious appetite.Late on Wednesday, McDonald’s announced that its chief executive, Don Thompson, would step aside. The chain has suffered declining sales for quarters on end (for all of 2014 global same-store sales were off 1 per cent). The simple explanation is that slightly more upscale, higher quality chains such as Chipotle and Panera Bread have convinced consumers to pay a little more and wait a little longer in exchange for tastier food. But some of McDonald’s wounds are self-inflicted. Growth forays into a wide range of sandwiches took the “fast” out of its fast food. The chain is culling 8 items from its menu and experimenting with kiosks and tablet ordering to beef up, and speed up, customers’ experience.These may help. But the “restaurant experience” critique misses the fundamental challenge for McDonald’s: it is a multinational company with a global problem (two-thirds of sales are outside the US). Sales were slammed in Asia because of a meat supply chain fiasco. Russian sales are being hurt by political unrest there and Europe is, well, Europe. The appreciating dollar exacerbates all these problems.With 36,000 locations and $27bn in total revenue, McDonald’s will not grow wildly. But all its investors require is a couple of percentage points of same store sales growth. McDonald’s, which trades on 17 times earnings, remains healthy enough that it plans to return $18bn to $20bn in cash to shareholders between 2014 and 2016. An enormous, inexpensive and plain business would be perfect for Mr Buffett. He won’t snap up McDonald’s. But someone should.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
149;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-01-29T18:02:32Z;New McDonald’s chief faces kitchen heat;Steve Easterbrook must turn round an $87bn company facing one of its toughest challenges;When Steve Easterbrook becomes chief executive of McDonald’s in March, the former Watford Grammar schoolboy will take over a company facing one of the biggest challenges in its 60-year history.Mr Easterbrook has a competitive streak. While at university in northern England he played cricket on a team captained by Nasser Hussain, who went on to lead the national team.But turning round an $87bn company will be a whole new ball game.The 48-year-old will take over a business coping with years of slumping sales growth and consumers who are opting for healthier, fresher alternatives to its Big Macs and fries.On Wednesday, when it announced that Mr Easterbrook would replace Don Thompson, McDonald’s also said it was conducting a “hard and thoughtful review” of its US operations. This will include an undisclosed number of lay-offs.“We are moving with a sense of urgency to improve our performance and enhance our customer focus,” the company said.Mr Easterbrook, who joined the company as an accountant from PwC in 1993, will need to move swiftly.One reason he was tapped for the job may be because Mr Easterbrook has turnround experience, back home in the UK. When he took over as chief executive of McDonald’s UK in 2006, the chain was struggling against the perception that its food was unhealthy and that it exploited low-wage workers in “McJobs”.He set about transforming it through a campaign that included renovating stores so they looked cleaner, a marketing campaign that fought negative perceptions, and new apprenticeship programmes.In a surprising turn just a month into his tenure, the soft-spoken accountant appeared on Newsnight to debate with Eric Schlosser, author of the anti-fast food bestseller Fast Food Nation.Sales rebounded as he rose to become head of northern Europe in 2008, rising 10 per cent at the 1,200 UK McDonald’s that year.By 2010, he oversaw all of Europe’s 7,000 outlets. But his new role will see the father of three leading a company with roughly 35,000 global restaurants.The rocky two-and-a-half-year tenure of Mr Thompson was marked by flagging sales as the low-income customers continued to struggle after the financial crisis. It also coincided with the rise of more expensive burger chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger, and the explosive growth of restaurants such as Chipotle, in the ‘fast-casual’ sector.Mr Easterbrook, who attended Durham University where he studied natural sciences, will hope to emulate the success of Mr Thompson’s predecessor, Jim Skinner, who also took over when McDonald’s was in crisis. During his eight years in charge the company’s stock rose 200 per cent and same-store sales rose for 106 straight months.A repeat performance will be difficult. Last year, McDonald’s recorded its first annual decline in global same-store sales in a dozen years.Some analysts questioned whether a McDonald’s insider was the appropriate choice, given the foundational changes the company must undergo.RJ Hottovy, analyst at Morningstar, said that, while Mr Easterbrook was a “suitable replacement . . . , we believe the company would benefit from additional outside perspective in its efforts to modernise customer experience and develop a more nimble organisation.”The company will need to be agile in markets around the world. The US, where McDonald’s is the target of criticism over both the obesity epidemic and wage inequality, is not its only challenge. Operations in Germany, Japan, Russia and China are also struggling.Consumers are no longer interested in food that is simply fast — they need to be convinced that it is, among other things, healthy, fresh and natural.Mr Easterbrook’s experience in the UK may again prove helpful. There, he set up composting programmes at some outlets, and introduced organic British milk, coffee certified by the Rainforest Alliance, and nutritional labels on the tablemats.Buffett won’t snap up McDonald’s. Someone shouldContinue readingSoon after the UK turnround, Mr Easterbrook left in 2011 to become chief executive of PizzaExpress, only to leave that job after less than a year to head the Japanese noodle chain Wagamama. By 2013 he was back at McDonald’s as chief brand officer.In that position he was in charge of marketing and menu innovation, two areas where the company has faced criticism. In recent years McDonald’s has added many items, including chicken wings and wraps, and created a menu that some argue is so bloated that it confuses customers and slows down service.Mr Easterbrook’s fingerprints also seem to be on one of the latest marketing campaigns, entitled “Our Food. Your Questions.” It is meant to combat the image of McDonald’s food as processed and unhealthy by allowing users to submit questions on a website that mirrors the makeupyourownmind.co.uk site Mr Easterbrook set up for UK operations more than five years ago.But the questions consumers ask speak to the scale of McDonald’s image problem: “Are there worms in your beef?” “Do you make your fries with real potatoes?”In 2008, Mr Easterbrook was admitted as a visiting fellow at Oxford university, lecturing on corporate reputation.He may need to dust off his notes.
150;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;McDonald’s and its challenges worldwide: a market-by-market look;New chief inherits a wide range of pressing challenges worldwide;McDonald’s shook up its leadership this week as it struggled to keep up with changing consumer tastes, appointing Steve Easterbrook, a veteran of UK high street restaurant chains, to replace Don Thompson as chief executive.FT reporters around the world take a market-by-market look at the challenges facing the company.US: left behind by shifts in dining habitsMcDonald’s faces perhaps its greatest challenge in its home market. Critics charge that the company has been unable to cope with fundamental shifts in the restaurant business in recent years, writes Neil Munshi in Chicago.Upstart rivals have been able to capitalise on consumer demand for food that is perceived as healthier and made with fresher, natural ingredients.McDonald’s has built a global empire based on the consistency of its products, down to the thickness of fries and the number of pickles on a sandwich. But the age of the Big Mac and fries has given way to the age of organic kale and small-batch aioli.In a sign of how drastically the restaurant game has shifted, McDonald’s will attempt to compete this year by expanding a customisable burger pilot programme to up to 2,000 US outlets, or one out of every seven stores. That will give consumers the chance to add bacon or mushrooms or caramelised onions to their Quarter Pounder.Compounding McDonald’s home market challenges are the nationwide protests that have broken out over raising the minimum wage. The fast-food giant has become the poster child for the fight for a $15 hourly wage — more than double the national minimum.A top US labour regulator recently ruled that the company might be liable for how its franchisees treat employees, dealing a blow to the entire franchise model.Steve Easterbrook, the incoming chief executive, confronted just such a challenge in the UK. He turned that market round through a campaign that included allowing consumers to ask what goes into McDonald’s food and promoting the upward mobility that so-called “McJobs” afford.But the US is a market roughly 10 times the size of the UK. Turning round the brand on its home turf will be all the harder.China: food safety concerns undermine brandFood safety comes near the top of any league table of public concerns in China, so McDonald’s was hit hard when an undercover television investigation accused the company last July of using a mainland supplier that relabelled expired meat, writes Patti Waldmeir in Shanghai.McDonald’s said earlier this month that same store sales in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region continued to suffer the effects of the scandal, dropping 4.8 per cent in the fourth quarter, year on year.“Consumers in China are still leery of the brand and haven’t really been convinced that McDonald’s has supply chain issues under control,” said Benjamin Cavender of China Market Research in Shanghai.Foreign fast food brands such as McDonald’s and Yum’s KFC have long enjoyed a reputation for cleanliness, quality and safety on the mainland, which has faced a string of food quality scandals in recent years. These included the scandal of melamine in infant milk, which killed six babies and sickened several hundred thousand.But recently, supplier scandals have hit both big US chains hard, with KFC facing several successive allegations of substandard supplier practices. Yum Brands was also targeted in the July expired meal allegations.The Shanghai government responded to the media exposé by closing down the affected factory of Shanghai Husi Food Co, a subsidiary of US food group OSI, and detaining staff.Problems with food quality have also coincided with other trends that have challenged western fast-food brands, industry analysts say. “Fast-food consumers in China have shifted away from their original curiosity about western fast food, and nowadays they are pickier and more focused on health,” said Shi Jun, catering industry analyst at Beijing-based Alliance PKU Management.2,000Number of McDonald’s outlets in China. KFC has 4,600“McDonald’s is facing more pressure from fast-casual restaurants and Chinese quick-service chains as consumers look at alternatives that they increasingly view as more healthful and safer,” said Mr Cavender.KFC remains the clear market leader with 4,600 outlets, more than double the 2,000 McDonald’s. But Dicos — a Taiwanese-owned fast-food chain strongest in lower-tier cities, with cheaper menus — recently eclipsed the US burger chain with 2,200 stores. It planned to have nearly 3,000 by the end of last year.Additional reporting by Zhang Yan in ShanghaiIndia: legal dispute eats away early advantageMcDonald’s ought to be well-positioned to profit from surging demand for convenient, clean and affordable meals in India. The market for Western-style fast-food is still relatively small, but growing rapidly as a young population increasingly grabs meals on the go, or celebrates special occasions by dining out, writes Amy Kazmin in New Delhi.An early Western arrival into India’s competitive food market, McDonald’s worked for years to overcome a fundamental problem. Its core product offering — beef burgers — is taboo for India’s Hindu-majority population.Although it has finally found a recipe to appeal to Indian palates — through ample chicken and vegetarian offerings — McDonald’s is locked in a bitter legal dispute with an estranged former partner, which has stymied the chain’s expansion.McDonald’s is fighting entrepreneur Vikram Bakshi for control of Connaught Plaza Restaurants, their erstwhile joint venture, which owns and operates 185 McDonald’s restaurants in north and east India.McDonald had sought to buy Mr Bakshi out of the venture since 2008, but the two sides had deep differences on pricing. Simmering tensions finally erupted in 2013, when McDonald’s ousted Mr Bakshi from his role as managing director of the joint venture, after 18 years.Mr Bakshi has since filed a lawsuit before India’s Company Law Board, accusing McDonald’s of mismanagement. Last month, the Delhi High Court issued a stay order, preventing McDonald’s from proceeding with international arbitration in London, as the company says it is entitled to do under the terms of its joint venture agreement with Mr Bakshi.Rs14.2bnMcDonald’s Indian revenues last year, trailing local Jubilant’s Rs16.2bnMcDonald’s is expanding in India’s prosperous south and west region, where its other Indian partner, Hardcastle Restaurants, was converted from a joint venture into a master franchisee in 2010.But McDonald’s dispute with Mr Bakshi is allowing rivals such as Domino’s, KFC and Subway, to erode its former lead.McDonald’s was India’s biggest Western fast-food chain in 2008 with revenues of Rs6.6bn, according to Euromonitor data. That was more than double Domino’s sales of Rs3.2bn. KFC, with revenues of Rs1.5bn, lagged far behind.McDonald’s revenues in India hit Rs14.2bn last year. But Yum Brand’s KFC had nearly caught up, with Rs12.5bn in sales. Domino’s, which in India is operated by Mumbai-listed Jubilant Foodworks, surpassed McDonald’s with revenues of Rs16.2bn.Japan: consumer backlash against cost cutsMcDonald’s Japan had its own management shake-up in the summer of 2013 when the US head office brought in Sarah Casanova, a 24-year McDonald’s veteran, to run the local unit. The chain had enjoyed nearly a decade of strong growth in its second-biggest market. But sales in Japan — with some 3,100 outlets — started slowing as consumers became disgruntled with its service and food offerings, writes Kana Inagaki in Tokyo.The McDonald’s brand became synonymous with cost cuts and a push for efficiency, highlighted by the backlash in late 2012 when Japanese stores pulled menus from its counters to shorten the time taken by customers placing orders. Angry consumers punished the chain by dragging its sales down for almost all of 2013, excluding May and June.But instead of stemming the slide in sales, Ms Casanova’s term has been plagued by a series of troubles that began with a chicken safety scare at its China-based supplier last July. Delays in imports of US potatoes forced the chain to ration sales of its French fries in December.The problems were capped by a flood of complaints that came to light this month when objects — from a human tooth to pieces of vinyl and a bracelet — were found inside its products. McDonald’s Japan, which is half owned by the US group, now expects its first annual loss in 11 years, totalling Y17bn ($144m), after sales tumbled by double-digits since July.“McDonald’s is already no longer a must-go place. They must regain consumer trust or else people would just not be interested in them any more,” said Nomura analyst Kyoichiro Shigemura.Ms Casanova has promised steps to ensure food safety through increased audits of suppliers. McDonald’s Japan also plans to remodel its stores and offer a wider line-up of menus, with better pricing.But analysts say it will be a hard road ahead to restore confidence in a market known for its finicky and picky consumers. When Ms Casanova appeared at a news conference in July, she was criticised for failing to appear apologetic enough. Three months later when she spoke again, she wore a dark suit with her hairstyle in a tight updo.“A new start is always a good thing,” she said.Russia: burger business caught up in geopoliticsMcDonald’s has long been portrayed as a success story in Russia, but over the past six months the fast food company has fallen foul of deteriorating relations between Moscow and the US, writes Courtney Weaver in Moscow.In late July, as the EU prepared its strongest sanctions against Russia to date, a regional branch of Russia’s consumer protection agency suddenly announced that certain McDonald’s items ranging from its cheeseburgers to Caesar wraps did not meet Russia’s health safety standards. This was either because they contained evidence of E-coli or because they contained more carbohydrates and calories than the menu stated, according to the agency.In late August, the agency’s federal branch went further, temporarily shutting down four McDonald’s outlets, including its flagship location on Moscow’s Pushkin Square — McDonald’s first ever restaurant in Russia and one of its biggest locations by sales in the world.By October, 200 out of McDonald’s 440 Russian restaurants were under government investigation, with as many as nine McDonald’s outlets closed during the period.The Russian agency, known as Rospotrebnadzor, has since finished its inspections and all the McDonald’s outlets that were closed have been reopened. However, the difficulties for McDonald’s in Russia are continuing.The fast-food group is now the subject of dozens of Russian court cases related to the agency’s findings, the FT’s Russian sister paper Vedomosti reported on Thursday.200Number of McDonald’s Russian restaurants under investigation, out of a total of 440Some of the court complaints relate to McDonald’s lack of a centralised laundromat for its employees’ uniforms, while others take issue with the layout of McDonald’s kitchens and the separation of different food products. McDonald’s counters that the layout required by Rospotrebnadzor does not reflect modern food industry standards when many food products are processed.Other court cases relate to McDonald’s alleged mislabelling of its food products.Russia’s consumer protection agency and health ministry have repeatedly insisted that the McDonald’s investigations have nothing to do with the geopolitical backdrop.But in the past few months, McDonald’s has figured in close to 100 Russian court cases, Vedomosti reports. In the previous seven years, it only figured in 10.Latin America: regional woes hit revenuesPaula, a McDonald’s worker in São Paulo, says she cannot think of anything worse than eating hamburgers for lunch every day, writes Samantha Pearson in São Paulo.“You saw what happened to the man in that documentary from America, right?” she said, referring to Super Size Me, the 2004 documentary in which film-maker Morgan Spurlock eats only at McDonald’s for a month.However, after a string of complaints, Paula and the rest of Brazil’s McDonald’s employees now have the option of eating a typical Brazilian meal of rice, beans and beef in their breaks instead.The option is even available to customers for R$23 (US$9) if they look hard enough, she said, pointing to the small print at the bottom of the menu.Catering to local tastes in the region, however, is not the only challenge for Arcos Dorados, the Buenos Aires-based company that owns the exclusive right to operate McDonald’s restaurants in 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries.In the three months to September 30, the company recorded consolidated revenues of $904m, down 11.5 per cent from the previous year. Arcos accounts for only about 6 per cent of McDonald’s global sales.The problems at Arcos are largely related to local competition and the macroeconomic environment of its five main markets, said Martha Shelton, equity analyst at Itaú BBA.Buffett won’t snap up McDonald’s. Someone shouldContinue readingBrazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela make up 80 per cent of the company’s sales, in that order, she said.In Venezuela, Arcos has been hit by the country’s deepening economic crisis and shortfalls of basic goods — McDonald’s restaurants across the country even ran out of fries this month, according to local media. In Argentina, high inflation has weighed on profits.“We expect Arcos Dorados’ growth strategies to reflect efforts in minimising exposures to these two countries,” said Moody’s in a note.In Brazil, which accounts for more than half of Arcos’s sales, currency depreciation and a slowdown in consumption, even during the World Cup last year, have eroded profits.In Mexico, Arcos has also struggled to compete with the informal market — the man selling tacos on the street corner who even extends credit to his best customers. “That will always cause difficulties for hamburger chains,” said Itaú’s Ms Shelton.Europe: ideas laboratory hit by economic downturnSteve Easterbrook’s reward for his successful stint at the head of the UK division was to be appointed president of McDonald’s Europe. When he quit in 2011 to head PizzaExpress, Europe was MacDonald’s fastest-growing region, writes Roger Blitz in London.Commonly a laboratory for the company’s new ideas, McDonald’s Europe was attracting customers with high-end beef, breakfast and garden wraps.Mr Easterbrook’s strategy suited recession-hit Europe. Cash-poor Europeans swallowed their misgivings about the godfather of American-imported fast-food culture and stepped gingerly inside McDonald’s restaurants — lured by some tailored offerings.France got a McBaguette, and gave McDonald’s its most profitable international market. Sales across more than 1,200 restaurants in France topped $5bn.But its most recent results suggest that, as in other markets, many European consumers are now spoilt for choice when it comes to fast food. Fourth-quarter same-store sales dropped 1.1 per cent and operating income was down 14 per cent.While the UK was doing well, the company was suffering from “consumer confidence issues” in Russia and Ukraine and weakness in France and Germany.Competition comes from top-end burger chains, plus fast-food businesses focusing on specialities such as Japanese and Mexican food.McDonald’s is still expanding across Europe, pushing up actual sales. But the decline in like-for-like sales means that the performance overall is “fragile”, said Euromonitor analyst Karla Rendle.“The poor economic climate in countries such as Greece and Italy will have also impacted McDonald’s sales,” she added.“McDonald’s three main challenges — brand image, market positioning and menu changes — are the same for Europe as they are for the US and the rest of the world.”Return to the top of the page
151;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-01-29T00:02:02Z;McDonald’s flips chief as burgers lose sizzle;New boss Steve Easterbrook is veteran of UK high street restaurant chains;McDonald’s is shaking up its leadership as it struggles to keep up with changing consumer tastes, appointing Steve Easterbrook, a veteran of UK high street restaurant chains, to replace Don Thompson as chief executive.Mr Thompson was appointed in 2012 after the ubiquitous burger brand had recorded 106 consecutive months of positive same-store sales growth in the US. He will retire after a rocky three years, culminating in last week’s news that it had reported its first annual drop in same-store sales in a dozen years.Mr Easterbrook, a British former accountant, spent 18 years at the company before leaving in 2011 to become chief executive of PizzaExpress. He left that position after less than a year to run Japanese noodle restaurant chain Wagamama, which he left in 2013 to return to McDonald’s. He will become president, chief executive and a member of the board.Mr Thompson, a 25-year McDonald’s veteran and its first African-American chief executive, pledged in October that the company would “ take decisive action to fundamentally change” after yet another disappointing quarter. He will retire on March 1.Like many traditional fast-food retailers, McDonald’s has seen sales slump as its core low-income customers struggle to recover from the global financial crisis. Under Mr Thompson’s leadership the company has come under fire for adding too many items to its menu of Big Macs and Quarter Pounders, which has slowed down service and confused diners.But the Illinois-based company has also been at the mercy of more fundamental shifts in the restaurant industry, which seemed to accelerate just as Mr Thompson took the reins.Consumers are increasingly opting for brands whose food is perceived as healthier and made with fresher ingredients, such as Chipotle, the burrito chain whose explosive growth in recent years stands in stark contrast to McDonald’s, once a majority shareholder. It has also been threatened by upmarket burger chains including Five Guys and Shake Shack.“It’s tough to say goodbye to the McFamily, but there is a time and season for everything,” Mr Thompson said. “I am truly confident as I pass the reins over to Steve, that he will continue to move our business and brand forward.”Mr Easterbrook, a former president of McDonald’s Europe, has been chief brand officer since 2013, where he has been charged with overseeing marketing and menu innovation, two areas where the company has been criticised.“I am honoured to lead this great brand, and am committed to working with our franchisees, suppliers and employees to drive forward our strategic business priorities to better serve our customers,” he said.It’s tough to say goodbye to the McFamily, but there is a time and season for everything.As part of the management changes, Kevin Fuller, who currently serves as corporate controller, has been named the new chief financial officer.While slipping sales in the US have become common in recent years, the 1 per cent drop in global same-store sales in 2014 highlighted the international nature of the challenges facing McDonald’s, particularly in China, Japan, Russia and Germany.The company responded by slashing its new restaurant budget by $800m.
152;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-01-23T17:46:21Z;US diners lose their taste for Big Macs;First fall in same-store sales for 12 years shows McDonald’s global challenges;McDonald’s same-store sales suffered their first annual fall in a dozen years in 2014, as the US economic recovery failed to bring increasingly health-conscious consumers back to its traditional menu of Big Macs and fries.US consumers are opting for fare that is perceived as healthier, such as Chipotle burritos and Panera Bread sandwiches. But a 1 per cent drop in global same-store sales in 2014 highlighted the broad-based challenges facing the emblematic US brand, from China and Japan to Russia and Germany.The $87bn company responded by announcing that it had slashed its restaurant opening plans, cutting back its budget for new outlets by $800m. It will still open more than 1,000 stores, but this compares to 1,300 last year.Threatened at home by upmarket burger brands such as Shake Shack, McDonald’s said it would expand a pilot build-a-burger programme to up to 2,000 US outlets as it presses ahead with a marketing push highlighting the quality of its ingredients.[This year] will be a year of regaining momentum globally . . . however, it will take time, especially in our larger marketsDon Thompson, chief executive, warned that results were likely to remain under pressure well into 2015. This year “will be a year of regaining momentum globally . . . however, it will take time, especially in our larger markets”, he told analysts on a call announcing fourth-quarter results that missed expectations.Low oil prices have boosted many companies that target McDonald’s core low-income customers, who are still struggling with stagnant wages despite the US recovery. But the chain’s US same-store sales fell 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, and 4.2 per cent for the year, and the company acknowledged continued pricing challenges.A food safety scandal involving a supplier in China contributed to a 4.8 per cent fall in quarterly same-store sales in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, while weakness in France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine knocked comparable sales in Europe by 1.1 per cent.In October, the company said it would implement sweeping changes, streamlining an increasingly complicated menu and tailoring it more to regional tastes. McDonald’s said on Friday that it would exercise “further financial discipline” by cutting its capital expenditure budget from $3bn last year to $2bn, its lowest in five years.Fourth-quarter earnings of $1.1bn, or $1.13 a diluted share, compared with $1.4bn, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 7 per cent, from $7.09bn to $6.57bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.22 a share on $6.68bn in revenues, and the group’s shares were down 1.46 per cent by the close in New York, to $89.56.Among the few bright spots was a 0.4 per cent rise in December’s US same-store sales, but Mr Thompson said he expected January sales to fall.The news came a day after 10 former employees sued the company and one of its franchisees for alleged racial discrimination at three restaurants in Virginia. The suit alleges that supervisors at the restaurants used racial slurs and made comments like “there are too many black people in the store”.McDonald’s has long maintained that it is not responsible for wages or the treatment of employees at its thousands of franchised restaurants. Critics have countered that the company exercises control over every other aspect of the store — from food preparation to uniforms to customer interaction — and should be held responsible.Last year, the National Labor Relations Board, a top regulator, ruled that the fast-food chain is a “joint employer”, meaning it may be liable for unfair labour practices at its 14,000-plus US restaurants. In December, the NLRB filed complaints in 78 cases against the company and franchisees across the country for “violating the rights of employees”.The company has vowed to fight the complaints, which are set for hearings in March.
153;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2015-01-14T23:20:39Z;Chipotle tries to beef up pork supplies;Sales suspended at 600 US outlets after violation by supplier;There was hope for carnitas lovers on Wednesday as Chipotle said it was trying to get hold of additional pork supplies, after the burrito chain suspended sales of the meat at about a third of its outlets.Chipotle — among the fastest-growing US restaurant chains — on Tuesday said it had halted sales of pork products at roughly 600 US outlets after discovering that a key supplier had violated the company’s animal welfare standards.The company is “exploring many options to add to our pork supply, including adding new suppliers, finding additional cuts of pork to use, and growing the supply among existing suppliers,” said spokesman Chris Arnold.The suspension affects about a third of the chain’s outlets.Chipotle said a routine audit had revealed that a supplier — which it did not name — was raising pigs without outdoor access and in violation of other humane standards the company insists on.“This is fundamentally an animal welfare decision, and is rooted in our unwillingness to compromise our standards where animal welfare is concerned,” Mr Arnold said.Chipotle has seen explosive growth in recent years in part by marketing itself as “food with integrity”. It is at the vanguard of so-called fast-casual restaurants that are shaking up the traditional fast-food model by marketing themselves as healthier alternatives to the average burger joint.The Denver-based company says it uses pork raised “naturally” on a vegetarian diet and without antibiotics. Along with many other fast-casual restaurants, it promotes itself as serving fresher ingredients that are often organic or locally sourced.Chipotle and others including Noodles & Co and Potbelly Sandwich Shop are growing at 9-10 per cent a year, compared with 2-3 per cent for traditional fast-food chains, according to food consultancy Technomic.Fast-casual customers tend to have higher incomes than their fast-food counterparts.McDonald’s, which has announced major initiatives to stem years of slow growth, Yum Brands and Wendy’s have all made forays into fast-casual in recent years.McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, is expanding a test programme that gives customers greater choice in their burger toppings that has a lot in common with Chipotle’s build-a-burrito model.Shares in Chipotle are up more than 30 per cent in the past year, compared to a drop in McDonald’s shares of more than 4 per cent.
154;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;McDonald’s Japan apologises over safety woes;Fast-food group probes incidents of objects found in products;McDonald’s has apologised after a string of incidents in Japan where objects — from a human tooth to pieces of vinyl and plastic — were found in its products, sparking fresh concerns about a worldwide sales decline.The latest food-safety scandal at McDonald’s second-biggest market adds to the troubles the fast-food chain has faced over the past six months, including a meat safety scare linked to its China-based supplier and restrictions on sales of its French fries because of a potato shortage.Cargill, the US commodities trader, is also investigating with McDonald’s Japan a customer complaint that a tiny piece of blue vinyl was found inside a chicken nugget that was purchased on Saturday in northern Japan.While the chicken nuggets were supplied by a Cargill unit in Thailand, it remained unclear whether the vinyl came from its facility. In a statement, Cargill said samples of plastics used in its facility did not match those found in Japan.“We are now taking every action we can in collaboration with McDonald’s to determine the facts. Based on the outcome of this investigation, we will make any changes required to improve processes,” it said.McDonald’s Japan has been supplying chicken nuggets from three plants in Thailand after its China-based supplier was caught relabelling out-of-date chicken and breaching other food safety rules.Among other complaints, McDonald’s Japan said a customer in Osaka, western Japan, found a human tooth inside French fries that were bought in late August. An internal investigation later found that the tooth had not been fried and concluded that it was unlikely that the object was inserted during the manufacturing process or by sales staff.“Unfortunately, we don’t know how the tooth got mixed in,” Hidehito Hishinuma, an executive at McDonald’s Japan told reporters on Wednesday, following a ritual bow of contrition.Last month, a young child suffered a minor cut inside the mouth from hard plastic that was inside a chocolate sundae, which was later attributed to an error in assembling the machine. Other reported cases included a piece of bracelet or necklace that was found inside a pancake in September and a piece of plastic inside a muffin purchased at a McDonald’s store in the southern island of Japan.The exact causes for many of the incidents remained unclear, but company executives promised to implement steps to prevent objects from being mixed inside its products.Shares in McDonald’s Japan have fallen 6.5 per cent since Christmas as investors worried about a further decline in sales fuelled by food safety concerns. The company, which is half owned by the US fast-food group, is expecting its first annual loss in 11 years, totalling Y17bn ($143m).Even before the food scandal erupted in Asia, the world’s largest fast-food chain has suffered from declining sales in the US amid changing consumer tastes. In November, same-store sales in the US fell 4.6 per cent, while sales declined 2 per cent in Europe and 4 per cent in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.
155;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-12-19T22:29:54Z;US labour regulator alleges worker violations at McDonald’s;National Labor Relations Board files 78 cases of rights violations at group and its franchisees;A top US labour regulator has alleged that McDonald’s and its franchisees have violated worker rights in a step that could upend the fast food franchise model.The National Labor Relations Board filed complaints in 78 cases against the world’s largest restaurant group and franchisees across the country.The complaint alleges that McDonald’ s and some franchisees “violated the rights of employees” by firing or intimidating workers who had advocated for a raise in the minimum wage and an improvement in fast food employee working conditions, including in nationwide strikes. Barring a settlement, the board will hold hearings beginning in March.It follows a July NLRB decision to name the struggling fast-food chain as a “joint employer”.The board’s decision means the burger chain may be liable for unfair labour practices at its 14,000-plus US restaurants, dealing a blow to one of the long-running franchise model’s key benefits.The Illinois-based company has consistently argued that its 3,000 franchisees set wages and are responsible for working conditions, rather than the parent company.That position becomes increasingly difficult to hold given the NLRB complaints, which were brought against McDonald’s and franchisees in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and a 10 other regions.In a statement, McDonald’s said the actions “improperly and dramatically strike at the heart of the franchise system”. The company noted that the complaints themselves do not amount to rulings, and that final resolution “will require a lengthy process”.“These allegations are driven in large part by a two-year, union-financed campaign that has targeted the McDonald’s brand,” the company said.The International Franchise Association, a lobby group, said it would “vigorously challenge” the decision.The franchise model is popular among most major fast-food chains, including Yum Brands and Burger King, because it allows them to keep costs down while collecting royalties and fees from franchisees.The news comes as fast food workers throughout the country continue to rally for union rights and a $15 minimum wage. In November, a number of states and municipalities voted to raise local minimum wages above the current $7.25 federal level.Micah Wissinger, a lawyer with Levy Ratner who brought the case for workers in New York, said the complaint “underscores the obvious fact that McDonald’s is the boss”.“The complaint validates what workers have been saying over and over again — that McDonald’s requires franchisees to adhere to such regimented rules and regulations that there’s no doubt who’s really in charge,” he said in a statement.Shares in McDonald’s are trading near a one-year low as the company struggles to grow. Earlier this month it reported yet another month of decreasing same-store sales, with November revenues down 4.6 per cent in the US.Chief executive Don Thompson said in October that the company was taking “decisive action to fundamentally change” its business after reporting third-quarter sales and earnings below expectations.
156;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Sales slide continues at McDonald’s;Fast-food chain reports 4.6% drop in US same-store sales;The slide in sales at McDonald’s continued last month as the world’s largest fast-food chain reported a 4.6 per cent drop in same-store sales in the US.The company blamed “strong competitive activity” for the fall in its biggest market in November, where it is suffering from changing consumer tastes and an uneven economic recovery, which has bypassed many of its core low-income customer base.Analysts had forecast a 1.9 per cent fall in the US, but the poor performance extended across the globe, with overall sales down 2.2 per cent against expectations of a 1.7 per cent fall. McDonald’s shares fell 3.8 per cent to $92.61.“Today’s customers increasingly demand more choice, convenience and value in their dining-out experience,” said Don Thompson, McDonald’s chief executive.Customers are increasingly abandoning McDonald’s for so-called “fast casual” food outlets, such as Chipotle, and gourmet burger outlets. Eating habits are also changing amid growing concerns about the impact of fast food on health.The latest sales figures underline the scale of the challenge Mr Thompson is facing — in the US same-store sales have fallen almost every month in the past 12 months.In October, he launched a shake-up across the organisation that he dubbed “decisive action to fundamentally change” the business in the wake of weaker-than-expected third-quarter results.The plans also included cutting $200m to $300m in spending and the opening of fewer restaurants this year.Mr Thompson’s plans include changes to the menus, stores, customer service and technology. The company is also taking on negative perceptions about its ingredients with an advertising campaign that gives customers a chance to ask what goes into McDonald’s food.But it is not just customer in the US that are looking elsewhere for a quick bite to eat. November sales fell by 2 per cent in Europe, and 4 per cent in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.Sales in Asia have been hard hit by a food scandal earlier this year in China, the company’s third-largest market, which forced it to suspend sourcing from OSI, a privately owned US food processor.In Russia, it has also become an apparent victim of the tensions following US and EU sanctions on Moscow, after authorities announced a crackdown against almost half of the McDonald’s outlets in the country in October.
157;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;US earnings boost masks revenue fears;Analysts are not convinced consumer momentum has returned;Beating earnings expectations has long been the game played by companies and Wall Street. And the latest results season has helped reverse last month’s turmoil, powering the S&P 500 into record territory.Strong profit growth for the third quarter, however, has been accompanied by a sharp reduction in the outlook for coming quarters due to worries over a stronger dollar and slowing global growth. In particular, there is concern that companies are beating earnings estimates thanks to cost-cutting, rather than revenues, or top line growth.Against this backdrop, much rests on whether the US economy can power ahead, leading to a substantial boost to company sales. Sharply lower oil prices are seen helping fatten the wallets of consumers, but, in spite of a continued improvement in the labour market, wage gains remain modest.Indeed, modest salary growth for US workers appears to be holding back consumer spending and expectations of stronger revenue growth in the coming quarters.“Call it the paradox of thrift, but US consumers are not inclined to spend. They are paying down debt,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.A key valuation metric watched by Mr Ablin is the S&P price-to-sales ratio, which he estimates sits nearly a quarter above its long-term average. “We need to see top line growth pick up. Companies are beating on earnings but not revenues, and at some point they need higher sales.”Analysts are not convinced that consumer momentum, by far the largest component of the US economy, has returned.S&P 500 sales are seen rising 3.4 per cent in 2014 from 2013 levels and a further 4 per cent in 2015, based on bottom-up estimates analysed by S&P Capital IQ. Those projections trail the 5.7 per cent rise in 2012 and compare with a 4 per cent gain in 2013.James Liu, a strategist with JPMorgan Funds, expects US economic growth will eclipse 3 per cent over the coming year, adding that the pace would need to “pick up the baton” if corporate margins moderate. “At this point we are seeing an uptick in corporate capital expenditures, which is a positive. On the consumer side we’re only seeing that slowly,” he says.And even the boost from declining energy and commodity prices does not appear likely to shift substantially the needle on consumer spending and propel company revenues sharply higher.Barclays estimates that a 20 per cent drop in oil prices results in $70bn of savings for the US consumer, with the extra cash seen benefiting discretionary areas such as restaurants, entertainment, apparel, electronics and furniture.In spite of the upside from lower oil prices, analysts at the bank are not shifting their year-end targets for the S&P from 1,975 for 2014 and 2,100 in 2015. “We believe revenue growth is too slow to justify further expansion of valuation multiples and therefore the market has transitioned into a period of lower returns,” they say.While concerns about the dollar and weaker growth in Europe and China did not play out as expected for third-quarter results, the outlook for coming quarters has been cut, led by the energy sector and materials as oil and commodity prices fall, John Butters, strategist at FactSet, says.“In their earnings releases and conference calls, a number of companies have cited the negative impact of the stronger dollar on both results for the third quarter and expected results for the fourth quarter,” says Mr Butters. “Comments from companies regarding Europe have generally been mixed, while comments regarding China have generally been positive.”Among the big 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Coca-Cola, IBM, UTX, McDonald's and Johnson & Johnson flagged a stronger dollar as a factor cutting into their bottom line.Companies generating more than 20 per cent of sales abroad have missed revenue projections by 30 basis points, data from Morgan Stanley show. The opposite has held true from companies earning less than a fifth of sales overseas: they have eclipsed projections by 190 basis points.Wall Street analysts now expect earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 7.4 per cent on a year-over-year basis, down from a forecast 12.1 per cent at the start of October. Profit growth has also been cut for the first half of next year as many globally orientated US companies have trimmed their outlooks.Energy stocks are now expected to register a drop of 7 per cent in fourth-quarter earnings and a slide of 11 per cent during the first quarter of 2015.One bright spot has been fewer companies issuing negative guidance following third-quarter results. To date, 55 per cent of companies have forecast results below Wall Street expectations, a tool often employed to cut high expectations, below the 15-year average.“This negative-to-positive ratio is muted compared to the aggressively negative guidance of late 2012 and 2013,” Morgan Stanley strategist Adam Parker says. “It would seem that management teams are becoming increasingly confident that conditions are improving.”
158;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-10-24T23:08:59Z;Splitting a burrito;;"With McDonald’s and Chipotle’s fortunes literally diverging (and their earnings announcements occurring within hours of each other last week) cue the quarterly cries that McDonald’s mistakenly divested the burrito dynamo.McDonald's sale of Chipotle might be one of the worst business decisions ever made http://t.co/OXhd7wWsWQThe reality, however, is much more complex than McDonald’s simply “selling” Chipotle.The burger legend first invested in the Denver-based Mexican chain in 1998. By 2006, it held a 91 per cent stake (Chipotle’s 2005 revenues were $625m). It divested Chipotle in a three-part process over the course of that year.First, in April it listed shares of Chipotle on the New York Stock Exchange. It had a dual class structure where Class B had 10 times the voting rights as Class A (in 2009 the company consolidated into a single class.)- In the IPO, McDonald’s sold 3m shares of Chipotle at $22.00/share price for $61.4m in proceeds.- Then a few months later, McDonald’s sold 4.5m shares at a price of roughly $60/share for proceeds of $267.4m.But the final step of its Chipotle divestiture was most interesting. With Chipotle shares rocketing, it could slowly have pursued more secondary share sales. The benefit of this approach is that McDonald’s would have gotten to keep the money to buy back shares or chase more acquisitions. Its management team made the investment, so they might as well get the spoils, right?Rather, McDonald’s very kindly directly distributed the bulk of their Chipotle shares to its shareholders. And what is most interesting is how those shares were distributed. It could have executed the traditional “spin-off” where all shareholders got their pro rata portion of Chipotle shares. Instead, it chose the more complicated “split-off” structure where McDonald’s shareholders got the option of exchanging their McDonald’s shares for shares in Chipotle.Not only was McDonald’s offering an exchange, it was willing to do so at a discount.For each share of McDonald’s common stock that you tender in the exchange offer and do not withdraw, you will receive a number of shares of Chipotle class B common stock at a 10% discount to the per-share value of Chipotle class B common stock, calculated as set forth below, subject to a limit of 0.9157 shares of Chipotle class B common stock per share of McDonald’s common stock. Stated another way, subject to the limit described below, for each $1.00 of McDonald’s common stock accepted in the exchange offer, you will receive approximately $1.11 of Chipotle class B common stock.The limit that is described has to do with if Chipotle shares had plummeted in the days preceding the exchange. Here’s the formal mechanism that governs the split-off.And so the exchange offer went as you would imagine.McDonald’s Corporation today announced the final results of the Chipotle exchange offer. The offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on October 5, 2006. Under the terms of the offer, McDonald’s accepted 18,628,187 shares of McDonald’s common stock in exchange for the 16,539,967 shares of Chipotle class B common stock held by McDonald’s. Each share of McDonald’s common stock accepted for exchange by McDonald’s was exchanged for 0.8879 shares of Chipotle class B common stock.All shares tendered by eligible electing odd-lot shareholders have
been accepted. The final proration factor of 7.01043% was applied to all other tendered shares of McDonald’s common stock to determine the number of such shares that would be accepted. Based on the final count by the exchange agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the results of the exchange offer are as follows:Total number of shares of McDonald’s common stock tendered 262,183,800Shares tendered that were subject to proration 261,917,171 “Odd-lot” shares tendered that were not subject to proration 266,629Total number of shares of McDonald’s common stock accepted 18,628,187McDonald’s needed 18.6m shares to be tendered for the exchange offer to be fully subscribed. Instead, 262m were subscribed, a fifth of total McDonald’s shares! So a fifth of McDonald’s shareholders (likely many of whom were arbs by then) were saying they would prefer to owns Chipotle. Because of the heavy demand, the proration factor was 7 per cent meaning that for every 100 shares that were tendered, only 7 got to be exchanged.And so for two-thirds of its Chipotle ownership, McDonald’s pursued the shareholder-friendly, tax-free exchange where its shareholders got to participate in the full upside in Chipotle. Since October 12, 2006, the day the exchange results were disclosed, Chipotle shares have increased nearly 1,000 per cent, while McDonald’s shares are up 100 per cent. It could be argued that McDonald’s should have also swapped the shares it sold in the IPO and secondary offering (it used the after-tax proceeds to buy back its own stock). But the amazing performance of the Chipotle shares that McDonald’s shareholders received has been a nice consolation prize."
159;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-10-24T18:07:22Z;McDonald’s: Eating their lunch;The world’s largest restaurant chain has missed a dramatic shift in what consumers want to eat;It is lunchtime in downtown Chicago, and the Chipotle Mexican Grill on Franklin Street is packed with customers hungry for burritos, tacos and fajitas. Among those satisfying his Mexican craving is Sameer Mazhary, one of the millions of diners who have made Chipotle one of the fastest-growing restaurant chains in the US over the past decade.“Chipotle is a different breed,” he says. “It’s like an evolution from fast food.”There is a McDonald’s a few blocks away, but Mr Mazhary, 28, says he has not stepped through the Golden Arches in a decade. “I learnt about the food, and what goes into it and it kind of turned me off,” he says.As he speaks, people rush by with bags from Potbelly Sandwich Shop, Freshii, Noodles & Co and another Chipotle, three blocks away, where the queue stretches on to the sidewalk. Wyatt Steele, 32, is a regular at this branch, visiting once a week or so. He says he grew up eating at McDonald’s but has not bought anything beyond a coffee there in years. “I don’t trust the ingredients, I don’t trust the way I imagine they put together their food . . . with chemists in a lab getting the taste and smell just right,” he says.Tastes are changing in the US, and this is bad news for the world’s largest restaurant group. The children who grew up eating Happy Meals are not hungry for Big Macs. Like Mr Mazhary and Mr Steele, they are as concerned about where their food comes from and what is in it as they are about how much it costs or how fast they can eat it.If Mr Steele is any indication, the future does not bode well. “If I had any kids, I likely would not take them to McDonald’s either,” he says.Throughout the US, McDonald’s largest market, the company’s fortunes in recent years have tracked those of its crucial low-income customers, who have not recovered from the financial crisis.McDonald’s is the biggest fast food player, with 35,000 global outlets and $28bn in annual revenues, and its challenges have been similarly large-scale. The company has seen same-store sales in the US fall in 10 of the past 12 months. This week, it said its global same-store sales fell more than 3 per cent during the third quarter, with profits down 30 per cent. By contrast, Chipotle on Monday reported a 19.8 per cent rise in same-store sales and a 57 per cent jump in profits.The problems for McDonald’s are not limited to the US. Growth in Europe is even slower, while Asia sales have slumped on a Chinese food safety scandal. A rebound in Russia may be even further off, after Moscow opened hygiene and finance investigations into nearly half of the company’s 450 outlets, which some see as retaliation for EU and US sanctions.Speaking to investors this week, Steve Ells, Chipotle’s co-chief executive, took a swipe at the fast food model epitomised by McDonald’s – once the Mexican chain’s largest investor. “The traditional fast food sector has traded food quality and taste for low-cost and ease of preparation,” he said.Judging from comments made this week by Don Thompson, McDonald’s chief executive, the fast food pioneer agrees with him. McDonald’s said it would take “decisive action to fundamentally change” its business in ways that would better position it to compete with Chipotle and other “fast casual” restaurants. It also plans to slash $200m-$300m in spending and open fewer restaurants this year.Customers want to understand the source to make sure they know what’s in it, where it came from and the integrity of the sourcesMr Thompson’s plans add up to a radical departure from the basic McDonald’s formula, with changes to its menus, stores, customer service and technology. It is also taking on negative perceptions about its ingredients with an advertising campaign that gives customers a chance to ask what goes into McDonald’s food. The question is whether these changes will be enough to transform the quintessential American burger chain in the face of a major shift within the US restaurant industry.So-called fast casual restaurants are marketed as healthier alternatives to traditional fast food, serving fresher ingredients that are often organic or locally sourced. But fresher may not always mean healthier: a Chipotle burrito with chicken, white rice, pinto beans, cheese, guacamole and salsa contains 1,100 calories – 60 more than in a Big Mac and large fries. But the segment is growing at 9-10 per cent a year, compared with 2-3 per cent for traditional fast food chains, according to food consultancy Technomic.Because fast casual customers tend to have higher incomes than fast food consumers, there is debate about whether Chipotle and other such chains are stealing McDonald’s customers. But there is no doubt that they are having a significant impact on the way traditional players do business.Yum Brands, which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut chains, has launched fast casual taco and Vietnamese sandwich joints, along with adding a gourmet menu at its Taco Bell restaurants. Wendy’s popular Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger is a clear play for those dollars, and the chain has launched prototype fast casual outlets in recent years.As US consumers have become more concerned about the obesity epidemic – and more critical of the food industry’s contribution to it – beverage, snack and restaurant companies have all moved toward offering more healthy options. McDonald’s has added salads and apple slices to its menu, but these changes have done little to stem slumping sales.The company has also become a focal point in the debate over pay inequality and the minimum wage, with a study by the pro-labour National Employment Law Project stating that about 700,000 McDonald’s employees receive roughly $1.2bn in annual public assistance.When Mr Thompson succeeded Jim Skinner as chief executive in June 2012, there were signs that the company’s nearly decade-long streak of same-store sales growth was coming to an end. But few expected the company to hit the wall quite so hard.“He came out at a critical inflection point in the restaurant sector, at the same point when fast casual was really taking off,” says RJ Hottovy, analyst at Morningstar. “You had consumer preferences changing quite quickly.”I don’t trust the ingredients, I don’t trust the way I imagine they put together their food, with chemists in a lab getting the taste and smell just rightMr Hottovy says the company’s response has been “a series of missteps”, including the introduction of many new menu items, which has been blamed for confusing customers, and deep discounting that has infuriated franchisees already coping with thin margins. Ultimately, Mr Hottovy says, the company has been caught flat-footed by a dramatic shift in consumer tastes.Among these shifts is the emergence of a new generation of burger chains. Fast-growing Smashburger, Umami Burger and Elevation thrive by offering organic ingredients including arugula (rocket salad), mushrooms and chipotle lime aioli. The family-owned Five Guys has grown to more than 1,000 outlets by offering customisable burgers that are far from healthy, but succeeds by promoting its fresh ground beef and pure peanut oil.McDonald’s is responding by expanding a test programme at four locations in southern California that give customers greater choice in their burger toppings. Using a touchscreen, they can select from 22 options, including caramelised onions, bacon and grilled mushrooms.All of the chain’s plans are good “in theory”, says Mr Hottovy. “But we’ve been promised a lot of things the last couple years by this management team and haven’t seen follow-through.”If the customisation programme expands, it would herald a significant change to the McDonald’s model, which has made reliability and uniformity its stock-in-trade.The McDonald’s formula was codified in 1958 when Fred Turner – the protégé of founder Ray Kroc, whom he later replaced as chief executive – wrote the company’s operating manual that remains the blueprint on which its restaurants run. It dictates there can be no more than six patties on the grill at a time and that fries can be no thicker than 0.28 inches. There are two pickles on every Big Mac, Double Cheeseburger, McDouble and Quarter Pounder with Cheese, one pickle on a regular burger or cheeseburger, none on a Filet-O-Fish and three on the Angus Deluxe, Angus Bacon & Cheese and the Angus Mushroom & Swiss.Departing from the formula by allowing customers more choice in their burger toppings could solve another problem: it could help alleviate suspicions about what goes into them.McDonald’s is also trying to attack the negative perceptions about its ingredients with a new marketing campaign entitled “Our food. Your Questions”.“Customers . . . want to understand the source of the origin to make sure they know what’s in it and where it came from and the integrity of the sources,” Mr Thompson said this week.The top consumer-submitted questions on its homepage speak to the scale of the challenges McDonald’s must overcome: “Is the McRib made from real pork?”, “Is ‘pink slime’ [a meat-based additive] in a Chicken McNugget?”, “Why doesn’t your food rot?”, “Are there worms in your beef?”, “Do you make your fries with real potatoes?”Bob Goldin, an analyst at Technomic, says it will be tough to change perceptions. “I think there are a lot of questions about the integrity of the food and the quality of the ingredients on the part of consumers,” Mr Goldin says. “McDonald’s is trying to say ‘we use whole-muscle meat and real milk’, but I don’t know if that resonates.“So much of it is fried and heavily breaded and I think that almost goes against the perception of good quality,” he adds. “If Chipotle fried up everything they serve would they have that reputation of food with integrity?”
160;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-10-21T18:52:28Z;Consumer stocks: change is bad;Revenue growth has disappeared at many big consumer companies. Dividends may come to the rescue;A consumer behaviour observed less often these days: a shopping excursion to Walmart, followed by a stop at McDonald's for a Big Mac washed down with Coca-Cola. All three consumer bulwarks have reported soft results or soft outlooks in recent weeks. This is particularly troubling because these are brands both customers and investors cling to in unsettled moments such as the current one. Economic stress might be a factor – middle-class wages in the US are stagnant, and global economic growth is flagging. The companies certainly point to cyclical factors. But competitive pressure is the root problem.On Tuesday, McDonald’s announced that global revenues fell 5 per cent in the third quarter, partially because of a beef supply chain problem in Asia. But in the US, comparable store sales slipped 3.3 per cent. McDonald’s said (again) it had a plan to bring back consumers. But when its former burrito subsidiary Chipotle reports comparable store growth of 20 per cent (its market cap is now $20bn), making burgers and fries hip again is daunting.At least McDonald’s can rejig its menu. Harder for Coke to quit selling soda. On Tuesday, after reporting no sales growth in the third quarter, it said it would slash $3bn of costs. Walmart is retrenching too. With its current year revenue coming in light, it last week said its capex budget in fiscal 2016 would be down from the year before.The leading market positions and historical steadiness of these companies have allowed them to maintain premium valuations – an average this year of 19 times forward earnings for Coke, 17 for McDonald's and 14 for Walmart. The shares prices have fallen because earnings expectations are down. What is propping up the valuations? Dividends perhaps. McDonald's boosted its dividend in September and its yield is a healthy 4 per cent. Coke and Walmart yields are at 3 per cent. Consumer behaviour is changing. Dividends provide protection in the meantime.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
161;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-10-21T17:46:46Z;McDonald’s in fundamental change to grow;Below expectation third-quarter earnings and sales spark move at US restaurant chain;McDonald’s is taking “decisive action to fundamentally change” its business after reporting third-quarter earnings and sales below expectations, as the restaurant chain continues to struggle for growth.“We are changing aggressively as we refocus on building the business for the McDonald’s system and for our shareholders,” Don Thompson, chief executive, said.He announced plans to upgrade menus, stores, service and technology, noting that McDonald’s has rolled out Apple’s new mobile payments system. The company will also move decision-making out from its headquarters, and launch new marketing and “a diligent review of the organisation’s structure”.The chain saw same-store sales fall 3.3 per cent compared with the previous quarter, led by weakness in the US, where it has appointed a new president to help turn round operations. Mr Thompson said the “internal factors and external headwinds have proven more formidable than expected and will continue into the fourth quarter”.Like many fast food chains, McDonald’s has seen sales fall in recent years as low-income consumers continue to struggle in the wake of the financial crisis. Those challenges were compounded after a China-based supplier was accused of re-labelling expired meat and breaking other food safety protocols, hitting sales in a key growth market.The Illinois company has faced supply shortages in China, its third-largest market, after it suspended sourcing from OSI, the privately owned US food processor at the centre of the scandal. McDonald’s Japan, of which the US company owns half, has also issued a profit warning as a result.The food safety scandal contributed roughly half of the 14 per cent drop in operating income, while weak performance in the US and parts of Europe made up the rest. The scandal knocked 15 cents off the company’s earnings per share, and is expected to hit earnings by 7-10 cents a share in the fourth quarter.McDonald’s reported earnings of $1.07bn, or $1.09 a diluted share, during the three months to September, compared with $1.52bn, or $1.52 a diluted share, a year earlier. Revenues fell 5 per cent to $6.99bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.38 a share on $7.19bn in sales.RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar, said the earnings report “paints a picture of a company struggling to keep pace with evolving consumer tastes and a competitive global restaurant landscape”.Higher income consumers in the west are increasingly turning to so-called fast-casual restaurants such as Chipotle – the burrito chain which on Monday reported a 57 per cent rise in net income – which are perceived to have healthier food, with fresher ingredients.McDonald’s is working to change its reputation in order to compete, including a new advertising campaign that allows people to ask what goes into its food.The news came as the company is facing a government crackdown on nearly half of its roughly 450 Russian outlets, in the wake of US and EU sanctions against Moscow.Its shares fell 0.63 per cent to $91.01 in midday trading in New York.
162;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-10-19T15:29:01Z;Russia bites back with widening crackdown on McDonald’s;The latest salvo subjects almost half of the US group’s outlets in Russia to regulatory probes;"Russia has broadened its crackdown on McDonald’s to more than 200 separate investigations, in a campaign that makes the US fast food group one of the biggest casualties of Moscow’s festering stand-off with the west over Ukraine.The latest salvo subjects almost half of McDonald’s outlets in Russia to probes over hygiene or finance.In August, Russia’s consumer protection agency ordered four of the company’s largest restaurants to suspend operations over a host of alleged hygiene violations and shortly afterwards added another five to the list.At the time, the decision was seen as a political message aimed at mollifying anti-western sentiment and demonstrating that Moscow was responding to sanctions imposed by the US and the EU, which have crippled Russian banks and corporates in their ability to access global capital markets.But since then, regulatory moves against the chain’s outlets have mushroomed. “Right now, more than 200 probes have been initiated,” McDonald’s Russia said in a statement released on its website at the weekend. It said a court had extended the consumer watchdog’s temporary closure of the initial nine restaurants and added that it would appeal against the decision.McDonald’s has 450 restaurants in Russia, more than 100 of which are in Moscow and the surrounding region. More than 60 are in St Petersburg and the surrounding region, the country’s second big metropolitan area.The company did not give details on which of these were affected apart from the initial nine, which included four in Moscow, two in the affluent Urals city of Yekaterinburg, two in the southern Russian city of Volgograd and one in Sochi, the Black Sea resort that hosted this year’s Winter Olympics.Pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine have escalated the political turmoil that threatens to tear the country apart

Further readingBut according to information gathered by contributors to Yopolis, an online platform about life in Russian cities, five more McDonald’s restaurants have been closed in St Petersburg, two in the enclave of Kaliningrad, another one in Volgograd, and another three in the Urals region. And reports on Russian social media have identified separate probes in at least three dozen other locations.Among these is an investigation into the finances of Ronald McDonald House Charities in the country, which prosecutors launched on the request of a lawmaker – the first such examination since the charity started working in Russia almost 20 years ago. More hygiene-related inspections and complaints about the labelling of toys included in Happy Meals also feature.McDonald’s has faced probes over hygiene standards and the health effects of its food in other countries, but foreign executives said they felt the company was being targeted for political reasons in Russia.“It is the typical approach you see when they are determined to bring a business to its knees,” said a food industry executive in Russia. “The clearest sign for that is that you have different probes at the same time – not just hygiene but also financial.”"

In July, the company subsequently axed its 2014 profit forecast on the back of plummeting sales after its China-based supplier was caught relabelling expired meat and breaching other food safety rules.McDonald’s Japan, which is half owned by the US fast-food group, said the supplier problems would cost the company Y45bn in lost sales for the year, and trimmed its 2014 revenue forecast 12 per cent to Y221bn.Sarah Casanova, chief executive, said the company was overhauling its pricing and menu in an attempt to staunch double-digit falls in sales.Japan is McDonald’s second-biggest market by number of outlets – some 3,100 – and sales have contracted between 17-25 per cent in the months of July to September.The full-year sales forecast is based on the assumption that monthly sales would continue to drop 15-20 per cent year-on-year for the remainder of 2014.In addition to losses from writing off unsold chicken from China, Ms Casanova said the company would invest more than Y2.7bn to improve its quality management.July 23, 2014: Chinese authorities have detained five employees of a US-owned company accused of relabelling expired meat, amid allegations of systemic violations at a key supplier to McDonald’s, KFC and other fast-food chains in China and Japan. Lucy Hornby reports from Beijing.New measures include unannounced audits of its suppliers, and distribution of more food quality information to customers.After the scandal broke, McDonald’s Japan halted all imports of chicken products from China and switched its sourcing to Thailand. The group will next year start importing chicken from Brazil.“I believe it is my role as chief executive to do everything I can to regain the trust of our customers and to turn around the business,” Ms Casanova said, when asked whether she would step down to take responsibility for the scandal.Ms Casanova said customers had complained that its pricing was expensive, its menu was not compelling, and that its existing stores were outdated. However, cutting prices has been hampered across Japan as costs go up on the back of a weaker yen.The company’s shares have fallen nearly 10 per cent since late June, including a 2.5 per cent tumble on Tuesday to Y2,638.

This followed a rise in its quarterly dividend by 5 per cent, to 85c a share, late on Thursday, a move that the company said reflected “continued strength and sustainability in our cash flow”.The stock has been hit by the effect on sales from a food safety scandal in China. The dividend lift matched that of the previous year, but was less than some analysts had expected and cast an “unfavourable light” on operating cash flow, according to Wells Fargo analyst Jeff Farmer.The restaurant chain boosted its total dividend by 10 per cent in 2012 and 15 per cent in 2011, before cutting it to 5 per cent in 2013.TransCanada, the Canadian company leading the Keystone XL oil pipeline project, rose as much as 3.5 per cent to a three-year high after Reuters reported on Thursday that the pipeline operator was being targeted by US hedge funds for a possible break-up. TransCanada declined to comment but said that it was “committed to acting in the best interest of shareholders”. The stock is 25 per cent higher so far this year.The Calgary-based company, the second-largest pipeline operator in Canada, released a statement on Friday acknowledging there was “significant trading activity” in its shares and that it is continuously “evaluating its approach to capital allocation”.Microsoft rose 1.8 per cent to $47.52 on news of a second round of lay-offs, eliminating 2,100 jobs of the 18,000 jobs it plans to shed.In July, the company’s new chief executive Satya Nadella unveiled the plans in response to its weak position in mobile technology. The cuts will eliminate 14 per cent of its total workforce.The cuts were spread over several location and countries, but included roughly 750 jobs in greater Seattle, according to local media. The company also announced plans to close its Silicon Valley research and development lab, which employs about 75 researchers.Oracle shares fell 4.2 per cent a day after Larry Ellison stepped aside as chief executive, although he remains as executive chairman and chief technology officer. At the same time as the executive reshuffle, the tech company reported weaker earnings than analysts expected. Oracle posted earnings of 62 cents a share for the first quarter, below consensus estimates of 64 cents a share.Healthcare information and service companies, Athenahealth and Cerner announced plans to join Epic Systems in developing applications for Apple’s mobile HealthKit, joining the to create wearable health management technologies.Shares in Athenahealth rose 4.1 per cent to $135.11, while shares in Cerner fared less well, initially rising as much as 2 per cent before paring back gains to trade 0.7 per cent lower at $58.52.Shares in Apple, were weaker at $100.96 on the day that the company began selling its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.Overall, US equity markets were mixed on Friday. After opened higher on optimism ahead of Alibaba’s record-breaking IPO, stocks pared gains and ended the day little changed. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent, at 2,010.42, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.1 per cent at 17,279.74. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 4,579.79.
165;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-09-17T13:33:08Z;Russia wages guerrilla warfare against western companies;;"Efforts to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia continue. But western businesses are finding themselves hit increasingly hard by Russia-related sanctions– from both sides.Since the US and EU moved to “sectoral” sanctions in late July – to target not just cronies of President Vladimir Putin but whole sectors of Russia’s economy – western businesses have been suffering collateral damage.Banning some of Russia’s largest state-controlled banks, oil companies and defence contractors from raising western financing has hit the fee income of western banks. This effect has been exacerbated by “self sanctions”, as western banks opt to steer clear of Russian clients more broadly.Last Friday, the US went a step further: restricting US companies’ ability to work on Russia’s Arctic, deepwater and shale projects – directly threatening an existing ExxonMobil project in the Kara Sea.However, western business is now being specifically targeted by Russian countermeasures. Last month, Moscow banned selected food imports from the EU, US, Norway, Canada and Australia. In response to the latest western sanctions, Andrei Belousov, an adviser to Mr Putin, said Russia might extend this food import ban to cars, textiles and other light manufactured goods. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has said Moscow might also ban EU airlines from flying through Russian airspace to Asia.With an EU agreement on extending sanctions becoming increasingly difficult to secure, Chris Weafer of Macro-Advisory, a Moscow consultancy, suggests the anti-Russian measures may have reached a “high water mark” – unless there is a further dramatic military escalation by Russia, such as a full-scale invasion of east Ukraine.But perhaps the most insidious development is the apparent guerrilla warfare being waged by Russia against some western companies, using regulatory bodies and police to apply pressure.So far, the most high-profile victim is McDonald’s.Pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine have escalated the political turmoil that threatens to tear the country apart

Further readingIn July, Russia’s food safety regulator asked a court to ban some of the fast-food chain’s products, citing alleged sanitary violations. A month later, the regulator temporarily closed four McDonald’s branches – including the flagship on Moscow’s Pushkin Square. This is not just one of the world’s busiest McDonald’s but, since it opened in 1990, a symbol of the end of the cold war. Now, a dozen branches have been closed and 100 inspected. Although this is a fraction of McDonald’s 440 Russian outlets, it highlights the potential for further interference in western companies’ business.Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the Russian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, hinted at a political motive this week, tweeting: “The US is half a gigantic McDonald’s; 53 per cent of inhabitants regularly go to McDonald’s. Therefore, their closure in Russia is a symbolic step.”Last Friday, Sweden’s Ikea had its Moscow headquarters raided. Investigators are reportedly investigating the land deal for its first Moscow store, opened some 14 years ago.Finland’s Valio, a dairy producer, was also raided last month by Russian police investigating alleged money laundering by an unrelated entity. The police search added insult to injury after Valio was hit particularly hard by the food ban – Russia accounted for nearly one-fifth of its sales last year.Companies such as Ikea are veterans of Russian harassment. Back in 2009, the retailer suspended its investment in Russia, complaining of corruption – only for two of its executives to be embroiled in a bribery scandal a year later.Raids by masked and armed investigators, searching offices and factories, have long been emblematic of Russia’s weak rule of law and property rights. But raids on foreign companies had become increasingly rare in recent years, as Russia tried to court much-needed investment.The Valio, McDonald’s and Ikea cases suggest such tactics may be back. So, too, does Tuesday’s worrying house arrest of one of Russia’s richest men, Vladimir Yevtushenkov, amid an apparent fight over ownership of one of the country’s few remaining oil companies outside state control. The case carried echoes of the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Yukos oil company chief, 11 years ago.Kiev and Moscow may eventually come to terms, and sanctions may pass. But after 20 years of efforts to integrate Russia into the world economy, the market may be underestimating the lasting damage being done to its ties with international business.neil.buckley@ft.com"
166;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-09-09T17:12:25Z;Mobileye jumps as analysts climb aboard;;Mobileye shares advanced after brokerage Morgan Stanley lifted its expectations for the company on the view that it will continue to win new business and maintain its leading market position.Analysts with the investment bank say the company, which makes software, chips and other applications that process visual data to stop cars from colliding, is exposed to two of the “most powerful and fastest growing trends” in the auto sector: autonomous cars and software.“Mobileye’s superior technology and early start in the vision space mean that it has a five- to 10-year lead over rivals today,” said Ravi Shanker, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.“Management’s top priority should be capitalising on this lead to lock up as many large platforms as it can, without sacrificing pricing and margins.”Mobileye’s products are currently in use in roughly a fifth of vehicle models produced currently, Morgan Stanley said, and its customer base includes Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan and BMW.Gains are contingent on wins from automakers including Volkswagen and Toyota, Mr Shanker said, which will fuel global growth.He noted that competitive threats were “not lurking around the corner” and the company was steadily outpacing rivals.“We believe this will be even harder to achieve for the competition as Mobileye continues to add new features on the same hardware including semi- and fully autonomous driving capability,” he said.Mr Shanker increased his target price on Mobileye from $46 to $65. The company has been buoyed by an optimistic analyst community.Three-fourths of analysts who cover the company recommend Mobileye a buy, according to data from Bloomberg.Shares in the company climbed 7 per cent to $56.60, taking its advance since its debut this year to more than 52 per cent.McDonald’s said on Tuesday that the safety scare at one of its suppliers in China will cost the company between 15 cents and 20 cents a share in the quarter because of lost sales and the costs of “recovery efforts”.Sales in Asia-Pacific were down 14.5 per cent in August from a year earlier.The safety scare in China, which also struck Yum Brands, adds to headaches for chief executive Don Thompson.Sales in the US continued to fall last month, McDonald’s said. Same-store sales declined 2.8 per cent in the country, adding to a 3.7 per cent drop in comparable sales globally.McDonald’s shares fell 2 per cent to $91.09 while rival Burger King declined 1 per cent to $31.85 and Yum slipped less than 1 per cent to $72.07.Organic food company Annie’s soared 38 per cent to $46.10 after it said General Mills would purchase the company for $46 a share.The deal, worth $820m, is expected to close later this year. Executives with Annie’s said the combination would allow it to expand its reach and increase efficiency.General Mills shares fell less than a per cent to $53.17.Home Depot confirmed that its payment data systems were breached, leaving customers who shopped at US and Canadian stores potentially exposed.Home Depot, whose shares have dropped since disclosing last week that it was investigating a possible breach, said on Monday that it will offer card monitoring services to anyone who used a payment card at a Home Depot store from April.The company’s shares fell 2 per cent to $88.93.Barnes & Noble, the US books retailer, climbed 3 per cent to $24.09 on Tuesday – its highest level since 2009 – after it said its quarterly loss was narrower than Wall Street expectations.The company reported a loss of $28.4m, or 56 cents a share, on revenues of $1.2bn. Analysts had forecast a loss of 63 cents per share.Same-store book sales, which exclude the Nook, fell 0.4 per cent in the quarter from a year ago.The figure was better than the 1.9 per cent decline recorded in the prior quarter, when severe winter weather crimped February traffic.Overall, US equity markets slipped on Tuesday ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 declined 0.7 per cent to 1,988.44 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 17,013.87.

167;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-08-22T20:12:44Z;McDonald’s names new US president;;McDonald’s has brought back former executive Mike Andres to replace Jeff Stratton as US president as the world’s largest fast-food chain struggles to rejuvenate sales which have been hit by competition from rivals Burger King and Chipotle and a food safety scandal in Asia.This is the second change in leadership for McDonald’s US division in the past two years as the company’s domestic sales have slumped. Mr Andres takes the helm on October 15, when the 58-year old Mr Stratton retires after 41 years with the franchise.The new president has a long history at the company: he began his career as a McDonald’s restaurant manager in California, working his way up to senior vice-president, before working at Boston Market and Logan’s Roadhouse.“Mike brings a wealth of knowledge of McDonald’s and has built strong relationships across the system, as well as broader experience in the Informal Eating Out industry,” said chief executive officer Don Thompson. “He’s a dynamic, proven leader and I am confident he will help lead our US business to the next level.”Mr Thompson faces big challenges in reviving sales in North America. McDonald’s same-store sales in the US dropped 3.2 per cent drop in July, as low-income consumers continue to cut back spending in light of the financial crisis.McDonald’s shares have also been under pressure after an expired meat scare in China, which has strongly squeezed sales in the area.McDonald’s stock fell 0.15 per cent to $94.40 on Friday.
168;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-08-22T08:47:57Z;Fast food faces indigestion in China amid rapid expansion;;"One month after the expired-meat scandal that dented the sales and reputation of western fast food in China, office worker Arthur Han contentedly chews his burger and proclaims that now is the best time to eat at McDonald’s in China – while the heat is still on from the food safety authorities.Mr Han says he does not normally eat at the US burger chain, whose brand image for cleanliness and quality was shaken last month by an undercover television investigation that accused it and several other western fast-food companies including Yum Brands and Burger King of using a mainland supplier that relabelled expired meat.In a country where food safety is one of the biggest political issues, the $200bn fast-food industry has been propelled again into the spotlight. The latest issue comes as the rapidly growing sector is grappling with a host of other issues. These include escalating competition from local players; rising rents; labour shortages – and the fundamental difficulty of procuring safe supplies in a market that is both fragmented and growing rapidly.McDonald’s said this month that the scandal – which led Shanghai authorities to close down the affected factory of Shanghai Husi Food Co, a subsidiary of US food group OSI, and detain staff – initially had a “significant negative impact” on sales, though it could not estimate the outcome for the full year.Yum said its brands KFC and Pizza Hut also saw sales drop initially, adding that if the decline persists it could have a “material effect” on full-year earnings per share. But analysts say that, whatever the impact on western brands, it is unlikely local players will be able to mop up the leftovers.Food safety “is not just something that affects McDonald’s and KFC, they are just the best known”, says Torsten Stocker, partner at consulting firm AT Kearney. “If it’s a problem they are facing, why would others be any different?”Many diners seem to realise that western brands are not the only ones with a problem: one young office worker eating lunch at a local fast-food outlet this week displayed a length of wire that he had just pulled out of his meal and told the Financial Times that the only solution was to “ignore it”.That, say observers, speaks to the issue of suppliers. Most of China’s half a million food processors are far too small or unsophisticated to serve enormous and exacting clients such as the foreign chains.Analysts say suppliers have failed to keep up with expansion in the sector, with companies such as Dicos increasing its restaurant numbers by 40 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with last year, to 2,200 stores.Hence a string of scandals have shaken the faith of China’s twenty- and thirtysomething white-collar workers. Brands such as Yum’s KFC in particular have been hit by one highly publicised supplier scandal after another; Yum sales had just begun to recover from a 2012 scare over antibiotics in chicken, when the expired-meat scandal broke last month.A fundamental shift towards healthier Chinese-style cooking is redefining the industry, and consequently propelling domestic chains to challenge foreign evadersAnd problems with food quality have also coincided with other trends that have challenged western fast-food brands, industry analysts say.“Fast-food consumers in China have shifted away from their original curiosity about western fast food, and nowadays they are pickier and more focused on health,” says Shi Jun, catering industry analyst at Beijing-based Alliance PKU Management.“Twenty years ago, a McDonald’s or a KFC might have been one of the few locations in some towns that had air conditioning and a clean bathroom, but now there are lots more alternatives; competition has greatly increased,” says Shaun Rein, of China Market Research Group in Shanghai.KFC remains far and away the market leader with 4,600 outlets, more than double the 2,000 McDonald’s. But Dicos – a Taiwanese-owned fast-food chain strongest in lower-tier cities, with cheaper menus – recently eclipsed the US burger chain with 2,200 stores. It plans to have nearly 3,000 by the end of the year.Private equity investors have backed a plethora of local fast-food chains, which are slowly building market share in the highly fragmented Chinese market, offering food that is closer to local tastes and marketing themselves as healthier. One such is Actis, which invested in a local hotpot chain, Xiabu Xiabu.This is driving consumer choice in fast food, according to Mintel. The research company says: “A fundamental shift towards healthier Chinese-style cooking is redefining the fast-food industry, and consequently propelling domestic fast-food chains to challenge the foreign fast-food leaders.”Mr Han, at the McDonald’s diner, says that if he had the time, he would definitely eat Chinese. But the fast-food industry is counting on the fact that in China – as in other markets – people will continue to be pressed for time. With a rapidly growing market that still, for all its problems, generates net margins of 15-20 per cent, fast-food operators have little intention of throwing in the towel.Additional reporting by Zhang Yan"
169;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;McDonald’s: unhappy meals;Big worry is the world’s largest economy, not the second largest;"Forget China. McDonald’s big worry is the world’s largest economy, not the second largest. Yes, a scandal at the Shanghai facility of a key supplier has hurt: Asia-Pacific same store sales declined 7 per cent in July. But the fall at home in the US – where there was a 3 per cent drop – is a much bigger threat.McDonald’s does not break out sales by country. It did say, however, that the markets involved in the scare – including China and Japan – affected a tenth of global sales, or something under $3bn. Even if China accounts for half of that, then the country is a relative small fry, with a sixth of US sales (rival Yum draws half of its sales from China).McDonald’s domestic struggles are a bigger deal. Pressure is coming from old rivals such as the resurgent Burger King and new burger chains such as Five Guys. There are also more upscale entrants, such as Chipotle, which increased sales by a fifth in the second quarter; Burger King saw 6 per cent organic growth. Total sales at McDonald’s fell.Clearly, the company needs to make changes in the US. It could follow Burger King in simplifying its menu, using its size to compete harder on price or pushing healthier options. Remember, though, that McDonald’s is trying to extend an extraordinary run. US same-store sales went negative last year; between 2003 and 2012, growth on that metric averaged 5 per cent a year – a staggering record, given that the company had $6bn in US sales at the outset (it had nearly $9bn last year). The stock has returned 360 per cent over a decade. How many growth levers can there be left to pull?McDonald’s shares, at 16 times forward earnings, trade at a discount to many peers – feisty Burger King trades at 27 times, for example. But the company will have to grow again in the US to eliminate the discount. Past success makes that a tall order.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
170;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-08-08T16:21:35Z;McDonald’s investors lose their appetite;;McDonald’s shares remained under pressure after the world’s largest fast-food chain detailed the fallout from a food safety scare in China, which has significantly depressed sales in the region.The company, and rival Yum Brands, have been felled by an undercover news report that depicted food safety lapses at Shanghai Husi, a division of OSI that supplies the two companies in China, where employees were alleged to re-label expired meat.McDonald’s reported on Friday that in July same-store sales in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and African markets fell 7.3 per cent, far worse than the 0.2 per cent decline Wall Street expected. The division represents roughly 10 per cent of McDonald’s overall sales.The fast-food chain’s US division did not fare much better, with same-store sales down 3.2 per cent compared to a year earlier.The figures underline the challenges the world’s largest restaurant group, like many fast-food chains, faces as its key low-income consumers struggle to recover from the financial crisis.Mark Kalinowski, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, said the July results indicated McDonald’s could report its first full-year of same-store sales declines since 2002.“As best as we can tell, they were the worst worldwide month in the last 10 years, once trading-day adjustments are taken into account,” Mr Kalinowski said. “McDonald’s also commented to no longer expect “relatively flat” same-store sales for the full-year worldwide.”McDonald’s shares fell less than 1 per cent to $93.48, taking its losses this year to 5 per cent. The broader Russell 3000 Restaurant index has fallen 3 per cent over the same period.Gap was among the leaders on the benchmark S&P 500 after the retailer reported same-store sales ahead of Wall Street forecasts, as the company’s turnround takes hold.The company said global same-store sales rose 2 per cent, compared with consensus forecasts for a 0.5 per cent gain. Gap expects to earn between 68 and 69 cents per share in the second quarter, when excluding certain gains.Analysts with Sterne Agee said the results, which were aided by sales of clearance merchandise, demonstrated “improving fundamentals”.“Although the Gap brand remained negative, -2 per cent, this was a significant improvement from June’s -7 per cent and was the brand’s second best performance this year,” Ike Boruchow, of Sterne Agee, said. “Importantly, new fall product hits stores later this month.”Mr Boruchow raised his price target to $48 from $46 and lifted his 2014 and 2015 full-year profit forecasts.Gap shares climbed 6 per cent to $42.57. Rival Guess advanced 2 per cent to $26.65 while PVH, the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, rose 4 per cent to $114.43.Shares in San Francisco-based game-maker Zynga fell 1 per cent to $2.88 after slipping into a 14-month low earlier in the day on news the company missed Wall Street expectations for its second-quarter results. Zynga reported bookings of $175m, below forecasts for $191m, while revenue dropped by a third compared with the same quarter last year.Zynga’s price has fallen steadily in recent months, sliding from $5.50 in March to below $3 in August, as investors questioned the company’s ability to develop new content.Monster Beverage Corp’s stock rose 7 per cent to $69.45 as the company beat earnings estimates, although it disappointed on net sales.The California energy drink company reported on Thursday that earnings per share rose by 32 per cent to 84 cents, exceeding analyst expectations of 75 cents. Monster’s stock has dropped by 7 per cent over the past month as investors anticipated weak second-quarter results, but RBC Capital Markets and JPMorgan raised their price targets for the company in the aftermath of the positive report.Shares in Nvidia rose 9 per cent to $19.00 after at least seven analysts raised their target prices on the company following its strong earnings report released on Thursday.The graphic chipmaker posted a 33 per cent increase in earnings during the quarter ended July 27, and forecast revenue for the current quarter at $1.2bn, above analysts’ expectations.Driven by strong PC sales, net income during the quarter ended July 27 reached $128m, or 22 cents per share, up from $96m, 16 cents per share, last year.Overall US equities were stronger on Friday after choppy trading over the week. The S&P 500 rose 1.2 per cent to 1,931.59 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 16,553.93. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 per cent to 4,370.90.
171;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-07-31T16:11:12Z;Yum leads S&P 500 fast food sector lower;;Fast-food chain shares were blunted on Thursday after one of the sector’s largest restaurant operators warned it had seen “significant” deterioration in Chinese sales amid a new food safety scare.Yum, the Kentucky-based operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, said that an undercover July news report has had a “significant, negative impact to same-store sales at both KFC and Pizza Hut in China over the past 10 days”.The report depicted food safety lapses at Shanghai Husi, a division of OSI that supplies Yum and McDonald’s in China, where employees were alleged to relabel expired meat.Yum, which had recently recovered after a year of sales weakness in China relating to a separate 2012 food safety scare, said it was “too early” to know when sales would rebound.“If the significant sales impact is sustained, it will have a material effect on full-year earnings per share,” the company said in a statement. Yum said it no longer purchases products from Shanghai Husi.Analysts with Wells Fargo and RBC cut earnings targets for 2014 and 2015, as China represents an outsized share of overall Yum sales compared to other markets.“With the current meat supply issue receiving widespread media coverage, we expect the consumer response to most closely resemble that of the 2013 antibiotic issue – meaning KFC and Pizza Hut are likely to see a shortlived, but meaningful, same-store sales hit,” Jeff Farmer, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Shares of Yum declined almost 5 per cent to close at $69.40, McDonald’s fell 1.45 per cent to $94.56 and Starbucks, which has more than 1,000 stores in China, dipped 1.55 per cent to $77.68. Burger King Worldwide shares declined just short of 1 per cent to end the day at $26.38.Whole Foods was under pressure after third quarter same-store sales fell short of expectations and the grocer cut its full-year earnings guidance.The Austin, Texas-based company lowered the top end of its full-year outlook, following three previous cuts to guidance. It now sees 2014 earnings per share in a range of $1.52 to $1.54, compared to a range of $1.52 to $1.56 earlier.Whole Foods forecast full-year revenue growth between 9.6 and 9.9 per cent, compared to earlier expectations as high as 11 per cent.The company also said same-store sales rose 3.9 per cent from a year earlier, shy of Wall Street estimates for a 4.8 per cent gain.“With comps running well below 6 per cent long-term goals, we believe valuation will remain under pressure,” Mark Wiltamuth, an analysts with Jefferies, said. Mr Wiltamuth lowered his price target on the company to $41 from $46.Whole Foods shares fell 2.28 per cent to $38.22. Rival grocers declined on the figures. Fresh Market slipped 2.5 per cent to $29.93, Kroger slid 1.51 per cent to $49.98 and Sprouts Farmers Market dipped 2.8 per cent to end at $30.51.US defence contractor L-3 Communications led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said it was conducting an investigation into alleged misconduct that led to overstatements of sales and income at its aerospace division.The company, which makes communications systems used in drones and aircraft carriers, said that contract cost over-runs had been “inappropriately deferred” and net sales were overstated.“The company believes that the amounts associated with these adjustments are the result of misconduct and accounting errors at the Aerospace Systems segment,” the company said in a statement. “The misconduct included concealment from L-3’s Corporate staff and external auditors.”L-3 shares declined 12.27 per cent to $104.96.Synchrony Financial, the North American store credit business partially floated by General Electric, edged higher on its debut on Thursday, despite broad declines in US equity markets. Shares rose as much as 1 per cent to $24 before paring gains. Synchrony priced 125m shares at $23, the bottom of its $23-$26 range.Overall, investors sold off US equity positions. The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to close at 1,930.67 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.88 per cent to 16,563.3.

172;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;US labour regulator deals blow to McDonald's;;A top US labour regulator has told McDonald’s it is jointly responsible for working conditions at its franchisees’ restaurants, a decision that if upheld could deal a blow to the long-running fast food franchise model.The National Labor Relations Board said on Tuesday it would name McDonald’s a “joint employer” with its franchisees in legitimate employee complaints, a decision that could mean the burger chain is liable for unfair labour practices at its over 14,000 US restaurants. Roughly 90 per cent of the chain’s US outlets are owned by franchisees.The board said it had found that 43 of the 181 labour practice complaints filed against the world’s largest restaurant group since November 2012 had merit. McDonald’s, which has vowed to contest the decision, could be included as a joint employer in each complaint.The news comes as fast food workers throughout the country rally for union rights and a $15 minimum wage. McDonald’s has consistently argued that its 3,000 franchisees – and not the parent company – set wages and are responsible for working conditions, a position that could become more difficult to hold if the decision is upheld.McDonald’s said it “believes that this decision changes the rules for thousands of small businesses, and goes against decades of established law regarding the franchise model in the United States”.Steve Caldeira, chief executive of the International Franchise Association, said the decision “would upend years of federal and state legal precedent” and “would be a devastating blow to the franchise business and franchise model”.Many large fast food companies, including Yum Brands and Burger King, use the franchise system, which allows them to keep costs down while collecting royalties and fees from franchisees.Fast Food Forward, the workers’ group that is organising for unionisation and a $15 wage, said the ruling “carries widespread implications for the fast food industry”.“Despite McDonald’s repeated assertions that it does not control employment decisions at its franchised restaurants, the NLRB . . . [said the] company is indeed an employer that exerts substantial power over its employees’ working conditions,” the workers’ group said.The news comes months after McDonald’s became the subject of class-action lawsuits in three states by employees who accuse it and its franchisees of systematic wage theft.The suits allege McDonald’s and its franchisees illegally underpaid employees by forcing them to work “off the clock”, not paying overtime and deleting hours from their timecards.
173;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-07-29T08:24:26Z;McDonald’s Japan axes profit guidance amid food safety scandal;;McDonald’s Japan has pulled its full-year profit guidance on the back of falling sales, after some of its 3,200 restaurants were forced to scratch chicken nuggets off the menu in the wake of a food scandal at its China-based supplier.The scandal has left McDonald’s across China, Hong Kong and Japan with limited menus – in some cases no more than fish burgers and fries – and the profit warning illustrates how the scandal is hitting bottom lines as well as customers’ stomachs.McDonald’s Japan, which is 50 per cent owned by the US fast food group and operates in its second biggest market by number of outlets, said that its “sales and profit expectations have been reduced” after its China-based supplier was found to be relabelling expired meat and breaching other food safety practices.It had previously forecast sales of Y250bn ($2.45bn) for the year to December and net income of Y6bn, adding that it could not commit to new targets as it was too soon to estimate the scandal’s full impact.A spokeswoman for US McDonald’s said she “cannot speculate” on how the shortages or abrupt supply chain shifts might impact the parent company’s performance, or when the shortages might end.Meanwhile, McDonald’s faces supply shortages in China, its third-largest market, after it suspended sourcing food from processor OSI, the privately owned American company at the centre of the scandal.Shanghai-based Dragon TV reported last week that OSI’s plant on the outskirts of the city was relabelling expired meat and performing other unhygienic practices, spurring regulators to shut that plant and step up inspections of OSI’s other processing facilities in China.The suspension is the strongest measure McDonald’s has taken to date in response to the allegations against its partner of many decades. Some McDonald’s outlets in mainland China are reported to have sold out of meat products.McDonald’s, which sources from OSI in the US, invited the Illinois-based company to set up a processing plant in China when the fast food chain entered the country in the early 1990s. OSI then expanded its China business to supply other chains, including KFC – for which it set up the Shanghai plant – Pizza Hut, Starbucks and 7-11.“Supplies of some products to some China restaurants have been cut. We are trying hard to allocate supply from other sources and resume supply as soon as possible,” the fast food chain said. It estimated that it would be able to restore full menus at some outlets early next month, while others would take longer.Fast food chains have scrambled to redirect the supply chain after the Shanghai plant closed, and the loss of supply from all of OSI’s China plants could prove a challenge for McDonald’s, which relies on a smaller but tighter network of suppliers than does its chief rival, KFC.The results can be odd. One KFC outlet in Shanghai sold spicy chicken burgers but not spicy drumsticks on Tuesday, while a KFC outlet in Beijing had pork burgers but no chicken. A McDonald’s in Hong Kong posted a sign that it could no longer provide some chicken items, corn or iced tea.Yum Brands, which owns KFC, said last week it would cut ties with OSI, which primarily supplied its operations in eastern and southwestern China. It said it only bought a few products from OSI in the US.OSI processes the meat of 300m chickens a year in China, as well as other meats, vegetables and pre-assembled food such as sandwiches or wraps.Additional reporting by Tom Griggs in Hong Kong, Jennifer Thompson in Tokyo and Neil Munshi in Chicago
174;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-07-25T17:51:21Z;Moscow launches Mac attack in beef with west;US fast-food chain feels brunt of Russian anger at sanctions over Ukraine;"As the west unveils further sanctions against Russia, Moscow is hitting back where it hurts: right in the cheeseburgers, milkshakes and Filet-o-Fish.A regional branch of Russia’s consumer protection agency on Friday filed a lawsuit against McDonald’s in a Moscow court, alleging that certain of the chain’s products – including its chicken burger, Caesar wrap and ice cream parfait – did not meet Russian health standards.The Veliky Novgorod branch of Rospotrebnadzor said extensive laboratory tests had shown many McDonald’s products were rife with “discrepancies in quality and safety” and did not follow “the physical-chemical and microbiological parameters required by [Russian] law”.It had found evidence of E-coli in McDonald’s Caesar wraps and vegetable salads, it alleged, and accused the US group of understating the calorie-count in items like its cheeseburger and Filet-o-Fish, and the fat and carbohydrate content in its vanilla and chocolate milkshakes.Over the past decade, Russia has finessed the art of adopting ultra-stringent health and safety standards just when geopolitical tensions are reaching their peak. It banned Latvian sprats during a territorial dispute with Riga; Georgian wine and mineral water in the run up to its 2008 war with Tbilisi; and Polish pork when Warsaw advocated tougher sanctions against Russia this year.Now there is a new target: Ukraine and its western allies. Separate to the McDonald's incident on Friday, Russia announced it would be banning all dairy imports from Ukraine from next week after Rospotrebnadzor warned of the “risky” and worsening qualities of the products.In a statement, McDonald’s said it had received no complaints from Ropotrebnadzor and knew nothing about the lawsuit. “For the 25 years that the company has been working on the Russian market, McDonald’s main priority has been to provide quality and safe products to our customers.”McDonald’s has long been held up as one of the great multinational success stories in Russia. When, after 14 years of negotiations with the Soviet government, it opened its flagship outlet on Moscow’s Pushkin Square in 1990, it was thronged by a crowd of 30,000 on its very first day.Now US-Russia tensions over Ukraine are threatening to eclipse the company’s business in Russia. The EU on Friday said it had readied a fresh tranche of sanctions against additional Russian businesses and individuals.Latest news on the downing of a Malaysia Airlines flight by a missile over eastern UkraineWhile the Kremlin has not imposed its own sanctions against US groups, some of Russia’s more patriotically-inclined politicians and businessmen have taken matters into their own hand.Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of the far-right Liberal-Democratic party, has called a national ban on McDonald’s and Pepsi, and helped organise protests at regional McDonald’s. A pro-Kremlin youth group launched an “eat Russian” viral campaign this week, with activists advocating Twitter users to choose borscht and kvas, a Russian soft drink, over burgers and cola.In April, McDonald’s announce it would be “temporarily” closing its three restaurants in Crimea following Russia’s annexation. However, the US chain’s loss, has been another – Russian – company’s gain.Rusburger, a young Russian franchise, has announced it is opening up in McDonald’s old location in Sevastopol, with plans to later expand across the peninsula and beyond.“Rusburger is ready to give its services and products to all of Russia,” its chief executive Andrei Korotkov said. “Rusburger isn’t political. Our job is to feed people.” The chain will soon have more than 30 locations."
175;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;McDonald’s profits dip on falling US sales;;McDonald’s reported second-quarter sales and profits that missed analysts’ expectations in the latest sign that the restaurant chain is still struggling for growth.The company cited “ongoing broad-based challenges”. Like many fast-food chains, McDonald’s has faced sluggish sales in recent years as its key low-income consumers struggled to recover from the financial crisis.The Illinois-based company introduced a number of new products last year in an effort to drive traffic. But critics charge that it resulted in an overly complicated menu that slowed down service and confused customers.Same-store sales at restaurants in the company’s key US market fell 1.5 per cent in the quarter, against expectations of a 0.3 per cent decline.Overall, global same-store sales were flat, with the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region reporting a 1.1 per cent rise and Europe falling 1 per cent.Don Thompson, chief executive, told analysts on a conference call that the company would focus on marketing, operations and its low-priced offerings with “an aggressive sense of urgency” in order to draw customers back in. But some analysts questioned whether something more “radical” might be necessary.Efraim Levy, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said investors like the fact that McDonald’s continues to generate a lot of cash. But he warned that the slow economic recovery and a highly competitive environment may make it difficult for McDonald’s to boost sales and draw in more customers.“It’s a large ship and it takes a while to turn things around,” he said. “Change doesn’t come so easily, especially when there’s more competition.”McDonald’s has tried to entice diners by refocusing on its lower-priced items. Meanwhile, higher income customers have flocked to fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle, which saw shares soar over 10 per cent in after-market trading on Monday, after it reported strong results and increased customer traffic even as it raised prices.The world’s largest restaurant chain reported earnings of $1.38bn, or $1.40 a share, compared to $1.4bn, or $1.38 a share, during the same period last year. Sales rose 1 per cent to $7.18bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.44 a share on sales of $7.3bn. Shares in the company were down about 1.5 per cent, to $96.08, in midday trading in New York.The news comes the day after McDonald’s and other restaurant groups suspended ties with a US-owned meat supplier in China after a food safety scare.In May, the company pledged to return between $18bn and $20bn to shareholders between 2014 and 2016.
176;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Foreign fast-food chains face China disruption;;Foreign fast-food chains in China could see their supply chains disrupted as authorities step up checks on a key meat supplier, following allegations that it was passing off expired products as fresh.China’s State Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday ordered checks on all eight mainland processing plants owned by Illinois-based OSI Group, after an undercover investigation by a local television station found that meat past its sell-by date was being relabelled as fresh in Shanghai.It also ordered checks on all clients of the Shanghai plant, Shanghai Husi Food, which has been closed by local regulators.The more extensive checks are so far limited to OSI subsidiaries rather than China’s meat processing industry as a whole.OSI said it was “appalled” by the food safety issue and “sincerely apologised” to both its clients and any consumers affected. “Our company management believes this to be an isolated event,” it said.Starbucks on Tuesday joined Yum Brands’ KFC and Pizza Hut as well as McDonald’s in pulling products from the plant, although the US coffee chain said its only affected product was a chicken and apple panini sandwich. Ikea said on its Weibo account that it had previously sourced meat from Husi, but stopped last September.The Husi processing plant primarily supplied foreign fast-food chains in Shanghai and the surrounding region, but it also provided McDonald’s in Japan with about one-fifth of its Chicken McNuggets. McDonald’s said it was re-routing McNuggets from other Chinese processing plants as well as from Thailand.Fast-food chains tend to rely on food processing companies that can supply standardised products at volume, making it difficult to switch suppliers at short notice.“A large company normally has more than one supplier, never just one. But the question is, can the alternates replace the volume that has been displaced? That’s where it gets tougher,” said Matthieu David of Daxue Consulting.Foreign fast-food chains generally have a better reputation among Chinese consumers than do their domestic rivals, but food safety is a constant concern as supply chains have had to scale up quickly while still meeting global standards.Many have tended to rely on foreign-owned processors in an effort to better control quality, especially in the wake of a 2008 scandal in which Chinese milk supplies were found to be deliberately contaminated with melamine, a chemical byproduct of coal, in an effort to fool quality tests.At least six babies died and 50,000 were hospitalised after drinking infant formula laced with melamine.
177;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-07-21T17:09:53Z;Regional banks slip after BB&T setback;;Regional US banks were under pressure after BB&T missed Wall Street forecasts and said it would set aside reserves ahead of a Department of Housing and Urban Development audit.BB&T, the second-largest regional bank trailing only PNC Financial, said it built an $85m reserve in the period regarding its compliance with Federal Housing Administration requirements.The North Carolina-based bank said the department had not asserted any claims as of yet but that it had identified losses incurred by the FHA on defaulted loans ranging from $25m to $105m.“This has been an industry issue for many FHA originators, and we believe this is the appropriate course of action for BB&T,” chief executive Kelly King said.Ms King, speaking to analysts, added that it could be a “year and a half or so before we find out what the final determination is” regarding the inquiry.The announcement accompanied BB&T’s second-quarter results. Profits declined 22 per cent from a year earlier to $425m, or 58 cents per share. Excluding some expenses, the bank said its earnings per share would have been 70 cents, short of analyst expectations.The company blamed higher personnel expenses for the weaker than anticipated results.Nonetheless, the bank said it was aided by a 7.2 per cent rise in annualised loan activity from a quarter earlier, including a bump in commercial and industrial loans.The results weighed on the wider sector as BB&T shares slipped 4 per cent to $37.33, leading the benchmark S&P 500 lower. SunTrust Banks declined 1 per cent to $39.28, BankUnited slid 1 per cent to $32.30 and PNC remained unchanged by close of trading at $83.88.Yum Brands, the operator of the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, declined after the Shanghai food safety watchdog said it had closed a poultry processor that supplies some of its outlets.The move followed an undercover investigation by a local television station that found the processor to be putting new labels on expired meat, among other safety violations.KFC and McDonald’s, both of which used the US-owned meat processor to supply their Shanghai outlets, apologised to their Chinese customers.China remains central to Yum’s business, accounting for more than half of the company’s overall sales last year. Shares of Yum fell 4 per cent to $74.13 while McDonald’s slid 1 per cent to $97.55.Botox maker Allergan advanced 2 per cent to $171.14 after it said it would cut 1,500 jobs, or 13 per cent of its staff.A reduction in headcount comes during Allergan’s three-month, $50bn takeover battle with Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose takeover advances it has rebuffed since they were first made in April.Valeant, whose bid is supported by Allergan’s largest shareholder, Wall Street hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, has sought to portray Allergan as saddled with inefficiencies and having a bloated cost structure.Allergan described the cuts as part of an “ongoing effort to improve efficiency and productivity”.It will take a charge of between $375m and $425m to pay for severance costs. Valeant shares rose 3 per cent to $125.54.Toymaker Hasbro was under pressure after it missed Wall Street quarterly sales expectations, despite an 8 per cent rise in sales.The company said revenues were lifted by rising Marvel and Transformer toys, offset somewhat by a dip in game sales.Hasbro shares fell 3 per cent to $51.78 while rival Mattel declined 1 per cent to $35.96.Overall, equity markets trended lower as geopolitical tensions continued to ferment with US President Barack Obama calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to ensure that investigators have full access to the site of the Malaysia Airlines plane that crashed in Ukraine last week.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,973.63 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 0.3 per cent to 17,051.73.

178;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-07-21T09:04:34Z;McDonald’s and KFC hit by China food safety scandal;;A supplier to McDonald’s and KFC in China has been accused of supplying rotting meat to the fast-food chains and falsifying product expiration dates, in the latest food safety scandal to hit the country.It is also the latest blow to foreign fast food companies operating in the country, where promises of rapid growth – there are more than 4,400 KFC restaurants alone – are being undermined by food safety issues.The Shanghai food safety watchdog said on Monday it had closed a meat and poultry processor on the outskirts of the city after an undercover investigation by a local television station found the company to be putting new labels on expired meat, among other food safety violations.KFC and McDonald’s, both of which used the US-owned meat processor to supply their Shanghai outlets, apologised to their Chinese customers.Foreign food companies generally enjoy a better reputation among Chinese consumers than domestic competitors, but a series of local media exposes over the past several years have clouded that reputation.The most recent scare hits KFC, the fried chicken chain owned by Kentucky-based Yum Brands, just as it was recovering from a local investigation 18 months ago that found excessive antibiotic use by its poultry supplier. China accounted for 35 per cent of Yum’s total operating profit in 2013.“Once the news gets out it is going to be difficult for them to convince Chinese consumers that [KFC] can put the needed checks in place on their suppliers,” said Ben Cavendar, a Shanghai-based analyst at China Market Research Group.Food safety is a perennial issue for companies reliant in China upon supply chains that have had to quickly scale up while meeting international quality standards. But the processor involved in this case, Shanghai Husi Food, a subsidiary of Illinois-based OSI Group, has been in operation for almost two decades.“We are working with relevant government departments and an investigation is under way,” said an employee at the Husi plant in the Shanghai suburb of Jiading.OSI Group began supplying McDonald’s in China in the early 1990s, when the fast food group first ventured into the country only to discover that local supply chains did not exist.OSI operates eight meat or poultry processing plants in mainland China.In January, US retailer Walmart recalled “five spice” donkey meat sold in its stores in Jinan city in eastern China after it said tests found that the product contained fox DNA.Yum said it had launched an investigation into Husi and required all KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and cease using any meat from the supplier.“Food safety is the most important priority for us,” the company said. “We will not tolerate any violations of government laws and regulations from our suppliers.”McDonald's said it had suspended sourcing from the plant, and expected a temporary shortage in some items.KFC and McDonald’s restaurants in Beijing appeared to be as busy as usual, although some customers said they were sticking with chilled drinks for now.“What can you do?” sighed one mother, after purchasing a chicken burger for her son at a McDonald’s in an underground mall in Beijing. “You can only avoid the food for a while. As long as you don’t eat it on a regular basis, it should be fine.”Another hamburger muncher snarled: “Can you please not talk about this while I am eating?”Additional reporting by Owen Guo and Neil MunshiTwitter: @HornbyLucy
179;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Chipotle extends hot streak;;Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant chain that has developed a fervent following across the US, climbed on Wednesday after brokerage Wunderlich Securities said recent price hikes by the chain have not blunted sales.Wunderlich analyst Robert Derrington said traffic trends were little changed by an average 5.5 per cent increase to prices, sending shares 3 per cent higher to $604.11.Mr Derrington now expects the company to report same-store sales growth of 11 per cent in the second quarter, compared to an earlier 8 per cent forecast.“Operators in various geographies we recently spoke with mentioned little if any pushback from customers, perhaps aided by the fact that the company hadn’t raised prices in almost three years,” Mr Derrington said.The restaurant chain, which began increasing prices in April, has likely completed the roll out across its 1,600 locations, he added.Chipotle executives blamed rising food inflation for the need to increase prices, including a 25 per cent jump in beef costs in April from the end of 2013.Wunderlich lifted its price target on Chipotle to $560 from $542 and reiterated its hold rating.The company’s shares, which have advanced 12 per cent since the year’s start, have outperformed much of the fast food sector, including those of McDonald’s, Yum Brands and Domino’s Pizza. Chipotle has mapped out an aggressive expansion over the current year, expecting to open as many as 195 new restaurants.Since the year’s start, the Russell 3000 restaurant index – which includes the largest US restaurants and holds a market capitalisation totalling $286bn – has risen 3 per cent.Garmin shares led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 after Pacific Crest Securities lowered its rating to underperform from sector perform as inventory of its new vivofit fitness band accumulates.Analysts with Pacific Crest said Wall Street sales expectations for the fitness band were overestimated and a new, larger iPhone could weigh on sales of Garmin’s personal navigation devices.“We have concerns about the underlying strength of the outdoor and fitness businesses, which contribute over half of the company’s operating profit and are critical, in our view,” analyst Brad Erickson said.Garmin shares fell 5 per cent to $57.23 while Telenav slid 2 per cent to $5.47.Shares of Alcoa jumped 6 per cent to $15.67 after the metal mining company turned a profit following two straight quarters of losses.Profits in the quarter to June 30 were $138m, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $119m a year earlier. Sales were little changed from a year earlier at $5.8bn.Alcoa’s results come two weeks after it agreed to buy UK-based Firth Rixson, a maker of aeroplane engine and landing gear components, as the US company seeks to expand its divisions behind everything from aerofoils used in jet engines and sheets used in the auto industry.American Airlines, the world’s largest airline, was buoyed on Wednesday after the company said it expected second quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile, a key industry metric, to rise between 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent from a year earlier.The forecast followed a profit warning on Tuesday from Air France-KLM, which weighed on the airline sector.Shares of American Airlines advanced 4 per cent to $41.96 while rival Delta inched 1 per cent higher to $36.94.Container Store shares slid 9 per cent to $24.72, touching the lowest level since they began trading last November, after the retailer said sales in the three months to May 31 missed Wall Street forecasts.“Consistent with so many of our fellow retailers, we are experiencing a retail ‘funk’,” chief executive Kip Tindell said, referring to a 0.8 per cent decline in same-store sales.Overall, US equities snapped a two day losing streak ahead of and following the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,972.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5 per cent to 16,985.61. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 0.6 per cent to 4,419.03.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
180;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-06-09T20:54:24Z;Time Inc shares receive cool first day reception;US publisher falls as much as 7% before paring losses;Shares of Time Inc, the publisher of People, Sports Illustrated and its namesake magazine, received a cool reception on its first day of trade, falling as much as 7 per cent before paring losses to close 1.21 per cent down at $23.20.The company, led by chief executive Joe Ripp, was spun off from Time Warner as the former parent focuses on faster-growing and more lucrative businesses like pay-TV channel HBO and its Warner Brothers studio.In its debut, Time carried a market capitalisation of roughly $2.5bn. The company generated sales of $3.35bn in 2013, a 2 per cent decline from a year earlier, while profits tumbled by more than a fifth to $201m.The results were a concern for some analysts after the company levered itself up with debt to pay a one-time dividend to Time Warner. Time said it expected to carry $1.4bn in debts after the split.“The publishing industry is in secular decline. Time’s circulation and advertising revenue has been decreasing, competition is intense and continues to increase – strategic initiatives may not result in growth,” Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan warned.The business is one of only a few available for investors seeking entry to standalone print publishers. In 2013, News Corp separated its publishing and entertainment assets. Shares in the publishing side, which includes the Wall Street Journal and HarperCollins book publisher, have climbed 17 per cent since last July.Wells Fargo offered a more optimistic view on Time, initiating coverage with an ‘outperform’ rating and $27 to $29 price target. Analyst Eric Katz noted much of the restructuring Time would need to complete was behind it and its digital businesses offered a growth opportunity.“Digital makes up 15 per cent of total advertising [revenue] today and is growing at a mid-teens pace,,” Mr Katz said.Rivals Condé Nast, which owns the venerable Vogue and Vanity Fair titles, and Hearst are both privately held.Time Warner shares closed up 1.25 per cent to $68.99.US discount chain Family Dollar may not be a natural shopping destination for a Wall Street billionaire, but a disclosure by Carl Icahn late on Friday of a 9.4 per cent stake in the company lifted shares 14 per cent to $69.08. They closed on Monday up 13.37 per cent at $68.62.After flourishing in the four years after the recession, Family Dollar has faced increased competition and scepticism over its expansion plan.Mr Icahn, one of the best-known activist investors, said that he would push Family Dollar’s management for changes. In response, Family Dollar disclosed it had adopted a so-called poison pill designed to deter any shareholder from securing a stake of 10 per cent or more.The prospect of a change in strategy at Family Dollar also helped buoy shares in rival discounters. Shares of Dollar General rose 7.35 per cent to $62.25, Big Lots climbed 2.77 per cent to $44.88 and Dollar Tree advanced 0.65 per cent to $55.50.Investment bank Jefferies upgraded Family Dollar and Dollar General to ‘buy’, citing potential cost savings of as much as $1.2bn if the two were to merge.“This upgrade is based on a potential acquisition of Family Dollar or in the absence of a combination, a material change to operations aimed at running the business better and closing the sales productivity and profitability gap with Dollar General,” analyst Daniel Binder said.The US continues to strike a sour note for McDonald’s, sending shares in the fast-food chain 0.57 per cent lower to $101.38.The company reported a 1 per cent decline in same-store sales in the US last month, underlining the struggle chief executive Don Thompson is having in the company’s biggest market. Analysts had expected US sales to rise 0.1 per cent.Alongside an uneven economic recovery that has hit its customers hard, McDonald’s is grappling with tougher competition from the likes of Yum’s Taco Bell which are pushing into the breakfast market.Apple shares also stood out in a dull trading environment, rising 1.60 per cent to $93.70 as the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis.Overall, markets were relatively tame to start the week. The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.09 per cent to 1,951.27, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.11 per cent to 16,943.10. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.34 per cent to 4,336.24.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
181;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-06-08T17:40:50Z;Facebook takes on Twitter and TV in World Cup marketing battle;;Facebook is hoping the World Cup will win it the upper hand in live events marketing, as it takes on Twitter and even the TV networks by claiming it can reach 500m football fans.The social network is touting its user base as the “biggest stadium in the world” – a global audience for advertisers to target during the football tournament which begins this week.Facebook is gearing up for a fight with Twitter, which has been seen as dominating live events especially after a record-breaking tweet at the Oscars, by stressing its much larger reach and more precise demographic targeting.Will Platt-Higgins, director of global accounts at Facebook, said 2014 will be the first World Cup that will be followed on people’s smartphones.“For the first time in 2014, we, all of us, are carrying around a mobile stadium in our pockets, where you will be watching, learning scores, team sheets, changes, injuries, substitutes – all of it – and sharing it,” he said. “That is a hugely compelling thing for a marketer.”Facebook said it has identified 500m users with an interest in football, based on links they have clicked on or pages they have liked. This is almost double Twitter’s total monthly active userbase of 255m.While Twitter has positioned itself as a companion advertising product to TV, striking revenue share deals with major networks, Facebook thinks it can supplement and maybe even replace TV as a medium to target fans.“This 500m – it is very, very difficult to find reach like it in TV,” Mr Platt-Higgins said, adding it was far easier to adapt a Facebook advertising campaign halfway through a match as the scores come in.Twitter is also trying to teach marketers to develop adverts as matches progress, running a trial where advertising agencies were asked to create promotional content while watching old World Cup footage.With no single social media site proving the definitive home of live events, brands are creating more personalised ads to adapt for use across internet networks.Budweiser is opening a social media studio in São Paulo, where it will help handpicked “influencers” from different countries create videos to post online, while McDonald's will re-enact some of the key moments of the tournament by using French fries instead of footballers.Kevin Burke, chief marketing officer for Visa, an official sponsor of the games, said the payments company now spends an average of 30 per cent of its marketing budget on digital media, more than the global average of 23 per cent, according to E-Marketer.Visa will use Facebook to target football fans’ other interests, and offer them coupons with their partners. “You can tell by looking at the social graph if someone is also interested in music, shopping, fashion . . . which results in better target messaging to you as an individual,” Mr Burke said.YouTube will also feature prominently, with Visa enlisting directors from 32 countries to create videos that show how football is celebrated in their culture.Coke took photos shared by fans on Facebook and Twitter and printed them on a football-pitch-size flag that was designed by a Brazilian street artist and will be unveiled at the opening match this Thursday. The company is also experimenting with the Yahoo-owned blogging site Tumblr, Chinese social networks Weibo and Renren and the Russian site VK.
182;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-05-22T21:23:51Z;Minimum wage gets minimal attention at McDonald’s meeting;;Even as 400 protesters rallied outside McDonald’s headquarters for a higher minimum wage for fast-food workers, the chain’s pay policies generated little noise inside its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.A day earlier, more than 100 people were arrested for trespassing after up to 1,500 protesters descended on McDonald’s suburban Chicago headquarters, calling for a $15-an-hour minimum wage and a union for fast-food workers.The rallies follow recent minimum wage protests across the country amid a growing national debate over income inequality, which President Barack Obama has called “the defining issue of our time”.But the company that has become the main target of those wishing to raise the minimum wage was asked just one question on the subject, couched in a theme that has come to dominate its recent shareholder meetings: McDonald’s contribution to childhood obesity.While the company spends billions on marketing “to hook more kids on junk food and increase executive compensation, many of your employees can barely make ends meet on poverty wages”, said Sriram Madhusoodanan, of Corporate Accountability International, a public health and human rights watchdog.Don Thompson, chief executive, offered data McDonald’s often provides to paint itself as a stepping stone to higher-paid jobs. Nearly 60 per cent of its employees are under the age of 24 in company owned-US restaurants and nearly 70 per cent are part-time workers, “many of whom are just starting out”.McDonald’s owns over 1,400 restaurants in the US, while about 12,000 are operated by franchisees.“Offering opportunity is a part of the McDonald’s heritage,” he said.Critics – including employees attending rallies against the company – contend that workers would like to work more hours, but are limited because the company does not want to offer the benefits full-time employment requires.According to a 2013 study by the pro-labour National Employment Law Project, US government programmes subsidise the incomes of about 700,000 McDonald’s employees.We continue to believe that we pay fair and competitive wages and we provide opportunities and we provide training for those entering the workforceAddressing the protests, Mr Thompson said: “We respect the fact that they want to challenge us relative to wages,” but added: “We continue to believe that we pay fair and competitive wages and we provide opportunities and we provide training for those entering the workforce.”Mr Thompson denied charges by several shareholders that McDonald’s targets children with unhealthy food, and challenged comparisons of Ronald McDonald to Joe Camel, the cartoon cigarette mascot.“I sometimes hear . . . that we are predatory – as a parent, I wouldn’t do that,” he said. “We are people, we do have values at McDonald’s and all of us are parents.”He noted that his children were in the audience and that they ate McDonald’s and were healthy.Answering pre-screened questions, Mr Thompson fielded concerns that the meeting was held too early, praise from a man who started as an hourly worker and would soon become a franchisee, a request to expand the biscuits and gravy breakfast offering nationwide, and a question about whether bingo could be reinstated at the South Holland, Illinois branch.A child also praised the company for offering entry-level jobs, and told Mr Thompson that he wanted his job one day.McDonald’s barred media from attending the annual meeting, it said, “based on direct feedback from reporters and steadily declining media attention”.
183;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-05-20T23:01:08Z;Global brands: McDonald’s global footprint remains the envy of the industry;An ability to adapt to changing customer needs has helped secure a top 10 spot;In a world dominated by technology companies, McDonald’s remains proof that a man – or woman – has to eat.What people eat under the Golden Arches is getting healthier. But not too healthy, and that is a reflection of one of McDonald’s greatest strengths as a brand, its ability to adapt to changing customer needs: people want the option of a salad, even if they’re going to order the burger.Even as fast food consumption growth slows– and higher-income consumers switch to fast casual dining spots such as Chipotle – McDonald’s global footprint remains the envy of the industry.It succeeds, says Gary Karp, of food industry consultancy Technomic, because the company localises its menus, with the potato-based McAloo Tikki burger in India and the McKebab in Israel, for example.“It isn’t exporting American food,” he says. “What it’s doing is addressing the various marketplaces it is operating in and complementing its offerings with local favourites.”McDonald’s has fallen a place in the rankings, but continues to be a top global brand because of its high ratio of hits to misses.Despite its size – which is itself a big supply chain advantage – McDonald’s remains nimble, able to adapt its menus to the whims of the market.
184;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-04-30T17:11:39Z;ONS survey reveals scale of zero-hours contracts;;"Unions and politicians have called for action to curb employment on a “zero-hours” basis after official data showed that UK employers are using about 1.4m contracts that do not guarantee a minimum number of hours.Most of the contracts – accounting for about 4 per cent of all jobs – were zero-hours, the Office for National Statistics said. About 13 per cent of employers reported some use of these contracts, including almost half of tourism, catering and food-sector businesses. More than one in five employers in health and social work reported using them, although they were found to be relatively rare in finance, professional services, manufacturing, energy and agriculture.The ONS surveyed 5,000 employers. Its previous estimates, based on surveys of employees, found that 583,000 people, or 2 per cent of the workforce, were on zero-hours contracts, though that was widely regarded as an underestimate. Some workers could have more than one contract, the ONS said. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development has put the number of people on zero-hours contracts at 1m, or 3.1 per cent of the workforce. Their use is thought to have increased sharply since the recession and some economists see it as a factor in the UK’s poor productivity performance.John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said: “The ready supply of workers for low-paid, low-skilled jobs means employers are able to operate on a business model that has a high turnover of staff and compete on low cost and low value. But this business model is holding back productivity and the economic recovery.”The ONS study showed the average number of hours worked on zero-hours contracts was 25 a week. Women, under-25s and those over 65 were more likely to be on the contracts; and larger employers were more likely to use them.Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “Insecure work with no guarantee of regular paid hours is no longer confined to the fringes of the jobs market.“It is worrying that so many young people are trapped on zero-hours contracts, which can hold back their careers and make it harder to pay off debts like student loans.”Employers say the contracts offer flexibility for both staff and companies. Controversy over their use grew last summer after it emerged that some employers, including McDonald’s, Cineworld and Sports Direct, used them for nearly all their staff. McDonald’s has used zero-hours contracts in the UK since it opened its first restaurant in 1974. It says many of its employees are parents or students who are looking to fit flexible, paid work around childcare, study and other commitments.Vince Cable, business secretary, last year proposed a ban on exclusivity clauses that tie workers on zero-hours contracts to one employer. He also proposed issuing advice and guidance about zero-hours contracts for employers and employees in an effort to stamp out abuses.Labour plans to give staff the right to demand a fixed-hours contract when they have worked regular hours for more than six months with the same employer and the automatic right to such a contract after a year. The party would also offer protection against attempts by employers to force workers to be available at all hours, to insist they cannot work for anyone else or to cancel shifts at short notice without compensation.Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, said the “shocking figures show that since David Cameron became prime minister, there has been huge increase in the number of people on zero-hours contracts”.Mr Cable said the analysis “shows that these types of contracts can provide important and flexible employment opportunities that suit most people in these jobs”. However, he said action was needed to tackle abuses and promised to publish the results of his consultation shortly.Neil Carberry, director for employment and skills at the CBI employers’ group, said: “Arbitrary attacks on the existence of flexible contracts would cost jobs and damage growth.”…Figures add to debate on slack in labour marketThe number of people on zero-hours contracts, which do not guarantee a minimum number of hours, appears to have grown strongly since the recession, writes Brian Groom. The question is: will this start to recede as the economy recovers or is this type of employment contract here to stay?The term began to be used after the early 1990s recession, but the practice probably dates from well before then. Attempts to pin down the scale of the phenomenon have been dogged by problems of definition.Employers say they offer flexibility for both staff and companies, and are popular with students, older workers and those with caring duties. But others say they have a damaging impact on workers who do not know what they will earn from one week to the next.The ONS puts the number of zero-hours and similar contracts at 1.4m, or about 4 per cent of UK jobs, based on a survey of employers. Its previous estimate of the number of people on zero-hours contracts, based on surveying employees, was 583,000, though many considered that an underestimate.In those earlier surveys, the number of workers saying they were on zero-hours contracts rose slowly from 2004 but doubled in 2013, possibly because of increased awareness of the term as a result of media coverage.The new figures will fuel debate about the amount of slack in the labour market but are unlikely to completely explain the UK’s poor productivity. Output per hour has not improved as expected since the economic recovery began but this may have more to do with problems in industries such as finance and North Sea oil.If productivity starts to recover and real wages grow, zero-hour contracts could fall. But, says Professor Kim Hoque, of Warwick Business School: “They may represent a structural shift in the labour market.”"
185;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-04-25T22:23:07Z;US fast food: pass the napkins;Fast-food stocks are struggling in an important market, and they are not cheap;There has been some indigestion in fast food of late. Mighty McDonald’s, which hit on the right recipe for much of the past decade, has struggled with products and pricing, particularly in the US. Yum Brands, the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, was hurt in its key China market with food safety concerns and an outbreak of avian flu, although those seem to be passing. Burger King has proved an outlier, with profit gains following a shift to a franchise model, which has enabled aggressive cost cutting and satisfied shareholders’ stomachs. But the latest quarter proved a tough one for all three in the US.McDonald’s saw its same-store sales slump by 1.7 per cent. Comparable store sales at rival Burger King were flat, and Yum’s US business was soft as well. Anyone selling anything that the buyer had to go outside to get has blamed the very cold weather in the US this winter for lacklustre performance. The fast-food chains were no different.It is reasonable that bad weather played a role. But these companies also cater to lower-income US consumers. They have struggled even as middle and higher income diners, who have been bigger beneficiaries of appetising developments such as the rally in the US stock market and the ability to refinance home loans. McDonald’s, for instance, has faced weak US same-store sales for the past several quarters.Looking forward to the rest of the year, the chains could also face some pressure from rising costs from commodities, such as beef and cheese. And this business is highly competitive. There is always the chance that one player comes up with a new quadruple cheeseburger or breakfast taco, garnering a bigger share of the business – or, worse, cuts prices on its value meal. In the stock market, McDonald’s trades at a meaty 17 times forward earnings (despite its troubles), while Yum trades at 21 times (for the growth promise of China) and Burger King, like other franchise-based businesses, earns a premium multiple (27 times). With so many issues, it looks like a good time for investors to stay at home for dinner.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
186;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s misses target as quarterly earnings dip 5%;;McDonald’s reported a 5 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, missing expectations as harsh winter weather and a slow economic recovery kept US customers at home.Don Thompson, chief executive, said the company’s “priority markets” – the US, Germany, Japan and Australia – drove the decline, adding the company was refining its menu and refocusing its marketing in order to “reignite our business momentum”.The world’s largest restaurant company introduced a number of new items to drive traffic last year, but analysts said the complicated menu confused consumers and slowed down service.Peter Bensen, chief financial officer, said first-quarter commodity costs rose nearly 3 per cent. Analysts said that because of the purchasing power that comes with its size, McDonald’s should be better able to weather high commodity costs than Chipotle, which announced last week that it would raise prices as retail beef costs have reached their highest level in decades.The news comes as McDonald’s faces renewed competition in its key breakfast category, which generates around 25 per cent of US revenues. Last month Yum Brands launched a Waffle Taco at its Taco Bell restaurants.Mr Thompson told analysts on a call that Yum’s breakfast push had not affected sales. “It seems every year there’s someone new that is making a run [on breakfast],” he said. “We have not seen an impact relative to the most recent competitors that entered the space.”McDonald’s responded by offering free coffee at its stores for a week, in order to draw customers away from Taco Bell and its chief morning competitors, coffee sellers Dunkin’ Brands and Starbucks.In China – which the company said was its fastest growing market in terms of store openings last year, with 275 new outlets – McDonald’s is facing an increasingly competitive market as homegrown brands, catering to local tastes, make big inroads.McDonald’s, which significantly trails Yum’s KFC in number of stores and sales in China, said last week it would introduce a more localised store design, and boost the percentage of outlets run by local franchisees to 20-25 per cent next year, from 12 per cent now.The Illinois-based company reported earnings of $1.2bn, or $1.21 a diluted share, in the three months to March, compared with $1.27bn, or $1.26 a share, during the same period last year. Sales grew 1 per cent, from $6.61bn to $6.7bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.24 a share on $6.73bn in sales.McDonald’s, along with other fast-food chains, has struggled for more than a year as its target low-income consumer has yet to fully recover from the global financial crisis.US same-store sales have fallen for the past five straight months, and were down 1.7 per cent for the quarter compared with the same period last year. Overall, global same-store sales rose 0.5 per cent, boosted by a 1.4 per cent increase in Europe. The Asia, Middle East and Africa market saw sales increase 0.8 per cent.Shares in the company were down 0.4 per cent at $99.32 at the close of trading in New York.Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir in Shanghai
187;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s faces US class-action lawsuits over worker pay;;McDonald’s faces class-action lawsuits in three US states by employees who accuse the fast-food company and its franchisees of systematic wage theft.The suits were filed in Michigan, California and New York and announced on Thursday by the employees’ lawyers.They allege McDonald’s and its franchisees illegally underpaid employees by forcing them to work “off the clock”, not paying overtime and deleting hours from their timecards.“Despite reaping tremendous revenues and profits thanks to the labours of crew members who earn at or just above minimum wage, McDonald’s is unlawfully failing to pay its workers for all the hours they work,” Joseph Sellers, attorney in the lawsuits filed in California and New York, said.Two lawsuits filed in Michigan allege employees were told to come to work, only to be told to wait without pay until enough customers showed up. Three California suits allege various forms of systematic wage theft, while a New York suit said employees were not reimbursed for the time and cost of cleaning their uniforms.McDonald’s said it was reviewing the allegations.“McDonald’s and our independent owner-operators share a concern and commitment to the wellbeing and fair treatment of all people who work in McDonald’s restaurants,” it said. “McDonald’s and our independent franchisees are committed to undertaking a comprehensive investigation of the allegations and will take any necessary actions as they apply to our respective organisations.”The news came the same day President Barack Obama signed a memo directing the labour department to strengthen overtime pay rules, which would likely not take effect until next year.“Overtime is a simple idea. If you work more, you should get paid more,” Mr Obama said at the White House. “If you’re working hard and barely making ends meet, you should be paid overtime.”The president has called income inequality “the defining issue of our time”, and has joined the growing national debate over the minimum wage, urging congress to raise it from $7.25 to $10.10.McDonald’s came under fire last year for suggesting that employees should get a second job to make ends meet or sell unopened holiday gifts on eBay for cash.According to an October study by the pro-labour National Employment Law Project, staff at the country’s top 10 fast-food companies receive about $3.8bn in welfare payments. Government programmes subsidise the incomes of about 700,000 McDonald’s employees, according to the report.Don Thompson, chief executive, has said the company is “not a minimum wage employer” and would be well-positioned to weather any rise.McDonald’s has struggled with sluggish growth in recent years.In 2013, the company reported earnings of $5.59bn, or $5.55 a share, up 4 per cent from $5.47bn, or $5.36 a diluted share in 2012. Revenues rose 2 per cent, from $27.57bn to $28.1bn.Shares in the company were down 1.4 per cent, at $97.37.

Analysts had forecast a decline of 1.6 per cent.The company, which generated 43 per cent of its operating profit last year from the US, said sales were better abroad.Comparable sales rose 2 per cent in Europe, as improvements in the underlying economies of the UK and Russia lifted overall results. McDonald’s said company-wide same-store sales climbed 1.2 per cent during the month.Chief executive Don Thompson continues to overhaul the fast-food chain’s menu and is cutting prices to better compete with rivals Wendy’s and Burger King.Shares in McDonald’s had slipped just over 1 per cent by the close of trading to $94.85.Apple shares rose 1.79 per cent to $528.99 in New York after activist investor Carl Icahn dropped a proposal demanding the iPhone maker buy back another $50bn worth of its shares this year.Apple investors were due to vote on the plan, which was nonbinding, at the Silicon Valley company’s annual meeting on February 28.The withdrawal of the demand comes 24 hours after Institutional Shareholder Services, a company that advises US institutions on how to vote on such proposals, urged investors to vote against Mr Icahn’s plan.Mr Icahn said he was heartened after Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, last week disclosed that the company had bought back $14bn of shares since the end of January.US toymaker Hasbro rallied 4.5 per cent to $52.36 after its executives said they were seeing “momentum” in a number of divisions on a call with analysts, even as sales disappointed over the key holiday period.The company said sales were little changed from year-ago levels at $1.3bn, while profits declined less than 1 per cent to $129m, or 98 cents per diluted share. Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $1.22 per share on sales of $1.3bn.“We are better positioned today to align our business towards delivering long-term profitable growth,” chief executive Brian Goldner said. “Importantly, we are seeing positive momentum in the areas of our heightened focus, our franchise brands.”Timothy Conder, an analyst at Wells Fargo, noted that gains in the pre-school market, as well as the company’s steady capital return programme, was a positive for investors.An upgrade to overweight at investment bank Morgan Stanley elevated shares of American Express on Monday.Analyst Betsy Graseck said new measures from the company to increase merchant acceptance of its cards could lift sales by $6bn to $16bn between 2015 and 2016. American Express, which is welcomed at fewer businesses than peer Visa, is at work to close that gap.Ms Graseck added that rising economic expectations in the US were likely to boost American Express cardholder spending.“Higher housing and stock market valuations disproportionately benefit Amex’s affluent customers,” Ms Graseck said. “We estimate 10 to 11 per cent spending growth; this is conservative in the context of the historical relationship of spending to real GDP growth.”American Express rose 1.5 per cent to $88.34.US equity markets drifted lower on Monday, following a 2.6 per cent two-day rally on the benchmark S&P 500 at the end of last week.The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 1,799.84 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged upwards to 15,801.79. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 4,148.17."
189;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-02-07T12:25:39Z;Good morning Vietnam, McDonald’s has landed;;McDonald’s is due to throw open its doors in Vietnam on Saturday, in a location that is high in historical symbolism – and revealing of trends in emerging markets, multinational ambition and world trade.A restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City, where the US pulled out of a disastrous war almost 40 years ago, will bring Big Macs to newly wealthy Vietnamese families in a venture branded with the golden arches but driven locally by the prime minister’s son-in-law.McDonald’s is treading a path already beaten by rivals including Burger King, Pizza Hut and KFC, which have all decided they need to grab a slice of the growing middle class in this country of almost 90m people, even before an anticipated relaxation next year of rules on foreign ownership of restaurants.“Here McDonald’s is about family entertainment,” said Frederick Burke, a Ho Chi Minh City-based partner at Baker & McKenzie, the law firm, and a long-time Vietnam resident. “It has also got to be the first restaurant in Vietnam that has a drive-through – which is a sign of rising affluence in itself.”Don Thompson, McDonald’s global chief executive, is expected to swoop in for Monday’s official opening of the branch, the company’s first venture into a new southeast Asian market in more than 20 years.It is part of a corporate influx that includes Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. But critics of Vietnam’s growth say an estimated quadrupling of average per capita income since 2000 has masked growing inequalities and poor economic performance compared with regional peers.The public face of the McDonald’s venture will be Henry Nguyen, a former Goldman Sachs banker who flipped burgers for the chain in the US as a student. His Good Day Hospitality business is the sole owner of the Vietnam franchise.Mr Nguyen, a Harvard graduate, is the managing general partner of IDG Ventures Vietnam, a venture capital and private equity group. He is also married to the daughter of Nguyen Tan Dung, Vietnam’s Communist prime minister.Ronald McDonald’s arrival on Dien Bien Phu street – named after a battle that marked the decisive military defeat of French colonialists in 1954 – also completes a circle in the fortunes of western food and drinks companies in Vietnam. US multinationals rode high in the then American-aligned South Vietnam until 1975, but the North’s victory in the war forced companies such as Coca-Cola into the cold for two decades.McDonald’s delayed its entry into Vietnam for more prosaic reasons, including a lack of domestic beef cattle and poor supply chain infrastructure. Now this singular symbol of American capitalism is back in Communist-ruled Vietnam with plans to open 100 outlets.
190;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2014-01-23T14:10:47Z;McDonald’s struggles for sales growth after ‘challenging year’;;McDonald’s will refocus its marketing efforts, simplify its new product rollout and speed up its service as it works to bounce back from a sluggish 2013 that it capped with flat fourth-quarter earnings and a drop in global same-store sales.“The key is going to really be to re-establish the trust of customers,” Don Thompson, chief executive, told analysts on a conference call. “That means basic execution at a restaurant level, marketing engagement at a much stronger level and also to make sure that our menu is relevant.”The world’s largest restaurant group has struggled for growth recently, in part because “those customers that tend to come to us aren’t faring quite as well in the current economy in the US”, he said.McDonald’s will focus on “locally relevant solutions” to its challenges in key markets including Germany, the US, Australia and Japan, he said.The company introduced a number of new items meant to drive traffic in 2013, along with a revamped dollar menu designed to entice consumers in tough times. But global same-store sales fell 0.1 per cent during the quarter, while US same-store sales fell 1.4 per cent. Analysts had expected a worldwide increase of 0.5 per cent and a 0.2 per cent fall in the US.The company said same-store sales for January were also likely to be flat.“We stumbled last year with too many products too fast and created complexity,” Tim Fenton, chief operating officer, told analysts on a conference call. “We overcomplicated the restaurants.”Mr Fenton said the company now planned for “fewer products but better execution”, which seemed to address recent industry surveys showing US franchisees complaining about an overwhelming slate of new products slowing down service.The news comes as the company reported earnings of $1.40bn, or $1.40 a diluted share, in the three months to December, compared to $1.40bn, or $1.38 a share, during the same period a year earlier. Revenues rose 2 per cent, from $6.95bn to $7.09bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.39 a share on $7.11bn in revenues.Mr Thompson said the company will spend close to $3bn in capital expenditure this year, roughly in line with recent years. It will open up to 1,600 new restaurants and renovate more than 1,000 existing locations. He said the company also expected to return around $5bn to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.The results come as the Illinois-based company faces mounting criticism of its wage and benefit schemes amid a national debate over the minimum wage.For the full year the company reported earnings of $5.59bn, or $5.55 a share, up 4 per cent from $5.47bn, or $5.36 a diluted share in 2012. Revenues rose 2 per cent, from $27.57bn to $28.1bn.Shares were up 0.39 per cent at $95.11 in midday New York trading.
191;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s Japan issues profit warning after costly stores revamp;;The Japanese arm of McDonald’s issued a profit warning on Thursday, saying net income would be cut in half this year as it revamped its store network.After market close the company said the cost of closing 74 of its 3,000 outlets and “aggressively” remodelling many others would wipe Y6.7bn ($64m) of net income from the previous forecast of Y11.7bn in the year to December.“Our competitors are catching up with us,” said Row Imamura, business controller. “We need to introduce products that meet consumers’ needs.”The announcement caps a rough year for the US fast food group in Japan, its largest Asian market. It has struggled to force through price rises driven by the weaker yen, while suffering a strong challenge to its mainstay sales of fresh coffee from convenience stores such as FamilyMart, Lawson and 7-11.In April the Japanese affiliate, 50 per cent owned by the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company, shook up prices for the first time in five years, adding Y20 to the cost of a Y100 hamburger and Y30 to a Y120 cheeseburger, aiming to bridge the gap between the cheapest items and the more expensive set menus.In July it tried to lure higher-end customers with a range of one-off, Y1,000 burgers featuring ingredients such as pineapple, truffle sauce and chorizo – all measures that “failed to stem the decline in customer footfall”, according to Kyoichiro Shigemura, a Nomura analyst.Same-store sales slid 5 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the company reported last month.Turning the business around may be a tough task for Sarah Casanova, the 48-year-old Canadian appointed in August as president and chief executive to succeed Eikoh Harada, who rose to chairman.During a previous stint in Japan from 2004-09, Ms Casanova made her mark by launching a shrimp burger promoted by model Yuri Ebihara, who is known as “Ebi-chan” (“ebi” means shrimp in Japanese). The group had planned to offer the burger for a limited period, but it proved so popular that it remains a fixture on menus.Before the profit warning, four out of five analysts covering McDonald’s Holdings (Japan) recommended that investors sell the shares, putting it among the 30 least popular stocks on the 877-strong Jasdaq index.Since Shinzo Abe, prime minister, kicked off Japan’s bull market last November by forcing an election, McDonald’s Tokyo-listed arm has risen by just over a quarter, lagging behind the Topix by 52 percentage points.
192;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2013-11-26T23:27:54Z;Burger King takes a bite at French market;;Burger King, the hamburger chain, plans to capture 20 per cent of the French fast food market by vastly expanding its footprint in rival McDonald’s second-largest European market.On Tuesday Burger King announced a joint venture with Groupe Olivier Bertrand, which operates around 250 restaurants in France, and private equity firm Naxicap Partners.Miami-based Burger King, which has three French stores, did not reveal financial terms or the number of new restaurants planned, but said the partnership would create 1,200 new jobs in its first year.McDonald’s operates nearly 1,300 restaurants in France, and the Illinois-based company controls around 46 per cent of the French fast food market, according to Euromonitor.That will pose a challenge for Burger King, but McDonald’s success in France “tells you that there’s clearly an appetite” for fast food there, said Jack Russo, analyst at Edward Jones.“I’m sure Burger King sees McDonald’s presence in that market and says we can carve out our own presence there and maybe even take some of that share,” he added.The fast food sector has faced stagnant sales recently, particularly in the west, as low-income consumers struggle amid a tough economy. Burger King reported a 2.4 per cent year-on-year rise in third-quarter sales for Europe, Africa and the Middle East, while McDonald’s reported a 0.2 per cent increase in European sales during the same period.The move to expand globally while sticking to a franchisee model fits with the cost-cutting strategy pursued by majority shareholder 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity group that took over the company in 2010 in a $3.3bn deal.The company said that as of September nearly 99 per cent of its more than 13,000 restaurants were franchised, compared to 90 per cent in 2011. By comparison, around 80 per cent of McDonald’s roughly 34,000 restaurants are franchised.Along with cutting costs, a decentralised, franchisee model allows fast food operators to better adapt to local tastes, which vary greatly across international markets.The news comes a week after Burger King announced plans to enter India through a joint venture with Everstone Group, a private equity firm.In the past year, Burger King has announced similar partnerships to open restaurants in Russia, South Africa, China and Brazil.
193;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Burger King / McDonald’s: watch the throne;Home of the Whopper enjoys better organic sales growth abroad;McDonald’s and Burger King both sell quickie hamburgers. That aside, comparisons may be overdone for now. The juxtaposition is undoubtedly giving indigestion to McDonald’s shareholders. Since Burger King was listed in June 2012 by its private equity owners, it has returned 40 per cent to shareholders, more than triple what McDonald’s has managed. But with less than half the number of outlets and a 10th of the enterprise value of the House of Big Mac, let’s call the Home of the Whopper what it is: a growth story enhanced by excellent execution.Monday’s earnings results at Burger King were the latest in a string of fine quarters. Earnings per share jumped by nearly a third. The company has finished its shift towards a pure franchise model – which means less capital spending on its part as that burden falls on location owners. Same store sales were negative in the US and Canada while McDonald’s managed 0.7 per cent domestic growth. But Burger King had comparable store growth of between 2.1 per cent and 3.7 per cent in Asia, Latin America and Europe, where it is also increasing the number of its restaurants. Organic growth, store growth and cost improvements collectively explain operating cash flow growth of nearly 17 per cent. And with gross leverage of nearly 5 times debt/cash flow, net profits are magnified much more.While Burger King has set its grill to a perfect temperature, McDonald’s is struggling to get its menu and pricing right. While both chains are wary about US consumer spending, McDonald’s is seeing weak organic sales growth abroad. But for years (like Burger King now) McDonald’s hit the right buttons on execution, such as fancy coffee. Eventually, it will find a new hit. So enjoy your reign, Burger King. But watch that leverage ratio. Consumer tastes change fast. Just ask McDonald’s.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
194;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Food Inc acquires taste for healthier options;;Reduced-fat french fries. Diet drinks made with natural sweeteners. Fruits and vegetables served with kid’s meals. The purveyors of salt, sugar and fat are trying to clean up their images.As consumers have grown more aware of exactly what is in the products they buy, food and beverage groups are stepping up efforts to shed their unhealthy reputations to capture or retain customers looking for alternatives to the fare they have traditionally peddled.“We are seeing a fundamental shift in consumer habits and behaviours,” Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, told investors last week. She was talking about “an accelerated decline in diet drinks” as consumers wary of aspartame and other artificial sugar substitutes are demanding naturally sweetened drinks.That push is also behind Coca-Cola’s move to replace Sprite in the UK and France with a lower-calorie version sweetened with sugar and stevia – a plant-derived sweetener – and the June launch of similarly formulated “Coca-Cola Life” in Argentina.Coke also recently patented a stevia product that analysts say may be used in zero-calorie drinks, while Pepsi is working on its own natural sweetener.Sales of sugary drinks have been falling for years, with fizzy drinks now making up about 40 per cent of the US beverage market, compared with more than 50 per cent a decade ago, Ms Nooyi said. But now diet drinks are struggling too.Sales of Diet Coke fell 3 per cent last year, compared with Coke’s 1 per cent decline, while Diet Pepsi’s 6.2 per cent drop was nearly double the 3.4 per cent decrease for Pepsi, according to Beverage Digest.Diet Coke and similar food and drinks “are under a bit of pressure as people are questioning ingredients [and] ingredient safety,” said Steve Cahillane, who heads Coca-Cola’s North American and Latin American business.The focus on healthier options is spreading throughout the food sector. In snacks, companies such as General Mills and Danone are playing catch-up to upstart Chobani, which has ignited a craze for Greek yoghurt.Dan Wald of Boston Consulting Group said the packaged foods industry alone has a $150bn annual US sales opportunity in healthier food, which will grow 4 per cent annually.Fast-food chains are not immune either. Amid continued criticism of its role in the US obesity epidemic, McDonald’s last month said it would only advertise milk, juice and water with Happy Meals. It would also offer fruit, salads and vegetables as alternatives to fries in value meals. The move followed Burger King’s introduction of reduced-fat, reduced-calorie fries.The restaurants are in part responding to losing higher-income customers to chains such as Chipotle, the fast-growing burrito chain with more than 900 stores, which serve food that is perceived as healthier. Chipotle’s shares are up more than 75 per cent this year, compared with 6.8 per cent for McDonald’s.“It’s really about building their brand perception around healthy and quality ingredients because . . . that’s what gets people into the restaurants,” said Dylan Bolden, of BCG.Recently we’ve seen faster growth in new innovations . . . [with] positive nutritional benefits rather than manufacturers making existing things less badThis is not the first time the food industry has made a health push. SnackWells low-fat cookies, now owned by Mondelez, launched 21 years ago. Low-calorie frozen foods, such as LeanCuisine, have been around even longer.However, some of the products in the industry’s early push were not really healthy at all, according to Bob Goldin, of food industry consultancy Technomic, with lower fat but high levels of sugar or sodium to give them taste.Today, however, it is no longer enough to create “less fat” or “low salt” versions of products.“Recently we’ve seen faster growth in new innovations . . . [with] positive nutritional benefits rather than manufacturers making existing things less bad,” said Mr Wald, citing Chobani and Roll Global’s Wonderful pistachios. They have succeeded by chipping away at the compromise between taste, convenience and health, he said.For PepsiCo’s Ms Nooyi, there is no question that the industry is grappling with serious change. She struck an urgent tone at a conference in New York earlier this year, stressing the need for a solution that brings customers back.“We actually believe that if you let this go too long, in another three or five years the consumer will walk away from [soda],” she said.
195;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s warns on global economy;;McDonald’s warned that the weak global economic environment would put pressure on its performance as it reported a 4.6 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings.“In the fourth quarter, tight macroeconomic and competitive pressures are not expected to change dramatically,” Don Thompson, chief executive, told analysts on a conference call.The Illinois-based company reported net income of $1.52bn, or $1.52 per diluted share, for the three months to September 30, up from $1.46bn, or $1.43 a share, during the same period last year. Revenues rose 2 per cent to $7.32bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.51 a share on revenues of $7.34bn.The company saw profits rise on strength in certain European markets, including Russia and France, as well as the success of the popular Monopoly promotion in the US.Mr Thompson said the company is constrained in raising prices in many markets, including Europe, where consumer disposable income remains under pressure.Despite introducing a number of new items meant to drive traffic, the company has struggled to increase sales. Global same-store sales rose 0.9 per cent during the quarter, while US same-store sales rose 0.7 per cent.Global same-store sales, which have been sluggish all year, would also be flat in October, the company said.The news comes at a difficult time for McDonald’s in its home market, as it faces fresh accusations of paying low wages and selling unhealthy food. It is also facing increased competition from “fast-casual” restaurants.Last month, amid mounting criticism of its contribution to the obesity epidemic, McDonald’s said it would offer healthier side dishes and promote healthier beverages for its so-called Happy Meals.Recent surveys from Goldman Sachs and Janney Capital Markets have found that it appears to be losing customers and the confidence of its franchisees.The results came just days after shares of Chipotle, the burrito chain, reached an all-time closing high of $509.74, up more than 16 per cent on Friday, and more than 70 per cent this year. Shares in McDonald’s were down about 1 per cent, at $94.22, in midday trading in New York.Last week a report from the pro-labour National Employment Law Project showed that low wages and lack of benefits provided by the country’s top 10 fast-food companies cost taxpayers an estimated $3.8bn annually, with 52 per cent of all frontline fast-food workers relying on government assistance.The report drew on data from academics at the University of Illinois and the University of California-Berkeley, which found that the more than 700,000 US employees of McDonald’s cost taxpayers roughly $1.2bn in annual public assistance.In a statement, the company said its franchisees, which own most of its stores, “provide jobs in every state”.

TSMC posted a 27.6 per cent year-on-year rise in sales: “We think that augurs well for Arm,” he said.● Whitbread should benefit from an improving economic backdrop in the UK when it posts its half-year results, writes Duncan Robinson.Citi analysts upgraded Whitbread to a buy this month due to the UK’s improving economy. Despite expanding its Costa franchise in Asia, Whitbread still generates 90 per cent of its earnings before interest and tax in the UK.Whitbread shares have dipped since the summer, as the performance of rival Travelodge improves. Whitbread’s Premier Inn business generates about 70 per cent of its earnings before interest and tax, according to Citi. The restaurant division, which has suffered in comparison to the rapid growth enjoyed by Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, is expected to post a fall in margin as inflation in the sector continues to be a hindrance.

Commercial aircraft deliveries for the quarter rose strongly, meanwhile, from 149 to 170.Investors are also likely to look for further comments on Boeing’s failure earlier this month to capture a new aircraft order from Japan Air Lines, which instead chose to place a $10bn order with Airbus, Boeing’s main rival in the commercial jet market.The consensus forecast is for adjusted net income to be down 1.7 per cent to $990m, on sales down 0.6 per cent to $21.7bn.● Investors will want to hear more about Argos’s efforts to boost its digital sales when Home Retail Group posts its half-year results, writes Duncan Robinson.The fortunes of the retailer have improved recently. Argos has benefited from booming demand for electrical goods, such as tablet computers, and has posted five quarters of positive like-for-like sales. It even launched its own cut-price tablet last week – the latest gambit from the retailer to stop losing market share to online-only rivals.Longstanding chief executive Terry Duddy is to leave the group next year, less than 12 months after he introduced a turnround plan. The strategy is focused on making Argos a true “multi-channel” retailer, with customers able to buy goods easily whether in store or online.Argos’s DIY sister chain Homebase has also enjoyed an improved performance this year. It posted an 11 per cent jump in like-for-like sales in its second quarter as the DIY and gardening store took market share from rivals.UBS upgraded the retailer to buy this month, arguing that “the mix of structural [and] cyclical factors which plagued the business on the way down may be reversing”. Shares in the group have rallied almost 70 per cent over the past 12 months.● Investors will be keen to hear the impact of China’s anti-corruption probe on sales at GlaxoSmithKline when the UK-based pharmaceutical group posts its third-quarter results on Wednesday, writes Andrew Jack.Initial forecasts suggest the company has been harder hit than its peers in China, with sales of its products down nearly a third over the summer while other western drug groups brace themselves for slowed growth as they await greater clarity on acceptable future marketing practices.Analysts have shrugged off the impact of fines and pointed out that China contributes less than 4 per cent of GSK’s sales. But the hit could hinder the group’s efforts to meet its pledge to boost top-line growth for the year by 1 per cent, after volatility in the first two quarters of the year.Deutsche Bank predicted last week that the China impact would be temporary, while suggesting GSK may have lost long-term market share on its respiratory product Advair to AstraZeneca’s Symbicort.Consensus forecasts are for sales to be up slightly to £6.6bn for the three months compared with £6.5bn for restated third-quarter 2012 levels, with pre-tax profits up to £1.82bn from £1.78bn. That would give earnings of 27p a share compared with 26p last time.The market will be seeking insights into the progress of GSK’s recently launched two cancer products in the US, as well as Tivicay, its HIV treatment approved by ViiV, GSK’s joint venture with Pfizer and Shionogi. They are also expecting guidance on launch plans for Breo, newly approved for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.EarningsBoeingQ3 $1.55 ($1.35)GlaxoSmithKlineQ3 27.81p (26.20p)Home Retail GroupQ2 N/A (140p)IberdrolaQ3 €0.09 (€0.09)Nasdaq OMXQ3 $0.63 ($0.62)Trading and sales updatesAsosBritish American TobaccoHeineken● Unilever, the consumer products group, reports third-quarter earnings, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. The company surprised investors last month with a sudden warning that sales growth in the quarter had been hit by weakness in emerging markets’ economies and currencies.Given 57 per cent of its sales are to emerging markets, the shares lost 5 per cent of their value. But they have since recovered and the focus now is on how hard profits have been hit. Analysts have downgraded annual earnings by up to 5 per cent, despite the Anglo-Dutch group’s affirmation it would meet full year targets.● The continuing slump in the PC market will weigh on Microsoft’s figures when the company reports its latest earnings, writes Richard Waters. Global PC shipments were off 8.6 per cent in the third quarter, according to research firm Gartner, hitting the Windows division, where revenues shrank 6 per cent in the previous three months.Under new disclosure policies, investors will get their first chance to see a breakdown of how the company’s hardware and services businesses are performing, following outgoing chief executive Steve Ballmer’s move to reposition Microsoft as a devices and services company. Over the previous 12 months, these businesses accounted for 24 per cent of Microsoft’s revenues but brought in only 7 per cent of its profits.Microsoft is expected to report revenues of $17.8bn – a rise of 11 per cent from a year before, when reported numbers were weighed down by a revenue adjustment related to Windows 8. Earnings are projected to rise by 1 cent to 54 cents a share, though that is below the 65 cents that would have been reported without the Windows 8 adjustment.EarningsBanco SantanderQ3 €0.12 (€0.12)Colgate-PalmoliveQ3 $0.73 ($0.69)Credit SuisseQ3 SFr0.49 (SFr0.72)DaimlerQ3 €2.08 (€1.05)DebenhamsFY 962p (980p)Ford MotorQ3 $0.36 ($0.40)KKRQ3 $0.59 ($0.69)MicrosoftQ1 $0.54 ($0.53)UnileverQ3 34.54p (n/a)Trading and sales updatesPernod-RicardRenaultThalesWPPEarningsNTT DoCoMoQ2 Yn/a (Y29.32)Procter & GambleQ1 $1.06 ($1.06)VolvoQ3 SKr1.09 (SKr1.20)Results forecasts, from Thomson Reuters, are for fully diluted, post-tax EPS in local currency for the stated fiscal period.

197;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2013-10-04T18:03:28Z;Potbelly’s shares double on market debut;;Shares in Potbelly, a US sandwich-shop chain, more than doubled in their debut on Friday, highlighting the growing popularity of “fast-casual” restaurants that promise diners healthier fare than traditional fast-food outlets.Potbelly, which started in 1977 in Chicago and had 288 stores across America as of last month, listed its shares at $14 each, a dollar above the high end of its expected price range.The shares opened on Friday at $28.66 and rose as high as $33.44 in morning trading, valuing the company at about $936m.Noodles & Co, a fast-casual pasta chain, also saw its shares double on their debut earlier this year. They were trading at $43.50, 142 per cent above the $18 listing.Analysts said that investors are hungry for fast-casual dining because consumers like the concept: higher quality ingredients than fast food, without the sit-down atmosphere or higher prices of casual restaurants such as Olive Garden.Sales at companies such as burrito-makers Chipotle and Qdoba and higher-end burger chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger, grew 13 per cent last year, twice the pace of their fast-food counterparts, said food consultancy Technomic.The fast-food industry, which has seen sales stagnate in recent months, is taking notice of the trend. McDonald’s recently announced that it would add more healthy side dishes, while Burger King launched a lower-calorie version of its French fries.“You just can’t be a burger chain serving greasy burgers and fries any more,” said Jack Russo, analyst at Edward Jones. “It doesn’t work because consumers demand more than that.”However, RJ Hottovy, of Morningstar, warned that investors should avoid filling up on the fast-casual sector.“Investors have to keep in mind that this space is getting a lot more competitive now – there’s been a lot of capital flowing into these fast-casual operators,” he said. “You can’t automatically assume these companies are going to grow in perpetuity.”Potbelly, which counts Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz as its largest shareholder, raised $105m in the offering, which will be used to pay a dividend, pay down debt and for working capital.Potbelly reported net income of $24m on revenue of $274.9m last year.
198;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;McDonald’s: still hungry;The company’s recent performance might inspire investors to turn to Yum;"New McDonald’s shareholders must feel unsatisfied. Over two years, the stock has returned 17 per cent. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index has done 3 times better. McDonald’s second-quarter results, released on Monday, will not help; they disappointed on both sales and earnings. A weak global economy is limiting pricing power, especially in the US, and management says the rest of the year will be “challenged”. The shares fell 3 per cent.Yet long-term shareholders are patting their bellies contentedly, after a 500 per cent 10-year return that whips the index. Of course when the global economy is slow, the company that invented the globalisation of restaurants is going to feel it. The question is whether now is the time to own a huge, efficient, proven company, or to find a way to target growth.The obvious way to focus on growth is with Yum! Brands, the operator of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC. It has proportionally more of its stores in the emerging world than McDonald’s does, and owns more of them outright, as opposed to franchising them. Food safety concerns drove Yum’s same-store sales in China, where it makes half of its sales and more than a third of its profits, down 20 per cent in the second quarter. But Wall Street analysts think these problems, which will probably result in falling sales and profits this year, are a blip. They expect double-digit sales growth in 2014 and 2015, twice McDonald’s rate. Yum’s shares have held up nicely, and they trade at 23 times forward earnings to McDonald’s 17.The choice seems simple enough, then. McDonald's for steady global performance, Yum for a leveraged play on emerging market growth.Remember, though, that during the past five years, McDonald’s has increased sales, on average, almost as fast as Yum (5 versus 6 per cent) and that it does draw a fifth of its profits from developing countries. The biggest difference between the two companies may be the supersized short-term expectations for growth at Yum.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
199;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s warns on global weakness;;McDonald’s shares fell after the fast-food chain reported second-quarter earnings and revenues that trailed expectations and warned economic weakness would hamper sales for the rest of the year.The world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue posted net income of $1.4bn, or $1.38 per share, in the three months to the end of June, up from $1.35bn, or $1.32 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.40.Revenues climbed to $7.08bn, but fell shy of the $7.09bn forecast.The disappointing results sent shares in the Illinois-based company down 2.7 per cent on Monday.Global economic uncertainty has led many consumers to keep a tighter hold of their purse strings, said Don Thompson, who took over as chief executive last summer.“Based on recent sales trends, our results for the remainder of the year are expected to remain challenged,” he added.McDonald’s has tried to attract customers through less pricey offerings such as its “Dollar Menu” options in the US and combo meals in Europe as it faces stiffer competition from its rivals.Burger King and Wendy’s have been revamping their menus under new management, while Taco Bell, owned by Yum Brands, has had a big boost from new products.McDonald’s is also trying to adapt to changing eating habits through healthier options.Although the company’s shares have gained more than 13 per cent year to date, it has lagged behind the growth of the broader market and some of its competitors. Burger King shares have risen close to 20 per cent, while Wendy’s shares are up almost 22 per cent.Global same-store sales, or those at restaurants open at least 12 months, rose just 1 per cent. Analysts had called for a 1.5 per cent uptick.In the US, sales grew 1 per cent, but fell 0.1 per cent in Europe as results in Germany and France dragged down those from the UK and Russia.In Asia, the Middle East and Africa, sales dipped 0.3 per cent, primarily because of weakness in China, Australia and Japan.
200;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2013-07-16T08:51:32Z;McDonald’s: EM pioneer;;"It’s quicker to list the countries where McDonald’s isn’t present than the ones where it is. The US fast food franchise now operates in 118 countries, and just announced Vietnam will be added to the list from next year.Given the history between the two countries, it is understandable why it has taken a while to happen. But the history of McDonald’s shows how the US brand has forged into the most hostile of waters.Most famously, the golden arches opened in Puskin Square in Russia (see picture left) – at that time, the Soviet Union, serving 30,000 people on it’s first day, according to the company. It also opened the same year in mainland China, in Shenzhen. The company aims to have over 2,000 outlets in China by the end of 2013, which would make it it’s third biggest market after the US (18,000+ outlets) and Japan (over 3,500). Brazil, Canada, France and the UK all have around 1,200 to 1,500 outlets.Some of the more challenging outposts are due to US military presence: the McDonald’s in Cuba isn’t for ordinary citizens – it’s for the army in Guantanamo. Similarly, the Iraq Baghdad was in the Green Zone for US military.But it also operates in tough places without a military leg up: Honduras, Oman, Pakistan, for example.And McDonald’s isn’t for ever: it has closed up shop in several countries including Jamaica, Iceland and Bolivia.Here’s a map of McDonald’s worldwide, showing the expansion around the world.Related reading:

201;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s to bring Big Mac to Vietnam;;Vietnam is finally set to get its first taste of the Big Mac after US burger chain McDonald’s said it would open its first outlet in the communist-run country early next year.The Illinois-based company said it had appointed a Vietnamese businessman, Henry Nguyen, an overseas Vietnamese who returned to the country a decade ago, as “developmental licensee” to “build the [McDonald’s] brand” in the country.The first outlet will be in Ho Chi Minh City, the country’s commercial hub. McDonald’s said the menu would include the Big Mac sandwich, cheeseburgers and fries.The move, which makes Vietnam the 38th Asian country in which McDonald’s operates, highlights how the country is fast becoming one of the most attractive consumer markets in southeast Asia, even though its economy is among the worst performing.In February, Starbucks, the US coffee chain, opened its first outlet in Vietnam, also in Ho Chi Minh City, increasing its presence across Asia to 12 countries.Other US chains already in Vietnam include Subway and Yum! Brands’ KFC and Pizza Hut. Jollibee, the largest fast food group in the Philippines, is expanding in Vietnam through a joint venture with the owner of Highlands Coffee, Vietnam’s leading upmarket coffee shop chain.The entry of McDonald's also marks the arrival of arguably the most iconic of US food brands almost four decades after the end of the Vietnam war.US food and drinks products were popular in the former South Vietnam until the war ended with communist victory in 1975, forcing companies such as Coca-Cola to abandon the market.Coca-Cola and rival Pepsi re-established themselves in the mid-1990s. McDonald’s never had a presence in South Vietnam.The company first looked at Vietnam over a decade ago, but the lack of a domestic source of beef cattle and a poor supply chain infrastructure meant the market was not suitable.The company’s strong association with US culture also caused problems. In the mid-1990s, the people’s committee of the city of Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, briefly banned McDonald’s from the city.The contract with Mr Nguyen, who once flipped burgers at a McDonald’s while a student in the US, was the result of a “rigorous” selection process that began years ago, the company said.Mr Nguyen, who is married to a daughter of Vietnamese prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung, is managing general partner of IDG Ventures Vietnam, a venture capital and private equity firm he founded in 2004. A former Goldman Sachs employee in New York, he graduated from Harvard University and later obtained an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management in Chicago.“As we grow our presence in the Asia region, we are looking for partners with a blend of strong business acumen and a unique understanding of our brand,” said Dave Hoffmann, president of McDonald’s Asia Pacific.“Henry Nguyen is that ideal business partner who has an impressive business background and proven record in driving new business ventures in Vietnam.”
202;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2013-05-23T18:02:15Z;McDonald’s defends on obesity concerns;;Don Thompson, McDonald’s chief executive, has vigorously defended the company against allegations that it targets children and minority communities with unhealthy food that causes obesity.“We don’t sell junk food,” Mr Thompson said. “We sell a lot of fruits and veggies at McDonald’s and we are trying to introduce even more.”Mr Thompson made the comments at the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting where six of the 13 shareholder questions dealt with McDonald’s role in the obesity epidemic and a few dozen protesters rallied outside the company’s suburban Chicago campus.McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, has come under increased pressure in recent years over how its high-calorie food has contributed to obesity in the US, especially among children. Last year, the company agreed to provide nutritional information for its menu, after long opposing the change.It has been trying to erase its junk food reputation by offering fruit smoothies, salads and putting apples in its “Happy Meals”. The company recently introduced egg whites to its popular breakfast menu.Mr Thompson drew upon his own experience growing up in a low-income, predominantly African-American housing project in Chicago in defending the company.“The epidemic of obesity particularly relevant to my neighbourhood [and similar ones] . . . it’s not about McDonald’s,” he said. “I still cook ham hocks with my greens at home – I grew up doing that. I’ll continue doing that.”He disputed allegations that the company targets African-Americans by using prominent black athletes like gymnast Gabby Douglas and basketball player LeBron James.A 2010 report by the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity at Yale University found that African-American children and teens saw at least 50 per cent more fast food ads on TV than their white peers, while “McDonald’s and KFC specifically targeted African American youth”.But Mr Thompson said the company did not specifically target minority communities or children.“We are not the cause of obesity. We are not overtly marketing to children,” Mr Thompson said to applause. “Ronald [McDonald] is not a bad guy. He’s a clown. He’s about fun . . . so I’d ask you all to let your kids have some fun too.”Tanya Fields, who spoke at the meeting in favour of resolution requiring McDonald’s to assess the health impacts of its food, called her community in the Bronx borough of New York “a food swamp [where] McDonald’s is the biggest alligator”.“There are three McDonald’s within walking distance of my house,” she said after the meeting. “And when my children see the golden arches all around them, it normalises it for them.”The meeting came the day before McDonald’s Japan plans to reintroduce its limited-time “Mega Potato” product: a single container with the equivalent of two large French fry orders, which weighs over 300g and contains 1,000 calories. A spokeswoman said it is “a shareable menu item for families”.
203;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;McDonald’s earnings edge higher;;McDonald’s warned that soft global consumer spending would continue to hamper sales this month as it reported first-quarter earnings up slightly amid stiff competition from fast food rivals.Franchisees have questioned the company’s focus on its dollar menu in order to gain market share, but Peter Bensen, chief financial officer, said the move was essential to ensure long-term success.“In this environment where . . . you have soft economic, declining-to-flat eating out markets, that battle for market share becomes so critical to the long-term health of the business that we are willing to sacrifice a little bit of margin to maintain that traffic and grow the market share,” he said on a call with analysts.The fast-food group reported net income of $1.270bn, or $1.26 per share, in the three months to March 31, up slightly from $1.267bn, or $1.23 per share, in the same period a year ago.Sales rose 1 per cent to $6.61bn, compared with $6.55bn during the same quarter last year.“While the company’s results for the quarter reflected difficult prior year comparisons and the ongoing impact of global economic headwinds, we continue our efforts to build market share and deliver sustained profitable growth for all stakeholders,” said Don Thompson, chief executive.Global same-store sales fell 1 per cent during the quarter, while they were up 6.7 per cent during the same period last year as consumers ventured out during an unseasonably warm winter. Mr Thompson said April comparable sales are likely to be slightly negative as well.The decline was led by a 1.2 per cent drop in US same-store sales and a 3.3 per cent drop in Asia, Middle East and Africa. European same-store sales fell 1.1 per cent.After suffering through continued weak consumer spending in the second half of 2012, the Illinois-based company has renewed its focus on its lower-margin dollar menu, introducing new products to attract more foot traffic.Margins at the 20 per cent of McDonald’s restaurants that are operated by the company fell to 16.2 per cent during the quarter, compared with 17.5 per cent during the same period last year.Last quarter, McDonald’s reported a 1 per cent rise in global earnings to $1.4bn, on $6.95bn in revenues up from $6.82bn during the same period last year. The figures were helped by a rise in US sales.Analysts had expected the world’s largest restaurant group to report earnings of $1.27 per share on $6.59bn.Shares in McDonald’s were down 2.08 per cent in afternoon trading, to $99.79.
204;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;McDonald’s joins inflation drive in Japan;;McDonald’s is doing its bit for Japan’s drive to push up inflation by raising the cost of its hamburgers, risking a backlash from customers in a country where incomes rarely rise.In a statement on Thursday, the Japanese affiliate of the US fast-food giant said the price of a hamburger would go up to Y120 ($1.22) from Y100 from next month at its 3,300 restaurants around the country, while a cheeseburger would cost Y150, up from Y120.The price rises are the first in five years, at what is McDonald’s largest affiliate outside the US. Consumers at an outlet in Matsudo, half an hour east of Tokyo, seemed taken aback by the prospect.“If prices go up, I will try to use coupons more and think more carefully what to order,” said Satomi Chiba, a 42-year-old part-time helper at a nursery, who takes her family of four to McDonald’s “two or three” times a month.The move comes amid concerted efforts by policymakers to banish the mild but persistent deflation that has pervaded the world’s third largest economy for most of the past 15 years. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister emphatically elected in December, has so far pushed for Y10tn of extra spending through the budget while leaning on the Bank of Japan to open the floodgates of liquidity.Haruhiko Kuroda, the new BoJ governor, obliged this month, pledging to double the amount of money in the economy within two years to achieve a 2 per cent rate of inflation, from below zero now. The prospect of such aggressive monetary easing has helped drive the yen down almost a fifth against the dollar since mid-November, and has led to a surge in prices of stocks and other assets.Tokyo’s financial district has begun to buzz once more. One visiting banker said it took him eight minutes this week to find a taxi in a street normally lined with idling cabs.Attention is switching to evidence of inflationary pressures building in the broader economy. While the weaker yen has caused costs for fuel and other imports to rise, many companies have so far been reluctant to lift their final prices, for fear of losing market share.Tokyo Shimbun, for example, raised the newsstand price for its morning newspaper from Y100 to Y110 this month – the first increase in 16 years – but left the price of a monthly subscription unchanged.McDonald’s pricing shift is also tentative. In an interview with the Nikkei newspaper last month, president Eiko Harada said higher prices were necessary to prepare for a staggered increase in the rate of Japan’s sales tax, which companies fear could stifle consumption. The first tax rise, from 5 per cent to 8 per cent, is due to take effect next April.Even so, McDonald’s plans to soften the impact of its more expensive burgers by cutting the price of a small packet of fries and a box of five chicken McNuggets.
205;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2013-04-03T19:15:20Z;KFC eyes more orders with ‘mobile wallet’;;Kentucky Fried Chicken has become the latest company to allow customers to use a “mobile wallet” to order and pay for food before they arrive at an outlet.The company has joined McDonald’s, Starbucks and other quick service restaurants trying to attract new customers and boost sales through smartphone apps and mobile payment systems.Forest Research estimates that mobile payments are expected to reach $90bn by 2017.“When you have a very comfortable ordering environment, like a smartphone, you just order more,” said Jeremie Leroyer, chief executive of Airtag, which built the app for KFC.He said mobile ordering for fast food restaurants would count for about 5 per cent of transactions in the next year, but expected that to “grow drastically” in the next two to three years.KFC implemented its technology in 10 locations in the UK on Wednesday, with the goal to extend it across the country, then to the US and the rest of the world.The move comes as companies from Google to start-ups race to build the default technology, in what analysts now refer to as the “digital wallet wars”.PayPal, the payment arm of e-commerce company eBay, is developing apps that allow people to order and pay in sit-down restaurants without having to wait for the server to bring the bill. It is also running a test with Jamba Juice that allows people to order and pay for smoothies from their mobile phones, then pick them up in the store, bypassing the line and cash register.When you have a very comfortable ordering environment, like a smartphone, you just order moreLast year Starbucks began replacing the payment systems in its 7,000 US locations with mobile payments technology built by Square, a San Francisco start-up.Carrefour, the second-largest retailer in the world by sales after Walmart, has deployed a version of the technology in its grocery stores in France.It allows people to order and pay for all their groceries from their mobile phone or a computer, then pick them up in the store, where everything is bagged and waiting for them at a set time.The KFC campaign may eventually include posters in underground trains with discount offers embedded in the image, as has already proved successful with Carrefour. Potential customers would be able to photograph a code in the poster to obtain a discount, which would be stored in their phones and applied automatically when they check out at the restaurant.
206;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2013-03-05T15:52:26Z;Margins give the little guys a chance;Profit margins can be higher in many cases for medium-sized enterprises than large ones;"Margins are an issue of profound importance for any business. But how much scientific thinking is there on the subject? Are certain activities naturally high margin and are they always a good thing?High margins mean a company is more likely to be nicely profitable, and deliver a decent return to shareholders. It means a business probably generates cash, which can be used for investment and hopefully create more jobs and pay more tax. All that seems highly desirable, both for owners and society.But high margins also attract competition. Pricing analysis is much more prevalent than in the past and the internet means costs are more transparent than they ever have been. If products can be sold cheaper by someone new, while still showing a profit, then they probably will be. As long as goods are not protected by patent or government mandate, replicas will appear very swiftly, at progressively lower prices. This is capitalism in action: relentless competition to the benefit of the consumer.Moreover, high margins can make industries complacent, bloated and unprepared for leaner times. It corrupts the psychology of management and breeds arrogance. Traditional media players suffered from this disease. Successful broadcasters and publishers enjoyed 20 per cent plus operating margins for decades. Then the internet arrived, and Google and others ate their lunch. Now they face an existential threat; but they did not anticipate or invest during the years of plenty, and are struggling to cope with the more typical margins and returns available in 2013.The pharmaceutical sector is suffering the same nemesis . It waxed fat with blockbuster drugs sold at eye-watering profits, protected by patents. But now pressure on healthcare spending, the rise of generic drugmakers, and the empty pipeline of new medicines mean the days of 30 per cent margins are history.By rights, franchise businesses should be wonderful to own and ought to luxuriate in high margins. The owner simply rents out its brands and format and collects a royalty – with no capital employed. McDonald’s is a successful example of the model. But in my experience a franchiser cannot really control its destiny – franchisees do that. Conflicts frequently erupt – just ask Burger King, which has a history of disputes with its franchisees. And hefty franchise and advertising fees often mean a meagre living for franchisees, which ultimately undermines the business model.Amazon is an extreme example of a business to which the capital markets have provided almost free financing. As a consequence it has been able to operate at very low margins – often 2 per cent or less – and deliver a superb service and cheaper products than the competition. Thus the bookshops and DVD retailers that used to dominate the supply of entertainment items are steadily going broke. And Amazon has an astonishing share of ecommerce in the US: at least a third. Because shareholders have forgone dividends and are not demanding growing earnings per share, Amazon has undercut all-comers and established a dangerously powerful machine. After all, who wants to spend billions to trade at margins of less than 2 per cent?In theory margins across all sectors should revert over time to generate the mean cost of capital. But chronic overcapacity can mean negative returns for long periods. Automotive manufacturers have suffered from value-destroying margins (with a few exceptions such as BMW and VW) for many years. Similarly, airlines are an industry that has been plagued for decades with poor economics and feeble margins.Curiously margins can be higher in many cases for medium-sized enterprises than giant ones. For example, leading food producers must trade with the oligopoly of supermarkets, who consequently dominate their order book – and squeeze their profits. But smaller rivals can happily stick to independent retailers, and so enjoy a fragmented customer base. This allows them to charge reasonable prices.It is surprising how often inverse economies of scale can be applied in business. This should give entrepreneurs hope that they really can compete against monster corporations.lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.ukThe writer runs Risk Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and is chairman of StartUp Britain"
207;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2013-02-19T23:46:10Z;McDonald’s: US minimum wage;A window into fast-food economics;Billions. That is how many burgers McDonald’s has cooked, and how many academic studies have been published on minimum wage hikes. But the connection ends there. In spite of inventing the McJob, the chain’s stock price slipped only a touch after Barack Obama’s proposed increase to $9 an hour. That is because the impact of higher wages on McDonald’s profits appears muted (if the proposal is enacted at all).For a start, only 40 per cent of McDonald’s locations are in the US. Of those, nine out of 10 are run by franchisees who have to bear the burden of store expenses. For example, franchises had to pay when McDonald’s upgraded to premium coffee machines.McDonald’s earns two streams from franchisees – a royalty payment and a rental payment (it typically owns the real estate) – in what amounts to a cost-plus structure. But disclosure on its few non franchised stores offers a window into fast food economics. Employee expenses eat up a quarter of revenues, but paper and food costs are higher, together accounting for a third of the top line. In 2012 McDonald’s hit a few speed bumps with rare misses on sales. And this year could also be tough.But McDonald’s can boast of a decade of 20 per cent annual share price gains, so investors should not be worried about ordering off the dollar menu any time soon. Indeed, profitability across America is high so it is not surprising that the minimum wage debate is raging again.In the second quarter of 2012, total US corporate profits as a proportion of output peaked at nearly 13 per cent, five percentage points higher than the average between 2000 and 2010. Academics are divided on the minimum wage issue. What can be said for sure is that fixes tried to date – wage mandates, tax refunds, training – have yet to improve the lot of workers versus the owners of capital.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
208;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2013-02-18T20:34:00Z;Burger King’s Twitter account hacked;;Burger King’s Twitter account has been suspended after it was hacked on Monday in a sign of the problems companies can run into with social media.The hackers spent the morning tweeting obscenities and drug references and changed the company’s logo to that of McDonald’s, claiming Burger King had been sold to its fast-food rival.The company has gained roughly 30,000 followers since the first tweet this morning.The cyber attack highlights not only the dangers corporations face when using social media to reach out to consumers, but also the vulnerabilities of major sites like Twitter and Facebook.The hack comes two weeks after Twitter warned 250,000 users that their accounts may have been compromised by what it called an “extremely sophisticated” attack. The Burger King incident is not believed to be related to that earlier break-in.Twitter said the company did not comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons.On Friday, Facebook said that it too had been targeted by hackers, showing that social networks and the personal information they contain are becoming a growing target for cyber criminals.A spokesman for Burger King said the company had worked with Twitter to suspend the account and hopes to get it back up as soon as possible. He said the company will post an apology on its Facebook page saying that “this is not consistent with our standards and values”.McDonald’s, for its part, tweeted its condolences: “We empathize with our @BurgerKing counterparts. Rest assured, we had nothing to do with the hacking.”Meanwhile, a social media manager for Wendy’s, Amy Rose Brown, tweeted while the account was still compromised, “My real life nightmare is playing out over on @BurgerKing”.George Kurtz, president of Crowdstrike, a San Francisco-based cyber security firm, said the weak link in such attacks is often a common or shared password.“A social media account for a company where multiple people need access [especially tend to use] shared passwords,” he said.One way companies can avoid Burger King’s situation is to ensure that such passwords are complex and shared with as few people as possible, Mr Kurtz said. Another is to use the two-factor authentication services offered by some sites which only allow access after the password has been entered along with a numerical code sent to the user’s mobile phone.Earlier this month, Twitter posted a job opening whose possible duties included the design of multi-factor authentication, which both Facebook and Google’s Gmail service already offer.The hackers’ references to “OpMadCow” when they had control of Burger King’s Twitter account may be a reference to the European horsemeat scandal, where the fast-food chain is one of many retailers to discover that its suppliers processed contaminated meat.The attack came three days after Burger King Worldwide, based in Miami, reported a near doubling of fourth-quarter earnings.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
210;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s profits edge higher;;McDonald’s is aiming to boost income this year with the help of a new product pipeline and a bigger emphasis on its dollar menu, as it plans to invest about $3.2bn to open as many as 1,600 restaurants and modernise others.The fast food group is confident it can build on slightly better than expected 2012 results by attracting more customers and increasing operating income by 6-7 per cent, Don Thompson, chief executive, said.“We believe we have [a strong, varied pipeline] going into 2013 and feel better about the robustness . . . of that food pipeline,” he told analysts.The company would soon introduce new menu items, including a fish version of the chicken McNugget. Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy said the company’s record as a strong innovator over the past few years “will show through in 2013”.“The company learnt its lessons last year in terms of bringing [a weaker, smaller batch of] new products to the market,” Mr Hottovy said.Globally, McDonald’s reported a 1 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings to $1.4bn, on $6.95bn in revenues up from $6.82bn during the same period last year. The figures were helped by a rise in US sales.Analyst expectations were for earnings of $1.33 per share on sales of just under $6.9bn.Full-year net income fell marginally to $5.46bn on a rise in revenues from $27bn to $27.57bn, while earnings per share rose from $5.27 to $5.36. The company’s operating income rose 1 per cent to $8.6bn during 2012.McDonald’s said it would open 1,500 -1,600 restaurants globally, a noticeable increase, and reinvest in existing locations.Shares closed up 0.57 per cent at $93.48 in New York..

Territory: Australia
Rating: 3/5Australians have a tendency to abbreviate names, places, and pretty much anything else to eliminate the burden of pronouncing additional syllables.Hence the decision by McDonald’s to rebrand 13 of its 750-odd restaurants in Australia as “Macca’s” for a month could prove to be yet another canny way for the fast-food chain to ingratiate itself with Australian consumers.Whereas McDonald’s harbours the nickname “Mickey D’s” in the US, Australians have plumped for “Macca’s” – a term so widespread Down Under that the burger joint is pressing to have it included in the Macquarie dictionary of Australian phrases.McDonald’s move to replace its signage with the “Macca’s” logo is touted as a reflection of the country’s growing appetite for the fast-food brand, and is timed to coincide with Australia’s national day on January 26.The accompanying television ad campaign – virtually incomprehensible to non-Australians – is a litany of excruciating slang diminutives narrated by Ray Meagher, aka Alf Stewart of soap opera Home & Away: chockers with bonzas, coppers, Gazzas, ambos, relos, tinnies, ankle-biters, Paddos and Simmos.Is it a blatant publicity stunt? Fair dinkum. Is it effective? Too right."
212;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s – happy meal;Value options revive sales but tricky choices await for the Golden Arches;It has been a disappointing year for the makers of the Happy Meal. No wonder investors were pleasantly surprised on Monday when McDonald’s reported a 2.4 per cent jump in global same-store sales for November, beating analysts’ expectations. The upbeat month follows two back-to-back quarters of disappointing earnings and, in October, the first decline in monthly comparable-store sales in nine years.Indeed, performance under the Golden Arches has deteriorated this year as the global economy faltered. Most of the burger chain’s revenue comes from outside the US. Meanwhile, competitors such as Burger King, Yum Brands and Wendy’s have shored up their menus, luring customers with new items. McDonald’s shares have lost more than 10 per cent this year, making them among the worst performers in the Dow.An aggressive push on its value options – such as the Dollar Menu – revived sales growth in November as did the improving popularity of the cheddar bacon onion sandwich. December should also get a boost from the reintroduction of the McRib sandwich. The shares gained 1 per cent on Monday, beating the broader market.The turnabout in November is a good sign, but McDonald’s faces challenges into 2013. First, a focus on value options threatens to put pressure on margins. Then there are tough comparisons ahead: same-store sales rose 6.7 per cent in January this year and 7.5 per cent in February. Perhaps most important, though, innovation looks trickier for McDonald’s against its peers. It led the way in expanding the fast-food menu with healthy options and better coffee, but the competition is playing catch-up. At $89, the shares trade at 15 times forward earnings, in line with their historical average, a sign that investors are waiting to see if McDonald’s can keep surprising them.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
213;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;McDonald’s ousts top US executive;;Recent weakness at McDonald’s has led to the ousting of its top US executive, marking an aggressive move by the restaurant chain to revive sales.The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues said on Thursday that Jan Fields, head of the company’s US business, would leave at the end of the month.The 35-year veteran of McDonald’s will be replaced by Jeff Stratton, currently global chief restaurant officer. Mr Stratton oversaw the company’s successful remodelling programme and its push into the coffee business.The reshuffle comes a week after McDonald’s reported its first monthly sales decline in nine years and after two consecutive disappointing quarters.McDonald’s has blamed global economic weakness on its sluggishness, but analysts have questioned how the company managed to perform better during the worst of the recession. McDonald’s is facing tougher competition from Yum Brands – which runs Taco Bell and Pizza Hut among other chains – and its more traditional rivals Burger King and Wendy’s.The disappointing stretch has put pressure on Don Thompson, the company’s recently installed chief executive, to turn things round quickly.“No one factor is at play,” McDonald’s said. “We do not make reactive moves based on short-term occurrences. We plan for the long-term.”Shares of McDonald’s closed down 0.7 per cent in New York at $84.05. The company’s stock price has declined more than 11 per cent in the last year.
214;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-10-21T19:28:40Z;McDonald’s – cause for indigestion;Latest disappointing results could see investors going elsewhere to satisfy their appetite;"Investors aren’t lovin’ it, but they aren’t absolutely hating it either. In the third quarter, McDonald’s served up its second consecutive set of disappointing results and warned of more pressure to come. Net income dropped 3 per cent to $1.5bn from the same period a year ago, while revenues slipped only marginally to $7.15bn. That follows a 4 per cent year-on-year drop in net profit and flat revenues in the second quarter.With more than two-thirds of its revenue coming from outside the US, McDonald’s has been hit by the faltering global economy. Meanwhile, competition is heating up at home as Burger King, Wendy’s and Taco Bell, owned by YUM! Brands, are luring customers by rolling out some of the same strategies that have helped McDonald’s to prosper. Burger King now serves chicken wraps alongside Triple Whoppers, and “premium blend coffee” is poured at some Wendy’s outlets. And the cost of commodities is high.With all of that to swallow, some indigestion from the McStellar stock performance of recent years is no surprise. McDonald’s shares topped $100 in January, more than double their 2008 low. This year’s rumblings have siphoned off 12 per cent, including Friday’s 4 per cent decline. At $89, McDonald’s trades at 17 times this year’s earnings. That is below Starbucks (26 times) and YUM! (21 times), which have higher projected growth rates, but still no value meal.McDonald’s has some leeway, particularly in uncertain times, as it is viewed as big and stable. (Shares in younger and scrappier Chipotle Mexican Grill, for instance, fell 15 per cent on Friday on warnings of slowing traffic; they are down almost 30 per cent in 2012.) The world’s largest restaurant chain also carries a dividend yield of more than 3 per cent. But any more bad news and more McDonald’s investors might just get hungry and start looking elsewhere to satisfy their appetite for stability.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
215;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-10-19T20:10:28Z;McDonald’s grim on global economy;;McDonald’s executives offered a grim assessment of the global economy as persistent consumer weakness ate into third-quarter profits.“When the economic crisis began an 2008, few people thought the environment would still be as uncertain and fragile as it is today,” said Don Thompson, chief executive of McDonald’s, on Friday. “It is clear, however, that this operating environment is the new norm.”The disappointing results mark the second consecutive downbeat quarter for Mr Thompson, who took over last summer with the challenge of extending the company’s run of success.Net income at McDonald’s fell 3 per cent year on year in the quarter to $1.45bn, or $1.43 a share, as revenues fell slightly to $7.1bn. The results trailed projections of Wall Street analysts.McDonald’s has been battling high commodity costs along with tougher competition from the likes of Yum Brands, which has been dominating in China and resurgent in the US. Rivals such as Burger King and Wendy’s have revamped their menus and adopted strategies from the McDonald’s playbook while the spread of “better burger” restaurants has encroached on its hamburger market share.Outside the US, McDonald’s said austerity measures in Europe are weighing on its sales and that the slowdown in China is concentrated in big and medium-sized cities where the company has most of its restaurants.Comparable store sales rose less than 2 per cent in the US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The company said sales are negative so far this month, signalling a slow end to the year.Analysts questioned Mr Thompson as to why the company thrived during the worst of the economic downturn but had suddenly lost its footing.“Global sales were lower than in any quarter even during the peak of the financial crisis at a time when macro indicators like consumer confidence were much worse,” said Michael Kelter, a Goldman Sachs analyst. “Why is McDonald’s not weathering the macro turbulence as well as before?”Mr Thompson pointed to currency volatility and high commodity costs associated with the drought last summer. He promised “tactical shifts”, such as a renewed focus on the company’s “dollar menu” and more interesting menu options next year.Shares of McDonald’s declined 4.5 per cent to $88.72.“We admire McDonald’s global footprint and best-in-class operations, but we also believe that a combination of decelerating comps and continued margin pressure from commodity inflation and other cost inflation will constrain earnings-per-share growth in the future,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research.
216;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;McDonald’s sues over Milan eviction;;After 20 years of serving burgers and chips in Milan’s plush 19th century Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II shopping arcade next to the likes of Louis Vuitton, Prada and Gucci, McDonald’s has been booted out to make way for another Prada store.The restaurant, McDonald’s third-busiest in Italy – after one at the base of Rome’s Spanish Steps and another in Milan’s Piazza Duomo – turned off the hamburger cooker, the chips deep fryer and the soda dispensers for the last time on Tuesday afternoon.Determined not to go quietly, in its last two hours of operations McDonald’s offered everybody free burgers, chips and drinks. Equally determined to call in the lawyers, McDonald’s is suing the city of Milan, which owns the Galleria, for €24m in damages connected to what it has called an unfair public tender for the renting of the space that hosts the restaurant.McDonald’s contends the city ensured the restaurant would have to close by fixing a public tender with various clauses that automatically excluded the restaurant including one calling for a “business showing excellence in innovation, technology and communications”. McDonald’s says it was the only business in the Galleria not to receive a right of first refusal on a new rental contract.The city contests the restaurant chain’s accusations regarding the public tender.“We don't want to fight with the city, but we were kicked out unfairly,” said Roberto Masi, chief executive of McDonald's in Italy, as he watched teenagers queueing from inside the restaurant, through the Galleria and out into the square.Despite its discreet signage, the Galleria McDonald’s has always stood out with Louis Vuitton to its right and Prada in front, both of which this week have purses in their windows for sale at more than €1,000.With the McDonald’s €7.80 McMenu and €6.60 caprese salad no longer an option, the nearest dining alternative will be Savini, a famous Milanese restaurant offering €27 salads and a similarly priced risotto Milanese.The Galleria, which connects the city’s cathedral, or duomo, and central square with the La Scala opera house, has traditionally been home to expensive shops and restaurants and is known as Milan’s drawing room due to its role as the place to see and be seen.The Galleria McDonald’s has secured a spot in the hearts of many Milanese, as evidenced by the more than 1,500 messages left on the Facebook page set up by the company two weeks ago for people to post their memories.Rossana Commissari wrote: “This is the McDonald’s where I ate on the first date with my boyfriend, now my fiancée, and where we eat every time we come to see the duomo. A true pity.”

The country’s trade minister, Ewa Björling, complained: “You can’t remove or airbrush women from reality.”Inter Ikea Systems, which runs the global franchise network of Ikea stores, said that it took “full responsibility for the mistakes made”. It expressed regret and said that it was reviewing its processes, as did Ikea Group, another company in the complicated Ikea structure that produces the catalogues.Ikea is one of many companies to have adapted its marketing to suit local tastes, a step that regional advertising executives say was in some cases probably overzealous.But with no formal government guidelines, international companies rely on local partners to avoid cultural sensitivities that vary dramatically across the Middle East. And given the room for confusion between the most conservative attitudes in Saudi Arabia and the most liberal in Lebanon, companies are unwilling to take risks.The Middle East has seen its fair share of contentious advertising campaigns – although the publicity has not always turned out badly for retailers, writes Camilla Hall in Dubai.● A Coca-Cola advertisement riled the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia in 2002 because of its focus on a young man and woman flirting over a Coke bottle. The same year, Coke released another ad where a young man writes his number in the condensation of the bottle and passes it to the woman. The company has faced such complications in the Middle East due to a decades-long political boycott that is has a dedicated part of its website to tackle Middle East rumours.● In 2006 Wonderbra launched an ad playing on a concept of censorship in the Middle East where a model in her underwear had black marker pen scrawled across her chest. The campaign ruffled feathers in the United Arab Emirates but received wide attention that may have provided a boost for the brand.● Burger King promotional videos were posted online in 2010 playing on stereotypes of two American women and two young Gulf men. “Y’all must be loaded,” one girl says. One of the men replies in broken English: “We have oil wells in our back yard OK and once a week businessmen come to us and we pump the oil by hand.” A prominent Saudi blogger wrote at the time: “Although the commercial is not offending – not to me, anyway – I don’t think Saudis should be thrilled about it. The TV ad simply reinforces some of the most negative stereotypes about us.”● One executive told of a bizarre instance in Saudi Arabia, in which billboards of La Vache qui Rit soft cheese were torn down after people took offence to the cow’s earrings, which were made of the triangular cheese.“When you don’t really understand you can kind of overdo it” in terms of self-censorship, says Dani Richa, chairman and chief executive of advertising company Impact BBDO Group, part of Omnicom, in Dubai. “But if a market is important enough for you to make an investment it’s important enough to do something specific for that market.”Advertising executives in the region identify the obvious cultural minefields as pork, alcohol, tobacco, sex, religion, politics, gambling and poking fun at the local population.Other sensitivities include consuming food or drink with the wrong hand and certain hyperbolic words which, in Arabic, are used only for religious purposes. When it comes to Saudi Arabia, the list is stricter, with women’s faces off limits and the approach to baring skin more delicate, says Tarek Miknas, chief executive of Fortune Promoseven, L’Oréal’s agency in the region.Some of the biggest international brands have chosen to adapt to secure a foothold in Saudi Arabia, where Booz & Co estimates the local retail market at $84.8bn. When Starbucks opened its doors in the kingdom, which practices a conservative form of Sunni Islam, the US coffee chain suffered a backlash for changing its green female mermaid logo to one with a crown in the water.But over time, the company has fully penetrated the market, with stores in Saudi Arabia’s biggest cities as well as in some of Islam’s holiest cities such as Mecca and Medina.While cultural sensitivities prompt companies to take advice across the region, Saudi Arabia is the most problematic.“A lot [of companies] just gave up using pictures of humans, you tend to just get pictures of products with a slushy slogan,” said one Riyadh resident of the billboards across the city. “They pixelate the pictures of humans so you can tell it’s a human being holding a drink but it’s blurred.”Alongside Starbucks, other food and beverage chains such as McDonald's and Burger King have adhered to Saudi Arabia’s strict gender separation rules. Family sections for married couples and women are divided from a section for single men. Religious police, known as the Mutawwa in Arabic or the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, stake out restaurants and malls, approaching anyone they suspect to be breaking the norms on segregation.An advertising agency created an advert in 2009 for Samsung, without its permission, in which Jesus Christ was shown taking photos of a group of nuns. The South Korean company was forced to deny that it commissioned the ad after Christians in Lebanon rallied against the work.But, with the risks associated with getting it wrong well known, most companies are trying to be as careful as possible, says Kamal Dimachkie, executive regional managing director of Leo Burnett, the advertising agency, in Dubai.“Brands are like people, they’re capable of making gaffes,” says Mr Dimachkie. “But they will err on the side of caution rather than take any unwarranted risk with their expression.”Additional reporting by Richard Milne
218;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;McDonald’s to add calorie count to menu;;McDonald’s will begin labelling its menus with calorie information, backing down from its previous opposition to the idea, in an attempt to promote a healthier image.The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues said it would unveil the new menus next week across the US in the hope of helping consumers and employees make “nutrition-minded choices”.“At McDonald’s, we recognise customers want to know more about the nutrition content of the food and beverages they order,” said Jan Fields, president of McDonald’s USA. “As a company that has provided nutrition information for more than 30 years, we are pleased to add to the ways we make nutrition information available to our customers and employees.”McDonald’s is following restaurant chains such as Subway and Panera in making the nutritional information about the food it serves more transparent.The company has already had to change its menu labelling to comply with a law in New York City that requires restaurant chains to show the calorie counts on their products.Obesity is a growing concern in the US and the government, along with states and cities, has been working to impose new regulations on companies to encourage people to consumer fewer calories. On Thursday, New York’s board of health will vote on a proposed ban on “supersized” sugary drinks.As part of the Obama administration’s healthcare law, which was upheld by the US Supreme Court in June, the US Food and Drug Administration is crafting national rules that will require restaurant chains to provide calorie information on their menus.McDonald’s has resisted labelling laws in the past and recent studies of their impact in New York has shown that the additional information has not had an impact on calories purchased by customers.However, McDonald’s has been trying to erase its junk food reputation by offering fruit smoothies, salads and putting apples in its “Happy Meals” for kids.The view of some critics is that the company has not gone far enough as an industry leader and that it continues to market unhealthy products to children.“McDonald’s wants to paint itself as a leader, but in truth, regulations that appear in the Affordable Care Act will soon require McDonald’s to implement these changes,” said Sara Deon of Corporate Accountability International.
219;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-09-04T18:01:28Z;McDonald’s to open first vegetarian outlets;;"Religious pilgrims to two of India’s most sacred spiritual sites will soon find themselves welcomed by a more secular icon: the golden arches of McDonald’s, the US hamburger chain, which is opening its first purely vegetarian restaurants near the shrines.McDonald’s is setting up vegetarian outlets in Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple, the holiest site of India’s minority Sikh faith, and the small town of Katra, the base for Hindus visiting the mountain shrine of Vaishno Devi, the second busiest pilgrimage spot in India.The zone around the Golden Temple and the entire town of Katra are vegetarian, adhering to the traditional Indian belief that eating meat arouses sensual passions inappropriate for spiritual seekers.“A vegetarian store makes absolute sense in the places which are famous as pilgrimage sites,” said Rajesh Kumar Maini, a spokesman for McDonald’s India.Famous globally for its juicy beef hamburgers, McDonald’s, which has a mere 271 stores in India but hopes to double this number in the next three years, has already veered far from its core product in India, where cows are sacred, and beef-eating taboo.Since opening in1996, McDonald’s restaurants in India have never served beef, in deference to local sensibilities, as even non-vegetarians shun the meat. But the chain has struggled to find tasty alternatives. Its lamb burgers were deemed too rubbery, and quickly abandoned. Today, McDonald’s primarily serves chicken burgers.But the chain has also developed a menu of vegetarian meals for the Indian consumer: the McVeggie, a patty of carrots, peas with potato; the McAloo Tikki, a deep fried patty of spicy mashed potatoes; and McSpicy Paneer, a patty of traditional Indian cheese. These items will form the core of the menu of the new outlets at the holy sites.Foreign food chains in India all are making concessions to local tastes to expand in the $12bn fast-food market, which is dominated by local independents. Although organised chain restaurants account for just 5 per cent of India’s total fast-food market, their sales are growing quickly, propelled by young people and cost-conscious families.Euromonitor, the independent research agency, projects the market for chain restaurants will double from around $600m to $1.2bn by 2016.McDonald’s will not be the first foreign food chain to strike meat off the menu in some of its Indian stores. US-based sandwich chain Subway, which has 280 outlets across India, on Tuesday opened its first entirely vegetarian restaurant in the affluent state of Punjab on a private university campus, whose owners are strict vegetarians.Domino’s Pizza also has pure vegetarian outlets in some neighbourhoods of Mumbai and Gujarat, where most residents are strict followers of the vegetarian Jain faith. Domino’s range of spicy pizza’s has helped turn India into the chain’s third biggest overseas market, after the UK and Mexico.Mr Maini said setting up McDonald’s at religious sites was a logical step for the company. Around 8m pilgrims pass through Katra annually, while the Golden Temple draws tens of thousands of visitors a day not just from India, but the Sikh community’s large diaspora.But McDonald’s, which is expected to open its doors just about 200 meters away from the temple, could face stiff competition. The Golden Temple offers vegetarian meals to all visitors as an integral part of its operations."
220;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-07-27T16:36:39Z;Softening demand hits US consumer groups;;US consumer companies are feeling the burden of slowing economic growth, with softening demand cutting into sales at companies such as McDonald’s and Starbucks this week.McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues, reported a rare decline in its quarterly profits and said that after several years of promoting higher-end menu items it would refocus on value. The company warned that the slowdown in the US, combined with austerity measures in Europe and a cooling Chinese economy, were changing dining habits, with more people choosing to eat at home.“It is really starting to constrain consumer behaviour,” said Peter Bensen, chief financial officer of McDonald’s, on Monday. “In several of the markets there [Europe], the eating out market is just simply declining and people are staying at home. And the magnitude of the issues in Europe are having ripple effects around the world.”Starbucks said on Thursday store traffic was down in June and July amid a weakening consumer environment. The company’s share price fell sharply after it lowered its earnings guidance.The disappointing corporate performances come as US consumers are pulling back on spending. On Friday, government figures showed US economic growth slowed to an annualised rate of 1.5 per cent, held back by weak consumption.Executives have begun to accept the protracted economic doldrums. Last week, Muhtar Kent, chief executive of Coca-Cola, said the macroeconomic environment was “increasingly unpredictable” and that companies needed to recognise that the normal ups and downs of the business cycle are a thing of the past.
221;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s – upset stomachs;If the burger chain is suffering, others will be hurting more;"Just because the guy next to you can put away three double quarter-pounders with cheese does not mean everyone can do it. McDonald’s share price returned almost 300 per cent under its previous chief executive, Jim Skinner – who retired in March. That was eight times the S&P 500’s increase over the same period. Four months later, the inevitable hiccups have arrived and they are coming out of the mouth of new chief executive Don Thompson. McDonald’s shares are now down more than 10 per cent this year and, on Monday, second-quarter earnings confirmed recent upset stomachs.The company missed expectations with net income that fell 4.5 per cent to $1.3bn. The top line also disappointed with slowing same-store sales in the US as well as overseas. The restaurant chain looks to be lowering prices to attract customers but that is not enough to counteract a weaker operating environment. For a place known for its Happy Meal, company officials, including Mr Thompson, were pretty downbeat as the burger chain is forced to navigate both a volatile global economy and heightened competition at home and abroad.The company has prospered in recent years in part by diversifying globally. (The US accounted for 32 per cent of total revenues; Europe, 40 per cent; and the Asia, Pacific, Middle East and Africa segments 22 per cent.) But when everything slows at the same time, that strategy no longer works.Currency fluctuations took a bite, subtracting 7 cents before quarterly earnings per share of $1.32, and are forecast to cut full-year results by up to 23 cents. In the current quarter, global comparable sales for July are expected to be positive, but slower than the 3.7 per cent pace achieved in the second quarter.Mr Thompson and investors can be sure of one thing, though. If McDonald’s is suffering, most other industries will be hurting more.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
222;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-07-23T17:17:36Z;Global slowdown eats into Big Mac sales;;McDonald’s blamed a slowing global economy for disappointing quarterly earnings on Monday, warning that declining consumer confidence and rising costs will be a drag on profits this year.The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues reported a rare drop in its quarterly earnings, with sales growth slowing around the world. The results failed to meet expectations from Wall Street analysts and shares of McDonald’s closed down 2.88 per cent to $88.94.The results overshadowed the start of tenure of new chief executive Don Thompson, who has promised anxious investors that the company’s leadership transition will be smooth. Second-quarter net income fell 4 per cent year-on-year to $1.35bn, or $1.32 a share, and revenues were flat at $6.9bn. The consensus earnings-per-share forecast was $1.38.“As you can clearly see, we are operating in a more difficult global environment,” Mr Thompson told analysts.The majority of McDonald’s sales come from overseas, making it more vulnerable to the impact of a stronger dollar. In the US, the company continues to cope with stubbornly high unemployment, along with the prospect of rising beef costs due to the prolonged drought.“Signs of deceleration, notably in the US, have started to materialise,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research.McDonald’s executives pointed to austerity measures in Europe and slowing economic growth in China as points of weakness.“In China, consumers are reacting with greater caution as the economy has slowed,” Mr Thompson said. “We have seen this particularly in our tier-one cities where we are more heavily concentrated.”Peter Bensen, chief financial officer of McDonald’s, said that the protracted nature of the downturn has caused structural shifts in the way people eat.“It is really starting to constrain consumer behaviour,” Mr Bensen said. “In several of the markets there [Europe], the eating out market is just simply declining and people are staying at home. And the magnitude of the issues in Europe are having ripple effects around the world.”Economic headwinds have tended to benefit McDonald’s, as consumers trade down to its relatively affordable fare. However, the company is facing tougher competition in the US from Burger King and Wendy’s and an increasingly strong rival abroad in Yum! Brands, which operates KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.McDonald’s has thrived in recent years by adding higher-end and healthier options to its menu, but Mr Thompson said on Monday that the company would refocus on value to bring in more customers.“We have to crank up our messaging …just a little bit more to appeal to some of these consumers who have less confidence in the overall economy and therefore, reduced their disposable spending,” Mr Thompson said.
223;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-07-08T17:05:14Z;McDonald’s Olympics sponsorship queried;;Top Olympics officials questioned whether it was appropriate to allow fast-food chain McDonald’s to continue sponsoring the games amid mounting concern about the global obesity crisis, the International Olympic Committee president has admitted.Jacques Rogge said in an interview with the Financial Times that the growing financial demands of the Olympics were making it harder for the movement to hold on to its long-cherished values, which include taking care of one’s health. It has faced increasing criticism from health groups for linking the games to high-calorie consumer brands.McDonald’s, whose four restaurants in London’s Olympic Park include its biggest in the world, which can seat 1,500 customers, extended its 36-year backing of the games in January by signing up as sponsor for another eight years.But Mr Rogge said there had been a “question mark” over the sponsorship of the Olympics by McDonald’s and Coca-Cola, a sponsor of the games since 1928 and also signed up until 2020.“For those companies, we’ve said to them: ‘Listen, there is an issue in terms of the growing trend on obesity, what are you going to do about that?’” he said.The IOC derives much of its income from broadcasting rights, receiving $3.9bn in the four years up to and including the London Olympics. But in that period, it has also received $957m from its 11 global sponsors.It gives more than 90 per cent of those revenues to national Olympic committees, international federations and host city organisers.Deciding to renew McDonald’s sponsorship deal “was not an easy decision”, he said. “But then we decided to go and to have the benefit of their support at grassroots levels.”Mr Rogge pointed to the introduction by McDonald’s of healthier menu options and Coca-Cola’s zero-calorie drinks as evidence of the companies’ taking their public health responsibilities seriously.Mr Rogge, who included concerns about obesity in his campaign for re-election as IOC president four years ago, said the financial support of sponsors ensured the survival of Olympic sports and national Olympic teams.“The bottom line is that we have to support and to alleviate the needs of …our national Olympic committees [and] international federations. Most international federations are on a lifeline for the Olympic Games and they need the financial support …Otherwise they would be in trouble.”
224;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-06-13T18:02:01Z;Companies vent anger at Olympic gag;;"Ministers are under growing pressure from companies, frustrated that they are unable to “shout” about their involvement in creating this summer’s Olympics.They want the government to relax strict rules drawn up by the International Olympic Committee to protect the official sponsors.All businesses that won work on the 2012 games had to sign a “no marketing rights protocol”, banning them from issuing press releases, running advertising or any marketing or public relations campaigns publicising their link to the event. It also prevents them from using Olympic logos.Business leaders have called on ministers to override such “over-protective” measures.Arup, a London-based engineering and construction group that designed the Sydney Opera House, has said the protocol puts innovation and growth at risk.Tom Foulkes, the company’s head of marketing, said Arup was unable to talk about the various projects it had built at the Olympic Park because of the protocol. “This is a very strange world given the innovations that have been made and the great work that has been done,” he said. “This protocol puts UK plc at risk.”Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said companies should be able to “shout from the rooftops” about their hand in delivering the games.He said that under the protocol, some restrictions would remain in place even after the games. “This puts a lot of companies in a pretty difficult position,” he said.Suppliers cannot create games-related job titles such as “2012 Unit” or “Olympic Group”. They can mention Olympic bodies only on client lists where at least nine other clients are mentioned.The agreement was drawn up by the IOC to protect companies – including British Airways, Thames Water, McDonald's, Visa and Deloitte – that have paid more than £1bn towards the games.But critics are reminding ministers of David Cameron’s pledge that the Olympics will deliver a “lasting economic legacy that will benefit the whole country”.Pierre Williams, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, castigated Locog (the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games) for a “wasted opportunity”, “petty officiousness” and for having been “absurdly over-protective” of its corporate sponsors.“In its almost paranoid attempts to protect the Olympic brand and its corporate sponsors, it has largely destroyed the goodwill that was there for the taking from businesses supplying the games,” he said.●STL Communications Oxfordshire-based STL Communications has been contracted to supply telephone systems and handsets that will be used to co-ordinate the opening and closing ceremonies

●Arup The UK engineering services group has been involved in several schemes within the Olympic Village. It also designed the “water cube” aquatics centre for the 2008 Beijing Olympics●Make Architects The firm won the tender to design the handball arena in the Olympic Park. After the games, the venue will be converted into a multi-use arenaChuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the Olympics were a “fantastic opportunity” to showcase the best of British business to the world. He called on ministers to explore what could be done “to give due attention” to that companies that had delivered the games.Whitehall officials admitted there had been discussions on how to relax the protocol, but said lawyers had given warning that it would be too difficult. “If we allow companies who have done some work on it to advertise that, it devalues the sponsorship and also the Olympics brand,” said one official.Mark Prisk, the enterprise minister, said that construction groups had “rightly” taken the issue up with the business department. “I think I can understand their frustrations,” he said. “I also understand why Locog has the rules they do.”The culture department said Locog had developed a “detailed protocol” allowing companies to refer to their contracts but only in some limited ways.“Businesses are allowed to talk about the facts; they just can’t proactively market in a way that creates an association with the games, which our sponsors have paid for,” said a Locog spokesperson.Sir John Armitt, the chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority, which was in charge of building the Olympic Park, urged businesses to “use their imagination” to report their involvement in the games.“You don’t develop business by taking adverts. You develop your business by knocking on doors and making presentations and talking to people – they have not been prevented from doing that,” he said.Sir John said most of the restrictions would be lifted after this year, when domestic sponsors’ rights expired."
225;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s suffers weak Asia sales;;McDonald’s sales in Asia fell last month, raising fears of the impact on companies of weakening consumer confidence in China .Sales were weaker than expected in all regions, but analysts were especially surprised by declines in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive, attributed the weak sales to an “increasingly challenging global economic environment” but was optimistic that the world’s largest restaurant chain by sales could still deliver long-term growth.McDonald’s said that global volatility and austerity measures in Europe would “significantly pressure” its second-quarter results and that the impact of currency fluctuations would cut its earnings by up to 9 cents a share.Shares of McDonald’s fell 0.6 per cent to $87.89 in mid-afternoon trading.Global same-store sales at McDonald’s rose 3.3 per cent year-on-year, led by a 4.4 per cent rise in the US and a 2.9 per cent increase in Europe. Sales in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, however, declined by 1.7 per cent in spite of projections of growth.Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research, attributed the weak sales in China to softening consumer confidence, the launch of cheaper “value” meals and tougher competition from Yum Brands. Yum, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut in China, is the leading restaurant chain there and McDonald’s has been battling to gain market share.Signs of an economic slowdown in China have become a growing concern for investors. Those worries have been compounded by rising wages, which have narrowed profit margins for companies looking to build up their presence and hire more workers.On Thursday, China’s central bank cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 in an effort to stimulate growth. China’s economic growth slowed to 8.1 per cent in the first quarter, down from 9.2 per cent in 2011 and 10.4 per cent in 2010.The US has continued to be the most consistent performer for McDonald’s, and innovative breakfast products such as blueberry banana nut oatmeal and drinks such as the Cherry Berry Chiller helped support sales domestically.However, analysts noted that customer numbers had increased at competing fast-food restaurants, which have been borrowing tactics from McDonald’s. Meanwhile, so-called “fast-casual” chains such as Panera and Chipotle have become increasingly aggressive rivals.McDonald’s sales in Europe were led by growing demand in the UK, France and Russia, but weakness in Germany held back sales growth.
226;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;McDonald’s refreshes drinks line;;McDonald’s and Coca-Cola are to launch a fruit soda in an attempt to tap into the appetite for healthier diets.Fruitizz, a blend of grapes, apples and raspberries with fizzy water, will go on sale next week in all 1,200 McDonald’s restaurants in the UK. The drink may be launched in other parts of the US fast-food chain’s global empire.The product will be manufactured by Coca-Cola but, unlike most of its drinks, will not be branded or marketed by the US beverage maker.Coca-Cola said that it frequently manufactures beverage products for food service customers.The move comes as governments across the world are launching campaigns against obesity.Last year, McDonald’s partially replaced fries with apple slices in its US Happy Meals, following calls from the US government and activist groups to sell healthier food to children.It offers fruit options in other markets, including the UK.McDonald’s own research suggests children given the healthier drink – which it says counts towards one of the UK government’s recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a day – will stick with it rather than reverting to colas.A pilot project in restaurants in Wales showed that three-quarters of people who bought Fruitizz would buy it again.In the UK, family business, measured by those ordering a Happy Meal, makes up 30 per cent of sales, while the company says most of the meals sold are accompanied by a drink. McDonald’s serves 2.5m customers a day in the UK.Drinks currently on offer include Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite, all of which are made by Coca-Cola, along with water, PepsiCo’s Tropicana and Fruit Shoots.Fruitizz will be served via the soda fountain, like other fizzy drinks, which the company believes will be an important part of making it “more exciting and desirable”. It will be priced in line with other sodas.The new drink, three years in the making, will be backed with advertising aimed at children as well as their parents.Jill McDonald, chief executive of McDonald’s UK, said: “We tried and tested 80 formulations in order to create the right product that delivers nutritional benefit as well as a new, exciting taste.”Separately yesterday, McDonald’s reported disappointing comparable store sales in April. Same-store sales were up 3.3 per cent around the world, failing to meet the company’s projections and the estimates of Wall Street analysts.McDonald’s shares fell 2.1 per cent to $93.55 by the close.
227;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;New McDonald’s chief eyes menu;;Don Thompson, the incoming chief executive of McDonald’s, has said that when he takes over the top job this summer, he will accelerate the company’s push to bring more nutritional and premium options to the menu as he looks to build on the momentum of Jim Skinner, his predecessor.Mr Thompson’s biggest challenge will be to continue the success that McDonald’s has had in recent years. In his first public comments since being appointed chief executive last month, Mr Thompson said on Friday that he will continue to focus on the operational strength that the company has established while improving its technological prowess.However, Mr Thompson emphasised that McDonald’s will not lose focus on its core offerings and promise to provide value.“We can walk and chew gum at the same time,” Mr Thompson said on a conference call with analysts.The comments came as McDonald’s reported strong first-quarter profits as its modernised stores and growing demand for new menu items such as Chicken McBites helped produce strong sales, in spite of ongoing concerns over the economy.Net income rose 7 per cent from a year ago to $1.26bn, or $1.23 a share, as revenues rose 7 per cent to $6.5bn. The results were in line with expectations of Wall Street analysts and shares of McDonald’s rose 2.2 per cent to $97.43 in midday trading in New York.Comparable store sales were strong around the world, led by a rise of 8.9 per cent in the US. Same store sales in Europe were up 5 per cent, led by the UK and Russia, and sales in Asia, the Middle East and Africa were up 5.5 per cent, led by China.In spite of the strong quarter, McDonald’s executives warned that challenges await later this year, as austerity measures in Europe take their toll on consumer confidence and high beef costs put pressure on profit margins.Mr Thompson said that the economic landscape in Europe is similar to where the US was in 2008 and 2009 and that the company is making a stronger push to market its cheaper “value menu” products.“The company’s trends are likely to soften against increasingly difficult comparisons as the environment remains soft in some of its key developed markets,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research. “While we admire McDonald’s global footprint and best-in-class operations, we believe that a combination of decelerating comps and continued margin pressure from commodity and other cost inflation will constrain earnings-per-share growth this year. “In the US, McDonald’s is facing more aggressive competition from Wendy’s and Burger King, which recently decided to go public again and has said it will look to adopt parts of the McDonald’s playbook.Mr Skinner, outgoing chief executive, said that signs of improving consumer confidence in the US are mostly due to people adapting to the persistent economic weakness and that high unemployment remains a problem..“People are sort of worn out over the overall economic issues and how it’s impacting them personally, so they are just in a place of normalcy now,” Mr Skinner said.
228;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-04-13T22:35:56Z;Companies leave legislative lobby group;;"Some of the biggest US food and beverage companies, including Coca-Cola, Kraft and McDonald's, have withdrawn from the American Legislative Exchange Council in protest over the conservative group's promotion of controversial laws.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also announced that it would stop funding of the group, although it will continue with its current $350,000 grant for an education project. ""We have decided that we will not make another grant to (Alec)"" said Chris Williams of the Gates Foundation in a blog post on the organisation's website.The companies are seeking to protect their reputations after Alec, a group that brings together state legislators and corporate representatives to discuss policy matters and draft model bills, supported polemic legislation such as Florida's ""Stand your ground law"" that allows people who feel threatened to shoot rather than retreat.The law is at the centre of the Trayvon Martin case in which a neighbourhood watch volunteer shot dead an unarmed teenager but was not arrested or charged until after an extended public outcry.Alec has also drafted and introduced other controversial bills such as voter identification requirements and the 2010 law in Arizona that set a crackdown on suspected illegal immigrants.Other companies announcing their withdrawals from Alec this week include Mars, PepsiCo and Wendy’s, along with Intuit, the financial and tax software company, and Arizona Public Service, the state's largest electric utility.Coca-Cola said that its membership in Alec “was focused on efforts to oppose discriminatory food and beverage taxes, not on issues that have no direct bearing on our business”. Other departing members issued similar statements.The shooting incident is causing companies to more closely examine the costs and benefits of their affiliations with organisations that take positions deemed to be controversial by consumer segments.The risk of reputational damage is high for publicly exposed companies in sectors such as fast-food and consumer goods, as these companies can make easy targets for consumer group-driven boycott campaigns via the viral world of social media.“Damage control is much more difficult than it used to be,” said Jerome Williams, an expert on consumer marketing at Rutgers University. “Once something hits social media and the genie is out of the bottle, it takes on a life of its own.”A heightened risk exists for food and beverage companies that have invested heavily in expanding their market share among ethnic minorities.Companies should be very concerned about alienating and causing a backlash among the consumers that they have worked hard to acquire, Mr Williams said.“Companies must realise the fact that identifying with a controversial group such as Alec could jeopardise their footholds with minority communities,” he said. “They must realise that they can be held guilty by association and must be more proactive and discerning about who they affiliate themselves with.”Alec’s mission is to “advance Jeffersonian principles” such as free market policies that promote innovation and job growth, and many of the departing companies originally joined the organisation because of its positions on taxation and economic matters.But divergences have arisen as Alec backed legislation strayed from the economic realm into more controversial social issues, debates that companies typically abstain from publicly.Kaitlyn Buss, an Alec spokeswoman, said that an “army of extreme leftwing special interest activists up in arms” had tried to paint the group as a front group for the conservative Koch brothers. The billionaire industrialists have funded several conservative organisations to advance their ideas, notably Americans for Prosperity, a group behind the conservative Tea Party movement.Alec’s “principles of free-market enterprise and limited government have never been more important than they are today”, Ms Buss said."
229;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-04-10T18:54:06Z;McDonald’s faces scrutiny over Brazil pay;;Brazil’s lower house of Congress is to hold a public hearing over allegations that fast-food chain McDonald’s broke the country’s constitution by paying staff less than the minimum wage.Lawmakers are due on May 10 to discuss claims that McDonald’s reduced workers’ pay outside peak hours, resulting in wages below Brazil’s minimum monthly salary of R$622 ($340), the lower house said on Tuesday.“There have been situations where the worker receives less than the minimum monthly salary, which is in clear violation of the constitution,” said deputy Sabino Castelo Branco from the PTB party, who proposed the hearing after tip-offs of the alleged infringement from a union.Brazil’s unions have earned a reputation for militancy, which, along with the country’s rigid labour laws and high recruitment costs, has proved a challenge for foreign companies trying to break into the country’s fast-growing consumer market.Lawyers said it would be the first time the lower house had called a public hearing to discuss the matter.The company, the world’s largest restaurant group by revenues, vehemently rejected the claims, saying it pays employees for all the hours they work and provides salaries equal to or above the minimum wage.“The company has a commitment to obeying labour laws and follows that which is provided and recognised by the law,” said the Arcos Dorados group, which operates McDonald’s 662 restaurants in Brazil.Despite a large number of independent eateries in Brazil, chain restaurants have shown the fastest growth and are expected to gain market share due to a boom in shopping mall development.According to Euromonitor, the McDonald’s, Habib’s, Bob’s and Giraffa’s brands hold more than 50 per cent of total chain food service sales in Brazil.Fabio Lupatelli, a lawyer in São Paulo specialising in labour legislation, said that if the public hearing next month showed McDonald’s had broken any laws, prosecutors or the unions themselves could file a civil lawsuit against the company.“Our labour legislation is 71 years old and very old-fashioned. It is very protective, protecting employees much more [than employers],” said Mr Lupatelli.Brazil’s labour laws give generous employee benefits while also making it hard for companies to hire and fire. The cost of employing a worker in Brazil is almost double the base salary because of additional mandatory taxes, benefits and contributions.
230;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-04-09T19:43:50Z;A bit of selfishness is all to the social good;Nobody should be surprised – or particularly worried – if alliances are founded on self-interest;The caricature of global capitalism puts sandalled do-gooders and corporate suits at opposite ends of the spectrum. Historically, the corporate social responsibility department was walled off from the boardroom, except when the CSR manager came to ask which cause the chairman deigned to support this year, or the chief executive was coaxed out to a community awards ceremony for some awkward back-slapping with his favourite charity-workers.This is changing, thank goodness, as relationships evolve between companies and enterprises structured along business lines that put social benefit above profit.According to Pamela Hartigan, director of the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, not one corporate representative attended the first Skoll World Forum, nine years ago. At the recent 2012 event, not only were there dozens of companies on the delegate list, many had executives up on the podium, explaining the advantages and challenges of working together with social enterprises.Some mutual suspicion persists. The likes of PepsiCo, Unilever and Novartis were perhaps too polite to voice during the conference any qualms about working closely with not-for-profit organisations. But other delegates had no such compunction about describing the concerns that still run in the other direction. “A lot of what Rio Tinto does to West Australia is criminal,” said lecturer Bronwyn Lewis, who works with the mining company on a child literacy campaign, “but there’s a few people in Rio Tinto who actually make a difference, and some of them are quite high up.”These days many social enterprises are not just supping with the devil, they are shopping for the ingredients and cooking the meal together.I agree with Ms Hartigan that this represents progress. Social entrepreneurs can benefit from alliances with big business – and vice versa. In fact, what I find bracing about ventures between established companies and social enterprises is that their partners are less starry-eyed than the parties to many ill-fated corporate alliances. As I have written before, the success and durability of corporate partnerships often stand in inverse proportion to the rosiness of their initial publicity: see, for example, Suzuki’s unilateral termination of its partnership with Volkswagen, or BP’s unconsummated alliance last year with Rosneft.Behind the aura of social purpose, the word most frequently used by Skoll delegates to describe the nature of their relationship with big corporate partners was “pragmatic”. It starts with the right choice of partner, according to Rupert Howes, chief executive of the Marine Stewardship Council. It has linked with McDonald’s to promote sustainable sourcing of ingredients for the fast food chain’s ubiquitous “Filets-O-Fish”. Social enterprises have got to “cut the herd” of potential corporate allies, he told the forum, “and work with the leaders that will draw the others up”.Gene Falk of mothers2mothers, which has partnered with Hewlett-Packard to digitise and analyse data from its HIV/AIDS education programme in Africa, was blunter still. Not-for-profit organisations have to “think what the corporate partner needs out of this [alliance] and go into it with eyes open”, he said.Nobody should be surprised – or particularly worried – if alliances are founded on self-interest. Keith Kenny of McDonald’s Europe sounded almost sheepish to admit that some of the motives for the company’s MSC partnership were “perhaps a little bit selfish”. By ensuring sustainability of sourcing from its fisheries, McDonald’s also ensures the stability and longevity of the suppliers themselves. Well, good for them – and good for the MSC.Frankly, if more companies acknowledged the selfish reasons for getting together with business partners, their alliances would probably last longer. Likewise, the virtues of a good social partnership – transparency, communication, trust, patience – are precisely the qualities any joint venture should have, whether its objective is drilling in the Arctic or mentoring HIV-positive mothers in Africa.There is a need to educate more companies about how to work in a self-reinforcing partnership with social enterprises. But the lessons big businesses can learn about how to run their hard-nosed profit-making alliances with other corporate partners are just as valuable.andrew.hill@ft.comAndrew Hill blogs at www.ft.com/businessblog
231;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-04-06T19:35:12Z;Listing plans intensify US burger wars;;The US burger wars are heating up, with Burger King declaring this week that it will go public once again and setting its sights on McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues.Burger King surprised analysts and investors on Tuesday when it announced that less than two years after it was taken private by 3G Capital it will sell a 29 per cent stake to a group led by Bill Ackman, the activist investor who runs the Pershing Square hedge fund.Mr Ackman’s UK-based investment vehicle Justice Holdings paid $1.4bn in cash for the minority stake in Burger King. The company, which he said has suffered from poor management and a narrow focus on young men, will list on the New York Stock Exchange within three months.A former McDonald’s investor, Mr Ackman said that Burger King would take pages from the McDonald’s playbook but move more quickly and aggressively than its bigger rival, which he called “enormously bloated”. Burger King has already started rolling out new menu offerings with salads, chicken, smoothies and ice cream.Analysts questioned the timing of the move and expressed scepticism that Burger King could successfully encroach on McDonald’s when so many other rivals have tried and failed. McDonald’s accounts for about 50 per cent of US fast-food restaurant sales, while Burger King accounts for about 13 per cent, according to Janney Capital Markets.Steven West, restaurant analyst at ITG Investment Research, warned that Burger King will probably need to take on more debt to help its franchises remodel their restaurants and that the size of the McDonald’s advertising budget will be unmatchable.
232;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Burger King: fries with that, gentlemen?;The natural question now is whether Justice Holdings has overpaid;They paid too much. That was the consensus when 3G Capital took Burger King private in 2010 for a total enterprise value of $4bn, or nine times trailing earning before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. How did things go? Well, Justice Holdings has just paid $1.4bn and will get 26 per cent of Burger King’s common shares in return. This now puts the enterprise value of Burger King at $8bn – an ev/ebitda multiple of 16 times (14 times if you follow Burger King’s practice of excluding restructuring and other costs). By comparison, the multiples for global powerhouses McDonald’s and Yum Brands are 11 and 14 times. Arcos Dorados, the largest Latin American McDonald’s franchisee, trades at 12 times.3G’s partners put $1.2bn of cash into the original deal and borrowed the remainder of the price. They also paid themselves a near $400m dividend last year, thank you very much. If they had sold the whole company at the price Justice has paid, 3G would have more than doubled its money in a year and a half. Over the same period, McDonald’s and Yum shares have returned 38 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively. Consensus now: would you like fries with that, gentlemen?The natural question now is whether Justice has overpaid. Same store sales fell last year and Burger King is losing share in the US. But Ebitda last year was a third higher than the period just before the buyout, due mainly to cost control. The proportion of restaurants that are franchised has risen slightly, which should stabilise financial results, and the geographic mix has shifted away from North America and towards high-growth Latin America. Both shifts are set to continue. But the current valuation implies that Burger King will execute its restructuring strategy perfectly. Heavy is the head that wears a crown.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
233;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-04-04T17:56:40Z;Wall Street falls as QE hopes fade;;JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley led financial stocks lower as the two banks dealt with allegations of impropriety levied by regulators while Wall Street had its second-worst day of the year after hopes for another round of quantitative easing faded.The S&P 500 financials index lost more than 1.6 per cent on Wednesday as investors interpreted the chances of a third round of quantitative easing as being increasingly unlikely after the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s latest meeting were released on Tuesday.JPMorgan fell 2.2 per cent to $44.41 as the bank agreed to pay a $20m fine to settle regulatory allegations levied by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that it mishandled Lehman Brothers’ client funds during the period up until the broker filed for bankruptcy protection.Morgan Stanley declined 3.5 per cent to $18.69 after it came under fire from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday for an alleged “pattern of misconduct and negligence” in its treatment of distressed borrowers through a since-sold mortgage subsidiary, Saxon Mortgage Services.The Fed is planning to fine Morgan Stanley and also require the bank to review tens of thousands of loan files to see if borrowers had their homes wrongfully seized or were improperly denied loan restructurings.Citigroup fared worst among the major banks, falling 3.7 per cent to $35.44. Bank of America declined 3 per cent to $9.20 and has retreated by almost 7 per cent since breaking through the $10 mark last week.The US private sector beat consensus forecasts and added 209,000 new jobs in March, according to data reported by ADP, the payroll processor. February's reading was adjusted up to 230,000 from 216,000 but the news was unable to lift markets.Overall, the S&P 500 lost 1 per cent to fall below the 1,400 mark and finished at 1,398.96. The benchmark US index has fallen from its cyclical high of above 1,420 crossed in intraday trading on Monday and has spent the last two trading sessions in negative territory.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9 per cent to 13,074.83.General Electric, the industrial and financial conglomerate, lost 1.1 per cent to $19.74 after Moody’s downgraded its senior unsecured debt by two notches to A1 and warned that GE’s financial unit was too reliant on short-term funding.The Nasdaq Composite Index performed worst among the three major indices and declined 1.5 per cent to 3,068.09.Yahoo!, the digital media company and search provider, rose 0.6 per cent to $15.27 as it announced 2,000 jobs would be cut, or about one-seventh of its workforce. The company said the expected savings from the cuts would be about $375m annually before tax considerations.“Our goal is to get back to our core purpose – putting our users and advertisers first – and we are moving aggressively to achieve that goal,” said Scott Thompson, chief executive. “Unfortunately, reaching that goal requires the tough decision to eliminate positions. We deeply value our people and all they’ve contributed to Yahoo!.”SanDisk, the flash-memory card maker, was the day’s biggest faller, dropping more than 11 per cent to $44.51 as the company cut its first-quarter sales and profits forecasts.Elsewhere, fast-food franchises and US airlines were among the most talked about equities on Wednesday.McDonald's, the world’s largest restaurant chain, dropped 1.9 per cent to $97.48 as it was removed from Goldman Sachs conviction buy list saying that it was unlikely for shares to rise in the near-term.“We do, however, maintain our ‘buy’ rating on the shares as McDonald's is executing extremely well and we expect ongoing share gains to continue,” said retail analysts at Goldman Sachs, placing a 12-month price target of $110 for the company’s shares.Shares in the fast food group have fallen 3 per cent in the year to date after rising some 30 per cent in 2011.Also on Wednesday, rival fast-food chain Burger King, which recently refreshed its menu offerings with a selection of healthier products, said it would sell a 29 per cent stake to Justice Holdings, a UK investment vehicle, which plans to take the company public again.US Airways gained more than 1.5 per cent to $7.86 as it said March traffic increased by 4.5 per cent and on a report that claimed the company was speaking to creditors of American Airlines about the potential sales gains and cost savings of a merger between the two US carriers.Another passenger air carrier Southwest Airlines gained 2.2 per cent to $8.38 as it was upgraded to “hold” from “buy” by analysts at Barclays.“For the first time in many years, we see reason for optimism on Southwest’s shares. While not a panacea for all that ails Southwest, we believe the market underestimates efforts to reallocate flying that begins in earnest this summer,” said David Fintzen at Barclays.
234;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-04-04T16:41:05Z;Ackman ready to take on McDonald’s;;Bill Ackman, the activist investor, had not eaten at Burger King for several years but he was hungry for a big name brand punching below its weight.“This is one of the great businesses in the world, that was mismanaged for a long time,” Mr Ackman said on Wednesday.Late Tuesday night, Burger King, the US restaurant chain, said it would sell a 29 per cent stake to Justice Holdings, a UK investment vehicle founded by Mr Ackman, which will take the company public. The group, which also includes Martin Franklin, chairman of consumer products group Jarden, and Nicolas Berggruen, a French billionaire who has worked with Mr Franklin on other acquisition vehicles, paid $1.4bn in cash to 3G Capital for the minority stake.The deal marks a quick turnround for 3G Capital, which took Burger King private in 2010 in a $4bn buyout.Burger King has struggled in recent years against a behemoth of a rival in McDonald’s, the fast-food leader, and a resurgent Wendy’s, which recently overtook it for second place in the “burger wars” for US market share. Burger King accounted for 20 per cent of the market in 1998 and fell close to 10 per cent last year, according to Janney Capital Markets.Mr Ackman, who runs the hedge fund Pershing Square and has been a personal investor in Burger King, said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday he was ready to take on McDonald’s.“Burger King has become a fast-moving, aggressive competitor,” he said. “We’re going to do the same things McDonald’s has done, but more quickly.”Mr Ackman praised the success that McDonald’s but said its business model was “enormously bloated” and Burger King would be operated as a nimble start-up.Earlier this week the company launched a new menu with salads, smoothies and ice cream. The company recently banished its “King” mascot, broadened its marketing strategy and is remodelling its stores.Mr Ackman has experience with McDonald’s. In 2005, Pershing Square took a 4.9 per cent stake in the group and urged its management to spin off its company-operated restaurants and keep the franchise business.Justice approached 3G Capital about a month ago to propose the deal, Mr Ackman said. The group was not intending to sell and had plans for an IPO in early 2013, but Mr Ackman convinced them that going public through Justice would be faster, easier and allow Burger King to move ahead with its international expansion plans more quickly.When the deal closes within three months, Justice will stop trading on the London Stock Exchange and Burger King will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Mr Ackman joined forces with Mr Franklin and Mr Berggruen last year. Justice was the first acquisition vehicle to take advantage of relaxed listing rules, which no longer required such cash shells to win a shareholder vote on their eventual investment – a feature that had mired previous vehicles in rounds of back-and-forth negotiation with investors.In effectively merging with Justice, Burger King can start trading in the New York market very quickly, within about 60 to 90 days. The company has been filing quarterly and annual reports with the SEC, despite its private ownership, which also helps accelerate the process.Mr Ackman, who this week praised the operating nous of the 3G team, has also invested with the fund personally. But, known for his sensitivity to even perceived conflicts of interest, he will take stock rather than cash from the deal with Justice, increasing his personal holding in Burger King. He also pledged to hold on to that stake as long as Pershing is also a shareholder.Analysts questioned the timing of the deal and the wisdom of challenging McDonald’s at one of the strongest moments in the company’s history.Mr Ackman noted that Burger King, which was founded in 1954 and has about 12,000 restaurants in 81 countries, is one of the most recognised brands in the world and that the company has suffered from a change in chief executives nearly every two years.“If you gave someone $25bn to replicate the market position of the company, you could not,” Mr Ackman said. “The sheer cost of creating that awareness overwhelms what we are paying.”
235;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
236;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Burger King sells $1.4bn stake to Ackman;;Burger King, the US restaurant chain, will sell a 29 per cent stake to Justice Holdings, a UK investment vehicle, which plans to take the company public again.Justice, which was founded by the activist investor Bill Ackman, will pay $1.4bn in cash to 3G Capital, which took Burger King private in 2010 and will remain the majority shareholder. After the deal closes, Burger King will return to the New York Stock Exchange.Daniel Schwartz, chief financial officer of Burger King, said that being publicly traded in the US would help the company forge ahead with its international expansion plans and regain its footing domestically.Burger King recently lost its status as second-place behind McDonald's in the hamburger chain wars, falling behind Wendy’s to become third largest hamburger chain by market share. The company has changed its advertising strategy and this week unveiled an array of new menu items that emulated offerings such as salads, coffees and smoothies that have been successful for McDonald’s.The deal is expected to close within three months and Justice will then stop trading on the London Stock Exchange.Mr Ackman, who runs the hedge fund Pershing Square, formed Justice last year with Martin Franklin, chairman of consumer products group Jarden, and Nicolas Berggruen, a French billionaire who has worked with Mr Franklin on other acquisition vehicles.The group said at the time that it would look for a minority stake in a well-established target, most likely in the developed world.3G Capital acquired Burger King in 2010 in a $4bn deal and assumed $750m in debt.Backed by the Brazilian billionaires Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Carlos Sicupira, the group has looked to grow Burger King in Latin America and Brazil. Last year 3G Capital announced plans to open 900 restaurants in Brazil by 2016.“When I learnt that Burger King was interested in a possible transaction with Justice, I brought the opportunity to my Justice founding partners to consider,” Mr Ackman said. “They liked what I saw, a 58-year-old global brand, and a simple, predictable, free cash flow growth franchise in the process of transformation into a pure brand royalty business.”Last year Burger King’s net income was $29.4m and its revenues fell 3.8 per cent to $580.6m from 2010.
237;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-04-01T17:54:43Z;Brazil-US relations near turning point;;The case of cachaça, the stiff sugar cane spirit used in Brazil’s national cocktail, the caipirinha, is probably not the first thing on the mind of US President Barack Obama as he prepares for a visit from his Brazilian counterpart, Dilma Rousseff, next week.But reversing a longstanding US refusal to recognise the Brazilian drink as distinctive from Caribbean rum – thereby subjecting it to adverse tax treatment on rum imports designed to protect producers in the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico – is one of several relatively easy “deliverables” that Mr Obama could offer Ms Rousseff when she arrives on April 9.Stubborn trade disputes and differences in approach to geopolitics have traditionally clouded what is otherwise a mature if somewhat standoffish friendship between the dominant powers of the Americas. Brazil wants recognition from the US for its growing geopolitical clout, most importantly its bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, but without sacrificing its neutrality in the process. Washington, meanwhile, wants a better idea of what Brazil, known for its pragmatism on foreign relations, actually stands for.“Relations between Brazil and the US have historically been very broad but also relatively shallow,” said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington.Once tempted to treat Brazil as just another, if slightly more important, Latin American country, the US is increasingly being challenged to acknowledge its growing role as an international player on the back of its fast economic growth.A surging middle class in Brazil has created new markets for US multinationals, ranging from McDonald’s and Pepsi to General Motors. But even as the total volume of trade has grown, the relative importance of the US to Brazil’s economy has declined. China has overtaken the US as Brazil’s biggest trading partner and new investor.At the same time, Brazil has become increasingly concerned about what it sees as “unbalanced” trade with China, which imports Brazilian commodities but few of its manufactured goods. The US by contrast is one of the biggest markets for Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer, one of Latin America’s flagship industrial companies.Relations between leaders of the US and Brazil have traditionally been warm – Mr Obama once called former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva “the man”. But in practice, Brazil’s independent stance on foreign affairs – it regularly abstains in votes on sanctions against oppressive regimes in the Middle East and on other issues – has grated with the US. In particular, Mr Lula da Silva upset Washington when he led an attempt to forge an independent civilian nuclear deal with US arch-enemy Iran in 2010.Yet while Mr Lula da Silva’s Iran adventure was politically costly in terms of relations with Washington, it was a sign of Brazil’s diplomatic coming of age, the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank said in a report last year. “Brazil’s participation alerted the major powers to its presence on global security issues and served notice that Brazil would remain a significant international actor,” the report, Global Brazil and US-Brazil Relations, said.With the election of Ms Rousseff in late 2010, Mr Obama set out to repair the relationship. He visited Brasília three months after she took office, describing Brazil as an “equal” partner and acknowledging though not openly supporting Brazil’s aspiration for a permanent seat on the Security Council.The challenge for both sides is where to take the relationship now. The US has already lifted a tariff on Brazilian ethanol imports – an important breakthrough. It could restart a US Air Force contract for 20 Embraer attack aircraft that it abruptly cancelled earlier this year. It is also making it easier for Brazilians to get visas. And it could also, of course, recognise cachaça as something distinctly Brazilian, rather than lumping it in with other Latin American rum.Most significant, however, would be for the US to offer formal support for Brazil’s aspirations to join the Security Council. Proponents argue this would put the ball in Brazil’s court, forcing it to become a more responsible contributor to the world order. Indeed, some argue that this sort of acknowledgment as an equal partner is all that Brazil has ever really wanted from Washington.“Brazil doesn’t want a trade deal from the US, it doesn’t want military co-operation,” says João Augusto de Castro Neves, political analyst at Eurasia Group. “It just wants recognition and that only costs a few words.”

A warmer winter also meant natural gas inventories rose above their five-year average.Consol Energy, which produced 62.6m tons of coal from 12 sites in the US last year, was the worst performing stock on the main market, down 4.5 per cent to $32.94. Alpha Natural Resources, another coalminer, fell 4 per cent to $16.03.A speech by US President Barack Obama in which he said the government would expedite construction on the Keystone XL pipeline did little to inspire confidence in the sector.Cabot Oil & Gas was the second worst performing stock on the main market, down 6.1 per cent to $31.52Overall, the benchmark US index sank 0.7 per cent to 1,392.78, its lowest point in more than a week.The S&P 500 materials sector had its worst day in more than two weeks, falling 1.6 per cent as commodity prices slid on concerns over global growth.US Steel, the integrated steel producer, was the worst performer among materials, falling 5.8 per cent to $29.47.Copper and gold miner Freeport-McMoRan was the next worst, shedding 3.7 per cent to $38.33. Allegheny Technologies, the speciality metals producer, fell 2.7 per cent to $41.58.“What you had was continued speculation on the depths of the Chinese slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the Chinese data,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Both those factors immediately hit materials.”Creeping fears of a slowdown in the world’s second- largest economy also sent Wall Street’s “fear gauge” up to its highest point since March 9.Volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, rose by as much as 9.6 per ent before finishing the day up 2.9 per cent to 15.27.Insurance companies and regional banks were the worst performing equities among the S&P 500 financials index, which fell 1.4 per cent, relinquishing its position as the top performing sector for the year so far to information technology.The financials index is now up more than 19.9 per cent since the start of the year while the tech index is slightly ahead, having gained 20 per cent.Hartford Financial Services after pressure from John Paulson, the billionaire investor, caused the insurance company to consider the sale of its life assurance business.Shares in the company, which rose on Wednesday after it revised its forecast earnings above analysts’ expectations, were down 3.3 per cent to $21.30.Overall macro growth fears also caused investors to ignore the latest US economic data that showed the number of first-time unemployment claims falling to its lowest level in four years.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6 per cent to 13,046.14.Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, was the third biggest loser on the blue chip-heavy index, falling 2.4 per cent to $106.44.

239;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s: supersize me;International expansion is one way to maintain its stellar performance;Incoming McDonald’s chief executive Don Thompson has a supersized problem: the burger chain has few obvious problems. As he takes over from Jim Skinner, who announced his retirement on Wednesday, he knows the shoes will be tough to fill. Since Mr Skinner became the boss in 2004, McDonald’s has returned almost 300 per cent, eight times the return of the S&P 500. Taking the helm after losing two CEOs in seven months, Mr Skinner inherited a company recovering from falling earnings early last decade.So with no crises or significant operational problems to fix, Mr Thompson, a 22-year veteran of the company, has to find a creative way to maintain McDonald’s stellar performance. One way is further international expansion. Despite owning one of world’s most recognised and powerful brands, McDonald’s still generates more than one-third of its revenues, and almost half its profits, from America. Mr Skinner was reserved about diversification. In the five years before he took over, the company’s overseas assets grew at a compound annual rate of almost 7 per cent. During his tenure, this rate almost halved. Accordingly, the CAGR of international revenues, which was previously about 8 per cent, dropped by about one-fifth. At home, however, growth in assets and revenues remained constant.McDonald’s has already said that it is in expansion mode. This year it plans to spend $2.9bn and open 1,300 new stores. By comparison, it has added only about 3,000 net new sites in the past decade.Inheriting a well-run and successful company can be as much a curse as it is a blessing. Mr Thompson is fortunate that there is a clear way for him to expand further. And as McDonald’s last year turned 130 per cent of its net profit into operating cash flow, he is lucky that he can afford to do so.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
240;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;New McDonald’s chief left with tricky task;;"When Jim Skinner took over as chief executive of McDonald’s almost eight yeas ago, the hamburger chain was in its darkest moment.The company’s chief executive, Jim Cantalupo, died of a heart attack after just 16 months in the job in April 2004. Seven months later his successor, Charlie Bell, resigned after being diagnosed with cancer, leaving the post to Mr Skinner, who was billed the “accidental CEO”.McDonald’s was also hit by negative publicity. The documentary Super Size Me was playing in cinemas, showing the world through film-maker Morgan Spurlock’s diet the dire effects of subsisting on McDonald’s.“Everything was going wrong for McDonald’s,” says Steve West, analyst at ITG Investment Research. “The restaurants were disgusting and the food was horrible. The best thing that happened to McDonald’s was Super Size Me.”McDonald’s announced on Wednesday that Mr Skinner would retire this summer, ending a 41-year career that he began as a trainee restaurant manager in Carpentersville, Illinois. The 67-year-old will be replaced by Don Thompson, who has been chief operating officer since 2010.Mr Skinner, an architect of the company’s “plan to win” strategy that has become a playbook for the fast-food industry, leaves with the reputation as a turnround artist and leaves his successor with the challenging task of maintaining the company’s momentum.Last year, McDonald’s recorded its strongest comparable store sales in the US since 2006 and plans to invest $2.9bn this year to open another 1,300 outlets, including nearly 175 in the US, 250 across Europe and 250 in China.In February, it had its 106th consecutive month of positive same-store sales growth in the US. Its stock price has soared more than 200 per cent since Mr Skinner took the top job, eclipsing $100 a share this year.“It’s been one successful product after the next,” says Peter Saleh, restaurant analyst at Telsey Advisory Group. “They changed their methodology to find out what consumers were interested in before coming to market with new products.”McDonald’s has thrived in recent years by focusing on the breakfast trade and expanding its beverages, while continuing to cater to recession-weary diners with its dollar menu. It has put pressure on rivals such as Yum! Brands, Burger King and Wendy’s, while displacing Starbucks, Smoothie King and even cereal makers in serving the breakfast market. “They’ve revolutionised the entire industry,” Mr West says.In spite of those successes, Mr Skinner’s tenure was marred by many of the controversies that have plagued McDonald’s for years and that Mr Thompson will face when he takes over. The company continues to be targeted by public health and animal rights groups for its contribution to the growing obesity epidemic and the treatment of the animals it consumes.“[Mr] Skinner’s pride was a ‘plan to win’ that largely made children’s health the loser,” says Sara Deon of Corporate Accountability International. She notes that obesity rates among children and Hispanics, on whom McDonald’s focuses much of its marketing, have risen disproportionately during Mr Skinner’s time as chief executive.“Parents and health professionals would like to see CEO Skinner take Ronald McDonald and the suite of McDonald’s predatory marketing practices into retirement with him,” she adds.Although a lot of attention has been focused on McDonald’s efforts to sell premium hamburgers and high-end coffee, Mr Skinner has worked to change its public image by replacing its playgrounds with flatscreen televisions and wireless internet, lowering the profile of Ronald McDonald, its mascot, and selling more apples and fewer French fries to children.“They’ve changed the perception of food quality, what a McDonald’s restaurant should look like and what it means to work there,” says Sara Senatore, Bernstein Research analyst, noting that the biggest changes have been in Europe. “The French used to call it ‘mal boeuf’ and people would joke about having McJobs.”Analysts say Mr Thompson’s challenge will be matching his predecessor’s success and fending off rivals that seek to replicate McDonald’s strategy.Yum! Brands, the operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, remains dominant in China and Asia; Wendy’s and Burger King have been improving ingredients and upmarket “better burger” chains are evolving from fad to trend status in the US, eating into McDonald’s core business.“When your stores are generating that much money, the question is how do you keep growing?” said Darren Tristano, executive vice-president of restaurant consultants Technomic.……………………………………………………………..Engineer set to take the helmIf McDonald’s is sometimes compared to a well-oiled juggernaut, it is only fitting that its next chief executive, Don Thompson, is a trained engineer, writes Alan Rappeport.The Chicago native and 22-year McDonald’s veteran began his career as an electrical engineer at Northrop Corporation, the defence contractor, and after joining the restaurant chain in 1990 worked his way up the operations side of the business.Mr Thompson has flipped burgers, turned round the troubled San Diego market, been in charge of the Midwest division and was president of McDonald’s USA.Analysts expect the transition to be relatively smooth, especially compared with the turmoil that surrounded Jim Skinner’s ascension to chief executive when tragedies struck his two predecessors.However, Mr Skinner’s retirement has come sooner than some analysts predicted and the company will now have to find a new chief operating officer to fill Mr Thompson’s role.In a 2007 interview with the Financial Times, Mr Skinner contemplated his retirement and joked that his successor would have big shoes to fill.“We have learnt through our own distress regarding potential leaders at McDonald’s [that] it’s important to have people available to do the job,” he said. “We have a lot of people who could do this job. Probably none as well as me.”Mr Thompson’s rise is a testament to his patience. Other top executives, including the company’s previous chief operating officer, decided to leave McDonald’s after losing hope that they would replace Mr Skinner.According to a report in Crains Chicago Business last year, Mr Thompson considered leaving the company early in his career, but stayed on at the advice of McDonald’s diversity chief, who urged him to switch from developing robotics and electronics to operations.When he takes over the chief executive post from Mr Skinner in June, Mr Thompson will be one of the most high profile African-American chief executives in the US.“I’m humbled to take the baton as chief executive of McDonald’s,” Mr Thompson said, adding that he would continue to modernise the company’s 33,000 restaurants and expand the menu beyond its traditional hamburgers and fries."
241;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Skinner stepping down as McDonald’s chief;Don Thompson to take helm of fast-food chain;McDonald’s said on Wednesday evening that Jim Skinner, its chief executive, will retire at the end of June and will be replaced by Don Thompson, the company’s chief operating officer and president.Mr Skinner, 67, has worked for McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, for 41 years and has been chief executive since 2004. During that time, he has helped the company expand internationally, broadened the menu to include more breakfast and beverage options and modernised the restaurants.McDonald’s last year recorded its strongest comparable store sales in the US since 2006, and is planning to invest $2.9bn this year to open another 1,300 outlets including nearly 175 in the US, 250 across Europe and 250 in China.“Doing what’s right for our customers and our business has driven my passion as CEO of McDonald’s,” Mr Skinner said in a statement.McDonald’s has continued to face criticism from health and animal rights groups, but in recent years Mr Skinner has helped soften the company’s image by working to improve its food sourcing and quality.Mr Thompson, 48, is a 22-year McDonald’s veteran and most recently has been in charge of global strategy and operations. Previously he spent four years as head of the company’s US division.Shares of McDonald’s fell 0.1 per cent to $96.60 in after-hours trading. The company’s stock price has climbed more than 200 per cent since Mr Skinner took the top job in 2004. McDonald’s said Mr Skinner would also leave its board of directors.
242;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Starbucks: slow-brewed;Chain coffee shops may not travel as well as burger joints;It should be the smell of hamburgers, not coffee, motivating Howard Shultz and his team at Starbucks. Because McDonald’s has done exactly what Starbucks needs to do: take a powerful American brand and make it work on globally. So far, Starbucks has not quite proved itself up to the task.International sales contribute just over a fifth of Starbucks revenues and profits. Store count and revenue in Europe since 2009 have risen 10 per cent and 31 per cent respectively. The corresponding figures for Asia are 20 per cent and 64 per cent. Impressive numbers, but because margins are very low in Europe, and Asia is still tiny relative to the overall company, the overseas business remains stunted.At McDonald’s, margins are almost as high in Europe as in the US, and stores outside the US and Europe contribute a fifth of sales. More than half of all profits are international. Bulls will see Starbucks’ domestic bias as an opportunity for growth. But the record to date suggests that chain coffee shops may not travel as well as burger joints.There are other parts to Starbucks’ growth story. It is aggressively pushing sales of drinks served (and most often sold) outside its restaurants – including packets of instant coffee and pods for single-serving machines. The company’s goal is for these to represent half of operating profits within a decade, up from an eighth now – an ambitious target that has captured the imagination of Wall Street analysts.But where Starbucks has succeeded so well up to now is in its shops. Competing outside of them takes it on to fundamentally new, and therefore risky, terrain. Those buying Starbucks’ premium-priced shares must be sure the core business has growth ahead, and should watch Asian growth and European margins before all else.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
243;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-03-16T16:56:40Z;McDonald’s and Carrefour in China apology;;McDonald’s and Carrefour, popular among Chinese consumers because their food is perceived as safe, have apologised to mainland consumers after state television accused them of selling time-expired chicken products.Both the French retailer and the US fast-food chain were quick to respond to the complaints, which were aired on a primetime national television programme to mark World Consumer Rights Day on Wednesday. They risk reputational damage in a country obsessed with food safety, following a string of food-quality scandals, said retail analysts.Both companies issued public apologies and said they were investigating the report by China Central Television, the state broadcaster, which alleged that one McDonald’s outlet in Beijing sold chicken wings 90 minutes after preparation, past the 30-minute limit set by the company.A Carrefour store in central China changed expiration dates on some chicken parts, the report alleged, and sold regular chickens as more expensive free-range birds.Food safety is one of the most sensitive issues in China, after the tainted milk scandal that led to hundreds of thousands of infants being admitted to hospital in 2008. Recent scandals have involved “gutter” or recycled cooking oil, fake eggs and meat laced with chemicals.Last year Walmart, the US retailer, was ordered to close several stores in southwest China after police detained store managers in a scandal involving the mislabelling of ordinary pork as organic produce.As China gets richer, consumers are willing to pay a premium for safe food, and they often go to foreign restaurants or supermarket chains to do so. But they can turn against these chains if they are shown to have violated consumer trust, said analysts.“The main reason why Chinese consumers like McDonald’s is because of their safe, hygienic standards. If their employees are not adhering to those high standards, their revenue could be slammed,” said Shaun Rein, of China Market Research in Shanghai.He pointed out that Ajisen Ramen, the Japanese noodle chain, had seen a hit to its sales after it apologised for using liquid concentrates to make soup rather than cooking the base fresh as the group had claimed in its marketing.“McDonald’s China attaches great importance to this. We will immediately investigate this isolated incident, resolutely deal with it earnestly and take concrete actions to apologise to consumers,’’ said a statement on the McDonald’s website. Carrefour issued an apology to consumers via Sina Weibo, a microblogging service, and said it would investigate the complaint.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen in Shanghai

Markets will watch Friday’s release of non-farm payroll figures closely.“It's a bullish sign that the S&P 500 has rebounded immediately off the lows this week and volatility [as measured by the CBOE’s Vix index] barely moved above 20,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. “It suggests the market could test post-crisis highs again.”Cyclical material stocks led the S&P 500 as all main sectors climbed on the day.

245;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;McDonald’s sales bit by eurozone woes;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues, reported sales growth that fell short of analysts’ forecasts in February, as troubles in Europe countered the resurgent US market.The company said on Thursday that austerity measures in Europe, “persistent economic uncertainty” and rising labour and commodity costs in the US could hit its first-quarter operating income growth.Shares of McDonald’s closed down 3.21 per cent at $96.96 in New York.Global comparable store sales rose 7.1 per cent year-on-year, against a consensus forecast of 8.2 per cent. The US outstripped forecasts of 8.6 per cent growth, expanding 11.1 per cent.But sales growth in Europe of 4 per cent fell short of the consensus forecast of 6.6 per cent. Sales in Asia, Africa and the Middle East rose 2.4 per cent.US sales were driven by consumer demand for Filet-O-Fish, Chicken McBites, beverages and breakfast. McDonald’s said that the UK and Russia were its strongest markets in Europe, which was hit by severe winter weather and austerity measures related to the sovereign debt crisis.Signs of weakness have been rare for McDonald’s recently and the company’s stock price is up nearly 30 per cent in the last year. McDonald’s has been successful luring consumers with modernised restaurants, healthier offerings and an expanded morning menu.“McDonald’s has started to see signs of consumer pullback in France,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research. “While it is still early to tell the extent of impact from austerity measures in Europe, McDonald’s is closely watching consumer responses there.”
246;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-03-07T14:51:16Z;Dollar bond rush sets record pace for deals;;It is being dubbed the great dollar bond rush. Companies are falling over themselves to sell bonds as borrowing costs tumble to record lows.Some $20bn of issuance in this week alone has taken the total volume of US investment grade and high yield debt sold so far this year to a staggering $274bn – a record pace for such deals – according to Dealogic.The reason for the buying frenzy is simple. Bond funds are drawing heavy inflows from investors unconvinced by the prospects for equities, despite the recent bull run in stocks, and hungry for a yield that outstrips the meagre returns from holding cash and Treasury paper.Moreover, investors are favouring US bond funds and multi-national companies with strong balance sheets over eurozone government debt markets, still considered vulnerable despite progress in resolving Europe’s debt crisis and falling sovereign borrowing costs there.US corporate bond funds have attracted $786m of inflows this year, up from $428m in the same period of 2011, according to TrimTabs.This wall of money is in turn being tapped by an array of companies worldwide aiming to lock in dollar borrowing costs at record lows. How long this “sweet spot” for companies and investors will last is likely to be one of the big investment themes in 2012.“There’s been a real boom in corporate bond issuance,” says Kathy Jones, fixed income strategist at CharlesSchwab. Demand from investors is primarily for investment grade and high yield, rather than US Treasury bonds and commercial paper, she says. “For the issuer, the bond market right now makes more sense: if you can lock low rates for a longer period of time, why not?”Investors wrestling with a low yield environment are opting for the safety of owning company debt backed by solid balance sheets. That explains why companies such as McDonalds, IBM, Walt Disney and Procter & Gamble have sold paper at record low yields this year. “We are getting inflows from European investors who formerly held sovereign bonds,” says Mark Kiesel, managing director at Pimco.The fall in borrowing costs also makes selling debt to buy back equity an attractive option for companies. “We will see a lot more issuance from companies looking to fund equity buybacks via low borrowing costs,” says Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management.“What we have here is, on one side, the corporate treasurers rushing to issue because they believe these are the lowest rates they can get, while investors, on the other side, believe there’s more room for these bonds to rally,” says Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research.Usually, big bursts of corporate debt sales have heralded negative turns in market sentiment. The worry is that the combination of record issuance, record low yields and big inflows into bond funds may not last.Since January risk premiums, or spreads, on investment grade corporate bonds have narrowed to about 180 basis points over US Treasuries from about 230 bps according to Barclays Capital. The average yield for investment grade bonds touched a record low of 3.27 per cent this month, according to BarCap.While low, these corporate yields look reasonable when viewed against the backdrop of the Federal Reserve’s intention to keep official rates low until the end of 2014. Indeed, the Fed’s purchases of US Treasuries under “Operation Twist” are designed in part to push investors into riskier areas of the debt market. So, stronger appetite for corporate debt suggests that part of its strategy is working.However, now that some US junk bonds and lower quality-rated investment grade paper are approaching yields in the region of 5 per cent, a historically low level for this type of debt, many investors worry that the bull run could start to run out of steam.“We could see a buyers’ strike at some point, junk bonds at 5 per cent are very tight and I think we definitely get some pushback on the investor side,” says Mr Kiesel. “The problem is that, with all this central bank liquidity that has major 10-year government bond yields at less than 2 per cent, where does an investor put their money.”The low yields on US corporate debt also reflect big market shifts in the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis. As other sources of funding such as securitisation and bank lending have yet to recover, companies have few alternatives other than to issue bonds.“The ‘risk’ in all this is that the corporate bond market, particularly high-yield, is prone to big bursts of euphoria and then big bursts of depression,” says Mr Bianco. “If that’s the case, we may see a bust, and it would be better then to have markets operating in a more normal, stable manner.”Ms Jones says some investors may be worried about buying bonds at current very low yields but adds: “There’s no indication rates will start going up anytime soon.” Unless and until the Fed brings to an end its ultra-loose monetary policy, the boom in issuance is likely to last.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock
247;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-03-07T02:02:20Z;Cautionary tales: What to do when good salesmanship goes bad;David Gelles finds reasons to be careful when companies take advertising online;When McDonald’s bought advertising on Twitter this year, it was hoping to drum up some goodwill for its burgers and fries. By promoting the “#McDStories” hashtag, it expected to users to share favourite memories from the world’s largest restaurant chain.Instead, critics of the fast-food chain hijacked the hashtag and used it to pillory McDonald’s, accusing it of peddling unhealthy, unappetising food.The incident was the latest example of how well-intentioned social media marketing can backfire, putting a company on the defensive. While sites such as Facebook and Twitter provide unparalleled access to customers, allowing companies to interact with fans, they also provide a forum for dissenters.McDonald’s was monitoring the conversation on Twitter, and quickly took down its promoted tweets. “With all social media campaigns, we include contingency plans, should the conversation not go as planned,” Rick Wion, social media director for McDonald’s USA, told the FT. “The ability to change midstream helped this small blip from becoming something larger.”Yet the damage was already done, and the episode became a cautionary tale for companies.McDonald’s scored points for being quick to respond. “You need to be on it 24/7,” says Ann Lewnes, chief marketing officer at Adobe, the software company. “That’s one of the biggest changes to marketing today. You don’t just put a campaign out there. At any given moment, someone is saying something about your company and product, and you have to be listening.”Because McDonald’s was listening, it says the damage was limited, with the #McDStories parodies accounting for only 2 per cent of conversation about the brand that day. “The response to any type of complaint has to be almost immediate,” says Ms Lewnes, adding that Adobe also strives to remain vigilant. “We have a policy that within minutes we have to respond in a meaningful manner.”Other brands can simply be tone-deaf in their promotions, drawing the wrath of online critics quick to pounce on the slightest whiff of inappropriateness from a big brand. When Casey Anthony, the mother suspected of murdering her daughter, was acquitted last year, the “#notguilty” hashtag began trending on Twitter.That prompted Entenmann’s, the snack maker, to tweet: “Who’s #notguilty about eating all the tasty treats they want?!” Customers called Entenmann’s out, and the social media agency representing the company apologised in a blog post.“The mis-steps happen when marketing departments aren’t aligned with the brand’s values,” says Nick Law, chief creative officer in North America for R/GA, a digital agency. “There are all these steps in the process where marketers take shortcuts to get some news out in the marketplace.”Social media gaffes are not limited to Twitter, however. Last year Olla, the condom maker, devised a campaign to attract customers. It created a programme that sent men a friend request from their supposedly unborn babies. So a Facebook user named Daniel Ogawa got a friend request from “Daniel Ogawa Jr”, with a picture of a baby and a message that said “Avoid surprises like this one. Use Olla Condoms.”Another ill-fated tactic involves trying to engage with the social media community on false pretences.Last year, ConAgra, a maker of packaged foods, invited bloggers to a four-course meal at an exclusive restaurant in New York. Instead of haute cuisine, the bloggers were served frozen lasagne.The reactions on the blogosphere were swift and fierce. “Our entire meal was a SHAM!” wrote one participant. “We were unwilling participants in a bait-and-switch.” The story went viral, and ConAgra was soon on the defensive.“Social media brings both opportunity and threat. Entering the market with a siloed mindset can be extremely dangerous,” says Laurence Buchanan, Digital Transformation Lead at Cap­gemini Consulting.“Having a mechanism in place to filter through the vast amount of noise generated on social media sites is a pre-requisite,” he says. “But this is a complete waste of investment without the ability to act fast on opportunities and threats as they come up.”
248;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-03-06T00:33:48Z;Scramble to sell US debt as yields hit record lows;;Companies lined up to sell dollar-denominated debt in what was the busiest day for issuance so far this year after yields in the corporate bond market fell to record lows.Corporate bonds have rallied in recent months as investors search for investments that offer a higher yield than US Treasuries. That demand, along with low benchmark rates on Treasuries, has driven yields on investment-grade bonds to consecutively new lows this year.Average yields on junk bonds have also fallen sharply this year to about 7 per cent but these remain slightly above all-time lows.Companies sold $19.8bn in investment grade and junk bonds by late Monday, the biggest daily issuance tally since November 7 when companies priced $20.7bn of bonds, according to Dealogic, the data tracker. But some deals were still awaited.Issuers ranging from Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Wynn Las Vegas and Newmont Mining priced bonds. DirecTV, the satellite television provider, sold $4bn.Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management, said that the strong start for debt issuance this month would continue as companies looked to take advantage of low yields.“This is just the start and we expect an onslaught of issuance as spring unfolds. Rates are low and corporate treasurers are making sure they get in before rates rise,” he said.On Friday, average yields on investment-grade bonds fell to a new record of 3.27 per cent, according to an index from Barclays Capital that dates back to 1973. US blue-chip companies, including Walt Disney, IBM, Procter & Gamble and McDonald’s, have already been able to sell bonds this year at record low costs.The US Federal Reserve began 2012 by pledging to keep interest rates near zero through to the end of 2014. It is also capping long-term yields via the purchase of bonds under Operation Twist.Since last November the yield on the benchmark US 10-year note, which serves as a key reference for corporate bonds, has been anchored at about 2 per cent.“Global central banks are keeping rates at extraordinarily low levels and investors are trying to find ways to get returns on their capital,” said Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. “Any time rates are low and investors are excited to buy, issuers will find reasons to sell bonds.”Also increasing debt sales is the fact that record low borrowing costs for companies raises the appeal of selling debt and using the proceeds to buy back stock.For February, US equity buybacks ran at their highest in five months, topping $42.2bn, according to TrimTabs.Average yields on junk bonds have plunged from more than 8 per cent at the start of 2012 to about 7 per cent now. The all-time low yield for junk bonds was 6.61 per cent last spring, the Barclays index shows.Mary Austin, portfolio manager for Pax World’s High Yield Bond Fund, questioned whether the deals were attractive for investors at their present low yields.“It’s been hard to be very excited for some of the names that are coming in because yields are very tight, at 5.5 per cent. It’s good for the companies – they manage to increase their cash flow at very low rates. But again, I don’t think I would purchase [high-yield debt] at 5 or 5.5 per cent levels,” she said.Pax was looking at only one of Monday’s deals, the $400m of 10.5-year notes seen being sold around a yield of 7 per cent by Bill Barrett.Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie
249;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-02-20T19:39:26Z;Price offers at McDonald’s;;The story. By 1997 about 85 per cent of McDonald’s 12,500 US restaurants were owned by franchises, while the rest were directly owned by the company.In the US, McDonald’s sales comprised about 25 per cent of all fast-food sales. The nearest competitor, Burger King, had 11 per cent of fast-food sales. McDonald’s was taking 40 per cent of the money spent on hamburgers in the US.The challenge. McDonald’s faced slowing sales growth and stiff competition in the US and abroad.After a string of new product successes in the 1980s, such as Chicken McNuggets and a successful breakfast food launch with offerings such as the Egg McMuffin, McDonald’s experienced a series of failed products, including the Arch Deluxe, the McLean Deluxe, the McPizza and McPasta.The outlook for McDonald’s franchises in the US was changing too, because rapid expansion in the number of stores led to cannibalisation of existing stores’ profits. Profit per location had dropped to $95,000 in 1996 from $120,000 in the early 1990s.McDonald’s needed to figure out a way to drive traffic into the stores.The strategy. McDonald’s devised a year-long price promotion, “Campaign 55”, that would feature a different hamburger sandwich each month at the bargain price of just 55 cents, in honour of the 1955 founding of McDonald’s. The promotion began with the company’s flagship product, the Big Mac, then usually priced at $1.99.What happened. The outcome was not what McDonald’s had planned. In February 1997 details of the Campaign 55 promotion were leaked to the press and franchisee reaction was immediately negative. They predicted – correctly – that such a bold price reduction would confuse consumers who had come to understand and expect that they already had the best deals McDonald’s could offer.Value pricing had become an important part of the fast-food market, where consumers were encouraged to purchase “meal deals” in which products were bundled together – typically, a hamburger, fries and a soda. Such value pricing offered a discount against the price of the items when purchased individually.Further consumer confusion – and ultimately, revolt – ensued when they turned up at McDonald’s restaurants to purchase Big Macs for 55 cents and found the small print: the special promotion was available only if the customer also bought an order of fries and a drink – the same bundle of items as the McDonald’s “Extra Value Meal” deal.In reality, the Campaign 55 pricing represented a 13 per cent discount from the existing Extra Value Meal bundle, and a substantial discount if the three items were purchased separately.But consumers were unable to make the price comparison with the ordinary Extra Value Meal and see that the 55 cent promotion was a better deal ($3.03 for the promotional bundle vs $3.49 for the Extra Value Meal, and $4.47 for the items brought separately). As a result they widely perceived the tactic as a “bait and switch”, a way to get them to buy the more expensive option.After a few months, amid consumer and franchisee dissatisfaction, McDonald’s pulled the promotion.The lessons. In a mature industry, sales promotions renew excitement and generate new sales. However, McDonald’s had a series of missteps with Campaign 55.First, the company learnt that it would have to consider the consumer more fully when it came up with such a complicated deal.Second, the company would need in future to consider the franchisees properly. They saw the 55-cent price attached to Big Macs as eroding the perceived value of their signature sandwich when they were already feeling financial pressure due to rapid store expansion.Lastly, such an extreme price cut was likely to attract people who look out for deals anywhere, but have no brand loyalty.This case is adapted from a Berkeley-Haas case study, “McDonald’s 55 Cent Promotion”.For more information, go to:http://cmr.berkeley.edu/berkeley_haas_cases.htmlThe writer is a senior lecturer in marketing at the University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business
250;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-02-15T20:31:44Z;US corporate bond yields hit record low;Low yields are a boon for companies;Yields on investment-grade US corporate bonds have hit a record low as investors buy into high-quality companies that offer higher rates than those offered by US Treasuries.High-grade US debt has benefited from US Treasury yields hovering near historic lows following Federal Reserve purchases of long-dated government bonds and a pledge to keep US interest rates near zero until the end of 2014. But risk premiums, or spreads, on corporate debt have also narrowed this year as investors play down lingering risks from the eurozone debt crisis and focus on data showing improvements in the US economy.According to a Barclays index that dates back to 1973, the average yield on US investment grade corporate debt fell to a record low of just 3.34 per cent on Tuesday, the most recent data available. The yield on an index of bonds issued only by industrial companies fell to a new low at 3.04 per cent. Spreads have also narrowed, but are not at historically tight levels, the index showed.New issuance of investment-grade corporate debt has been lower at the start of this year versus last while the volume of securitised debt remains low.“There is a lack of high-quality product,” said Michael Hyman, a portfolio manager at ING Investment Management.These low yields are a boon for companies. As yields have fallen in recent weeks, blue-chips and household names such as IBM, Procter & Gamble, Walt Disney and McDonald’s have been able to borrow billions of dollars at record low cost. On February 9, Disney sold five-year bonds paying interest at 1.125 per cent, the lowest coupon rate for five-year US unsecured corporate debt, according to Dealogic, which has been tracking this data since 1995.Since the financial crisis, US investment grade companies have consistently set lows for yields as benchmark rates plunged and investors favoured fixed-income assets to equities, which suffered sharp losses in 2008.Investors have maintained their confidence in highly-rated corporate bonds because these issuers have improved their balance sheets and stockpiled cash since the crisis.“Investors continue searching for incremental yield,” said Jim Glascott, head of global debt capital markets at Barclays Capital. “Companies are in great shape.”However, the low yields highlight the difficulty investors face in trying to generate positive returns in the current environment. With annual US inflation at close to 3 per cent, high-quality corporate bonds were not offering investors much return in absolute terms, said Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.“There is a clear case to be made that the [Fed] is engineering Treasury rates lower and that this is pushing investors into riskier assets,” Mr Brady said. “Yield is your cushion against loss. If there is not a lot of yield, that cushion is low.”Average yields on financial company debt are not at record lows but have fallen from 4.56 per cent at the end of 2011 to 3.79 per cent as concerns about contagion from problems in the eurozone have eased following the extension of European Central Bank loans to the region’s banks.Lingering uncertainty means that investors are still demanding significantly more yield on the bonds of financial versus industrial companies.
251;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-02-13T23:24:27Z;McDonald’s bows to pressure on pig crates;;Bowing to pressure from animal rights activists, McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues, said that it will require its pork suppliers to stop using gestation crates, which have been criticised for inhumanely immobilising pigs.The company said on Monday that it plans to contact its suppliers to develop plans for alternative methods of handling pigs. McDonald’s expects to announce a timetable and details of the plans in May.“McDonald’s wants to see the end of sow confinement in gestation stalls in our supply chain, said Dan Gorsky, senior vice-president of McDonald’s North America supply chain management.Mr Gorsky said that the gestation stalls are not a “sustainable production system”.The Humane Society of the United States praised the decision, calling it “important and promising”.Lindsay Rajt, spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or Peta, said she was encouraged that McDonald’s was moving away from the “iron maiden” cages, but argued that McDonald’s still needs to improve its treatment of chickens in the US.McDonald’s is one of the world’s biggest purchasers of pork, which it uses to make bacon, sausages and McRib sandwiches.The move comes as other companies, including Cargill, Smithfield Foods, Burger King and Hormel, have recently said they will purchase pork from farmers that use larger cages or pens.In spite of the criticism over the gestation cages, the National Pork Board defended the practice on Monday.“There are numerous ways, including sow gestation stalls, to provide proper care for sows,” the group said in a statement. “Each housing system, including gestation stalls, open pens, free-access stalls and pastures, has welfare advantages and disadvantages that must be considered by an individual farmer.”
252;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-02-12T16:52:34Z;Doubts over PepsiCo’s strategic shake-up;;For Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, satisfying Wall Street’s appetite for quick profits while attempting to feed the world healthier food has been a difficult balance.Last week, the US food and drinks group said that it would shed 8,700 jobs worldwide as it revealed a strategic “reset” that will see it invest more than half a billion dollars in marketing its core products – soft drinks and salty snacks – this year.The plan to go back to basics and refocus on the products that have been PepsiCo’s growth engine was widely anticipated, but it left some analysts wondering whether Ms Nooyi had gone far enough to revive the company’s fortunes.Investors initially expressed disappointment that the cost of the move and job cuts would mean slimmer profits this year. A weaker earnings outlook sliced nearly 4 per cent off the company’s share price on Thursday.PepsiCo executives acknowledged some stumbles, but point to new infrastructure in emerging markets, the rehabilitation of the Gatorade brand and expected breakthroughs on sweeteners as reasons to be optimistic. But shareholders, frustrated by a loss of market share to Coca-Cola in North America and a flat stock price relative to its biggest beverage rival, have been calling on PepsiCo to make changes.Wall Street analysts welcomed the decision to spend $500m-$600m on 12 “megabrands” with a focus on North American beverages. However, after a series of setbacks during the past few years, some doubted the company’s ability to execute its strategy.According to analysts at Bernstein Research, PepsiCo’s goal of raising advertising spending to 6 per cent of its sales by 2015 is a smaller portion of sales than the company spent a decade ago. Although Bernstein advocates additional investment, they warn that PepsiCo will be spending much more just to match its historical growth rates.PepsiCo’s move came as rival Coca-Cola announced its own cost-cutting and advertising initiative last week.“The application of time and money is not in a vacuum, particularly considering Coke’s business momentum and just announced productivity plan,” says Michael Branca, analyst at Barclays Capital.Junk food is still selling, so the company has to go in this regrettable directionOthers point out that PepsiCo’s renewed focus on products that are linked to obesity and diabetes risks undoing some of the goodwill gained over the past few years when the company promised to make health and wellness a priority. Health advocates bemoan the new strategy, calling it a retreat from Ms Nooyi’s vision of promoting more nourishing food.“The quarterly pressure of profits makes companies have to respond to short-term gain,” says Kelly Brownell, director of Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity. “Junk food is still selling, so the company has to go in this regrettable direction.”Marion Nestlé, a professor of nutrition and public health at New York University, calls PepsiCo’s move to reinvest in its core brands a “crass commercial decision” and says that greater emphasis on less healthy foods would hurt the company in the long run. “They have to grow, and that forces them to reassess any social values they may have,” Ms Nestlé says.But Ms Nooyi insists that she is not giving up on nutrition, emphasising that the company cares both about food that is fun and good for customers. “This is an ‘and’ game, not an ‘or’ game,” she says.PepsiCo is not alone in grappling with growing demand for food that not only tastes good but is healthy. Groups such as Danone, McDonald’s and Walmart have moved to provide healthier offerings, while some of their rivals have chosen to focus narrowly on the products that made them popular, regardless of nutrition.A report funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation last year suggested that PepsiCo might have had the right idea all along, finding that products with fewer calories, dairy and whole grains were driving sales at food companies. The study found that such products accounted for 70 per cent of sales growth at the top 15 food and drinks groups between 2007 and 2011.As PepsiCo forges ahead, some investors remain bullish. Don Yacktman, president of Yacktman Asset Management and a PepsiCo shareholder, says that the company remains a good investment in the long term, although its share price could still suffer as it battles commodity costs and an onslaught from Coke.“On a 10-year horizon it’s still a great business,” Mr Yacktman says, adding that PepsiCo is more diversified than Coke and has more room to grow internationally. “We’ll see how the execution goes, but the basic thing is still there.”
253;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-02-07T19:47:48Z;Coca-Cola: it’s the real thing;Its shares will not make you rich but they are unlikely to make anyone poor;People are willing to pay more for Coca-Cola – the drink and the stock. It is pointless to argue that it makes no sense to pay up for brand-name soda. People do, and that’s what matters. But share prices are something else. Coke shares trade at 17 times forward earnings, a hefty premium to the market. The demanding valuation may be why shares only ticked 1 per cent or so higher when Coke reported solid fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday.Coke’s valuation cannot be justified by looking at its growth profile in isolation. It targets a low to mid single-digit expansion. But the company has characteristics that make the share price look reasonable. While growth is not rapid, it is impressively consistent and the company’s profits are spread evenly around the world. In 2011, Europe, Latin America and North America each contributed about a quarter of profits, with developing markets in Asia and Africa making up the rest. Volumes and profits grew in every region – even Europe – and the company raised prices in most regions. Combine this with a universal brand and you have a company that looks more enduring than most nations.Is there another consumer staples company with a comparable profile? PepsiCo’s profits are much more concentrated in the Americas. The biggest of the global beer companies, AB InBev and SABMiller, do a bit better at emulating Coke’s global reach but they lack single global brands and their European and North American operations are struggling mightily to grow. The closest comparison is probably McDonald’s, but even that company has more of its profits concentrated in Europe and North America than Coke does.Coke shares may be unlikely to make anyone rich from here but they are even more unlikely to make anyone poor.

254;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Treasury beset by exodus of top staff;;George Osborne’s Treasury is grappling with an exodus of personnel as officials fume at low pay levels and high staff turnover, creating real operational difficulties with the Budget just seven weeks away.Just before Christmas, Treasury staff received e-mails asking whether they had any friends interested in applying for the ranks of unfilled jobs. Two officials have told the FT that the Treasury’s turnover rate is now “higher than McDonalds’”.Annual Treasury staff turnover was 28 per cent in 2011, up from 22 per cent a year earlier and far higher than Britain's median labour turnover rate of 12.5 per cent. McDonalds declined to disclose its staff turnover rate.Mr Osborne has lost six of his director and director-general level officials in recent months including Andrew Hudson, the director general of public services, Mark Bowman, head of Budget planning, and Nick Joicey, director of international finance.The Treasury said it has traditionally had high staff turnover rates because it often takes staff on temporary secondments, but accepted that the current situation may be worse than usual. A department spokesman attributed the rise in staff turnover in part to the Treasury’s declining headcount: “Overall turnover rates inevitably increase when headcount is falling.”According to the Treasury’s annual staff survey, published quietly on its website last week as officials fretted about large executive bonuses at state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland, only about 12 per cent of department employees thought their pay was “reasonable”. That compares with a 24 per cent satisfaction rate at the Treasury in 2009, and 35 per cent at other top government departments. The survey also found that one in ten officials wanted “to leave HM Treasury as soon as possible”.Senior Treasury officials have to leave the department to get a pay rise. Michael Ellam, who is in charge of dealing with the eurozone and the Group of 20, is paid £101,500. Jonathan Taylor, the head of financial services who had taken time out from a Treasury career to work for a few years at UBS, is paid £162,500.
255;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Wendy’s eyes new front in burger wars;;Wendy’s, the US fast-food restaurant chain, says it will challenge McDonald’s on late-night dining, breakfast and coffee as it looks to expand the hamburger wars to new fronts.The company said its “Hot ‘N Juicy” line of premium cheeseburgers helped Wendy’s generate its strongest quarterly same-store sales since 2004 during the final three months of last year.Following the McDonald’s formula, Wendy’s is also remodelling its restaurants with modern designs and flatscreen televisions and is rolling out a breakfast menu and a new coffee blend, called Redhead Roasters.“We are making progress on re-establishing Wendy’s as the quality leader and innovator,” said Emil Brolick, chief executive.Wendy’s has been rejuvenated recently as consumers have been drawn to “better burgers”, which are custom made and contain more high quality beef. The company is also trying to balance its “barbell strategy” by catering to high-end customers with its Black Label burgers, covered with bacon and aged pepper jack cheese.In spite of increasing consumer health consciousness, Wendy’s has been promoting buttered buns and has not shied away from high calorie counts.The strategy appears to be working. Last month analysts at Janney Capital Markets projected that Wendy’s will overtake Burger King for second place in market share behind McDonald’s later this year. McDonald’s has thrived on coffee and breakfast sales and Wendy’s is attempting to replicate that recipe.Speaking on Monday at the Wendy’s investor day, executives said they were “readying for expansion” by testing a breakfast menu in certain markets, selling items such as panini sandwiches, baked goods and premium coffee, while looking to accommodate late-night diners with expanded hours.According to a recent analysis by Bernstein Research, breakfast is the fastest-growing meal offering for fast-food chains and Wendy’s has the most room to grow.In 2010, breakfast accounted for a quarter of McDonald’s sales, while it represented just 2.2 per cent of sales at Wendy’s.“Wendy’s turnround hinges on success in the competitive breakfast day-part, along with continued menu innovation,” said Sara Senatore, analyst at Bernstein Research.During the fourth quarter, Wendy’s comparable store sales rose by 4.4 per cent year-on-year, with revenues up 5.6 per cent to $615m. Special charges related to the sale last summer of Arby’s were a drag on the company’s operating income, which fell by 30 per cent to $4.3m, or 1 cent per share. Shares in Wendy’s were down 2.9 per cent to $5.06 in afternoon trading.
256;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-01-25T15:00:59Z;Globalisation: one size does not fit all;Far from turning employees into clones, successful modern multinationals encourage individuality and value local knowledge;"You might want your Big Mac to taste the same wherever in the world you sink your teeth into it. But do you think the person behind the counter should be the same, whether you are in London, Lima or Little Rock? Globalisation, we should know by now, is not quite the simple process some gurus led us to believe it would be. National differences and identities have not been eliminated; not all employees are the same.David Fairhurst, chief people officer for McDonald’s Europe, has been fighting a brave campaign for several years to re-educate superior folk who might regard his colleagues as identical and more or less personality free. Five years ago he wrote to the Oxford English Dictionary, suggesting that its definition of the word “McJob” should be changed. It was demeaning, he argued, and it implied that a job at the fast-food business was a meaningless thing that required no character or individuality.The strong improvement in the perception of the company, in the UK and France at least, has been down in no small part to the efforts McDonald’s has made to hire good people and offer them both training and a career path. Individuality has been a big part of that recruitment process. “Hire the smile”, is Mr Fairhurst’s watchword, but he also advises that there should be a good mix of people in the team. After researching the matter, McDonald’s found that its UK outlets with a blend of older and younger workers produced better results.The Swedish furniture giant Ikea is another global business that seems, from the outside, to impose a one-size-fits-all approach on its staff (and customers). But as its former chief executive, Anders Dahlvig, reveals in a recent book, The Ikea Edge, the company’s thinking is rather more nuanced and sophisticated.“As we grew in Europe we found that the differences between countries were not too great, and that our values were easily adopted by our people,” he told me. “But in China you are in very different territory, and it is easy for companies coming in to underestimate this.”As Mr Dahlvig explains, Ikea’s values – centred on informality, delegating responsibility and encouraging teamwork, but also independence in the job – can be recognised as being pretty universal. But a Chinese workforce brought up to accept the authority of the boss and to fall into line, might struggle to adapt to the more free and easy way of the new employer. As an added factor, strict parental control in the land of the one-child policy was bound to create a more regimented and less spontaneous pool of labour. Adjustments had to be made. It has, however, apparently been successful: this week the company announced it will triple its expansion rate in China to three store openings a year. This is in contrast to its plans for India, which have been put on hold owing to concerns over the Indian government’s requirements on sourcing from local producers.So when people say that Ikea is “so Swedish” and that staff are obliged to fit into a Swedish mould, they are in danger of missing the point. As Mr Dahlvig writes: “Is Ikea really a Swedish company with a local touch? Or is it a big anonymous global retailer? The founder lives in Switzerland. The head office is in the Netherlands. The owner is a Dutch foundation. Less than 10 per cent of the employees work in Sweden. Sweden contributes only seven per cent of total sales and 5 per cent of buying, and this will decrease even more in the future.”What does make Ikea Swedish are the heritage, the values, the management style and the product range, Mr Dahlvig says. (The herrings and meatballs add something too.) But in the 10 years he was at the helm – between 1999 and 2009 – he helped Ikea master that elusive trick of being global and local at the same time. And an important part of that achievement involved getting employees to do the job right on the ground.Globalisation was originally oversold, not least in the suggestion that similar management approaches could be deployed anywhere in the world because big business meant repeating similar tasks in different settings.Not every company made this mistake. In 2006, Sam Palmisano, at the time the chief executive of IBM, the US technology group, gave an important speech at Insead, the international business school, in which he set out a chronology (and future) of globalisation that offered a clear way of thinking about the worldwide workforce.The modern multinational company, he said, had gone through three distinct phases. First came the 19th-century “international model” – businesses were based in their home markets, but sold goods abroad via representatives in local offices. Next came the classic multinational, in which the parent company replicated itself (on a smaller scale) in countries around the world.The third model, Mr Palmisano said, is the “globally integrated enterprise”, the shape that he prescribed for today’s IBM. This involved a radical re-ordering of the conventional corporate structure, moving away from having a large and dominant global headquarters in a mature market and subsidiaries around the world. Instead, the business should relocate people and jobs anywhere in the world “based on the right cost, the right skills and the right business environment. And it integrates those operations horizontally and globally … work flows to the places where it will be done best.” Research centres should be built where the expertise can be found – in Shanghai, Bangalore, or São Paolo. More business will get done in the healthiest markets.So one size does not fit all, and not all markets are the same. A degree of corporate agility and adaptability is needed to exploit emerging opportunities. The companies that manage and configure their global workforces the best will win out.The writer is visiting professor of management practice at Cass Business School, London"
257;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-01-24T21:18:07Z;Wall Street hampered by soft earnings;Doubt from Europe drags markets;An earnings miss by Zions Bancorporation highlighted the ongoing risk to US banks from souring loan securities.Utah-based Zions, which owns a group of banks in southern and western states, fell 7.6 per cent to $17.15 as it booked a $12.1m, or four cents a share, charge on collateralised debt obligation securities in the fourth quarter.Overall per share earnings of 24 cents were 9 cents lower than expected.Zions followed the trend in fourth-quarter bank results, reporting a fall in non-performing assets over the fourth quarter and reducing reserves set aside for losses from loans made by the bank itself.But Zions recognised losses on securities the bank holds from CDOs, instruments which issue securities backed by the debt of low-rated companies.$4.3m of the CDO losses resulted from the bankruptcy of a homebuilder, while Zions also said its CDO portfolio “had exposure to 24 of the 92 bank failures that occurred in 2011”.The CDO charge was four times greater than expected by Stifel Nicolaus analysts, who removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, although Brian Zabora at Stifel, said no other bank he covered had a portfolio of CDO securities, “so this issue should be pretty unique to Zion”.Zion’s report added to a gloomy start to earnings season by financials, which are so far showing year-on-year earnings growth of 10.4 per cent, well short of consensus analyst expectations of 20.7 per cent at the start of the season“With financial sector heavyweights generally …dragging down early fourth-quarter results, the rest of the S&P 500 will have work to do to drag index earnings back toward expectations in the weeks ahead,” said Gina Martin Adams, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo.The S&P 500 snapped a 5-day rally to close down 0.1 per cent at 1,314.63. The benchmark US index had opened sharply lower after Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, said it would likely declare Greece in “selective default” once the country concludes its debt restructuring, but the index pared losses on positive US economic data.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 12,675.75 but the Nasdaq Composite index ticked up 0.1 per cent to 2,786.64Stocks were further boosted after the close of trading, when Apple reported record fiscal first-quarter profits and revenues, easily surpassing analyst expectations as iPhone sales surged. That sent Nasdaq futures up 24½ points in after-hours trading.Apple rose as much as 12 per cent to $468 in after-hours after it closed in regular trading at $420.41, down 1.6 per cent.Tech stocks had already outperformed after fourth-quarter sales at Western Digital, the hard disc drive manufacturer came in significantly above expectations, given the disruption to the company’s supply chain caused by flooding in Thailand. Shares rose 6.3 per cent to $36.88.“Our thesis that WD can systematically recover and gain share is playing out much faster than anticipated with much higher profit,” Ben Reitzes at Barclays Capital told clients.That helped semiconductor manufacturers, which build components for hard disc drives, and the Philadelphia Sox index of semiconductor stocks climbed 0.4 per cent.Data storage computer manufacturer EMC Corp climbed 7.3 per cent to $25.14 as fourth-quarter earnings rose almost a third year-on-year. Disruption to Western Digital’s supply chain had left EMC facing higher prices for hard disc drives, “but the company has done a great job of getting its allocation of disc drives without suffering too much margin degradation,” said Jason Noland at RW Baird.Nasdaq futures accelerated further in after-hours trading, after Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings that were 30 per cent above consensus expectations, and also offered strong guidance for the current quarter.Verizon Communications fell 1.6 per cent to $37.79 after reporting an overall net loss of $2.02bn, hampered by pension costs and lower margins on smartphone sales.Investors continued to express doubts in the new management team at Research In Motion, sending shares in the BlackBerry handset manufacturer down 3.5 per cent to 15.01, barely 50 cents higher than they started the year.Investment bank Jefferies said RIM is at a “cost disadvantage” compared with other smartphone producers and that significant restructuring will be necessary to compete in the future.McDonald’s reported strong fourth-quarter earnings with net income rising 11 per cent from a year ago but share sold off 2.2 per cent to $98.75.Insurance group Travelers narrowly missed analyst estimates, logging $618m of net income in the fourth quarter compared with forecasts of $620m but its shares fell 3.8 per cent to $58.00 for the worst performance in the Dow Jones.Kimberly-Clark also succumbed to disappointment surrounding its fourth-quarter earnings. The maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies reported that net income fell 19 per cent from a year ago and that it expected a “difficult” start to 2012. Its shares were off 1.7 per cent to $72.27.Coach climbed 5.8 per cent to $67.97 as the luxury retailer defied the gloom cast by Tiffany, which earlier this year reported a year-on-year fall in holiday sales at its flagship New York store. Same-store sales at Coach’s North American stores were up 8.8 per cent.Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, fell 1.7 per cent to $36.86 after fourth-quarter earnings missed analyst estimates because of lower output at its Australian operations.
258;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-01-24T19:57:02Z;McDonald’s: keep your eyes on the fries;The restaurant chain has proved it can generate global profitable growth;"What is more American than McDonald’s? Lots of things. Almost 60 per cent of the company’s profits are earned internationally. And it is becoming less American all the time; just a 10th of restaurants opened last year were in the US.International growth has played a crucial role in McDonald’s’ performance, which has been astonishing, both operationally and in the stock market. Just five years ago, only 40 per cent of profits were international and the bulk of that came from Europe. Now, nearly a fifth of profits originate in Asia and the Middle East. Just as important as the internationalisation is the way it has been achieved: with a conservative focus on returns, not revenues. While Asia-Middle East profits have increased fourfold since 2007, the restaurant count in the region is up only 13 per cent. And McDonald’s uses its own capital quite conservatively: three-quarters of international stores are franchisee-owned. Contrast this to Yum Brands’ much-heralded expansion in China, where franchisees own only 5 per cent of the restaurants.The same pattern holds in the still-important US, where comparable store sales and profits have grown steadily and the store count has barely budged. McDonald’s keeps its restaurants looking up to date and steadily expands their capacities, leading to (for example) recent success with breakfast and high-margin coffee.It is with good reason, then, that McDonald’s shares have doubled in the past half-decade. Whether the run can continue is another question. The shares are not cheap at 17 times this year’s forecast earnings, and big-cap stocks that pay good dividends (as McDonald’s does) have already had a good run. When the company reported better than expected fourth-quarter growth yesterday, the market shrugged, sending the shares down 2 per cent. But McDonald’s has proved it can generate profitable growth on a truly global basis, even during a weak economy. Surely, that is worth paying a premium for.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
259;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s Twitter campaign hijacked;;Critics of McDonald’s have turned the fast-food chain’s ad campaign on Twitter against itself, unleashing a torrent of abusive tweets, in the latest example of how social media marketing can backfire.McDonald’s bought two “promoted tweets” using Twitter’s nascent advertising system, which it hoped would encourage happy customers to share their “McDStories” on the quick-fire messaging site.But the clickable “hashtag” which McDonald’s used to aggregate these tweets was quickly hijacked by less-than-satisfied diners, who used Twitter to vent about food-poisoning incidents and allegations of low standards of employee and animal welfare at the restaurant group.Such was the volume of negative stories using the #McDStories hashtag that McDonald’s was forced to pull the ad campaign – which had meant to focus attention on the quality of its ingredients – within hours. Clicking on a hashtag takes any visitor to Twitter’s website to a list of the latest and most popular tweets on the subject, which in McDonald’s case was dominated by hostile messages.Rick Wion, social media director for McDonald’s USA, acknowledged that the #McDStories hashtag did not work out as the company hoped.“With all social media campaigns, we include contingency plans should the conversation not go as planned,” Mr Wion said. “The ability to change midstream helped this small blip from becoming something larger.”McDonald’s said that within an hour of pulling the campaign last week, the number of conversations about the topic fell from a peak of 1600 to a few dozen. “As Twitter continues to evolve its platform and engagement opportunities, we’re learning from our experiences,” Mr Wion said.Marketing mishaps notwithstanding, McDonald’s continues to show remarkable strength in the face of tough economic conditions. On Tuesday the company reported robust fourth quarter and 2011 earnings as customers flock to its restaurants for breakfast and value meals.Although Twitter says most of its advertisers are happy with the results from using promoted tweets, the McDonald's incident – dubbed “McFail” by some observers – follows similar backlashes against social media campaigns last year from brands including Wendy’s, another fast-food chain, and Qantas. The Australian airline’s “QantasLuxury” promotion came just a month after it was forced to ground its fleet and led to a flurry of angry tweets from customers who had been stranded.“Social audiences aren’t going to respond in the ways you might hope to what is transparently a marketing ploy,” said Paddy Herridge, chief operating officer of Social360, a social media monitoring firm. “Brands with an established set of negative issues are always going to have those issues thrown in their face if they try and encourage positive interaction on an open forum like Twitter.”Fear of such outbursts of customer rage has given rise to a new industry of social media monitoring services which can allow brands to respond quickly.Twitter is estimated to have generated up to $150m in revenues from advertising last year but is building this side of its business slowly, for fear of upsetting users with too many commercial messages. These can appear in users’ main feed of messages from the people they follow, in search results, alongside the top 10 list of most-discussed or “trending” topics, and among suggestions of new people or brands to follow.Brands using these promoted tweets are charged “per engagement”, such as whether people reply to their tweet, click on their links or “retweet” their messages. They are not charged when other people use their hashtags, for better or worse. At a technology conference in Munich this week, Twitter’s chairman and co-founder Jack Dorsey said that its promoted products saw engagement rates of 3 to 5 per cent, with many clients “coming back for more”.“Twitter’s business model has been in development for quite some time, and it works,” he said.
260;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
261;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;McDonald’s modernisation plan pays off;Arches stay golden as chain beats estimates;McDonald’s ended 2011 on a strong note as consumers turned to the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues for affordable meals amid the economic uncertainty.The company said on Tuesday that last year it recorded its strongest comparable store sales in the US since 2006, luring consumers with breakfast offerings, coffee and extended hours.McDonald’s has recently been investing heavily in new restaurants and revamps, while its competitors have retrenched. The company’s stock price is up more than 30 per cent in the past year and closed down 2.2 per cent at $98.75 on Tuesday.“We talk about multiple ordering points, scheduling, planning and positioning, blocking and tackling in the restaurant, with an attitude of serving more customers during those peak hours – [that] is probably the most important thing,” said Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive. “It’s not rocket science.”In the US, 40 per cent of McDonald’s restaurants are open 24-hours, and nearly 90 per cent are open at 5am. The company’s competitors, such as Yum Brands and Burger King have struggled to convince customers that they offer viable breakfast options.Donald Thompson, chief operating officer, said the company will be rolling out breakfast across most markets to replicate the success that it has had in the US, while bringing more of its premium sandwich and hamburger offerings to its domestic market.Mr Thompson said that McDonald’s had noticed signs of momentum among US consumers, noting increased restaurant traffic during the breakfast and dinner hours, but that the economy remained too volatile to determine if this was a sustainable trend.However, the company’s strategy of catering to higher-end consumers with premium offerings and cash-strapped customers with its value meal has helped shield McDonald’s from the mixed economic backdrop.Demand for McDonald’s fare was strong globally, with fourth-quarter comparable sales up 7.5 per cent year-on-year in the US, 7.3 per cent in Europe and 6.9 per cent in the rest of the world.The company said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter net income rose 11 per cent from a year ago to $1.376bn, or $1.33 a share, while revenues rose 10 per cent year-on-year to $6.82bn.For the year, McDonald’s net income was up 11 per cent to $5.5bn, or $5.27 a share, on $27bn in revenues.“Key contributors to sales were both core and new product offerings, restaurant re-imagings, and an emphasis on value and convenience,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research.Mr Skinner said McDonald’s would invest $2.9bn this year to open another 1,300 restaurants and renovate more than 2,400 existing outlets. The company will open nearly 175 in the US, 250 across Europe and 250 in China.
262;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-01-16T18:15:23Z;US groups feel the pinch of dollar strength;;US companies are beginning to feel the pinch of steady gains in the dollar as currency losses show up in fourth-quarter earnings and guidance reports, threatening a strong start to 2012 on Wall Street.Most major currencies fell against the haven asset of the dollar in 2011 and the declines have continued this year. That could be bad news for S&P 500 companies as diverse as McDonald’s and General Electric, which derived the majority of their 2010 revenue from foreign sales.As the debt crisis in Europe worsened, global investors favoured the perceived safety of the US dollar. The euro slid about 14 per cent after hitting a high in May and last week touched 16-month low below $1.27.Europe accounts for about 14 per cent of all overseas sales for S&P 500 companies, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. “If the dollar continues to gather strength, it will start hurting the profitability of US companies,” said Michael Mullaney, who manages $9.5bn at Fiduciary Trust. “While a stronger dollar may reward investors in the short term, ultimately earnings may have to be adjusted.”Adjustments have already started. As fourth-quarter earnings season gets under way, Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at Sanford Bernstein, is forecasting S&P 500 earnings per share of $23.50 – 50 cents short of the consensus.“We don’t believe recent dollar strength and weaker growth in international markets has been fully reflected in analyst estimates,” Mr Zlotnikov said.He says that if the dollar remains at its present levels, it would wipe more than 4 per cent off international revenues for S&P groups in each of the first three quarters of 2012.In Brazil and India – where local currencies fell 12 per cent and 13.6 per cent respectively against the US currency in the six months ending on Friday – dollar revenues may fall more than 10 per cent this year.Dollar strength is a particular problem for retailers and consumer discretionary companies, which sell products around the world in local currencies.Coca-Cola’s shares have seen a negative correlation of 0.93 with the strength of the dollar in the past three years, according to Kaumil Gajrawala, analyst at UBS. Last week, he removed his “buy” recommendation on the company and cut his 2012 earnings forecast by 4.2 per cent to $4.09. Coca-Cola shares are down 4.3 per cent this year to $66.99.Mr Gajrawala also cut forecasts for PepsiCo while Ali Dibadj at Sanford Bernstein sees currency costs taking 2.2 per cent out of fourth-quarter earnings at Avon Products and 3.7 per cent at Colgate-Palmolive. PepsiCo is down 3 per cent to $64.40 while Avon is up 0.3 per cent to $17.52 in the year to date.But the strong dollar is not just an issue for retailers. Technology stocks are the most dependent on non-US revenue in the S&P 500, with foreign sales accounting for 56 per cent of the sector’s revenue in 2010 compared to 45 per cent for the whole index.Tech supply chains tend to be priced in dollars, giving some protection to component producers such as semiconductor manufacturers. But that makes end-product manufacturers even more vulnerable.“Corporate IT budgets are fixed, so if the strong dollar erodes the purchasing power of foreign companies, they may simply purchase less product,” said Ashok Kumar, tech analyst at Rodman and Renshaw, who added that the dollar could reduce earnings at Hewlett-Packard and Dell by up to 10 per cent if it does not fall in 2012.Apple, however, may be an exception. “If the dollar stays strong, I would favour consumer-facing companies and strong brands,” says Mr Kumar. “Unlike corporate budgets, consumer bud- gets are not set in stone.”As the earnings season gets under way, are hedge funds shorting companies that are most exposed to foreign sales? Probably not, said Mr Zlotnikov. “An analyst has no way of knowing what currency hedges are in place until the company reveals results. I can assume that hedges will net out across sectors or indices but a company analyst or stock picker cannot.”The negative impact on foreign sales has to be weighed against the benefit of a strong dollar to importers or to US companies with large cost bases abroad, analysts said. Alcoa booked $51m in fourth-quarter income from lower local currency-denominated costs compared with the third quarter. Without that, its $239m loss for the quarter would have looked worse. Alcoa is trading at $9.80, up 13 per cent in the past two weeks.“Alcoa has significant upstream facilities in Australia, Canada and Brazil, and dollar strength has had a meaningful impact on its spending,” said Tony Rizzuto, at Dahlman Rose.Another set of analysts dismiss currency movements as the accounting equivalent of “white noise”. Last week Chevron issued a fourth-quarter profit warning, with foreign currency gains that contributed $450m to third-quarter earnings expected to be negative in fourth-quarter figures. Chevron shares are off 0.3 per cent this year to $106.09.“For analysts, these are phantom numbers,” said Fadel Gheit, an oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer. “Companies like Chevron are required by law to recognise the dollar value of their foreign assets every quarter but those assets are illiquid: Chevron is not going to sell its Australian refineries but fluctuations in their value can have an outsize effect on accounts.”For those paying attention to the dollar, the threat is to individual company earnings rather than the momentum of the S&P 500, which is enjoying a strong start to the year.A strong dollar “will not devastate the index”, said Howard Silverblatt, at S&P Capital IQ. “But when it comes to stocks, we work on pennies. They do matter.”
263;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-01-16T09:59:40Z;Renminbi deal aims to boost City trade;;"George Osborne signed a deal on Monday with Hong Kong aimed at helping turn the City into an offshore trading centre for the renminbi, in what the chancellor sees as a vote of confidence in London.Mr Osborne believes the talks are proof that China sees London as a significant financial centre and gateway to the European single market, in spite of Britain’s isolation at a Brussels summit last month.The chancellor has agreed technical measures with Norman Chan, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, to help London play an important role in increasing the renminbi’s standing as a big global ­currency.The two men will set up a forum investigating synergies between the UK and Hong Kong, including looking at clearing and settlement systems, market liquidity and development of new renminbi-denominated products.Explaining the deal on Monday, Mr Osborne said there was “a very specific opportunity for Britain” to benefit as the Chinese economy grows. “At the moment [the renminbi] is mainly being traded in and around China and Hong Kong and what I’m working on is making sure that London is the western trading centre for the Chinese currency…that’s good for Britain, good for British jobs and also good for China,” he told the BBC.The chancellor argued that a more prosperous China would be beneficial for British goods and services, and that the government was explicity trying to build new trade links with emerging economies such as China and India.“I think there is actually a great opportunity; exports to China are up quite dramatically over the last two years from Britain and I think that’s partly because as China moves from being a nation of low cost manufacturing to a much wealthier nation to a nation of consumers they’re going to start to want the things that Britain is pretty good at making,” Mr Osborne said.The deal will also give weight to attempts by Mr Osborne to ensure that new European Union regulations do not stifle the City. He argues that London is a large asset not just for Britain but as a financial centre serving the whole of the European Union.China has given its backing to London’s ambitions to become a significant offshore renminbi trading centre; Hong Kong is the world’s biggest offshore centre for the Chinese currency, acting as a gateway for the onshore market in mainland China.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority recently announced that it was to extend the operating hours of its renminbi payments system by five hours so as to facilitate better offshore trading with London, extending the window through which financial institutions in London can settle offshore renminbi payments.A Treasury official said: “The UK is the only European country to hold a dialogue at such a senior level with the Chinese government, and last summer’s discussions followed on from an increase in UK goods exports to China in 2010 by 40 per cent to £7.6bn.”The Treasury says London is the logical place for the market to expand to help deepen the renminbi market outside China and Hong Kong.British financial services companies are market leaders in what is a rapidly expanding field. For example, UK bank Standard Chartered launched the first ever renminbi corporate bond for McDonald’s in 2010.Total Chinese trade settled in renminbi has increased from 0.7 per cent in the first half of 2010 to more than 9 per cent in the first half of 2011. Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong have increased from Rmb64bn in January 2010 to Rmb627bn in November 2011.Bank of China said it “strongly supports” London to be the next offshore renminbi trading centre, after Hong Kong, while Peter Sands, Standard Chartered’s chief executive, said London had “a unique opportunity” that should not be missed.Stuart Gulliver, HSBC’s chief executive, said: “Successful co-operation will support British businesses as they look east to the opportunities in Asia while supporting Asian businesses looking west to Britain as a natural home for trade and investment.”"
264;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s extends Olympic partnership;;McDonald’s has extended its sponsorship of the Olympics for another eight years, in a deal that typically generates about $200m for the International Olympic Committee.The fast food company announced the renewal of its contract with the IOC in Innsbruck, Austria, where the Youth Olympic Games are taking place. The deal will make McDonald’s a global Olympic sponsor until the 2020 games, for which a host has yet to be decided.Gerhard Heiberg, the chairman of the IOC’s marketing commission, said: “We believe that the long-term agreements we have in place with leading companies are a testament to the continued strength and appeal of the Olympic Games as a global marketing platform for sport.”Commercial contracts account for more than 40 per cent of the IOC’s revenue.McDonald’s is one of 11 companies that have signed up to the The Olympic Partner (TOP) programme and pay an average of $100m for each four-year Olympic cycle.The official restaurant provider for the London 2012 games follows fellow TOP sponsors Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, which have also signed up to the 2020 Olympics. TOP sponsors Panasonic and Samsung have committed until the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.The IOC said it has no TOP sponsors beyond 2020 because it is looking to reform the programme. IOC revenue from the Olympic cycle ending with London 2012 is at $957m, compared with $279m in the 1993-96 cycle.However, Timo Lumme, managing director of the IOC’s TV and marketing services, recently told FT.com: “I would never say it’s easy to get a company to part with over $100m.” He said the growth of the programme proved there was a business imperative for being an Olympic sponsor.McDonald’s’ sponsorship will bolster the company’s marketing power in developing markets hosting the games over the next eight years, including Sochi for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and the 2018 winter games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.McDonald’s has been an Olympic sponsor since 1976 and became a global partner in 1988.IOC president Jacques Rogge said he was “delighted” McDonald’s was continuing to help fund the games.P&G has also announced the next phase of its Olympic sponsorship, with a campaign targeting mothers around the world.The maker of Pampers nappies and Tide laundry detergent said its “Thank You Mom” campaign would help raise $5m this year to support youth sports.Last year, the company signed a 10-year contract with the IOC to be a global sponsor until the 2020 Olympics.
265;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2012-01-11T17:45:42Z;Greggs serves up Christmas sales rise;;Greggs the baker reported a 10.8 per cent rise in sales over the festive season, shifting a record 7.5m mince pies and boosting coffee sales by more than a fifth compared with last year.In the five weeks to January 7, the Newcastle-based company saw like-for-like sales in stores open for more than one year increase by 5.1 per cent, thanks in part to the “extra day” afforded by Christmas falling on a Sunday.This means that it is on track to deliver a 5.8 per cent increase in sales for its full year to December 31, although ingredient price rises and promotional “meal deal” offers have hit profit margins.Broker Shore Capital forecasts that winter promotions have shaved 40 basis points from Greggs’ full year operating margin, estimated at 7.5 per cent. With management confirming that promotions will continue, analyst Darren Shirley has reduced his 2012 pre-tax profit forecast by £2.4m to £56m.“The group has a strong balance sheet with the potential for cash balances to build further this year, supporting the dividend income stream and potentially opening up the prospect of a resumption of a share buy-back programme in the medium term,” he said.Now trading from 1,550 outlets in the UK, which is more than McDonald's, Greggs plans to pass 2,000 within four years by expanding on to university campuses, football grounds and industrial estates. Next week, it opens a trial outlet at a motorway service station in partnership with Moto. In 2011, Greggs opened 98 new stores, one-third of which were not on high streets.Having opened its first coffee shop, Greggs Moments, and expanded into the breakfast market, chief executive Ken McMeikan is now trying to extend business at the other end of the day.“We’re looking at what more we can do to encourage customers to come in late in the afternoon or on their way home from work,” he said. “We are now selling frozen Greggs sausage rolls in partnership with Iceland, and that is an indication of our belief that there are still more opportunities in the take-home market.”FT COMMENTWould-be investors in Greggs must weigh up its growth prospects against steadily shrinking margins. The company’s shares proved a defensive bet in 2011, despite extraordinary spikes in input costs, but this is a UK-only growth story. With the potential for 500 more stores, expanding into markets including coffee shops, take-home foods and supermarket freezer cabinets shows the scope of management’s ambitions. Trading on a forward price/earnings ratio of nearly 13 times, this is expensive by retail or food sector standards, but with no debt and a 4 per cent dividend yield, shares look worth buying.
266;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-12-23T21:42:49Z;NYSE falls behind as S&P 500 solidifies gains;;Tech stocks sat out a good week for equities, as an earnings miss by Oracle led to a sell off in the software sector on Wednesday.Oracle ended the week down 10.8 per cent to $26.06 after revenues rose just 2 per cent to $8.8bn in the three months to the end of November compared with the 7 per cent growth that had been forecast, as corporate customers delayed purchases.“Management noted that IT budgets were not reduced, rather the sales cycle increased as additional levels of approval were required, which is typical of a macro slowdown,” said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund.“Cloud” software company Red Hat, which had lowered 2012 guidance earlier in the week, fell 12.7 per cent to $41.59 and Salesforce.com, a fast-growing software company, whose contract growth has slowed markedly in the past month, fell 8.4 per cent to $98.02.That meant the Nasdaq ended the week up just 2 per cent to 2,618.64, underperforming other US indices, and still in negative territory for the year.The S&P 500 climbed 3.7 per cent over the week to 1,265.31, putting the benchmark index into the red for December, historically a good month for equities, and, more importantly, just into positive territory for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.6 per cent to 12,294.00. That left the large-cap index up more than 6 per cent for the year, but analysts were quick to stamp on suggestions that meant US equities had enjoyed a good year.Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, pointed out that just two stocks – IBM and McDonald’s – had accounted for half of the Dow’s gains this year.“That’s a function of the way the DJIA is constructed – weighted by stock price rather than market cap – as well as the strong performance of these two stocks,” Mr Colas commented.The Dow has also been helped by the small number of financials in the index, and the low stock prices of the banks that are in the index. Bank of America has traded in a range of $4.92 to $15.31 this year and JPMorgan $27.85 to $48.36, meaning they do not move the price-weighted index significantly.On Friday, for example, BofA shares climbed 2.4 per cent to $5.60 for the best performance in the Dow, but that did not even shift the index 1 point, whereas a gain of just 1.5 per cent to $184.75 for IBM shifted the index more than 20 points.The Nasdaq and S&P 500, both market capitalisation-weighted indices, both lag the Dow by more than 5 per cent in the year to date.Shares in NYSE Euronext lagged behind the market up just 0.6 per cent to $26.38, despite receiving approval from US regulators for its proposed merger with German rival Deutsche Börse.Analysts at Raymond James said the deal was still likely to be blocked, as European regulators remain concerned about competition within the exchange space. Raymond James cut its 12-month price target for the exchange to $36 from $42, based on a 33 per cent probability the merger will go ahead.Akamai Technologies was a rare bright spot among tech stocks, climbing 19.8 per cent to $31.93 as investors in the internet services company applauded its $268m purchase of Contendo, a “cloud” services company.“This is a very positive move,” said Michael Turits, a tech analyst at Raymond James. “Akamai are doubling down on the cloud side of their business, which has seen faster growth and has higher margins than their core video acceleration business.”First Solar climbed 8.7 per cent to $34.70. lnvestors picked up shares in the world’s largest solar panel manufacturer by market capitalisation after Robert W Baird analysts said it could be subject to a takeover bid, after its valuation tumbled 75 per cent over the year.Takeover speculation was fuelled late in the week when Total boosted its stake in SunPower, a smaller panel maker, to 66 per cent. SunPower shares climbed 17 per cent to $6.00.TripAdvisor fell 13.3 per cent to $25.15, in its first three days of trading on the Nasdaq, after it was spun out from its parent, the travel booking website Expedia.Investors had shown strong interest in the travel review website as it traded in a “when-issued” market for two weeks before its formal listing, once Expedia shareholders had approved the spin off. But several analysts offered negative opinions once the stock was trading.A Morgan Stanley recommendation to sell the stock on Thursday, which citied expected margin compression and greater competition from online search engines, led to a 10 per cent fall.Mead Johnson Nutrition slumped 10.5 per cent over the week to $65.29, as it battled negative publicity after a newborn baby died in Missouri after being given one of its powdered products.Both Walmart, where the Mead product was bought, and Supervalu, the operator of Jewel-Osco supermarkets, pulled the Enfamil powdered baby food formula from their shelves, citing an “abundance of caution,” as investigations continued as to the cause of death.The CBOE Vix index of equity volatility continued to fall. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” has now dropped more than 25 per cent over the month and is trading at 20.88, meaning the price of options on the S&P 500 have tumbled during December.
267;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Wendy’s to flip Burger King into third;;"The battle for second place in the US hamburger chain wars is heating up. Burger King, which for years staked its fortunes on male-centric advertising filled with sexual innuendo, has left an opening for Wendy’s to overtake it as the chief rival to McDonald’s.With burger consumers increasingly demanding about taste and quality, Wendy’s is poised to pass Burger King in market share sometime next year, according to Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst at Janney Capital Markets. It would be the first time that Wendy’s, which was founded in 1969, has overtaken Burger King.Burger King, which once held about 20 per cent of the $65bn hamburger market, fell to 13.3 per cent last year and could soon dip below 10 per cent, he wrote in a recent research note.“We view the Burger King brand as troubled – a brand that needs to find its voice in the domestic market,” Mr Kalinowski said. “To us, flame-broiling and ‘Have it your way’ are not nearly enough to connect with many of today’s sophisticated burger-sector consumers.”Wendy’s, meanwhile, has focused on taste and heritage, offering thicker burgers with buttered buns while reminding customers of its glory days with a remake of its 1984 “Where’s the beef?” commercials.“Wendy’s is gaining at Burger King’s expense,” said Kevin Horne, a marketing consultant who suggests that the chain should replace “Wendy” as a mascot in favour of “Dave”, the chain’s founder.Top US fast-food chains have faced increasing competition from “better burger” chains that have been eating into market share with their premium meat and high-quality toppings.Analysts argue that while McDonald’s has aggressively reworked its restaurants’ image and Wendy’s is staging its own remodelling, Burger King has been too slow to improve the quality of its food or facilities.Burger King’s stumbles have coincided with a reshuffling of the company’s critical advertising account.Until earlier this year, Burger King employed Crispin Porter + Bogusky, an independent agency known for its unconventional work, in a bid to attract young men who frequent fast food restaurants.“There was a very close mix between the edgy style of that agency and the overall strategic position Burger King wanted to take,” said Bradford Hudson, a marketing professor at Boston University.CP+B’s work for Burger King included a hamburger-scented cologne called “Flame”; a popular but disturbing character named “the King”; and the “Whopper Sacrifice”, a Facebook application that gave users a free hamburger if they removed 10 friends from their social network.But CP+B’s innovative work for Burger King obscured problems with the chain’s product. “The entry point for being excited about the brand was the ads, not the food,” said Mr Hudson.Now, as Burger King’s new owner, 3G Capital, tries to revive the Burger King brand it has decided to adjust its marketing strategy.CP+B was dropped in favour of Mcgarrybowen, a small New York agency run by industry veterans, and last August, Burger King unveiled a “food-centric” approach to marketing that it said would showcase its high-quality ingredients.CP+B, Mcgarrybowen and Burger King all declined to comment.The value of Burger King’s creative account is $300m and the new ads focus on the food itself, with television advertising touting “new” french fries and featuring hamburgers served on “artisan-style” buns.“Sometimes the agency leads the strategy, and sometimes it follows it,” said Mr Hudson. “CP+B was leading the strategy, and the new firm is following the company.”But it will take more than advertising to reverse Burger King’s declining fortunes, according to Jeff Greenhouse, president of 201 Proof, a marketing consultancy.“People are looking for better food now, and ultimately the food is what’s going to get people coming back,” Mr Greenhouse said."
268;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-12-14T20:17:23Z;US dollar: double whammy worry;Investors fear haven status at a time of weaker earnings growth;The pattern of late is familiar to the point of contempt: stocks go down, the US dollar goes up. Asset manager Factor Advisors notes that the 90-day correlation between the dollar and large-cap US stocks is negative 0.85 – the most extreme in a decade. Conversely, the correlation between the S&P 500 and the euro was positive 0.84.This is anything but surprising, given financial markets’ fixation on the ups and downs of the eurozone’s efforts to save its currency. However, underlying this short-term effect is a fundamental but under-appreciated factor – the impact of currency moves on reported corporate profits. With the euro hitting an 11-month low this week, dipping below the $1.30 level, American companies are set for their second successive year of drag from currency translation gains. These gains may be noticed more this year than last, when they were offset by beneficial currency impacts from developing countries.The EU accounts for 14 per cent of sales for S&P 500 companies, according to Standard & Poor’s. Companies with high exposure include McDonald’s, Mylan and Kraft Foods with 40 per cent, 36 per cent and 32 per cent respectively. Back in 2002 and 2003, when the euro rallied from $0.895 to $1.05 and then $1.25, McDonald's booked hefty reporting gains. In 2003 these contributed 7 cents to its total earnings per share of $1.15. Over the two years the revenue impact was nearly $1.9bn.Translation gains and losses may be fleeting but they are more than an accounting identity. They can result in lost market share for manufacturers. US investors fretting about the impact of slowing growth abroad must also consider the double whammy caused by the dollar’s haven status at a time of weaker US earnings growth.

Agency: Heye Group, DDB Tribal
Verdict: 5/5The internet has spawned a genre of commercials which the companies they laud swear not to have commissioned, and their agencies claim never to have released.Ford, Nokia and VW have all featured in such non-ads. The latest one is “Package”, a work purporting to speak for McDonald’s, Germany.The online video shows a young boy sitting in a playground trying to eat his McDonald’s burger and fries, only to have them pilfered by older boys. The end of the spot shows our young hero eating free of predators, his McDonald’s fries hidden by a Burger King bag.The rival burger chain says the ad breaches the rules of comparative advertising by “degrading” its brand. McDonald’s swears it does not know how it got onto the web, saying it was only seen internally, volunteered in brainstorming meetings by Omnicom units Heye Group and DDB Tribal.The company says it is trying to see whether “Package” can be removed from the web, where it has been watched hundreds of thousands of times.Six years ago, a viral non-ad depicted an exploding suicide bomber and a VW Polo, which contains the blast and stays intact. VW has always distanced itself from its contents. But, as the company says: “Once on the web, always on the web.”"
270;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-12-12T20:08:25Z;Yum Brands: pizza and chicken in China;If China’s economy were to go on a diet, Yum would find itself with a bellyache;The first few bites of fast food are always delicious. Overindulge, though, and the feeling is altogether different. For global companies, the same may be true of exposure to China. If so, Yum Brands, which owns and franchises Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut restaurants, will find out the hard way.At the company’s investor day last week, its management made a compelling case for investing heavily in China. It has more than 4,000 outlets there now but is nowhere near saturation. The management points out that if that figure goes to 9,000 by 2020, there will still be only seven outlets per million people. There are 60 stores for every million Americans now. The economics of each store are impressive: a new store in a smaller Chinese city, according to the company, might cost something more than $500,000 to build and can ultimately bring in $300,000 in cash profits annually.Given these two points, it is clear why the company wants to put its capital to work in China. It built almost 300 company-owned restaurants there in the first nine months of the year, and now owns, rather than franchises, more than 80 per cent of its stores in the country (McDonald’s, notably, is taking the opposite tack, emphasising franchising in China).But how much is too much? Note that at the same time as Yum is ploughing money into China, it is pulling cash out of established markets: for example, it plans to cut company ownership of US KFC outlets from 10 to 5 per cent, and it will franchise all its remaining Pizza Hut outlets in the UK. It has pulled in $119m in cash from refranchising company-owned stores in 2011. The shift in allocation means that Yum, which already generates half its operating income in China, will be even more dependent on the country. If China’s economy goes on a diet, Yum is going to have a bellyache.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
271;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-12-08T00:10:37Z;Yum plans to be the McDonald’s of China;;Yum! Brands, the operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, plans to become the McDonald’s of China, blanketing the country’s second and third-tier cities with its fast-food restaurants over the next decade, according to its chief executive.David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, said on Wednesday that Yum plans to more than double its China restaurants to by 2020, when it hopes to have 9,000 across the country. Meanwhile, the company is paring back its ownership of restaurants in developed markets as it accelerates its emerging markets push.“You see, in small-town America, McDonald’s will have a prime location in all the spots,” Mr Novak said at the company’s investor conference. “What you’re going to see 10 years from now is that we’re going to own that. We’re going to have the very best locations.”Yum, which is set to earn about $900m in net income from its China business this year, said it plans to build small restaurants in Chinese rail stations and airports and use its distribution network to expand into second and third tier cities, which tend to be most profitable because labour and rent remain relatively cheap.Already the leading international restaurant company in China, Yum is adapting its strategy there as the cost of doing business rises. Mr Novak said that Yum expects to face 6 per cent inflation for commodity prices in China and believes the cost of labour will rise in the “mid-teens”, potentially narrowing its profit margins next year.Although China remains Yum’s most successful market, the company is trying to replicate that success in India and other parts of Asia with more innovative localised offerings, extended hours and breakfast. Mickey Pant, chief executive of Yum Restaurants International, said the company has been leaving billions of dollars of market share on the table for McDonald’s by allowing KFC to lag behind in the breakfast business.“We will have breakfast in place,” Mr Pant said, noting that customers think of KFC as a place for chicken rather than eggs. “As smart as we think we are, we forgot basic things like telling people we are open for breakfast.”Emerging markets account for 58 per cent of Yum’s operating profits and the company is ramping up its ownership of restaurants in those countries while “refranchising” stores in developed markets.Yum, which recently sold off all of its UK Pizza Hut restaurants to franchisees, said that by 2014 it expects to own 70 per cent of its restaurants in emerging markets and just 30 per cent in developed markets. Currently, it owns 53 per cent of its emerging market restaurants and 47 per cent in developed markets.The Kentucky-based company has seen its US operations struggle. Executives called the performance this year “disappointing” and “terrible”, noting the weak economy and bad publicity, but told investors that a renewed sense of urgency and better relationships with franchises would help.“It’s been a big challenge in the US,” Mr Novak said. “We still have a lot of wood to chop.”
272;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-12-05T22:14:41Z;BATS to establish market-making programme;Move highlights need to prevent “flash crashes”;BATS Global Markets, operator of US and European stock exchanges, will establish a market-making programme to support its nascent listings market, the group said on Monday.Earlier this year BATS announced it would launch a listings market to compete with NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, which dominate corporate issuance. Though stocks can trade in any venue, the listings venue collects a fee and offers other services.While BATS’s offering is now live, it does not yet have any listings. BATS, which has filed to go public, plans to list on its own exchange. It is also in discussions with other groups to list, according to a spokesperson.On Monday, BATS said for the first time it would roll out an “innovative market maker program”, though it declined to offer details.BATS has already said it will distinguish itself with lower fees and size requirements than the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stock markets.But the plan to have a market maker programme acknowledges that corporate issuers require levels of customer service greater than the high-speed trading firms which initially backed BATS and Direct Edge, another competing exchange. The pair now account for roughly 25 per cent of daily US stock trading volume.While the core trading clients of BATS include Tradebot and Getco, high-speed market makers who are among the exchange’s owners, the listings business aims to attract companies who often know little about modern market structure.Groups such as Coca-Cola or McDonald’s see value in having intermediaries handling trading of their shares, even if high-frequency trading firms have mostly replaced exchange-designated specialists as key liquidity providers in equity markets.Getco itself recently expanded its role on the New York Stock Exchange floor as a designated market maker (DMM) and filled the role for Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, General Electric and others, citing the value of those relationships. Nasdaq has its own such programme, known as select market maker.The US Securities and Exchange Commission has highlighted the need for market-making requirements to prevent events like the “flash crash” last may, when a sharp drying up of market liquidity allowed prices to swing wildly over 20 minutes.Though some high-frequency trading firms believe that those requirements would only add to their costs, other groups such as Knight Capital and Getco, who are both NYSE DMMs , have backed them.A recent study by Celent, a market research firm, from publicly available data on the execution of stock trading orders from brokerages, found that DMMs were the fastest way to trade larger orders of shares, but did not offer price improvements as strong as independent market makers.
273;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-11-30T18:42:23Z;Getco acquires BofA market-making slots;Chicago-based trading group expands role on NYSE;Getco has acquired Bank of America’s designated market-making slots on the New York Stock Exchange, as the firm continues to expand beyond trading for their own account.The Chicago-based trading group will become the second largest market maker on the NYSE’s hybrid market, having already acquired a piece of Barclays Capital’s DMM business last year. Barclays still has the largest presence, having acquired LaBranche’s business last year.Getco will now be the assigned trader of 850 symbols on the NYSE, including for stocks of 120 S&P 500 companies such as General Electric, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola. Getco also handled the price auction for the initial public offering of General Motors last year.It will be one of just four such DMMs remaining, the result of consolidation and the exit of firms that were once powerful specialists before NYSE – part of the NYSE Euronext group – merged with electronic exchange Arca and adopted a hybrid model for the floor, where prices are no longer set by open outcry. Goldman Sachs and Knight Capital are also DMMs.While the role of specialists and the NYSE floor have diminished in the past decade, intermediaries such as Getco, founded in 1999, have grown into big intermediaries.As a DMM, Getco has incentives to bring more of its trades to the NYSE, whose share of trading has fallen in recent years. NYSE matched 12.8 per cent of all trades on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters Equity Market Share Reporter.Daniel Coleman, global head of equities and client services for Getco, said there was still value in the lower trading fees and rebates it received as a DMM, in exchange for providing liquidity in the stocks it handles.He also said that being part of opening-bell price auctions on the NYSE was an advantage, but that it was “not a critical part of the market structure”, having become less important than it was in the specialist days.Mr Coleman highlighted the relationship advantages of being a DMM. “It’s important to demonstrate that we’re in this for the long haul and align ourselves with an institution that’s been around for a couple hundred years,” he said.“We’re developing key client relationships with all the corporations whose stocks we’ll be trading, and corporations are key constituents who should know us and what we provide,” he added.Getco has in recent months announced a new business, GETAlpha, that sells some of its trading algorithms to outside clients. It recently hired Chris Amorello, formerly of ITG, to head the algo sales group.It has also seen continued growth in its own “dark pool” trading venues, GETMatched, which pairs customer orders with Getco’s own market making, while most other dark pools have seen their share of trading decline since this summer, according to Rosenblatt Securities.Alison Crosthwait, head of global market structure research at Instinet, said: “In today’s resource-constrained and economically difficult environment, Getco can likely leverage those DMM spots better than BofA could. Those spots have value to them in a way they didn’t to BofA.”US regulators focused on the role of market makers after the “flash crash” last May, during which stocks fell and rose 6 per cent in 20 minutes. The Securities and Exchange Commission now requires that market makers’ quotes be closer to current market prices, and have discussed additional obligations.Getco and other high-speed market-making firms have said that they continued trading during the flash crash without any obligations, unlike asset managers and other traditional investors, who placed large sell orders.
274;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-11-11T18:33:52Z;Cash-strapped Britons lap up porridge;;Porridge has emerged as the “superfood” of cash-strapped Britain, with sales of the oat cereal rising by 30 per cent in a year at Asda, the third-largest supermarket chain.The Scottish breakfast staple has reached thousands more households in recent months as consumers opt for a cheap but warming breakfast to fight the chilling economic headwinds.Rob McWilliam, Asda finance director, said porridge was “a comfort blanket” in difficult times.“It is a product that says security and safety. It feeds you, it warms you, it also happens to be a value for money product, it also happens to be a healthy product.”Mr McWilliam said Asda’s monthly income tracker showed the average family has £15 a week less to spend this year than last, because of rising fuel, transport and food bills.Quaker Oats, which sells more than half the porridge consumed in the UK, said the market had grown 40 per cent in five years. More porridge was sold this summer than in the winter of 2009.David Murray, general manager, said: “We’ve seen demand for porridge soar as consumers recognise it as a healthy, warming and low in fat breakfast option.”The dish has also become popular as a fast food. McDonalds, Pret A Manger and Eat among others have introduced takeaway porridge, with fruit and other additions, in the past year.Entrepreneurs have set up mobile vans serving porridge in cities across the country.Oats are low in cholesterol and release energy slowly, leaving you feeling full for longer.
275;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s looks to buy more property;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues, is looking to capitalise on the depressed commercial property market and purchase more of the land and buildings where it operates.Peter Bensen, chief financial officer of McDonald’s, said the company has been shifting away from its previous strategy of leasing properties in favour of owning as the recession has led to increased distressed real estate.“For the most part, we are focused on purchasing more where we can and over time that is definitely accretive to our business,” Mr Bensen said at McDonald’s investor conference on Thursday. “We realised the opportunity to get in and purchase sites and secure occupancy rights long term has been better than it has ever been.”The company currently owns about 45 per cent of the land and 70 per cent of the buildings for its more than 30,000 restaurants around the world.Victor Calanog, director of research at Reis, a property research company, said many real estate owners would like to unload their distressed properties and that McDonald’s should be able to find bargains with prices stuck at 2006 levels.“Given the amount of distress in retail properties around the nation, now is the time for retail tenants to carefully assess their lease/own decisions,” Mr Calanog said.In spite of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, McDonald’s said on Thursday it was ramping up its capital expenditures next year to $2.9bn, with plans to open 1,300 restaurants and remodel 2,400.In 2005, McDonald’s was under pressure from William Ackman, founder of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital, to sell 65 per cent of its company-owned restaurants and restructure its vast real estate assets.At the time, the company owned about 30 per cent of its restaurants around the world and Mr Ackman, who had a 9.3 per cent stake in the company, proposed that it retain its real estate assets but raise about $15bn in non-recourse financing against them, using the proceeds to buy back shares. McDonald’s was cool to the idea and Mr Ackman later sold his stake.On Thursday, Mr Benson said McDonald’s intends to invest more in real estate next year, but that so far it has not been able to capitalise on the property downturn to the extent that it hoped. International markets have been difficult because landlords want to hold on to the security of having McDonald’s as a tenant, and in the US the transaction process has been complicated because off-balance-sheet structures mean that there is not a single owner to a property.“That said, we’re still looking for opportunities,” Mr Bensen said. “We’re seeing operators of other brands that are closing up shop and we’re taking advantage of those opportunities.”
276;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Starbucks to buy California juice group;;Starbucks, the US coffee chain, is tapping into growing demand for healthy food and drink by paying $30m to acquire a juice business that it will use to open a new line of outlets focused on nutritious products.The Seattle-based company said it was buying Evolution Fresh, a Californian juice maker, and declared its determination to change the way juice is sold in the US in the same way it helped to do so for caffeine shots.The Starbucks move follows steps by other big corporations, including McDonald’s and PepsiCo, to promote healthier food and drink amid growing criticism that they are contributing to an obesity crisis in the US.Starbucks fell into financial trouble after over-expanding to the point of ubiquity before the global financial crisis. Diversifying into juice is the brainchild of Howard Schultz, a former chief executive who returned to the job in 2008 to revive the company.Announcing the juice acquisition on Thursday, Mr Schultz said: “Our intention is to reinvent this category in the same [way] that we reinvented over the last 40 years the basic commodity of coffee.”The company said the “super premium” juice segment was a $1.6bn market in the US and that the health and wellness market overall was worth $50bn.Starbucks, which has made cups of coffee costing several dollars a staple of many people’s working days, said most juice would initially sell in 450ml bottles priced between $3.75 and $4.75.Justifying that price tag, Starbucks said Evolution Fresh peeled, pressed and squeezed its own raw fruits and vegetables and used a special high-pressure pasteurisation process that preserved freshness by removing pathogens without heating the juice.Mr Schultz said Evolution juice would be sold through three channels, including an as yet unnamed new line of stores that it will begin to open next year, which will sell juice and food and have tables and chairs for customers.A second channel will be Starbucks coffee shops, where Evolution juice will replace the current range of juices available.The third will be grocery stores – many of which already sell packaged Starbucks coffee – where it will be stocked on shelves alongside other brands.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo, said: “Over the long term, Starbucks’ ability to leverage its expertise in building a brand and creating an experience around it will translate well into the health and wellness category.”Last summer, McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, said that it was adding apples to its children’s meals and shrinking the size of its portions of fries. McDonald’s has also introduced fruit smoothies.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, has said she wants to triple revenues that the company derives from “good for you” products, but investors argue that she has neglected the company’s core salty snacks and sugary drinks products.
277;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-11-10T19:32:58Z;Blue-chip premium ‘is worth paying’;Buying shares backed by strong revenues from emerging markets is still a viable strategy, analysts claim;Paying a premium to invest in blue-chip companies with strong revenues from emerging markets is still a viable growth investing strategy, analysts claim – in spite of fears of another recession.Research published by Morgan Stanley last month suggested that the current climate might give rise to a new breed of “Nifty Fifty” companies– a reference to the US large-cap groups that achieved strong stock-market performance in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Their present-day counterparts, the bank’s analysts claimed, offer similar potential for strong growth in coming years, even in more volatile markets.In particular, these companies will be those that are active in higher-growth emerging markets, producing accelerating revenue growth and above average – but less volatile – earnings per share (EPS) growth.Notably, most of the companies that Morgan Stanley highlighted already have price/earnings (p/e) ratios of 10 or more. For example, British American Tobacco, SABMiller and LVMH each have p/e ratios ranging from 13 times earnings to 14.7 times earnings.Between 1964 and 1972, shares in the so-called Nifty Fifty US companies outperformed the S&P 500 index by 15 per cent per year.Many of these shares traded on above-average price/earnings ratios – earnings per share (estimated or historic) divided by the share price.But analysts say the p/e ratio has to be used with other indicators. Jeremy Batstone-Carr at Charles Stanley stockbrokers recommends looking at a company’s price to book value (P/B) ratio – share price divided by book value per share – and its dividend yield. If a company has a P/B ratio of less than one, it could mean that the company is being valued at less than its total assets.Frédérique Carrier at RBC Wealth Management says that a p/e ratio must be put into context because certain accounting methods can make a company appear to have higher earnings then in reality.Mark Slater at Slater Investments, meanwhile, suggests that if growth is the objective, it is probably best to look for a company with high growth prospects and a low p/e ratio.However, this may be a premium worth paying. “In today’s world markets nothing is certain, but if you can say you’re certain about a company’s earnings, that is what people are willing to pay a premium for,” argues Tim Cockerill, head of collectives research at Rowan Dartington. “For a business to do well in tough conditions, you want something that is very solid, has a strong balance sheet and provides good dividend cover.”He believes global businesses with these qualities are best suited to survive market turmoil and adds that the price premiums means clarity of earnings for the next few years.Mark Slater, chief investment officer of Slater Investments, a fund manager, points out that a high p/e ratio can sometimes be an indicator of quality – although he warns that it should not be used in isolation.He says British American Tobacco is attractive not because of its p/e figure, but for its other attributes. “It has a little bit of a premium to the market but it has a good growth rate and it is a growth rate that it can deliver,” he says.George King, head of portfolio strategy at RBC Wealth Management, says that blue-chip companies can be used as growth stocks, dividend producers or core holdings – because they produce good results without much fanfare. “The approach that we typically take is the boring stuff, offering diversified growth,” he explains.Even so, Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of research at Charles Stanley stockbrokers, says it might be difficult for any large-cap company to be “nifty” in the next 12 months, given the poor economic forecast.“Our view is pretty downbeat on the medium-term outlook for the global economy,” Batstone-Carr says, adding that earnings expectations are being reduced aggressively for 2012. “If we are heading into a recession, perhaps we should be thinking about a typical recessionary environment where earnings fall by 10 to 15 per cent and there will be no place to hide for even the largest company,” he says.King at RBC Wealth Management is less downbeat, saying that his firm has a neutral outlook for equities in the next 12 months, seeing pockets of opportunity despite what will no doubt be a choppy, difficult period.Nevertheless, Frédérique Carrier, RBC’s equities specialist, says: “Even if these companies do have a decrease in their earnings, it wouldn’t be as much as a cyclical company might experience in the same environment.”Overall, these analysts agree that paying a premium for a company can pay off, but only in the long term. “It’s really in an economy of slow, sub-trend global growth when these stocks perform well,” Batstone-Carr says. “If you’re going to invest for more than ten years, there may be value to be had at these types of levels, but you really need to be looking longer than 10 years.”Slater remains sceptical of the Nifty Fifty comparison. “You could get a version of them among growth companies in the west,” he concedes, but adds that most global multinationals these days are not dynamic in the way that firms like Polaroid or McDonald’s were in the 1960s.Geordie Clarke is deputy editor of Money Management, a Financial Times magazine
278;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-10-31T19:54:16Z;Welcome to London 2012: the apparatchiks’ games;Britain’s capital city is promised an exercise in authoritarian elitism to rival Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union, writes Philip Stephens;Thinking of visiting London next summer? Here is some gentle advice. Think again. Britain’s capital city is playing host to the Olympics. Unless you have tickets to the 100m finals, you would do well to stay away.London 2012 was billed as a celebration of the vitality, youth and diversity that have made the city a global hub. Multicultural London triumphed over provincial Paris. All trace of such romanticism is now being extinguished in the cause of cash and comfort for the games’ organisers.London is promised an exercise in authoritarian elitism to rival Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union. The people’s games have been turned into the apparatchiks’ Olympics. The stadiums and arenas will overflow with politicians, bureaucrats and corporate sponsors. More than 1m ordinary families have failed to secure a single ticket even to the opening stages of the most obscure Olympic sports.Civil liberties are to be suspended for the duration of the games. David Cameron’s government is promising draconian penalties for anyone who dares jeopardise the exclusive rights of commercial partners such as McDonald’s and Coca-Cola.The long arm of Olympic law will reach well beyond running tracks, pools and velodromes. Advertising sponsors have been promised what is chillingly called a “clean city”, handing them ownership of everything within camera distance of the games. Wear a T-shirt expressing a preference for Burger King and Pepsi and you may be thrown into the Tower. The crackdown extends to what the Olympic Stasi call “advertising on the human body”. Freedom of expression can go hang.For those lucky enough to have secured tickets in the public draw, the air is thick with warnings that London’s creaking infrastructure will crack under the weight of visitors. Cars are banned for all but the privileged, but the mayor’s office concedes that public transport will struggle to meet the demands of the Olympics and daily life. Even during the August holiday season, trains are already packed to overflowing.The system will work only if Londoners abandon their daily commute. Those who cannot rearrange holiday plans are being told to work from home. No one will miss the bankers who inhabit the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf, but it is a bit tough if you are a doctor or a plumber.Even then, travel will be at snail’s pace. The journey time from city centre to the Olympic stadium should be 35 minutes by underground rail. The authorities say that once crowd control and security measures are put in place, the trip will take more than two hours.All this is to one purpose: to make life comfortable for the privileged elite that goes by the name of the “Olympic family”. I am not talking about competitors. Most would agree the runners, riders and rowers should be cossetted. No, the “family” comprises the 40,000 – yes 40,000 – Olympic bigwigs, national bureaucrats, commercial sponsors, hangers on and politicians who are preparing to slip into all the best seats at all the best events.These oligarchs of sport have already grabbed every half-decent hotel room in the capital. They will whizz from their Park Lane suites to the Olympic venues along 100 miles of dedicated Zil lanes carved from an already congested road network.Traffic lights will be programmed to turn green as the limousines approach and red again as they pass. Ordinary folk who inadvertently stray into the reserved lanes will face draconian fines. Penalties for parking in Olympic “exclusion zones” will rise tenfold.There is always, you could say, the legacy. The promise was that the billions in public money poured into the Olympics would provide a lasting bequest to regeneration, youth opportunity and sport in one of the British capital’s most deprived areas.Ah, the legacy. The charitable Wellcome Trust came up with a glorious plan to turn the Olympic Park into a world-class centre for the life sciences and advanced technology. The powers that be had other ideas. The site is being sold off to property speculators.The privileged 40,000 will not entirely escape the inconvenience inflicted on everyone else. Most will come through Heathrow, the dismal collection of overcrowded sheds that passes for London’s main airport. There they will experience the dinginess, congestion, queues and delays that Heathrow has made its trademark. On my last visit, the journey through immigration and baggage reclaim was taking two hours. Wait for the Olympics.I hope I am wrong about all this. Perhaps everything will run smoothly. The roads will be empty, the trains on time, and the police will refuse to enforce ridiculous and repressive laws. The sporting spectacle will be memorable, and the world will see London at its best. Britain might even win a clutch of medals. Yes, it could just work. As long, that is, as everyone stays away.
279;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-10-30T23:22:34Z;Omnicom buys Mudra in India push;;US advertising group Omnicom is making its biggest push yet into India with the acquisition of a majority stake in Mudra Group, one of the subcontinent’s largest advertising conglomerates.The deal will give Omnicom, the company behind agencies such as BBDO and DDB, a new foothold in one of the world’s largest emerging consumer markets. Financial terms of the transaction were not released, but Omnicom is taking a majority stake immediately, and will have the ability to increase its control in the near future.“We’re paying fair value for it,” said John Wren, Omnicom chief executive. “It’s a complete transaction, including 26 offices and four or five operating companies across the subcontinent. This gives us a backbone to expand our other services including retail capabilities and public relations.”Omnicom said the addition of Mudra will make the US group one of the top three holding companies in India, a market where it has traditionally had less exposure than its peers. Omnicom has had a 10 per cent stake in Mudra Group since 1993.As the economies of the US and western Europe show persistently little growth, advertising groups are increasingly looking to emerging markets for new revenues.Strong international sales helped Omnicom report surprisingly robust third-quarter earnings in late October, even as the outlook for the sector worsens. International revenues increased 22 per cent to $1.68bn, nearly equalling US revenues of $1.7bn, which were up 5.3 per cent.Interpublic, the second-largest advertising group in the US, has been on an international acquisitions spree, and attributed its strong third-quarter results last week to improved sales in Asia and Latin America.“Every western company of any importance is expanding into India, and India also has quite a number of important companies that are expanding outside of India,” said Mr Wren. “It’s extraordinarily important that we become as strong in India as we are in the US.”Founded in 1980 and based in Mumbai, Mudra now has more than 1,100 employees. Mudra has succeeded in introducing international brands such as 7Up and HBO to India’s large emerging middle class, and has also become an agency for the country’s local brands, such as Air India and the government’s tourism board.“We have significant relationships around the world that can only get more significant in India,” said Chuck Brymer, chief executive of DDB Worldwide. DDB already works with Mudra and shared clients including Unilever and McDonald’s.Omnicom also said that Anil Ambani, the Indian billionaire who is chairman of Reliance Group, will join the Omnicom international advisory committee.“I’ve known Anil for over 20 years,” said Mr Wren. “Having access to him in an area of the world where the future is going to be defined is terribly important.”
280;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Palm oil struggles for sustainability;;Global efforts to put the $50bn palm oil industry on a sustainable footing are under threat because of lack of support from fast-food chains and other end-users, according to GreenPalm, a supporter of the initiative.Palm oil is used in soap, margarine, cakes and chocolate. But growing demand and spiralling prices – which have swung between $950 and $1,300 a tonne in the past 12 months – mean plantation owners are clearing forests to plant more palm trees.To reverse this trend, the industry-backed Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil promotes practices to increase yields from existing palms, including the use of fertilisers. Plantations signing up to these standards are certified by the RSPO and big European food producers have committed to using only certified sustainable palm oil by about 2015.But despite these commitments, signed by companies including Unilever, the world’s biggest end-user, and Nestlé, the food group, only 43 per cent of the sustainable palm oil produced is being bought.Entire sectors of end-users are “avoiding the issue completely”, according to GreenPalm, which runs the RSPO-backed offset certificate trading programme. These include food services companies, ranging from big chains to local fish and chip shops, through to producers of animal feed.The latter uses an annual 650,000 tonnes of palm oil kernel expeller, the mass left after oil from the kernel is crushed out, or substantially more than the UK’s entire imports of crude palm oil.In the food services sector, Bob Norman, general manager of GreenPalm, said McDonald’s was among the few to commit to supporting sustainable production by 2015. “But it’s a drop in the ocean,” he said. “The food services sector in volume terms is bigger than retailers and branded manufacturers added together. It’s a massive sector.”Others claim that even supportive buyers are putting the scheme in jeopardy by buying GreenPalm certificates rather than physical oil. On a global basis, 70 per cent of the sustainable palm oil is bought this way. Certificates offset buyers’ consumption against the production of an equivalent amount of sustainable oil.Critics claim the price of the certificates is too low to create an economic incentive for plantation owners to make the investment required for more sustainable production: they are now trading around 25 cents.“The market is valuing them at 25 cents because nobody wants to buy them,” said Alan Chaytor, executive director of New Britain Palm Oil, a sustainable producer.Users counter that the complex derivatives required – and convoluted supply chain from Asian plantation to the final refinery – make it too difficult to secure segregated sustainable oil that can be traced back through the system.Unilever last year bought virtually all its sustainable oil via GreenPalm certificates. The Anglo-Dutch maker of Flora margarine and Dove shampoo says the complex supply chain and the fact it requires a variety of processed oils make it harder to buy sustainable oil physically.
281;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Supply-chain experts arrive at the top;;"When Tim Cook, the new chief executive of Apple, launched the iPhone earlier this month, it was widely considered a damp squib. In an industry that is big on hype and marketing, the low-key approach adopted by the successor to Steve Jobs was seen as a slight disappointment.But the promotion of an expert in the quiet but critical world of supply-chain management may have been one of Jobs’ most astute moves. In a globalised market, where the delivery of goods at high-speeds and low costs through storms – both financial and natural – is a priority, operational expertise is increasingly crucial.As a result, the promotion of supply-chain managers to board level positions has become a growing trend.“It’s changed significantly,” said John Manners-Bell, analyst at Transport Intelligence, a consultancy. “Operational experts were always the poor relation in the corporate hierarchy. Now, supply-chain bosses are winning their way to the top of the pile.”Kate Allum, for example, moved as head of supply chains at McDonald's to the same role at First Milk in March 2009, taking over as chief executive last April; John Bilbrey was promoted from supply chain supremo to interim chief executive at Hershey, the chocolate maker in May; and Brian Slobodow, chief executive of the mining company US Silica, had been vice-president of global supply chain at Johnson & Johnson.One of the reasons operational experts are being dragged out of back offices is that supply chains have become more complex and far reaching. With growth in developed economies stagnant, companies are increasingly pushing into emerging markets where they are more reliant on third party suppliers.Lucy Harding, head of procurement and supply chain management at Odgers Berndtson, the headhunter, says operational experts are gaining status because the risk of getting the logistics wrong can be so catastrophic.Last week, for example, Supergroup, the clothing company, announced that a supply chain problem in its warehouse management system had led to problems shipping customers’ orders and a significant loss of sales, resulting in a 30 per cent drop in the share price.“If there is a problem in the supply chain, it can become very visible, very quickly,” says Ms Harding. “It depends what your suppliers are doing for you. But, if for example, your suppliers are sourcing the chemicals in your pharmaceutical products, it’s crucial to get it right.”Another driver is the recession, where supply-chain improvements can be key to cost saving. “When it is tough to gain market share and consumer confidence is fragile the only way to drive efficiencies is through the supply chain. Materials will be one of the biggest costs and managing your inventory and making sure your footprint is optimised is crucial,” adds Ms Harding.Jo Sands, a consultant for Interim Partners, which places short-term managers in companies, says she has also seen an increase in demand for candidates who have a solid operations or supply chain background over the past two years.“The current market conditions have created the ‘perfect storm’,” she says. “Traditionally, chief executives have come from a sales and marketing background, but today it is all about absolute value and as supply chain is the spine of the business it is core to realising value.”"

Trading was upbeat but twitchy ahead of the European summit this weekend to discuss a support plan for the region.Better than expected US economic data of late and a generally well-received US earnings season is encouraging bullish strategies, with the brave also prepared to bet on a positive outcome when details of any Euro-package are mooted to be unveiled on Wednesday.The FTSE All-World equity index was up 2.2 per cent in a market that has been adding “risk on” positions as the session progresses.The euro rallied strongly after an early dip and was up 0.8 per cent to $1.3894, while the dollar index, which traditionally displays an inverse correlation to risk appetite, was down 1 per cent. Indeed, the buck at one point hit a record low versus the yen of Y75.78, according to Reuters.Commodities were firmer, with Brent crude adding 0.2 per cent to $109.95, while perceived havens, such as US Treasuries and German Bunds, saw sellers, nudging yields higher by several basis points. Gold was up 1.2 per cent to $1,640 an ounce.Wall Street’s S&P 500 rose 1.9 per cent to 1,238, its highest close since August, and above resistance at 1,230. Extra impetus came from well-received earning reports from General Electric, Honeywell and McDonald’s.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 advanced 2.5 per cent, with the banking sub-index leading the charge on a gain of 3.8 per cent, as investors reckon a support mechanism to stave off Eurozone sovereign debt contagion will be delivered within the next several days.Despite the broadly bullish mood, investors will be aware that any negative news, chatter or speculation over the progress being made by the eurozone to contain the region’s sovereign debt crisis could see sentiment turn on a dime.This has been a stark feature of recent sessions, with assets vacillating in response to reports that point to progress or disagreement.That said, it was noticeable that Wall Street on Thursday appeared able to escape the clutches of eurozone angst and carve out a gain based primarily on reduced fears that the US economy could face a double-dip recession.A surprise expansion in the mid-Atlantic region’s factory activity – it’s strongest performance in six months – bolstered investor stoicism, and it looks like that has been carried over into Friday’s session.Still, traders remain nervous. The S&P 500 may be at the top of its 2½ -month, 120 point range, but the Vix index, a measure of expected market volatility that is considered a good gauge of investor anxiety, remains elevated at 32.Earlier in the session, Asian markets posted modest gains as banks and technology shares were lifted by cautious optimism for a comprehensive rescue package for the eurozone in coming days.The FTSE Asia Pacific index is up 0.2 per cent. South Korean construction firms rallied as the death of Libyan dictator Muammer Gaddafi boosted hopes for the resumption of stalled construction projects in Libya, pushing the Kospi index up 1.8 per centTechnology shares in Tokyo and Seoul were initially supported by Microsoft reporting a modest profit gain and after SanDisk beat Wall Street estimates. The Nikkei 225 closed barely changed, however, typifying dealers’ reluctance to take big punts in case weekend Eurozone events scupper strategies.Gains in the region were limited by declines in resources stocks after Thursday’s sharp fall in copper prices, and this left Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index with a loss of 0.1 per cent.…..Trading Post.To maintain financial health one should always listen to the doctor: Dr Copper, that is.The red metal is so named because it is considered most erudite in its forecasting of global economic activity. Copper is not immune to daily risk on/off switches but its fundamentals demand respect, argue its disciples.If true, global equity investors should be nervous.The Shanghai copper future was limit down – a fall of 6 per cent to a 16-month low – on Thursday. It rallied 1.5 per cent on Friday, but the recent stumble is a function of demand concerns rather than a reflection of supply increases.Freeport-McMoRan, the biggest quoted copper producer, this week cut its sales forecast for next year.A slower pace of Chinese growth is meeting worries over the economic health of the US and eurozone. Funding difficulties in China as Beijing seeks to restrict speculation are also weighing and this has contributed to the Shanghai Composite index falling on Friday to a fresh 31-month trough, down another 0.6 per cent on the day.Some western investors tend to be pretty sniffy about the SCI, but a drop to March 2009 levels should not be so quickly dismissed.Note, the US-traded copper contract has not matched the equity market’s bounce of the past few weeks. It is having a good day on Friday, currently up 5.3 per cent to $3.22 a pound, but has still lost 5.6 per cent so far this week.Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul.Follow the market comments of Jamie Chisholm on Twitter:@FTGlobalMarkets

284;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-10-21T13:29:03Z;McDonald’s profits rise on expanded menu;Restaurant chain grows with breakfast and healthy options;McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues, said on Friday that it would look to raise prices in the US later this year, as rising beef costs have eaten into its profit margins.The company said that because grocery prices have been rising faster than restaurant prices, it sees the opportunity to make increases on its menu items in the near term.“We will continue to evaluate additional price increases in light of those inflationary environment always balancing our goal of driving traffic and market share gains with managing impact of rising costs,” Peter Bensen, chief financial officer of McDonald’s, said on a conference call with analysts on Friday.McDonald’s said that inflation was more severe than it anticipated in 2011 and that it expected little relief next year. However, the company said it will continue to offer its “dollar menu” options even though some of its rivals have pulled back on their value meals.In spite of a volatile economic backdrop, growing sales of oatmeal and mango pineapple smoothies helped drive a rise in third-quarter profits at the US company.McDonald's said its net income rose 9 per cent from a year ago to $1.5bn, or $1.45 a share, as revenues rose 14 per cent year-on-year to $7.16bn. The results exceeded expectations of Wall Street analysts, and shares of McDonald’s rose 2.81 per cent to $91.51 in midday trading.“The investments we are making to optimise our menu, modernise the restaurant experience and broaden McDonald’s accessibility with ongoing convenience and value platforms are driving profitable market share growth,” said Jim Skinner, chief executive officer.Comparable store sales were up 5 per cent globally, with sales up 4.4 per cent in the US, 4.9 per cent in Europe and 3.4 per cent in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.McDonald’s said that its “tiered menus” were working in Europe, the company’s largest market, where it offers a greater mix of value and premium options. Mr Bensen noted that the sovereign debt crisis and austerity measures were dampening consumer sentiment in Europe and that the company would be careful about managing prices and its costs there.Meanwhile, in the US, McDonald’s has been sustaining its growth by focusing on beverages and breakfast, which now accounts for 25 per cent of its US sales. It said that its smoothies, McCafé coffees and healthier options, such as oatmeal, were attracting new customers.“Against a backdrop of continuing global uncertainty – austerity measures in Europe, lingering effects of the earthquake in Japan and weak labour markets in the US – McDonald’s better than expected September comps speak to the strength of the company’s execution,” said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
286;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-10-14T11:58:35Z;China promotes international role for renminbi;;Beijing has published rules to govern how foreign companies can bring offshore renminbi funds into China for investment, a move that nudges the Chinese currency a step closer to a more prominent international role.Renminbi-denominated bond issuance has sprung to life in Hong Kong during the past year, with foreign companies from McDonald’s to Caterpillar tapping the so-called “dim sum” bond market.But faster growth has been stymied by the hurdles that foreign companies face in channelling the cash to their mainland operations. Chinese regulators closely guard the country’s capital account to prevent hot money from entering the economy.With rules published on Friday by the Chinese central bank and commerce ministry, foreign companies will have long-sought clarity about the approval process and the offshore renminbi market will have a more solid foundation for expansion.“Previously, the key thing was how do you generate more usages for this money sitting offshore,” said Kelvin Lau, an economist with Standard Chartered in Hong Kong. “One of the key functions that Hong Kong will increasingly serve is to become a capital-raising hub for offshore renminbi.”Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong have reached Rmb609bn, more than six times the level at the start of 2010, but the growth of assets, including dim sum bonds, has been much slower, making it hard for banks to manage their burgeoning liabilities in the Chinese currency.Slower renminbi deposit growth in Hong Kong in recent months has also fanned questions about whether Beijing was tapping the brakes on the offshore renminbi market, wary of ceding control over its currency.However, the clarification of investment rules implied that Beijing was comfortable with the pace of change and was committed to its stated objective of internationalising the renminbi, Daniel Hui, an HSBC strategist, said in a note.“China is slowly but surely closing the circle for the global circulation of the renminbi,” he wrote.A firm grip on the capital account has been one of China’s main ways of insulating its economy from the volatility of international markets, a policy that has served it well since the outbreak of the global financial crisis.But Beijing is slowly relaxing its controls in order to promote its currency as an alternative to the dollar. A more international renminbi would make global trade and financing cheaper for Chinese companies and potentially be a source of diplomatic strength for the Chinese government.
287;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-10-12T21:49:25Z;Cats, coffee and tales that never go away;Memorable cases endure because they tell stories people want to believe;The British cabinet clash over a Bolivian ex-student’s cat – which saw Ken Clarke, the justice secretary, describe the behaviour of Theresa May, the home secretary, as “laughable, childlike” – exposed divisions that can’t be wished away.It also showed what happens when partial versions of legal disputes become embedded in people’s minds.Ms May laid into the provision of the Human Rights Act that protects family life. She told the Conservative conference that the law resulted in “the illegal immigrant who cannot be deported because, and I am not making this up, he had a pet cat”.As Mr Clarke suggested, it was more complicated. Legal cases usually are. That is why they end up in court. Their convolutions are then simplified, first by reporters and then by pundits and politicians.I have wrestled with how to reduce a day of court proceedings to 400 words and have been painfully aware of how many nuances I have had to shed. And I work for a scrupulous newspaper. If you work for one that isn’t – well, you get the picture, or whatever picture the reporter has been told to draw.The most memorable cases endure because they tell stories that people want to believe. Some of the best-known illustrate how litigious Americans are, how quick to sue over their own stupid mistakes and how much money their greedy lawyers can win for them.The tale of the woman who dried her poodle in the microwave and then sued because the manufacturer hadn’t warned her that this would mean bye-bye poodle has been around for decades. As the legal academic Patrick Ryan has pointed out, in European retellings the poodle is sometimes replaced by a cat, or even a baby. No one has found any evidence that this incident, in any form, ever occurred.One that did was the woman who dropped hot McDonald’s coffee in her lap and won $2.9m. A US newspaper said: “When Stella Liebeck fumbled her coffee . . . she might as well have bought a winning lottery ticket . . . This absurd judgment is a stunning illustration of what is wrong with America’s civil justice system.”What really happened? Ms Liebeck, then 79, bought the coffee from a drive-through McDonald’s in New Mexico. Her grandson, who was driving, stopped so that she could add sugar and cream. She spilt the coffee. He wasn’t initially worried, but his grandmother seemed to be in shock. He drove her to a hospital, where doctors found third-degree burns to 6 per cent of her body that left permanent scars.Ms Liebeck was a reluctant litigant. She asked McDonald’s to cover her medical costs. When the company offered $800, she found a lawyer. The court heard that McDonald’s coffee was far hotter than other restaurants’. It had received over 700 complaints, which its safety consultant dismissed in court as “basically trivially different from zero”. The jury decided that Ms Liebeck was partly to blame and awarded her $160,000. But, angered by what they saw as the company’s cavalier attitude, they added $2.7m in punitive damages – two days’ coffee revenues. The judge reduced this to $480,000. The two sides eventually reach a confidential settlement. We don’t know for how much, but that doesn’t stop people saying it was millions or how ridiculous it all was.The Bolivian ex-student who convulsed the Conservatives had overstayed his visa, as police discovered when they arrested him for shoplifting. He was not charged. When the authorities tried to deport him, he applied to stay on the grounds that he was in a settled relationship with a British man.The immigration tribunal found this was true. There were photographs. The couple had a joint bank account. Friends and family provided evidence. One witness had given them a cat. The Bolivian’s lawyer says he didn’t make much of the cat. It was just one detail among many. Indeed, the tribunal could not find the original cat representations the Bolivian was alleged to have made. The judge, though, talked quite a bit about cats and referred to Ontario’s approach to pets. But that wasn’t why the Bolivian won. He won because he had a long-standing relationship that the law recognised.But, once again, the distorted version of the case resonates because it supports beliefs people already hold – in this case that immigration is out of control, a view that is creating problems for UK companies’ attempts to recruit the best.We should always argue for the truth. The problem is that a lie is halfway around the world before Puss has got his boots on.
288;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-09-21T21:45:58Z;Technology users of the world unite;Access to the internet and social media services has become a human right. Tech companies take notice;"My summer was less holiday more work. Not so much at the office but at home: we moved house.It is often said that moving is one the most stressful events for a family. With three small children (the youngest just three months old), the logistics of managing a relocation while barely managing ourselves were rather tiresome.So far, so unsurprising. But the process itself was, in fact, the least of our worries. The real source of collective anxiety that brought us to our knees? Broadband. Or, more precisely, the lack of it. For six weeks, our internet service provider was unable to connect us at home and life became a lot more complicated. When I needed to find a phone number, I couldn’t even remember the number to dial for directory inquiries.Clearly, no disaster occurred during our enforced break from the web. But the episode did reveal how much we rely on technology. My wife’s inability to get email or use the web – tools that have become as much a part of the daily routine as boiling a kettle – made her feel cut off from the outside world. I couldn’t help thinking that the internet has become an essential service not terribly dissimilar to the basic utilities we take for granted.The Arab spring brought this into rather sharper relief. When the Egyptian government shut down the internet during the protests in Tahrir Square, it was seen as a form of repression.Should access to technology now be seen in the same way as access to, say, clean water? And does this mean that the companies behind those technologies have a particular moral obligation to their users?The authors of Cameras Everywhere, a report published earlier this month by Witness, a non-governmental organisation focused on using video to expose human rights abuse, argue that they do. (Full disclosure: Sameer Padania is the report’s co-author and a friend.) They looked at the role of mobile telephones and social media, as well as technology providers including Google, Twitter and Dailymotion, in documenting human rights abuses.Their headline conclusion is that while new technologies make it easier for us to reveal abuses – for example, for individuals to record government repression and upload the videos to the web – they can also be exploited by hostile governments. Unsurprisingly, they urge companies to think about this when designing their products and strategies. For example, businesses should make it possible for individuals, such as activists, to be anonymous, something that Facebook currently does not allow.One business that has been dealing with this is Nokia Siemens Networks, the joint venture between the Finnish mobile phone maker and the German engineering group. The company was thrust into an unwelcome spotlight in 2009 when it was revealed it had sold technology to the government of Iran that enabled it to monitor telephone calls.NSN had actually sold the division that made the product but it says the incident was a catalyst for rethinking its approach to human rights. In 2010, it published Human Rights Policy, a document that acts as a sort of mission statement for the age of technology. NSN also says it now performs a human rights due diligence process before conducting a sale or entering a new market to determine how likely it is that its technology could be misused.Do technology companies have a particular duty of care? All businesses have a responsibility, both to make profits but also to act in a way that does not cause more damage than good. So, in that sense, there is little that separates a Yahoo from a McDonald’s. Surely every company should consider human rights when making decisions.What differentiates technology companies is the pervasiveness of their products and our relationship to the virtual world to which they enable us to connect. This is what posed such a challenge for Google in China: it was right to think enabling people to connect online was a worthy endeavour; it was wrong to think it could achieve this within the constraints imposed by the state. (A point it recognised by pulling out.)I have little doubt that my kids will see access to the internet as a human right even more than we do. And that does add an extra obligation if only because, just as customers have led the way for better environmental practices and more transparent supply chains, the users of the future will demand it.ravi.mattu@ft.comMichael Skapinker is away"
289;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-09-19T16:30:25Z;Dollar’s rebound bodes ill for Wall Street;;The rebound in the US dollar may be the last thing that equity investors want to see after a torrid summer on Wall Street.For much of the past year, a weak dollar has been seen by investors as a tailwind for US stocks, that has at various times helped boost quarterly earnings for a string of global companies such as McDonald’s, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.Yet amid no end to the eurozone debt crisis, the dollar has risen sharply and is near a seven-month high on a trade-weighted basis. With some currency analysts forecasting further weakness in the euro, even towards $1.20 from its present level of $1.3640, earnings expectations for the S&P 500 could erode further, pressuring the world’s biggest equity benchmark.“The rally in the dollar is a two-edged sword,” says Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird, a wealth manager. “The relative strength in the dollar is attracting assets from abroad but it could cause our export markets to suffer and change the equation for global companies when profits are translated back into dollars.”In recent years, the weak dollar has helped many US exporters by making their products more affordable abroad. For example, John Deere, the world’s biggest tractor maker, is one company for which the value of the dollar often makes a big difference to its bottom line, as it brings home profits earned overseas.Ahead of the third-quarter reporting season next month, analysts have dialled down their forecast earnings per share growth for the S&P 500 to 13.5 per cent from 16.4 per cent at the start of July, according to FactSet.But a stronger dollar would not harm all sectors. In general, periods of dollar weakness have rewarded industrials and materials sectors with some energy and technology names also performing well, according to Citi. A weak dollar also tends to boost technology hardware and equipment. Yet according to Citi, a stronger dollar favours tech software and services and also boosts healthcare stocks.“The dollar has some impact, but it is not the end all,” says Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi, who estimates that 30 per cent of S&P 500 sales are derived from outside the US, with 20 per cent coming from Europe.He adds that there are some benefits of a stronger dollar resulting “in lower commodity prices [that] would help the economy and broader stock market”.Others are also relatively unconcerned by a strengthening dollar.“The dollar has definitely been a benefit for a lot of our companies but right now we’re not too worried about it,” says Eric Schoenstein, principal at Jensen Investment Management, with $5bn in assets under management.Though Jensen’s primarily large-cap portfolio has more than 50 per cent of its holdings’ revenues generated outside the US, Mr Schoenstein says: “Big companies know how to manage their exposure and have been in emerging markets for years.”He also notes that companies’ diverse exposures will mean that divergences between Asian and Latin American currencies against the dollar may offset each other.Other big US manufacturers have deliberately shaped their companies to limit the impact of currency moves. Faced with rapid growth in emerging markets, big US industrial multinationals have established operations globally in recent years to reduce the risk posed by foreign exchange fluctuations and win local political and consumer support for their products.Some companies avoid currency risk by doing all their business in US dollars. For example, Boeing, the aircraft-maker and the US’s biggest exporter, sells internationally in a market that is wholly dollar-denominated.Even so, many view a stronger dollar as a clear negative for US equities, which so far this year have held up better than many other share markets.Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management, says: “The dollar is something to watch and it will have an impact, no doubt about it.”Adam Parker, US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, adds: “One source of the strong profitability of US companies so far this year was the earlier dollar weakness. That tailwind is likely to be diminished or even turn into a headwind for some companies, depending on the lag factor.”With fears of a slowdown in global growth mounting, investors in US equities will be hoping that any headwind from a stronger dollar will be minimal.Additional reporting by Alan Rappeport

Or it may be lipstick on a cow. McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s are all adding fancier burgers to their menus to compete with chains that offer a slightly higher quality and higher priced product.And why wouldn’t they react, given that Five Guys Burgers and Fries, for example, added more US restaurants in 2010 (190) than the big three combined (67), according to Technomic?The magic of Five Guys, Smashburger and In-N-Out Burger is selling a prosaic meal in an environment that makes customers feel hip and upmarket. The old guard can make a better burger. Adding cool to their 27,000-odd American outlets is a challenge fancy toppings won’t overcome.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
291;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-09-16T16:29:31Z;US burger chains beef up to keep up;;Top US fast-food restaurant companies are beefing up their hamburgers to keep up with an onslaught of competition from “better burger” chains, which have been gaining market share by offering premium meat and high-quality toppings.McDonald’s started offering Angus beef hamburgers on fluffy buns, promising more thickness and juiciness. Rival Wendy’s now sells an eight-ounce hamburger, made from North American beef that is never frozen. And Burger King, trying to capitalise on greater health consciousness, is cooking “California” Whoppers, topped with fresh guacamole and ripe tomatoes.The more expensive premium burgers, which in some markets exceed $5, show that the quick-service restaurant industry is moving beyond value menus to lure customers who strayed to “fast casual” or better burger chains. An array of start-ups have changed the market with made-to-order burgers that often feature exotic toppings or organic, grass-fed meat.“I think that these better burger chains have definitely rattled the feathers of quite a few companies,” said Brad Ludington, restaurant analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. “They’re peeling customers away.”The premium burger trend was popularised by California’s In-N-Out Burger restaurants, which were founded in the 1940s but expanded rapidly on the west coast in the 1990s. With a nod to that model, companies such as Shake Shack, Smashburger, Five Guys and Fatburger have been opening in more locations across the US and overseas.A recent report by Technomic, a restaurant industry research firm, showed new high-end burger chains making inroads into the established market.When Technomic surveyed consumers in 2009, 20 per cent ate at a speciality burger restaurant once a month, but last year that doubled to 40 per cent. To keep up with growing demand, the number of premium burger restaurants climbed 16.8 per cent in 2010 from the previous year, while US restaurant growth stalled at big fast-food chains.Mary Chapman of Technomic said big restaurant chains have adopted more of a “barbell” strategy, offering their standard value menu to accommodate low-end customers and more creative and expensive options to keep up with the new breed of hamburger specialists.Competition from better burger chains, which account for only about 3 per cent of the market, is good for the industry, according to Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst at Bernstein Research, because it gives consumers a new option priced between fast-food and casual dining. The focus on quality meats and toppings has forced industry leaders to sell healthier food.“I think, given the demand environment, offering a premium-priced burger could make you raise your eyebrows a little bit, but it shows a continuing trend toward improved food quality,” Ms Senatore said. “All of the chains have ratcheted up the quality.”McDonald’s has clearly taken notice. Donald Thompson, chief operating officer, was asked on a conference call in July if better burger chains were starting to pose a threat to the world’s largest hamburger chain. He expressed confidence in his company’s ability to offer a premium hamburger and said McDonald’s would use its size and supply chain to beat smaller rivals on pricing.“You see the advent of more premium burger outlets coming into the marketplace and, frankly, I think it’s good for us,” Mr Thompson said. “I’m really looking forward to us having even more premium burgers.”
292;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-09-13T15:20:07Z;7-Eleven becomes Indonesia’s trendy hangout;;An unlikely makeover for 7-Eleven from a corner store into trendy hangout is helping the world’s biggest franchiser crack the lucrative but tough Indonesian market.On an average Friday night in Jakarta, pavement tables are packed with young urbanites, talking over the thump of techno music, sipping imported beer and text-messaging friends through a wireless hotspot.This might sound like a trendy new nightclub in Tokyo or London, but the crowd is packing the local 7-Eleven convenience store in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, which has the world’s largest Muslim population.7-Eleven’s products in the country do not contain pork but the stores sell alcohol, and hot meal choices include Indonesian rice and chicken, instant noodles and hot sauce. The free internet and sidewalk seating make it an automatic draw for the young crowd, who park their bikes outside.“It’s the new Indonesian lifestyle of 24-hour convenience, fast food, Twitter and Facebook. The growing middle class is demanding such services,” says Henri Honoris, president director of PT Modern Putra Indonesia, 7-Eleven’s Indonesian franchisee.“Rather than go to the street vendors – the warung – or traditional markets, they are now getting used to the idea of these modern, convenience services”, Mr Honoris says.7-Eleven’s move began without fanfare last year, when a handful of pilot stores opened under the franchise deal with PT Modern Putra Indonesia. The agreement took 7-Eleven into its first new market in 16 years.Twenty stores began operating, selling signature Slurpee and BigGulp drinks and putting the bright green and orange logo on Indonesian streets. Sales from the 7-Eleven stores jumped almost 700 per cent to $15.6m in the first half of 2011 and are expected to reach $37m for the full year, PT Modern Putra Indonesia said.Business has been so brisk that the franchisee said last month it would invest an additional $18m to increase to 57 outlets in 2011. It plans to more than double again next year to 117.7-Eleven’s presence in Indonesia may appear small – it has close to 40,000 outlets worldwide, making it larger than McDonald’s. Yet the new formula of blending a small supermarket with a food and beverage retailer with seating signals an important shift for the company, which was acquired by its Japanese franchisee Ito-Yokado in 1991 after running into financial trouble.The initial success in Indonesia comes in an increasingly competitive market in the emerging democracy of 240m people. Foreign food retailers are attracted by Indonesia’s steady economic growth, which reached 6.5 per cent in the first half of this year, driven largely by rising consumer spending.About 131m Indonesians, or 55 per cent of the population, earn at least $2 a day – almost 50m more than in 2003 – an income that makes them middle class, according to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.7-Eleven, founded in Dallas in 1927, is among scores of foreign companies scrambling for a share of the largest consumer market in Asia after China and India.McDonald's, Burger King and – to a lesser extent – Starbucks are 7-Eleven’s closest competitors in Indonesia, but those chains are not expanding as rapidly. McDonald's, which arrived in 1991, has 112 outlets and plans to open 16 new branches in 2011. Burger King is targeting 40 restaurants this year, up from 17. Starbucks entered in 2002 and has 100 coffee shops.The bulk of 7-Eleven’s clients are students and young professionals who do not splurge on gourmet coffee or upscale dining, but are eager to try something new, said Mr Honoris, who signed the Indonesian 7-Eleven franchise in November 2009.The selection and service at Indonesian 7-Elevens is similar to the traditional American chain, with BigBite hot dogs and $0.60 coffee. Yet the small differences are what seem to be making it such a hit.“Modern Putra’s first wave of openings has surpassed both ours and their expectations”, said Chris Tanco, vice-president for 7-Eleven Inc. They “are very popular among the millennial crowd [16-35-year-olds], and they especially enjoy Slurpee drinks.”It is hard to know if the Indonesian business will grow to the size of those in Japan, Thailand or Taiwan, which have a combined 24,000 outlets. But Indonesia’s population is larger than the three countries combined and growing faster.
293;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-09-13T12:05:40Z;Report highlights value of higher education;;"Male graduates can expect to earn $208,000 more over their lifetimes than people without degrees, making higher education qualifications worth $95,000 to the state in increased tax receipts and reduced unemployment, according to an analysis by the OECD.The Paris-based international organisation also said foreign students were a boon to the UK economy – especially if they stay on to work: “The labour market and taxpayers are reaping the benefits of these additional highly educated workers without having incurred the cost of basic education.”The Education at a Glance report also confirmed that most of the pain of the recent crisis and recession was borne by poorly educated workers.Andreas Schleicher, author of the report, said: “If you look at the UK, and actually most countries of the OECD, those people who are well educated haven’t felt much of the crisis …When you look at the people without baseline qualifications, they have really taken the impact of this.’’This assessment comes as the UK is tightening visa restrictions on foreign students and preparing to raise tuition fees – already assessed as the third-highest user charges for higher education in the world. Annual fees, which are currently capped at £3,375, will be able to rise to £9,000 next year.Mr Schleicher said, however, that the UK student loan system made the system very different from other high-fee countries. “At the same time what you can also say is most of the people in the UK are covered – they have access to loans. That’s far different from Korea and the US”, he said.David Willetts, universities minister, said: “By asking graduates to contribute more to the costs of their education, we have been able to avoid damaging alternatives like cutting student numbers or reducing the amount available for educating each student.”Les Ebdon, chair of million+, a universities think-tank, said the report showed that higher education should be seen as “a crucial investment not only for individuals but also as a means of promoting social cohesion and the growth and innovation that are vital to the UK’s economic recovery”.But Alison Wolf, a professor of public policy at Kings College, London, criticised the OECD’s calculations. Professor Wolf, who produced an official report on vocational qualifications in schools earlier this year, supports subsidy for the higher education sector but attacked the OECD’s reasoning.She said: “The OECD seems to assume that anything extra that a graduate earns, compared to a non-graduate, is the direct result of their degree; and that the state therefore gets enormous ‘social returns’ on university spending through graduates’ higher income taxes.”Prof Wolf continued: “McDonald's franchise holders and city traders also earn much more than the average, and so pay more taxes. Does the OECD want the state to go around subsidising any business from which people expect to make a profit?”"
294;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;US Postal Service: postmortem;Feckless politicians are hindering an efficient but lossmaking post office;In the words of its first postmaster, “time is money”, and the US Postal Service is rapidly running out of both. Of course, even after shedding 110,000 employees in the past four years, more than all but the largest companies’ entire workforces, it remains so huge that Benjamin Franklin would scarcely recognise the old place. For example, it has more retail outlets than McDonald’s, Walmart and Starbucks combined.That, and many other aspects of its business, are part of the problem that will probably drive it into default by October. The popular view that this is a result of vanishing “snail mail” and its own inefficiency is inaccurate though. Today’s postmaster has lobbied for changes that could save $20bn annually by 2015 – twice its projected 2011 net loss. But his hands are tied by Congress where several bills that would allow lay-offs (opposed by powerful postal unions) or more limited service (abhorred by voters) languish.Technically, Washington writes the rules without holding the purse strings as the USPS is self-financing. But a $15bn credit line nearing exhaustion has acted as an implicit subsidy as well as a way to avoid tough decisions. The USPS ploughed much of this back into mandatory pension contributions that it will now miss for the first time, triggering technical default. That deadline may come and go though and normal service could continue through next summer. With elections looming, Congress must then make a decision or cough up more loans.A post office, even one with fewer branches and delivery days, is quite a useful thing to have but need not cost taxpayers a penny. By global standards, the USPS is efficient and there are reasons to believe it could become more so given the chance. Instead, feckless politicians probably will inform them that their unwanted cheque is in the mail.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
295;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Sovereign spreads challenging cherished notions;Seventy large US companies now considered better credit bet than state;"A few years ago, I pointed out in a column that the cost of insuring the US government against a default in the credit derivatives market, had risen above that of McDonalds, the US fast food company, for the first time.Back then, in 2008, it seemed a shocking development. After all, Western finance has traditionally assumed that governments were the safest entities in the markets; indeed the yield on US Treasuries was considered the “risk free” benchmark. Thus paying more to insure loans to Uncle Sam than those to Ronald McDonald (or any other company) seemed distinctly bizarre.No longer. At the end of last week, trading in the credit derivatives markets implied that no less than 70 large US companies are now considered a better credit bet than the American government, according to Markit data. More specifically, the cost of insuring US government bonds against default for five years is currently trading around 50 basis points (meaning it costs $50,000 a year to insure against default for $10m of bonds), while the cost is less than 30bp for companies such as AT&T, New Cingular Wireless and Oracle. The spread for Google, HP, Coca Cola – and, yes, McDonald’s – is also well below the sovereign spread.And this is not just an American pattern: the credit default swap spreads for Telefonica and Iberdrola in Spain, for example, are also now well below that of their government. The idea that large companies are safer than governments, in other words, is no longer such a bizarre aberration in the derivatives world; on the contrary, it is almost accepted.Now some people might argue that this simply shows the danger of relying on CDS as a credit guide. After all, the market for many CDS contracts is thin. Thus prices can be erratic. Indeed, Creditsights, an industry newsletter, reckons that at present only eight US CDS contracts currently have net notional values in the market of more than $5bn, and just 27 more than $2bn.However, the CDS world is not the only place where the relative safety of companies and governments is changing. When Standard & Poor’s, the US rating agency, removed the AAA rating from US sovereign debt two weeks ago, for example, it left the AAA rating for four US companies unchanged. Thus Automatic Data Processing, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft are now rated higher than their own government – a pattern that used to be largely seen just in emerging markets.And if you dig into the reasons why those CDS rankings have changed – or why S&P left those four American companies rated above the government – it reveals some fascinating longer-term structural shifts. One way to read this trend is that it presents a verdict on relative levels of corporate governance, and transparency. More specifically, the reason why so many large companies command tight CDS spreads is that investors feel confident that they understand their balance sheets, and that these entities have plenty of cash on hand, and tangible, easily tracked revenues.Sadly, however, many public entities currently lack that sense of transparency; on the contrary, it is painfully hard to disentangle where the liabilities and tangible assets lie. Hence the high(ish) level of CDS spreads for US Treasuries: although investors know that America is highly unlikely to default on its bonds, the political climate is so volatile that it is hard to predict cash flows. However, a second factor is the issue of globalisation. Most of America’s best-run and healthiest companies these days are not really “American” anymore; on the contrary, they draw a growing proportion of their revenues from outside America’s shores, and hold vast pots of cash overseas.That gives them the ability to hedge themselves against an American, or Western, economic downturn; or, to put it another way, they can flee, with their cash if economic or political circumstances turn sour. So can many “European” companies; just look, for example, at the global nature of “Greek” shipping lines, or those “Irish” information technology groups. However, that option is not open to public sector entities; for better or worse, their credit risk is tethered to the West.Now, this swing may yet turn out to be temporary. And it should be noted it has not really affected actual funding costs yet: irrespective of CDS prices, the US government is still able to borrow money in the bond markets more cheaply than large American companies, including the 70 which now have tighter spreads. But, if nothing else, that 70-strong list shows again the degree to which the fall-out from the financial crisis is challenging some cherished 20th century ideas in finance. Investors should take note. Not to mention Western politicians.The writer is the FT’s US managing editorgillian.tett@ft.com"
296;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-08-25T16:01:10Z;China steps up march of currency reforms;;Only a couple of months ago, Hong Kong bankers were worrying that the Chinese government may have developed second thoughts about its plan to transform the renminbi into an international currency.The pace of reform had slowed, renminbi deposits were no longer accumulating rapidly in Hong Kong banks and there was growing evidence that cross-border trade in the renminbi was being hijacked by financial opportunists.However, those concerns faded away over the past week. Speaking in Hong Kong last Wednesday, Li Keqiang, Chinese vice-premier, signalled that Beijing remained as determined to press ahead with the internationalisation of the renminbi.Mr Li, who is expected to become China’s premier in 2012, announced almost half a dozen reforms to increase the flow of renminbi in and out of the mainland and to enhance Hong Kong’s role as the offshore trading hub for the currency.While Mr Li was speaking, a helicopter buzzed over the city trailing a red banner advertising a Rmb20bn ($3.1bn) sale of Chinese government bonds, the biggest ever issue of offshore renminbi debt.“Confidence in the renminbi market received a very significant boost from the vice-premier’s speech,” says Kelvin Lau, an economist with Standard Chartered. “Since that speech, we’ve seen very responsive actions by the Chinese authorities.”Indeed, China’s Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday issued draft guidelines for a programme under which companies can make foreign direct investments into China using the renminbi.The scheme could be launched as soon as September, the ministry said.Allowing the renminbi to be used for foreign direct investment should make it easier for companies that sell renminbi bonds – as McDonald’s and Caterpillar have done – to move the money to the mainland where it can be put to good use.Financiers have high hopes for the offshore renminbi bond market, where companies have raised Rmb54bn in the year to date, according to Dealogic, up from Rmb34bn for the whole of 2010.Yet, for all the optimism among Hong Kong bankers, the latest batch of reforms is a reminder of the extent to which the development of the offshore renminbi market depends on policy decisions made in Beijing.China has many reasons to reduce its reliance on the dollar, which is used for almost all its cross-border trade and finance. The trouble is, liberalising the renminbi carries risks.Doing so would allow money to pour into, or out of, its domestic financial system, undermining government control of financial stability, interest rates and the allocation of capital.As some sceptics ask, why would the Communist Party dismantle China’s capital controls and allow the renminbi to become a truly global currency when doing so would destroy their ultimate source of power: the control of the banking system.Given such considerations, Beijing is taking a gradual step-by-step approach to the liberalisation of its capital account.For example, a scheme announced by the vice-premier last week to allow Hong Kong financial companies to invest in mainland securities markets using renminbi is capped with an initial quota of just Rmb20bn.Beijing’s caution appears warranted. Take something as seemingly innocuous as the use of renminbi in cross-border trade of goods and services, which only became possible in mid-2009. On the face of things, the scheme has been a great success.In December 2009, only 0.2 per cent of China’s trade transactions were settled in renminbi, according to Crédit Agricole. This jumped to 8.3 per cent in June this year.Meanwhile, international companies still prefer to settle trade deals using the dollar.According to bankers, a large proportion of renminbi trade involves Chinese companies dealing with their own offshore subsidiaries, arbitraging the price differentials between exchange rates and interest rates on either side of the mainland’s capital controls.“This is in essence an arbitrage of the rate disparity between a restricted China and the free market,” said one Hong Kong-based trade finance banker. He added that regulators were growing increasingly worried about outright fraudulent cross-border money flows disguised as trade.Whatever the nature of the trade flows, they have resulted in an accumulation of renminbi deposits at banks in Hong Kong.Renminbi deposits in the Hong Kong system reached Rmb554bn in June.Given the dearth of renminbi-denominated financial assets available offshore, most investors have few options besides low-yielding deposits.They are willing to hold renminbi because the currency is widely expected to strengthen against the dollar at an annual rate of about 5 per cent over the coming years.A reversal in expectations of the renminbi’s rising value against the dollar would have potentially seismic implications for the offshore market.But for the time being, there is no sign that the renminbi’s ascent is slowing. This means that more and more renminbi is likely to accumulate in Hong Kong.When Mr Li next visits Hong Kong, he is likely to have been crowned China’s premier. By then, the offshore renminbi market will have gained greater power too, and will be testing the mainland’s capital controls ever more forcefully.
297;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-08-16T22:31:10Z;McDonald’s top Europe executive to quit;;McDonald’s fast food restaurant chain said its top executive in Europe was resigning after less than a year in the job, which would spark a shake-up in the company’s biggest-selling region.Steve Easterbrook, 44, will step down as president of McDonald’s Europe at the end of September to join Gondola Group as chief executive of its PizzaExpress restaurant chain.Mr Easterbook, an 18-year veteran of McDonald’s, took over the company’s European operations last December.He said on Tuesday: “In this time we have made many changes to our business that are clearly appreciated by our customers and staff”.Doug Goare, who runs supply chain and real estate development at McDonald’s, will take over for Mr Easterbrook in October.Mr Goare has worked at the company for 33 years and will be replaced by Jose Armario, who leads its Canada and Latin America operations.Jim Skinner, chief executive of McDonald’s, said: “We have a deep bench of talent with individuals who are ready to step into these important leadership roles”.McDonald’s has 7,000 restaurants in 40 countries in Europe. In 2010 the region generated $9.5bn in total revenues, making it the company’s top revenue producer in the world. McDonald’s plans to open 230 restaurants there this year.In July, Europe was the most rapidly growing region for McDonald’s, with comparable store sales rising by 5.3 per cent from the same month a year ago.Analysts at Sanford Bernstein said European consumers were showing a growing appetite for McDonald’s new high-end beef and chicken offerings and that its breakfast options were gaining popularity.Mr Easterbook’s abrupt resignation was especially surprising because of his short tenure in the job, according to Steve West, restaurant analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.However, he said top Europe executives at McDonald’s were prime candidates to be poached by other European companies because of their experience gained rising through the ranks.Europe has been the testing ground for many McDonald’s innovations recently.In a Financial Times interview in May, Mr Easterbook said the company would be fitting its European restaurants with touch screen terminals and swipe cards in move to partially replace cashiers and banknotes.McDonald’s has said it is looking to introduce the garden wraps and premium hamburgers that have proved popular in Europe to the US.In spite of McDonald’s recent successes in Europe, Mr Goare will face some tough challenges.Donald Thompson, McDonald’s chief operating officer, said in a July conference call that consumer confidence in Europe was a “mixed bag” because of high unemployment rates, government cuts and new tax proposals.Mr Thompson said: “We have to continue to watch what takes place with some of the austerity measures and make sure we’re prepared from a value perspective and from an operating perspective”.
298;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-08-10T20:56:48Z;US stocks resume downturn;;US equities once again fell sharply on Wednesday, wiping out a late-Tuesday rally that many had hoped would represent a bottom to August’s steep declines.Financials continued to lead the move lower, dropping 7.1 per cent as a sector by the close. Citigroup fell 10.5 per cent to $28.49, and Bank of America fell 6.8 per cent to $6.77.The major indices ended the session at the day’s lows, with S&P 500 index falling 4.4 per cent to 1,120.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.6 per cent to 10,719.48, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 4.1 per cent to 2,381.05.The chief executive of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, sought to allay fears. On Wednesday he said the bank would seek to pay a dividend as soon as possible, and said it would not seek new equity capital.But the two largest US financial institutions, seen as highly sensitive to a US economic slowdown, only endured further volatility. Wednesday’s losses wiped out the brief rally in the shares on Tuesday, bringing them back near their lows seen after a 20 per cent correction on Monday.Leading financial declines on Wednesday were regional banks. Regions Financial fell 11.5 per cent to $4.23, and SunTrust slipped 11.5 per cent to $5.80. Wells Fargo, seen as one of the better-capitalised banks, still fell 7.7 per cent, to $22.88.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets recommended that investors should keep buying bank stocks. “It is important to remember that bank fundamentals are strong and we believe they are getting stronger,” they wrote.However, they also warned that regulatory uncertainty was weighing on the stocks. “The Federal Reserve needs to provide the [systemically important financial institution] buffers and a timetable to reach them,” they wrote.The troubles of large European banks weighed as well. France’s credit rating, much as the US’s was earlier this week, is feared to be vulnerable as European countries are all called to fund bail-outs to “peripheral” economies such as Greece.Glenn Schorr, analyst at Nomura, said: “Despite the low valuations, we believe macro concerns will probably keep buyers on the sidelines in the near term”.There were gains in the sector, however, unlike in previous sessions. Capital One, the consumer lender and credit card group, agreed to acquire the US card businesses of HSBC for $30bn, which follows its earlier $9bn deal to buy ING’s US deposit unit. It is now among the five largest consumer depositaries in the US. The shares rose 0.7 per cent to $41.05.“This is a strong acquisition for Capital One and complements the ING acquisition,” said analysts at Citigroup.AvalonBay Communications, the property management group, was up 0.1 per cent to $125.67, after it was named as a possible buyer of rival Archstone, still owned by the bankrupt Lehman Brothers estate.The market had initially slipped to new lows on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold rates near zero until 2013, but did not extend any additional liquidity programmes.After the S&P 500 dropped to just above 1,100, many traders stepped in to close shorts, believing that the Fed’s promise of liquidity could be a catalyst for gains. But the market quickly resumed its initial move at Wednesday’s open.“The Fed did not commit to a third round [of quantitative easing] yesterday. Some traders seeking a bottom may have inferred they were likely to do so, but they didn’t do that,” said Clark Yingst, chief market strategist at Joseph Gunnar.Mr Yingst said that energy groups and other commodity-linked companies would benefit the most if investors believed “QE3” of some form was imminent. “Hard assets will be what people are seeking if there is ultimately going to be a round three of easing,” he said.ExxonMobil, the crude oil giant, was down 4.4 per cent at $68.03 on Wednesday, and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was down 3.3 per cent at $43.55.Materials groups CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, and Newmont Mining, the gold producer, were among the market’s most resilient performers, as the sector outperformed, down 3.3 per cent. CF’s shares were off by 0.3 per cent at $149.59 and Newmont added 0.7 per cent to $55.81.Retailer Macy’s succumbed to the sell-off, dropping 3.6 per cent to $24.52, despite the department store chain raising its full-year earnings forecast from $2.45 to as much as $2.65 a share.Polo Ralph Lauren, the apparel designer, added 4.5 per cent to $125.28 after it topped analyst expectations by earning $1.90 for the quarter, versus forecasts of $1.47.Walt Disney fell 9.1 per cent to $31.54 as the entertainment and media group missed forecasts for its revenues this quarter. Sales totalled $1.62bn, versus $1.83bn that had been forecast.Analysts at Nomura lowered their price target from $45 to $42 a share. “The stock is likely to be range-bound unless the macro outlook brightens or earnings begin to beat expectations again,” they said.
299;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-07-31T17:04:32Z;US food groups step up healthy eating drive;;US food and restaurant companies are aggressively stepping up their healthy food initiatives to get ahead of government regulations, but sceptics warn that they could be overreaching at their own expense.McDonald’s, the US fast-food restaurant chain, last week bowed to pressure over its marketing to children, putting its “Happy Meals” on a diet by shrinking the size of its French fries and offering apple slices. That followed a move in early July when 19 US restaurant chains promised to offer a children’s meal with limited calories, fat, salt and sugar.Big food companies have also been forging ahead to be healthier. Ken Powell, chief executive of General Mills, the maker of Cheerios cereal and Progresso soups, said its organic business is now a “growth engine” for the company and that the success of that division is informing its entire product line.“Consumer attitudes are changing,” Mr Powell told the Financial Times.PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks company, has been especially ambitious on this front, aiming to double the revenues it generates from nutritious products by the end of the decade. Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive, in February said, “This is no longer a trend or a fad, this is here to stay”.In spite of these efforts, some argue that food groups risk overreaching by investing in food fads and straying from their strengths.A former chief executive of a top US food company, who now advises other companies, warns about the costs of overreacting to the health push. He said companies risk confusing their research and development departments, which have spent years focused on taste, and that they may be opening opportunities for groups that stick to their less calorie-conscious roots.Steve West, analyst at Sifel Nicolaus, said that healthy options still account for a small percentage of sales at restaurant chains and that companies need to adapt their recipes gradually because flavour preferences are deeply ingrained in their customers. He points to the grilled chicken venture by Yum! Brands’ KFC as an example of the pitfalls of trying to change.“They spent millions of dollars a couple years ago buying ovens for franchises to make grilled chicken to capitalise on the healthier food craze, and it flopped,” Mr West said. “They did not see any sales lift at all.”Last year KFC made a bigger bet on taste with its “Double Down” sandwich, encasing bacon, cheese and sauce between two slabs of fried chicken.Jerry McVety, president of the restaurant consulting firm McVety & Associates, said that some restaurant chains, such as Taco Bell and Hardee’s, have thrived by clinging to core values that are not healthy. He advises restaurant groups that appetite for healthier food is likely here to stay, but that they should be careful about straying too far from what made them successful.“If you change things too much, it can come back to haunt you eventually,” Mr McVety said.
300;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Dunkin’ Brands soars on New York debut;;Shares in Dunkin’ Brands, parent of the coffee and doughnuts chain Dunkin’ Donuts, leapt more than 40 per cent on Wednesday after an initial public offering that raised $423m.Dunkin’ was priced at $19 a share, above its projected range of $16 to $18, but its shares closed up 46.6 per cent at $27.85 in New York.That lifted the valuation of the company, which operates its outlets as franchises, to more than $3.5bn on the Nasdaq market.Dunkin’s business is built on drinks more than doughnuts and the company is the largest seller of takeaway hot coffee in the US, according to NPD Group, an industry research firm. In that market it competes against Starbucks and McDonald’s.Dunkin’ Brands also owns the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream chain and in total has 16,000 outlets in 57 countries.Three private equity groups that acquired it in a leveraged buy-out in 2006 – Bain Capital, Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners – have maintained a controlling stake of about 78 per cent in the company after the IPO.Dunkin’s shares climbed steadily in the morning then slipped back in the afternoon before rallying again toward the end of the trading session.Asked whether Dunkin’ should have sold the shares at a higher price, Neil Moses, chief financial officer, said: “That’s always a challenge. We debated that yesterday. But we felt we wanted to start the trade well in the after-market.”Proceeds from the offering will be used to pay down some of the company’s long-term debt, which it took on in the leveraged buy-out.Mr Moses said the company carried about $1.5bn of debt, equal to five times this year’s forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about $300m.He said the company aimed to reduce the debt to 4.5 times forecast earnings by the end of this year.Dunkin’ Donuts plans to double its number of US outlets from about 6,800 over the next 20 years. It operates an “asset-lite” model through which most of the capital investment in new stores is made by franchisees.The company provides support in the form of a supply chain, marketing and product innovation.The chain has most of its stores on the American east coast and wants to open more in the western US. It also has fast-growing businesses in China and Russia and plans to open more stores overseas.
301;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-07-26T21:24:16Z;McDonald’s adds fruit to Happy Meals;;McDonald’s is phasing out fries in favour of fruit for its “Happy Meals”, acquiescing to calls from the US government and health activist groups to sell healthier food to children.The US fast-food restaurant chain said on Tuesday its new children’s meals would come with a side of sliced apples and low-fat milk and that it would reduce the size of the fries by more than half. The meal, which launches in September, will have about 20 per cent fewer calories.“McDonald’s will always try to do the right thing, and we know we can help make a difference in our communities,” Jan Fields, president of McDonald’s USA, said in a statement. “The commitments we’re announcing today will guide the future evolution of our menu and marketing.”The company, which has faced withering criticism from health advocates, has already announced plans to reduce sodium, calories and fat in its food this decade.The move comes as food companies have been under pressure over marketing of unhealthy food. In April, the US government issued a proposal asking food companies to curb marketing that entices children with products high in saturated fat, trans fat, sugars and sodium. Ronald McDonald, the corporate mascot of McDonald’s, has been targeted by health groups as an ambassador of junk food to children.Steve West, restaurant analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said the healthier McDonald’s offerings would put pressure on other fast-food chains such as Burger King and Wendy’s to improve their menus. Quick service chains have already been facing competition from casual dining rivals such as Chipotle and Panera, which have stepped up the quality of their food.“There’s been a lot of political pressure on McDonald's,” Mr West said. “This is part of the transformation they’ve been making.”Michelle Obama, US first lady, lauded the announcement on Tuesday, calling the changes “positive steps toward the goal of solving the problem of childhood obesity”.Meanwhile, critics of the company offered cautious praise.“McDonald’s deserves credit for not only taking these steps, but for acknowledging its role in today’s epidemic of diet-related disease in so doing,” said Kelle Louaillier, executive director of Corporate Accountability International. “It’s a good first step, however, the corporation has yet to address the central issue – its aggressive brand marketing to kids.”Walter Willett, chairman of the Harvard School of Public Health’s department of nutrition, said, “This is a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t begin to compensate for the huge amount of soda, fries and other junk that McDonald’s promotes and sells.”McDonald’s said it would continue offering toys with its meals for children, in spite of calls for the company to stop including such trinkets.“It wouldn’t be a Happy Meal without a toy,” said Danya Proud, a McDonald’s spokeswoman.
302;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-07-22T22:30:39Z;Struggling consumers boost McDonald’s;;Struggling consumers are still flocking to McDonald’s, the US fast food restaurant chain, which has benefited from the lingering effects of the economic downturn.McDonald’s shares touched a record high on Friday, after the company said its frozen drinks and breakfast offerings helped its second-quarter earnings exceed Wall Street expectations. With an expanded menu offering, it is stealing market share from competitors such as Starbucks and Yum! Brands and luring consumers away from their breakfast tables with oatmeal and smoothies.Jim Skinner, chief executive, said McDonald’s was succeeding by offering more “relevant” food and beverage choices and because of its move to modernise its restaurants. Drinks sales at McCafe, which Mr Skinner introduced in the US in 2009, increased 29 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter.McDonald’s raised prices in March and May this year to keep up with soaring commodity costs. But the company said that although consumer sentiment remains “volatile” and unemployment is high in the US and across Europe, customers have not shied away or changed their eating habits.“We aren’t seeing any dramatic spike in the usage of our dollar menus,” Peter Bensen, chief financial officer, said in a call with analysts. “We’ll continue to be judicious as we move forward.”Mr Bensen said that because grocery prices are rising faster than restaurant menu prices, McDonald’s has more room to raise prices later this year. He expects commodity prices to “top out” in the third quarter and ease during the last three months of the year.McDonald’s plans to import some of its premium hamburgers that have been popular in Europe to the US, as it looks to fend off competition from increasingly popular “better burger” chains in the US. The company would like to begin exporting its strawberry lemonade beverages, which are popular in the US, but said it is assessing global fruit supplies.Meanwhile, McDonald’s is looking to use its scale to capitalise on weak spots in the economy and to edge out competition. Mr Bensen said McDonald’s had purchased more restaurant sites in 2011 than last year and would likely increase its real estate ownership further next year.John Ivankoe, restaurant analyst at JPMorgan, said in a research note that he was “comforted” by McDonald’s performance and that it had strong momentum going into the second half of the year.Net income at McDonald’s rose 19 per cent to $1.41bn, or $1.35 a share, from $1.23bn, or $1.13, in the same period a year ago. The results sent the company’s shares up 2.3 per cent to close at $88.56 on Friday.Total revenues at McDonald’s rose 16 per cent to $6.9bn.The US was the slowest growing region of the world, with total revenues increasing just 4 per cent. The pace of growth picked up in Europe, where total revenues increased 21 per cent, and in Asia and the Middle East, where they jumped 25 per cent.McDonald’s said it expects global comparable store sales to rise 4-5 per cent in July.
303;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-07-22T20:53:29Z;US equities struggle but end up on week;;US equities posted solid gains this week as the second-quarter earnings season heated up, led by stellar results from Apple whose stock hit a record.On Friday, better earnings from McDonald’s were offset by investors selling fellow blue-chips General Electric, Caterpillar and Verizon.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,345.01 on Friday for a weekly rise of 2.2 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 per cent to 2,858.83, a weekly gain of 2.5 per cent.Overall, S&P 500 earnings growth in the second quarter is set to rise 9.2 per cent year-on-year, up from a forecast of 7.1 per cent at the start of this week, according to FactSet. That sets the S&P up for its first single-digit earnings gain after six quarters of double-digit results.So far this earnings season, 127 companies have reported their results with 84 beating estimates, a little higher than the run rate in prior quarters, and with 16 missing estimates, said John Butters, a senior analyst at FactSet.The big change this week has been in technology, with the S&P sector up 3.7 per cent in the wake of stunning results from Apple. The blended earnings for technology are now seen rising 17.5 per cent for the second quarter, up from 11.9 per cent on Monday, said FactSet.Apple recorded earnings of $7.79 a share versus forecasts of $5.87 a share and the stock touched an all-time high of $396.27 on Wednesday and rose 7.8 per cent to $393.30 on the week.Shares in News Corp dropped at the start of the week, but the stock rebounded and rose 5 per cent to $16.42 from Monday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent on Friday to close at 12,681.16 with a number of blue-chips reporting their latest results.Leading the Dow’s best performers on Friday was McDonald’s, whose second-quarter profits rose 19 per cent to $1.41bn, or $1.35 per share, and beat estimates. Its shares gained 2.3 per cent to $88.56.Fellow Dow member General Electric saw its shares drop 0.6 per cent to $19.04 after the conglomerate reported a 21.6 per cent jump in earnings, boosted by demand for oil and natural gas production equipment and jet engines.Verizon Communications, the telecoms group, swung to a second-quarter profit of $1.61bn that exceeded estimates and also named Lowell McAdam as the new chief executive officer.But shares in Verizon fell 2.2 per cent to $36.74, even as 2.3m sales of the iPhone helped produce earnings of 57 cents per share, ahead of analysts’ expectations of 55 cents per share.After the closing bell on Thursday, Microsoft reported a larger-than-expected jump in its fourth-quarter profit, but sales for its Windows product declined. The Dow constituent rallied 1.6 per cent on Friday, up 2.8 per cent on the week at $27.52.Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, said its net earnings in the second quarter rose 44 per cent to $1.02bn, or $1.52 per share. Excluding costs, the company earned $1.72 per share, below the $1.75-per-share forecasts.Caterpillar also signalled an uncertain business environment and the stock dropped 5.8 per cent at $105.15, and as the third-highest priced member of the price-weighted DJIA after IBM and Chevron, Caterpillar dragged heavily on the blue-chip benchmark.Of the major S&P sectors, financials was one of the standouts this week with a gain of 3.3 per cent as 26 banks reported earnings. Morgan Stanley reported a smaller-than-expected loss and, for the week, its stock rose 13.3 per cent to $23.90.Bank of America, the US’s largest bank, reported a net loss of $8.8bn for the second quarter and its shares rose 1.3 per cent to $10.13. Wells Fargo rose 7.2 per cent to $29.14 this week after its 29 per cent rise in earnings to $3.9bn. Goldman Sachs rose 4.1 per cent to $135.49, after overall earnings of $1.1bn, or $1.85 a share, and announced 1,000 job cuts. Analysts had expected profit of $2.27 a share with results hit by a 53 per cent year-on-year plunge in fixed income, currency and commodities revenues to $1.6bn.Zillow, the real estate website, debuted on the Nasdaq and tripled in value in its first day of trading on Wednesday. Shares opened at $60 and closed at $34.27 on Friday.In deals, Express Scripts agreed to a $71.36-a-share offer in cash and stock worth $29bn to buy Medco Health Solutions. Medco shares soared 22.1 per cent to $65.96. Express Scripts rose 10.3 per cent to $57.3
304;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-06-13T11:18:55Z;Pret a Manger plans Paris store opening;;Sandwich chain Pret a Manger is preparing to open two shops in Paris this year, making France its first new territory since a troubled expansion into the US and Asia a decade ago.The company expects to sign leases in the coming weeks for two sites – one in La Defense and the other near the Champs Elysees. The locations mean Pret will roll into one push an expansion process that took two steps in the UK, where founders Julian Metcalfe and Sinclair Beecham built up a lunchtime following in the City before taking on shops in London’s west end.It will also offer more seating in the French shops than in a typical London Pret, as well as a different range of products – increasing, for example, the number of baguette sandwiches on sale.Clive Schlee, chief executive, says the adjustments are the result of past mistakes abroad.Mr Schlee joined the company as it was retrenching internationally. Starting in 2000, it had opened scores of stores in the US, Hong Kong and Tokyo. But where the freshly made packaged sandwich concept had quickly caught the imagination of Britons, it proved a harder sell in the new territories.New Yorkers, for instance, were unimpressed by a brand boasting a kitchen in every venue, since that was a standard already met by most corner delis. And they balked at buying lunch where they couldn’t also serve themselves filter coffee. Pret primarily offered espresso-based drinks.After the dot-com bubble burst, the company closed a tranche of American and Hong Kong stores and withdrew from Japan entirely. In its climbdown in the US, it joined a roster of successful UK companies that have stumbled across the Atlantic, from Pizza Express, which no longer has a presence in America, to Tesco, with its slow-to-catch-on Fresh & Easy brand.“By 2002, the dream was pretty much over,” says Mr Schlee. “These cities are like a Labyrinth. You go in as a victim, and you crash into the walls, and there are horrible little pickpockets everywhere. We were almost eaten by the Minataur but we made it.”In 2006, Pret began expanding again in the US and Hong Kong. Today, its international business is profitable “by all measures”, according to Mr Schlee. The group added two Hong Kong shops last year, bringing the total to 10, and seven in the US, including a push beyond New York and Washington, to Chicago. It now has 32 American shops – the number it had before retrenchment – and more than 220 in the UK, where it is still growing.Pret decided to open in Paris after it studied a number of European cities and concluded the French capital offered the most promise, in part due to sheer density. Madrid, Barcelona and Berlin ranked second, third and fourth. But Mr Schlee says the company has no intention of moving into any of those locations until it is sure it has got Paris right.Even bigger restaurant brands have found they need to adapt to different cultures in order to succeed abroad. McDonald’s, which previously owned a third of Pret, famously changed its one-size-fits-all approach after growth in Europe stuttered in the late 1990s.Mr Schlee says Pret, which is 52 per cent owned by private equity group Bridgepoint, aims to increase sales by 15 per cent a year, two-thirds of which should come from expansion and one-third from same-store sales. Its worldwide estate produced £327m in revenues last year, a 17 per cent year-on-year rise. The pre-tax loss at the group – heavily indebted by Bridgepoint’s leveraged buy-out – fell from £45m in 2009 to £36m.
305;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-06-06T21:21:43Z;Watching the executives;;Companies caught lying, cheating or bribing are increasingly turning to new a solution to signal they have recovered their moral compass – an integrity tsar. One reason is that hiring a guardian of ethics is an easy way to broadcast to the outside world that the business has renounced its former ways.In February, Daimler, for example, appointed Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt, a former German Federal Constitutional Court judge, to a new “integrity and legal affairs” seat on its management board, almost a year after reaching a costly financial settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice over allegations that it had paid bribes to foreign government officials.Other big companies, such as Siemens – still recovering from a bribery scandal than first surfaced in 2006 – and Renault, which is in the process of appointing an ethics manager as it tackles the fallout from a botched internal espionage probe, are also engaged in heavy duty corporate clean-ups. “The financial crisis showed that trusting people to do the right thing does not work, so activist shareholders are putting much more pressure on companies to be compliant and act ethically,” says Arturo Bris, professor of finance at IMD business school.Fears that the UK Bribery Act, which will come into force on July 1, could trigger a series of test-case criminal prosecutions, also favour the trend, while presenting recruiters with a challenge. Simon Hankey, Europe, Middle East and Africa head of legal, risk and compliance practice at headhunters Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann, says: “What we are witnessing is a role in transition, with some companies appointing compliance and ethics chiefs for the first time and others upskilling.”In the past, compliance jobs appealed mainly to technically skilled auditors and legal specialists. Now, he says, the job demands professionals who also possess the business credibility and persuasion skills to change corporate culture.One unanswered question, however, is whether the role is to be an enforcer, to keep employees legal or an ethics champion to push for what is right on top of what regulations require. The divergences in outlook are apparent in the variations in job titles for the function, which range across “chief compliance and ethics officer”, “compliance and integrity” and simple “compliance”.At McDonald’s, Haydee Olinger is the global compliance and ethics officer, combining regulatory oversight with a wider responsibility for “instilling ethical thinking throughout the organisation”. But this does not mean she has a say in how the company promotes its Happy Meals, which have been attacked by consumer activists. That function falls to someone else whose reports to the head of communications.How much independence the compliance role commands makes a big difference to the holder’s ability to be effective. At the time of the corruption scandal, Siemens employed part-time compliance managers who reported to local business heads. “Frankly, [compliance] just wasn’t taken seriously,” says Peter Solmssen, who joined the company in 2007 as general counsel. Today, all compliance staff report to the headquarters team. Mr Solmssen says this makes clear that their overriding responsibility is “to the company”.But what if senior management transgresses? Once again, reporting lines matter. At Microsoft, compliance director Odell Guyton reports to general counsel, as does Ms Olinger at McDonald’s. However, both are also independently accountable to their company’s audit committees. Such arrangements give compliance officers greater authority to bring potential malpractice to the attention of the company’s supervisory directors. As Mr Guyton puts it: “I have the ability to go outside the chain of command.”As the compliance role has become more demanding, companies have adapted their hiring strategies. In 2007, as the new general counsel at Siemens, Mr Solmssen faced the un­usual challenge of rebuilding a compliance function that the bribery scandal had exposed as not only impotent but, sometimes, corrupt. “The investigators uncovered one or two cases where the person paying the bribes was actually [a] compliance officer,” he says. His solution was to persuade up-and-coming talent from commercial functions, such as sales and procurement, to do a stint in compliance as part of their career development.Last year, Siemens appointed Josef Winter, previously head of German sales, as the head of compliance operations. Mr Solmssen says his deputy’s commercial background gives him “credibility” and means he can talk in language that managers understand.A more commercially engaged compliance function might also lay to rest an outcome that many businesses fear: creating an army of bureaucrats who are detached from the profit imperative. In 2004, Robert Roeder set up a compliance and ethics function at his former employer, the metal packing company Impress (now part of Ardagh Group). To win over sceptics, he says he “became a foot-soldier” and accompanied colleagues to meetings to demonstrate how he could help them comply with regulations and still make their targets. On one occasion, he advised a key supplier who was pressing for “unorthodox commercial conditions” to check the matter out with his own legal department. The next week, the supplier told him: “You were absolutely right” – it was illegal.Another outcome might be that eagerness to help their businesses might put pressure on ethics and compliance managers to become corporate stooges. Roy Snell, chief executive of the US-based Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics, says that after educating and exhorting, compliance must “find and fix” malpractice.But the skills required to isolate rotten apples are not necessarily those used in corporate audits. According to Louis Freeh, a former director of the FBI and founder of Freeh Group International Solutions, a compliance consultancy, many businesses follow scripts too rigidly rather than probing and picking up on unguarded remarks as investigators do. “A lot of companies are so process-driven that they forget the basic questions,” he says.Since its public shaming, Siemens has made a point of disclosing malpractice. Not only does it collect statistics on dismissals following compliance investigations, it publishes them in its annual report – 108 in 2010. “We will train our employees and give them all the backing they need,” says Mr Solmssen. “But if they cross the line, they know there will be consequences, which, if [the transgression] is serious, includes being fired.”It seems that compliance heads walk a tightrope – by turns trusted adviser, business partner and chief corporate cop.
306;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-05-23T19:42:18Z;Doughnuts: breaking fresh grounds;Krispy Kreme is seeking to build on growth by becoming a coffee destination;A firm selling glistening lumps of sugar and fat, perhaps unsurprisingly, hit market saturation in the US. The solution: sell more confections abroad and, back at home, move aggressively into drugs. The firm is Krispy Kreme and the drug is caffeine.Even without a cup of Joe, the earnings report delivered a jolt on Monday morning. Krispy Kreme has changed radically. The company was almost destroyed by over-expansion following its IPO in 2000, but in the last five years the number of US stores was culled by a third. Many of the remaining stores are smaller. Meanwhile, there has been a 500 per cent expansion internationally, to more than 400 franchises. The latest earnings show the pay-off. Company owned outlets (all of which are the in US) showed strong same-store growth while profits from abroad were up by a fifth year over year. The share price leapt.With the stock now trading at over 25 times this year’s earnings, the issue is growth rates in the future. The international story is humming along. But the domestic business, 60 per cent of overall store sales, has to keep expanding too. Coffee is the hope. Krispy Kreme makes 12 per cent of its sales from drinks, and only a third of that from java. Dunkin Donuts derives almost two-thirds of its US sales from beverages.Krispy Kreme has two challenges at home: customers visit infrequently and not during the middle of the day. Becoming a coffee destination would help on both fronts. And what goes better with a doughnut? The spoiler is competition. A listing of Dunkin’ Brands this year will prime its balance sheet for growth. McDonalds, and a host of other restaurant chains, also have a renewed focus on breakfast and coffee. Krispy Kreme is not the first to see the appeal of the drug trade.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
307;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-05-20T11:44:26Z;First mobile payments service launched;Orange and Barclaycard introduce phone readers to 500,000 stores;The first mobile phone payment system has been launched in the UK.Orange and Barclaycard have introduced phone readers into 50,000 stores, including Pret A Manger and McDonalds, which will allow customers to buy items of £15 or less with their phone.The contactless mobile phone payments system uses a Barclaycard reader to scan specially enabled Orange handset. The new handset will be available for sale from Friday.Customers can request sums of up to £100 to be transferred to their phone, and can then use the phone to make small purchases.So far just one handset will be available with the Near Field Communication (NFC) system, short-range wireless technology used in many wireless payment systems. The Samsung Tocco Lite phone will be available for £59.99 on pay-as-you-go or for free on pay-monthly contracts from £10 per month on 24 month contracts.Mobile phone payment is more popular overseas than in the UK, where online shopping and credit and debit cards are the preferred purchasing methods.Research agency TNS found that across the world demand for mobile banking services rose by 50 per cent. Growth was fastest in developing markets where people have leapfrogged traditional banking services in favour of accessing finance through their phones. One in five phone users in Kenya, for example, use mobile banking.David Chan, CEO of Barclaycard Consumer Europe, said the new system, dubbed QuickTouch, was secure and convenient. Phone users will be able to set a PIN on their handset and payments made will be subject to the same 100 per cent fraud guarantee as standard transactions. The firms involved hope mobile payments will become as popular as credit cards, first launched in the UK 40 years ago.However analysts say take-up of the new payments system in the UK, where consumers already use debit cards to make small payments, may be slow.O2 trialled contactless payments in Spain, allowing funds to be taken directly from a customer’s bank account. It also teamed up with Nokia to embed Oyster cards used by London commuters into a mobile phone.
308;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-05-19T18:36:54Z;McDonald’s defends Ronald as ‘ambassador for good’;;Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive, forcefully defended the company’s marketing practices on Thursday, denying the hamburger chain was pushing unhealthy food on children.McDonald’s has been under renewed pressure to overhaul advertising in the wake of a US government proposal last month asking food companies to curb marketing that entices children with products high in saturated fat, trans fat, sugars and sodium. On Wednesday, more than 600 health institutions and professionals signed a letter published in US newspapers urging McDonald’s to drop campaigns including the Ronald McDonald clown.“Ronald McDonald is going nowhere,” Mr Skinner told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting. “[He] is an ambassador of McDonald’s and he is an ambassador for good.”Corporate Accountability International, a watchdog group, has been leading the campaign against McDonald’s. At the meeting, the group helped propose a resolution that would require McDonald’s to undertake a study to assess its “health footprint” and the costs of its marketing that is targeted at children.“Advertising is at the heart of McDonald’s business model, with annual expenditures reaching $2bn,” the group wrote in its letter. “Marketing can no longer be ignored as a significant part of this massive problem.” The resolution garnered just 6 per cent approval from McDonald’s shareholders.Dr Donald Ziegler, of the American Medical Association, told Mr Skinner at the meeting: “McDonald’s and its competitors have stolen a page from Big Tobacco’s and Big Alcohol’s playbook when it comes to the marketing of a dangerous product to children. How similar are Joe Camel, the Marlboro Man, Spud McKinsey or Ronald McDonald?”Mr Skinner noted the philanthropic work that McDonald’s does through the Ronald McDonald charity and maintained that the company is offering choices to its customers, not forcing them to eat unhealthy food.“We believe in the democratic process and we play in the democratic process,” Mr Skinner said. “This is about the personal, individual right to choose.”McDonald’s has been promoting healthier options including salads, oatmeal and fruit smoothies, but critics remain unsatisfied.In spite of promises that Ronald McDonald will remain central to McDonald’s, analysts and investors have noticed the mascot is less prominent in some of its advertising and in its remodelled restaurants.Asked why the clown had been absent from recent shareholder meetings, Mr Skinner said he was busy doing noble work and could not make it in through thickets of protesters.
309;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-05-17T12:04:33Z;Human resources: power to the people;;"At the height of the recession, it took Andrew Cosslett, chief executive of InterContinental Hotels, little more than the flick of a switch to summon his 400 “knights”, the group’s top executives around the globe, for in-depth briefings a couple of times a month.A distinguishing feature of the latest recession has been the greatly increased availability of communications technology. As well as providing far more opportunities for flexible working, it has given business leaders much better access to employees, and vice versa.“Many of our general managers are very remote,” says Tracy Robbins, executive vice-president of global human resources at InterContinental. “[The briefings] helped them feel connected. Nothing took them by surprise.”The knights’ briefings were backed up with a new “Leaders’ Lounge”, an online portal launched in 2009 that enables executives to swap information, receive regular video messages from top management and access e-learning.Another key difference from previous recessions has been organisations’ attitude to their staff.Palle Ellemann, a Copenhagen-based HR consultant, says: “In the past 10-15 years, there has been a much stronger belief that organisations are people driven and that lay-offs have huge costs – not only in losing talent, but also in the trust of those that stay. At the same time, expectations of how companies act in [lay-off situations] are a lot higher. This can even be a good opportunity if all the values you talk about are proven through the crisis.”Now, as companies look to put the recession behind them and position themselves for growth, talent management is still high on the agenda.A global survey of 700 chief executives, published last month by the Conference Board, the US business research group, found that talent – how to find, keep, grow and reward it – was the second most pressing challenge; those in Asia went further, rating it their number one issue. “Talent was not even in the top seven challenges globally in the previous two surveys,” says Rebecca Ray, vice-president and managing director of human capital.Even at companies that have had to make deep cuts during the recession, the approach was more strategic, reflecting an emphasis on retaining talent, says Michael Rendell, global HR services practice leader at PwC, the consultancy. “This time there has not been wholesale slash and burn,” he says.Many companies were forced to cut or scale back graduate trainee schemes during the recession. But a few, concerned about longer-term skills shortages, kept them going.Even though it cut overall staff numbers from 300,000 to 250,000, Citi, the financial services group, barely touched its trainee programmes. This year it plans to recruit 1,800 trainees and 1,400 summer interns globally, says John Harker, head of HR for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “We did not want to denude our pipeline for the future, so we kept our presence on campus,” he says.Equally, Citi has tried to retain the skills of working mothers, part of efforts to create a family-friendly organisation. Its flexible working and “maternity buddy” initiatives, for example, have contributed to a 96 per cent return rate among new mothers.To help it attract a wider talent pool, KPMG, the accountancy firm, has opened its graduate trainee programmes to older candidates such as women returning to the workplace after starting a family. It also has schemes to attract ethnic minorities and school leavers. “We realised we needed to go further than the traditional ‘milk round’ [of recruiting on campus],” says Michelle Quest, UK head of people.Those that are not yet ready to recruit staff post-recession can still be proactive, says Claire McCartney, a resourcing adviser at the UK’s Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. “Companies can keep talent warm for the future – staying in touch so they can respond quickly,” she says. In this, new technology has helped, making it far easier to set up “alumni” groups of former employees, for example.Financial incentives still matter, but career development and training are increasingly sought by employees. “People value opportunities to [learn new skills] very strongly,” says Mr Rendell at PwC.Underwriters Laboratories, a US safety testing organisation with nearly 7,000 employees around the world, has stuck to its goal of investing 2 per cent of revenues in training. Among other things, this has demonstrated that the “commitment to training is real”, says Keith Williams, chief executive. “It has been perceived in a positive way. People feel the organisation cares about them. And it will give us advantages post-recession.”Others responded to the slowdown by bringing more training in-house and using staff who are now free to deliver courses to colleagues, often via sophisticated intranets such as InterContinental’s Leaders’ Lounge.“Learning is becoming more self-centred,” says Michael Dickmann, a professor in HR at Cranfield School of Management. “You have to be more proactive and the master of your own career. Companies can give you career opportunities but not security.”As well as job openings, KPMG’S intranet includes case studies to give staff a clearer idea of what different jobs entail. Ms Quest says the accountancy firm has also maintained global mobility programmes for top talent, an area many organisations cut during the recession.These include the “Tax Trek”, whereby newly qualified tax accountants can undertake a short placement in an overseas office, almost as a thank you for their hard work, she says, or “Go Network”, which entails longer assignments usually of 18 months to two years.More broadly, companies are becoming more adept at moving key staff from the slower growth cold spots to the hot spots in the global economy, says Mr Rendell at PwC.Such programmes require careful management, says Matt Crosby, an associate director at Hay Group, the consultancy. “They are fraught with risk. [For those posted overseas] finding a job to come back to can be difficult,” he says.The big challenge in the near term will be rebuilding trust in the workforce and finding ways to motivate jaded staff at a time when workloads have risen. In spite of signs that the economy may be returning to growth, CIPD research shows that trust in senior leaders has continued to decline this year. “There is fatigue with new initiatives after so much change,” Mr Crosby says.There also needs to be realignment – in many cases, individuals’ targets and rewards are the same as two years ago in spite of sharp shifts in corporate priorities. “A common challenge is that individuals do not understand corporate strategy and their place in it and therefore don’t see the value in what they do,” says Ms Ray at the Conference Board.Companies should give more support to line managers, she says. Among other things, they can help motivate staff through informal career chats and by recognising individual and team achievements, something that research shows people seek. “It is important to celebrate small wins,” she says.But companies also need to be more systematic about redistributing responsibilities post-recession, says Mr Rendell at PwC. “This is still an issue. Resource planning is in its infancy in many organisations.”Flexible workingSuch is the draw of flexible working that McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, allows two friends or family members employed in the same outlet in the US to cover one another’s shifts without prior notice.European employees with wanderlust can apply for a “McPassport”, enabling them to work for the chain across the continent. And those unhappy with their shift allocations can turn to “McTime”, a scheme that allows employees to manage their schedules.Staff say the policies – which have helped improve diversity – have made them prouder to work for the company.Research by PwC, the accountancy firm, last year found that nearly half of UK employees rated flexible working as the most prized benefit.In some countries, flexible working is well entrenched and backed by the state. The German government, for example, set aside €5.1bn ($2.2bn) in 2009 to support a Kurzarbeit or “short-time” working programme that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates saved almost 500,000 jobs.“The German system is geared to making reductions in staff difficult in bad times,” says Michael Dickmann, a professor in human resource management at Cranfield School of Management.KPMG introduced a version of Kurzarbeit in the UK in 2009. More than three-quarters of staff, including partners, volunteered to work a four-day week or take a sabbatical, saving the accountancy firm €4m ($6.6m) or the equivalent of 100 full-time jobs.Similar arrangements were available pre-recession, says Michelle Quest, UK head of people at KPMG, but the programme “opened people’s eyes to the possibilities”, she says.Like others, she says flexible working helps employees achieve a better work/life balance, which in turn improves productivity.More research on flexible working is needed, says Rebecca Ray, a vice-president at the Conference Board, the US business research organisation. “We need more documentation – of success stories, productivity levels and the impact on revenues.”"
310;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-05-15T19:13:06Z;McDonald’s to shake up food ordering system;;"McDonald’s is to change the way customers order its meals in Europe, partly replacing cashiers and the use of banknotes at its 7,000 fast-food restaurants in the region with touchscreen terminals and swipe cards.“Ordering food has not changed for 30 or 40 years,” said Steve Easterbrook, president of McDonald’s Europe, in an interview with the Financial Times.The move is part of the fast-food chain’s efforts to woo cash-strapped customers by making its restaurants more convenient and convivial. It is refurbishing stores, and introducing longer opening hours and new menus.At a time when many retail and consumer companies are racking up sluggish or even shrinking sales in Europe, McDonald’s like-for-like sales rose 5.7 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter – the highest growth out of its three main geographic regions.Mr Easterbrook said that the changes would make life easier for consumers as well as improve efficiency, with average transactions three to four seconds shorter for each customer. McDonald’s European stores serve 2m customers a day.Weiky Filho, a student enjoying a burger at McDonald’s in Wimbledon, London, was in favour of the changes. “You don’t need to communicate with staff and it would be much quicker,” he said.But Joe Surkitz, 21, was less convinced. “I’m looking for work and if there’s more machines doing jobs I’ll find it harder. Plus you won’t get service with a smile.”Mr Easterbrook said that the new technology would allow McDonald’s to harness more information about customers’ ordering habits. Supermarkets and other retailers have huge databases of information on customers’ shopping habits, which they gather from loyalty cards.Diners at the 1,200 McDonald’s outlets in the UK will shortly be able to pay by simply swiping a Visa debit card, just as London’s commuters can swipe their
Oyster cards at train stations.McDonald’s does not expect any reduction in staffing as a result of the changes. “In fact the business is growing so we would expect to see an increase in overall staff numbers and we’re still on track to create an additional 15,000 new jobs in Europe in 2011,” it said."
311;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
312;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Business chief says coalition could do better;;The government “could do better” on vital issues such as red tape and planning, a business leader warned the UK coalition on its first anniversary on Wednesday.Miles Templeman, director-general of the Institute of Directors, told the institute’s annual convention in London that the government had made some “bold steps”, particularly by bringing more competition into the schools system.He said: “We certainly would give it a good mark overall even if we add the classic comment of ‘could do better’.”Mr Templeman strongly supported the government’s deficit reduction strategy, but said the IoD wanted to see “a stronger and clearer-cut business orientation in its policy decisions and recognition that wealth creation is the key to achieving so many other objectives”.He said getting rid of harmful regulation and bureaucracy was “certainly an area where, despite fine words, we have yet to see real progress”.“Despite the efforts of many of us here, the government has not fully grasped the impact on smaller companies of employment law and the way in which it discourages them from taking on new staff.’”Mr Templeman said the government had also underperformed on planning, failing to improve the speed and effectiveness of the regime at local and national level.“This is fundamental to our economic progress, whether we are talking about major transport or energy projects, or local business and housing development. The government seems to recognise the problem but has not yet delivered.’’Jill McDonald, chief executive of McDonald's UK, said business had a crucial role to play in preventing a “lost generation” of unemployed young people.She complained about the “snobbery” people often attached to jobs at her company and others in the hospitality industry, where 1m new jobs were likely to be created by 2017.“With more and more employers embracing on-the-job training, we can help cut the corrosive effect of unemployment in our country. It is vital that we do, or we risk a lost generation,” she said.She said McDonald’s had created 3,000 level two apprenticeships in hospitality, with the equivalent of six full classes of employees also gaining adult certificates in English and maths every week.Ms McDonald warned that, with unemployment among 16- to 24-year-olds close to 1m, Britain was in danger of creating a long-lasting problem. She said companies had a responsibility to offer quality jobs to young people.“These young people are our potential employees and our potential customers. If they are undervalued, if they feel isolated, I think it’s bad for business,” she said.
313;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-05-09T21:50:25Z;Wall St gains muted by eurozone debt fears;;Dollar Thrifty Automotive surged after Hertz Global offered to buy the car rental company, while the wider markets advanced after deal activity and a rise in commodities outweighed concerns over the financial health of the eurozone.Dollar Thrifty bounced 13.8 per cent to $79.27 after Hertz made a $2.2bn offer for its smaller rival.The offer is a 24 per cent premium over a rival offer made by Avis Budget last September, and is 17 per cent higher than the 60-day average share price.The move comes eight months after Hertz supposedly bowed out of a battle to buy Dollar Thrifty, saying it would not seek to match a higher offer by Avis. Shares in Hertz were down 1 per cent to $16.68 while Avis gained 0.3 per cent to $18.47.In other deal action, Alkermes said it would merge with a drug technology unit of Elan, the Irish drugmaker, in a cash and stock deal valued at $960m. Shares in Alkermes rose 5 per cent to $15.19.This assorted deal activity helped encourage sentiment across Wall Street, but the biggest gains came from the energy and material sectors as commodity prices rebounded.In the energy sector, Baker Hughes rose 3.4 per cent to $71.65 while Marathon Oil added 5.3 per cent to $52.19. The S&P energy index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 7 per cent losses seen on the index last week.The S&P material sector was up 1.6 per cent, with US Steel adding 2.3 per cent to $46.67 and Newmont Mining rising 1.8 per cent to $54.69.This follows sharp losses for both of these sectors in the middle of last week as commodity prices fell sharply. On Thursday, oil prices fell more than $10 a barrel in the biggest one-day correction since the financial crisis, while other commodities such as silver and copper also lost ground.The gains in the session left the S&P 500 index up 0.5 per cent to 1,346.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 12,684.83 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,843.25.The positive impact on Wall Street was limited by concerns over peripheral eurozone finances after Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating again. It comes as European officials acknowledged that Greece’s €110bn ($157bn) rescue package a year ago was insufficient and further help would be needed.On Friday the US markets were sent lower after rumours that Greece was in talks to exit the single currency. “Lingering sovereign debt concerns” could cause “additional volatility as the week progresses”, said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The downgrade news worried the financial sector, and the S&P financial index lost 0.2 per cent – the worst performing sector on Wall Street.Bank of America was down 1.1 per cent to $12.18 while Fifth Third Bancorp lost 1.5 per cent to $12.80.Elsewhere in the sector, Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent to $44.16 after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.Citigroup is the most actively traded stock in the US and the move helped bring about a relatively low-volume session.Elsewhere on Wall Street, homebuilding stocks were weighed down by worrying data showing that in the last few months US house prices suffered their largest drop in over two yearsAccording to figures from Zillow.com, the real estate website, home values fell 3 per cent in the first three months of 2011 from the previous quarter, and 1.1 per cent in March from the previous month. Prices have fallen for 57 consecutive months, according to Zillow.The news, a further sign that the US housing market is a long way from recovery, left shares in Lennar down 1.4 per cent to $18.28. Elsewhere in the homebuilding sector, DR Hortonwas 1 per cent lower at $11.81 while PulteGroupfell 2.1 per cent to $7.79.The S&P homebuilders index was down 1.5 per cent. The sector is 80 per cent lower than its pre-crisis peak.In other news, McDonald’s advanced 0.8 per cent to $79.31 after reporting that its same-store sales had risen 6 per cent in April, the biggest monthly increase since October.Tyson Foods was down 5.9 per cent to $17.77 after the world’s largest meat producer reported flat second-quarter earnings, as higher feed costs offset improving demand and higher meat prices.
314;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-05-09T13:59:34Z;Apple surges to top of BrandZ ranking;;"Apple has overtaken Google to become the world’s most valuable brand with an estimated brand value of more than $153bn, according to new rankings published today.For the last four years, Google has dominated the BrandZ Top100 ranking of the most valuable global brands, compiled by Millward Brown, a subsidiary of advertising company WPP. The ranking covers everything from cars to clothing and banks to telecoms providers.Thanks to the success of the iPad tablet and iPhone mobile – among both consumers and corporations – Apple’s brand value has surged in the last year to overtake that of the search engine company.Apple has increased its brand value by $137bn or 859 per cent since 2006, when the BrandZ rankings were launched. The brand valuation compares with Apple’s stock market capitalisation of $323.27bn, which is nearly five times higher than in 2006.The BrandZ index calculates brand value on a number of factors, including a valuation of intangible assets, measures of customer perception and an estimate of growth potential.Peter Walshe, global BrandZ director at Millward Brown, said Apple’s success reflected the fact that its products were not only highly desired by consumers but also seen by companies as useful.“The anecdotal evidence is that if employees are given the choice of two similar jobs they opt for the one with better technology for its employees – for example an iPad,” Mr Walshe said.Apple, he added, had also succeeded in emulating luxury good brands, in that making its products more expensive had increased their desirability.The brand rankings are dominated by technology companies, with six out of the top 10 places occupied by Apple, Google, IBM, Microsoft, AT&T and China Mobile. McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Marlboro and GE were the only “heritage” brands to make the top 10.“Technology has engaged people on all levels to make their lives simpler, cheaper, faster and more enjoyable, which is why technology companies enjoy so much brand recognition,” Mr Walshe said.Facebook was a new entry into the top 100 list this year, coming straight in at number 35. The company has become easier to value in the past year following sales of equity to investors including Goldman Sachs.Nokia’s brand, meanwhile, has lost 28 per cent of its value and is now at number 81 in the rankings. Its brand value is estimated at $10.7bn, a fraction of Apple’s. Dell, the PC manufacturer, meanwhile, lost its place in the Top 100 list this year.Overall, the value of the top 100 brands rose 17 per cent to $2,400bn in the 2011 ranking, underlining the message from brand experts that big names emerge from a recession stronger than their smaller rivals.A notable exception was BP, which suffered a 27 per cent fall in brand value as a result of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. But Cristiana Pearson, a director at Millward Brown Optimor, said: “We have seen brands go down a lot more in one year than that, so if we take that into consideration, BP is a strong brand, the brand itself has held up, this is financial, it’s mainly driven by market cap as well as the financials.”Nick Cooper, MBO’s managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa, pointed out that, according to BrandZ consumer research, the further east one goes from the Gulf of Mexico, the less impact the oil spill has had.“We saw a lot of reaction from the US, which obviously is a huge market for BP; there was a slightly more muted reaction in the UK, a lesser reaction in Europe and in Asia, really it was ripples on the surface in comparison with what happened in the US.” he said.“It was almost business as usual for a lot of BP’s markets and, while it was divesting here, there and everywhere to pay for what happened, in a lot of its fast growing emerging markets it is relatively unaffected.”The oil and gas group can also take heart from the perfomance of Toyota in the latest rankings. After seeing its brand value fall 27 per cent in the 2010 ranking in the wake of the recall saga, to which its initial response was hesitant at best, the car group recovered 11 per cent of its brand value this time and regained top spot in the Cars category.“They were slow in getting off the mark, but finally, when they did it, they did it very, very well indeed,” said Mr Walshe. “They were also helped by the fact that all of the inquiries from government and safety officials exonerated them, saying that really it’s nothing to do with technical electrical problems within the car; most of the accidents were unfortunate and to do with driver error.“There is a lot of history that says if a strong, distinctive brand deals with problems clearly, honestly, responsibly and quickly, it has a much better chance of recovering.”"

The ranking covers everything from cars to clothing and banks to telecoms providers.Thanks to the success of the iPad tablet and iPhone mobile – among both consumers and corporations – Apple’s brand value has surged in the last year to overtake that of the search engine company.Apple has increased its brand value by $137bn or 859 per cent since 2006, when the BrandZ rankings were launched. The brand valuation compares with Apple’s stock market capitalisation of $323.27bn, which is nearly five times higher than in 2006.The BrandZ index calculates brand value on a number of factors, including a valuation of intangible assets, measures of customer perception and an estimate of growth potential.Peter Walshe, global BrandZ director at Millward Brown, said Apple’s success reflected the fact that its products were not only highly desired by consumers but also seen by companies as useful.“The anecdotal evidence is that if employees are given the choice of two similar jobs they opt for the one with better technology for its employees – for example an iPad,” Mr Walshe said.Apple, he added, had also succeeded in emulating luxury good brands, in that making its products more expensive had increased their desirability.The brand rankings are dominated by technology companies, with six out of the top 10 places occupied by Apple, Google, IBM, Microsoft, AT&T and China Mobile. McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Marlboro and GE were the only “heritage” brands to make the top 10.“Technology has engaged people on all levels to make their lives simpler, cheaper, faster and more enjoyable, which is why technology companies enjoy so much brand recognition,” Mr Walshe said.Facebook was a new entry into the top 100 list this year, coming straight in at number 35. The company has become easier to value in the past year following sales of equity to investors including Goldman Sachs.Nokia’s brand, meanwhile, has lost 28 per cent of its value and is now at number 81 in the rankings. Its brand value is estimated at $10.7bn, a fraction of Apple’s. Dell, the PC manufacturer, meanwhile, lost its place in the Top 100 list this year.Overall, the value of the top 100 brands rose 17 per cent to $2,400bn in the 2011 ranking, underlining the message from brand experts that big names emerge from a recession stronger than their smaller rivals.A notable exception was BP, which suffered a 27 per cent fall in brand value as a result of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. But Cristiana Pearson, a director at Millward Brown Optimor, said: “We have seen brands go down a lot more in one year than that, so if we take that into consideration, BP is a strong brand, the brand itself has held up, this is financial, it’s mainly driven by market cap as well as the financials.”Nick Cooper, MBO’s managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa, pointed out that, according to BrandZ consumer research, the further east one goes from the Gulf of Mexico, the less impact the oil spill has had.“We saw a lot of reaction from the US, which obviously is a huge market for BP; there was a slightly more muted reaction in the UK, a lesser reaction in Europe and in Asia, really it was ripples on the surface in comparison with what happened in the US.” he said.“It was almost business as usual for a lot of BP’s markets and, while it was divesting here, there and everywhere to pay for what happened, in a lot of its fast growing emerging markets it is relatively unaffected.”The oil and gas group can also take heart from the perfomance of Toyota in the latest rankings. After seeing its brand value fall 27 per cent in the 2010 ranking in the wake of the recall saga, to which its initial response was hesitant at best, the car group recovered 11 per cent of its brand value this time and regained top spot in the Cars category.“They were slow in getting off the mark, but finally, when they did it, they did it very, very well indeed,” said Mr Walshe. “They were also helped by the fact that all of the inquiries from government and safety officials exonerated them, saying that really it’s nothing to do with technical electrical problems within the car; most of the accidents were unfortunate and to do with driver error.“There is a lot of history that says if a strong, distinctive brand deals with problems clearly, honestly, responsibly and quickly, it has a much better chance of recovering.”"
316;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;PepsiCo questions Fed inflation guide;;PepsiCo’s chief financial officer has criticised US policymakers’ focus on “core” inflation, arguing that it overlooks the impact of rising prices on consumer spending power.The Federal Reserve’s preference for the core price measure that excludes food and energy has stirred controversy as commodity price rises have accelerated and companies have had to judge how much they can pass on costs to hard-pressed consumers.“It’s a big exclusion,” Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s chief financial officer, said in an interview with the Financial Times. “The reality right now is that food and fuel are quite inflationary.”Food prices have climbed nearly 3 per cent in the past year and petrol prices have increased nearly 30 per cent, according to the labour department’s latest consumer price index.During the same period, “core prices” rose 1.2 per cent.PepsiCo, with its $60bn snacks and drinks portfolio, has a privileged insight into the state of consumer sentiment around the world.According to Mr Johnston, consumers who earn less than $70,000 per year are continuing to struggle and face the greatest threat from inflation.“The unemployment rate is inching down but disposable income is not growing much,” Mr Johnston said, explaining that efforts to inject liquidity into the US economy were not yet creating significant growth.The Fed argues that core prices are a better guide to underlying price pressures in the economy and therefore to future inflation – if it responded to headline prices, then it would have been forced to raise interest rates sharply in 2008 just as the economy was going into recession. But it has struggled to communicate this argument. During an event in Queens, New York, last month, William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was heckled when trying to explain the disconnect between food prices and other prices.One member of his audience questioned when he last visited a grocery store and another asked if an iPad – which he argued was getting more powerful for the same price – was edible.Restaurants are also feeling the commodity price crunch. Last week, McDonald’s said it raised prices in March and that it would continue to do so later this year as smaller cattle herds and a weak US dollar raised its beef costs.Although PepsiCo, whose food business includes Frito-Lay and Quaker, forecasts commodity inflation of 8 to 9.5 per cent this year, it has resisted passing most of this on to customers.“We don’t price to cover all of it because the sticker shock would be too significant,” Mr Johnston said.PepsiCo is due to release its first-quarter results on Thursday.
317;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s warns on commodity inflation;;McDonald’s, the US fast food restaurant chain, said on Thursday that rising commodity prices ate into its profit margins in the first quarter and that the company expects consumer spending to remain stuck at the depressed levels of the last few years.The company raised its prices by 1 per cent in March and expects “away from home” food prices to rise by up to 4.5 per cent this year in the US. Additional increases are expected later this year, depending on trajectory of food and energy prices.“We are seeing cost increases on virtually every item in our basket, with beef accounting for about a third of the additional increase,” Peter Bensen, McDonald’s chief financial officer, said in a call with analysts.Commodity prices have been a growing concern for food companies, which have had to weigh how much of the costs they can pass to consumers. Jim Skinner, the company’s chief executive, said it was resisting further price increases and absorbing the additional costs.“They get pinched everywhere, they should not suffer the same fate at McDonald’s,” Mr Skinner said of his customers.Concerns over inflation sent shares of McDonald’s down nearly 2 per cent to $76.97 in midday trading on Thursday in spite of an 11 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.Net income at McDonald’s rose to $1.2bn, or $1.15 a share, in the first three months of the year, up from $1.09bn, or $1 a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Overall revenues at McDonald’s grew by 9 per cent to $6.1bn.McDonald’s has been aggressively refurbishing its 32,000 restaurants worldwide and looking to add healthier options to its menu amid growing concerns about obesity. The company has also been working to polish its image as an employer, earlier this month announcing that it would spend an additional $518m this year to hire 50,000 workers in one day in the US.In the US, where comparable store sales rose by 2.9 per cent, the company said its fruit and maple oatmeal and McCafe offerings were top sellers. However, customers continued to consume less healthy options too, including the 20-piece chicken McNuggets and the BBQ bacon angus hamburger.US sales were weaker than those in Europe and Asia, where they rose by 5.7 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively. Same-store sales in China were up by 6.5 per cent after climbing by 1.4 per cent in the same quarter a year ago.McDonald’s said that austerity measures in Europe did not appear to be having an impact on the appetites of its customers.On Wednesday, rival Yum! Brands, which owns brands such as KFC and Pizza Hut, said its first quarter profits jumped by 10 per cent thanks to an 18 per cent rise in its sales in China.
318;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-04-14T13:49:52Z;Boost for Brazil’s ‘golden arches’;;"Arcos Dorados, the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee, sold $1.25bn worth of shares in a US initial public offering and the most successful Latin American flotation since the financial crisis.Arcos Dorados– or “Golden Arches” – generates 5.1 per cent of McDonald’s sales worldwide. It operates primarily in Brazil and Argentina, and is the largest of any Latin American fast-food chain.In its offering, it sold more shares than expected, 73.5m, at $17 a share, above its projected range of $13 to $15. It was the first Latin America-based group to sell shares above its range since mid-2007. Investors, primarily US hedge funds, flocked to the company as an entry point for the emerging consumer class in Brazil. The shares will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.Woods Staton, chief executive, who has been working with McDonald’s in Latin America since 1982, took the company on a three-week global roadshow in the lead-up to the IPO. He also purchased about 2m shares in the offering.The sale continues a surge in US public offerings, which enjoyed the best first quarter since 2008, a nearly 200 per cent gain over the first quarter last year. US investors added $2.8bn in assets to mutual funds invested in non-US companies in the week ending April 6, according to the Investment Company Institute, the best flow since December. The sale was managed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Itaú BBA and Citigroup.ZipCar, the web-based hourly car rental group, also priced an IPO on Wednesday after the market close, raising $170m in a sale of 9.5m shares – more than initially offered – at $18 a share. That was above the projected range of $14 to $16 a share. The sale was managed by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.Demand for growth companies, especially in technology and consumer services, has been strong in the US this year, in addition to demand for large established groups such as Arcos Dorados and previously successful IPOs such as Kinder Morgan, HCA and Nielsen. Demand Media, the web content creation group, sold shares above its range in January, though they have since declined. Qihoo 360, a Chinese internet company, which sold shares in the US in March, saw a 134 per cent jump in price in the first day of trading.Also on Wednesday, MGM Resorts International, the casino group, said a 20 per cent stake in its Macau casino joint venture would be sold via an IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. MGM will have 51 per cent stake; the proceeds will go to its partner, Pansy Ho, the real estate developer, who will retain a 29 per cent stake.MGM, by boosting its stake to 51 per cent from its previous 50-50 arrangement with Ms Ho, will have management control of the group, called MGM China Holdings Limited, and allow it to include the fast-growing resort’s results in its own financial reports.Ms Ho is in a dispute with her father, Stanley Ho, the Hong Kong tycoon, over ownership of his casino groups. MGM was forced to abandon its hotels in New Jersey because the state’s gambling commission found Ms Ho to be an “unsuitable” business partner because of her father, who is accused of having ties to organised crime. Mr Ho has denied any such ties."
319;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-04-08T16:40:32Z;Towering example of endorsement;;At 6ft 8”, LeBron James stands head and shoulders above the other stars of US sport.With annual earnings from endorsements alone of more than $40m from a range of sponsors that includes McDonald’s and Coca-Cola, Mr James also packs a financial punch few can match.His biggest deal is with Nike, which has had a relationship with the 25 year-old since 2003, when it signed the then teenager to a seven-year contract worth $90m.In Mr James, Nike saw the perfect replacement for Michael Jordan, the Chicago Bulls star who propelled the company to global recognition and success simply by wearing its shoes on the basketball court.Adidas and Reebok also courted Mr James but Nike won his signature after presenting him with a ready-made shoe bearing his name and a short commercial made by Spike Lee.Since then, he has blossomed into the most exciting player of his generation, with one of the most fearsome dunk shots in the sport.But he has yet to win a national title. This was the motivation behind his move last year from his home town team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, to the much better equipped Miami Heat.He agonised over the switch for weeks, entertaining offers from teams in New York and Chicago. He even received personal pleas from, among others, Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, such is his appeal.Fenway Sports Group will hope some of that stardust translates into financial success for Liverpool Football Club. “LeBron is more than just a great athlete, he’s a brand,” says Paul Wachter, who advises the star on finance and investments.Basketball players have more clout than other sports stars, he adds, and there is no bigger star than Mr James. “Basketball is different. It’s cool, it appeals to kids and there are only five guys on the court. It has a natural appeal for endorsement.”
320;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-04-08T01:56:59Z;Mondi in South African spin-off;;Mondi, Europe’s leading supplier of office paper, is to spin off its South African packaging division, moving it further away from its origins as a subsidiary of mining group Anglo American.David Hathorn, chief executive of Mondi, said: “MPSA [Mondi Packaging South Africa] is unique within the group as no other part of Mondi produces rigid plastics or cartonboard and therefore the board felt that MPSA would be best placed to take advantage of the considerable opportunities available to it as an independent entity.”MPSA generated revenues of R5.7bn (£523m, $855m) in 2010 and accounted for between 8 and 10 per cent of net income for the Mondi Group, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The complicated spin-off plan will involve shareholders in Mondi's South African quoted vehicle, Mondi Ltd, receiving shares in Mondi Group and the newly-listed MPSA.South African shareholders would be “treated equally but not identically” to those in London, Mondi said.Mondi owns 70 per cent of MPSA. The Shanduka Group, a black empowerment investment company led by former ANC activist and union leader Cyril Ramaphosa, controls a quarter of MPSA.The spin-off will involve the recapitalisation of MPSA, which will dilute to 10 per cent Shanduka’s stake, acquired under the terms of Anglo American’s divestment of Mondi.Shanduka, which recently struck a long-term deal to become the master franchisee for US fast-food group McDonald’s, will be held to a 180-day lock-in on its remaining investment in the group.Mondi, which is dual-listed in London and Johannesburg, said it expected the demerger of MPSA to have a “material effect on the price of Mondi Group’s securities” and advised investors to “exercise caution” until further details were fixed.A recovery in Mondi’s share price, as a result of an improvement in sentiment towards the paper and packaging company’s core exposure to central Europe and Russia, made it an outside candidate for promotion to the FTSE 100 index earlier this year.Shares in Mondi closed down 11p at 596p, valuing its total equity at £3.09bn.
321;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Unilever in ‘dim sum’ bond move;;"Unilever is set to become the first European multinational to launch an offshore renminbi-denominated “dim sum” bond when it raises Rmb300m ($46m) from institutional investors in Hong Kong on Monday, bankers say.Dim sum bonds are slowly gaining traction with multinationals, virtually all of which have growing Chinese operations. McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, became the first US issuer last August when it raised Rmb200m. Caterpillar, the US-based manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, followed with a Rmb1bn bond in November.Unilever, which is also expected to be among the first clutch of foreigners to list renminbi-denominated A shares in Shanghai once the regulatory framework is in place, will hope the move demonstrates its commitment to China. In addition to backing the nascent dim sum bond market, issuers are supporting Beijing’s ultimate aim of internationalising the so-called red-back. The more foreign private sector issuers, as opposed to bodies like the Asian Development Bank, issue the bonds, the greater the credibility in the offshore market, bankers say.The move comes as Unilever plays catch-up to US-based rival Procter & Gamble, which has stolen a march on it in China. Consultants in China attribute Procter & Gamble’s stronger positioning to its early start and hefty investment in everything from advertising to distribution.But Unilever, which has revenues in excess of €1bn ($1.4bn) in China, is fighting back with beefed-up spending on research and development as well as consumer insights.Dim sum bonds have raised $1.3bn so far this year, according to Dealogic, more than $1bn of which was tapped by Chinese issuers. But issuers from other countries are starting to dip in; Orix, the financial services company, became Japan’s first issuer earlier this month.Bankers say the coupon on Unilever’s bond, which will be finalised on Monday, will be “very competitive”. Caterpillar paid 2 per cent for its bond and McDonald’s 3 per cent. Unilever, like fellow issuers, has sizeable renminbi outgoings, but these are more than covered by income. However, bankers say, the deal is seen as being less about securing reasonably priced funds than winning stripes in Beijing for good corporate citizenship. Backing by a multinational should help stimulate further interest in the dim sum bond market, one of the core components in Beijing’s ambitious plan to internationalise the Chinese currency.Foreign issuers have not been rushing to tap the market largely because the renminbi cannot be freely converted.Strict regulations control the flow of the currency between mainland China and Hong Kong, making transfers for investment cumbersome. Most foreign issuance in the market since its creation in 2007 has come from banks and their Chinese subsidiaries."
322;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-03-27T19:30:00Z;Met under fire over protest tactics;;A senior Metropolitan Police officer has defended the policing of Saturday’s anti-cuts demonstration in London amid mounting criticism of his force for failing to protect West End businesses from a minority of violent protesters.Commander Bob Broadhurst of the Metropolitan Police told the Financial Times there would be dozens of arrests following damage to shops and hotels in the busy shopping and entertainment district.Westminster city council said the cost of lost business alone would exceed the £5m tally racked up after the May day protests in 2002, before repairs and cleaning.Mr Broadhurst said n addition to 202 arrests this weekend, investigators were studying video footage and treating every damaged property as a crime scene.“I would expect the number arrested to rise quite significantly,” he said, adding that up to 500 “anarchists” had participated in violence, alongside more than 250,000 peaceful demonstrators. “Many were not masked and don’t seem to care [about being identified]. We’ll catch up with quite a lot of them.”Some retailers complained that more should have been done to protect banks, clothing shops and food outlets identified in advance by protesters. Jace Tyrrell, spokesman for the New West End Company, which represents retailers, said: “We need to speak to our members to understand the damage and cost. And we will talk to the police to understand what was successful and what lessons can be learnt.”Mr Broadhurst defended the deployment of 4,500 officers, nearly the number at the Notting Hill Carnival, and said 16 police had needed hospital attention after defending targets such as Topshop.But he said the “hit-and- run” tactics of a minority intent on criminal damage made it impossible to defend all premises. “Without our plan, I’m certain there would have been widespread damage across a large swathe of London,” he said. “We would never have enough officers to protect every building in London.He praised the official demonstration, which “showed you can protest peacefully”. That was the result of co-operation between the TUC and the police, which he said had adopted social communication techniques including Twitter and texting.While some commentators called for more pre-emptive action to arrest potential demonstrators, Mr Broadhurst said it was difficult to take action based on “threats on Facebook”, and anyone arrested in advance is likely to have been swiftly released on bail, provoking further action.Brian Connell, Westminster council’s cabinet member for business, said the West End attracted 400,000 people every Saturday, and the fact the area was closed to public transport would mean “a serious financial impact” on emptier shops – a further blow for the UK’s beleaguered retail sector.Shops most severely affected including Topshop, owned by Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group, and Fortnum & Mason in Piccadilly, were back open on Sunday.Branches of McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, and banks HSBC and Santander were also attacked.
323;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-03-27T09:17:22Z;Extremists attack London shops and banks;;Several buildings were damaged in central London on the sidelines of Saturday’s anti-cuts protest, with banks including branches of Santander, HSBC and Lloyds TSB, as well as other businesses such as McDonald's targeted by breakaway groups of protesters.Fortnum & Mason, the smart department store on Piccadilly, and the shops in front of the Ritz hotel on the same street, were also targeted, with people smashing windows and damaging produce on sale. Some two dozen protesters occupied the roof of the shop’s front entrance and some of the departments inside for more than an hour.As darkness fell, Metropolitan Police deployed their controversial containment tactic, kettling, outside Fortnum & Mason.Officers made nine arrests during the afternoon – all for criminal damage, threatening behaviour or intent to cause criminal damage. Five officers were injured, with one requiring hospitalisation, while 27 protesters were injured.The first scuffle occurred at Oxford Circus at 1.45pm when protesters attacked a Topshop store. Paint and smoke grenades were thrown at police and the store’s facade, cracking several windows.The police, who closed Topshop, said ammonia-filled light bulbs were thrown at officers on Oxford Street. These protesters were heavily outnumbered by the usual weekend mix of tourists and shoppers, some of whom were hit by paint fired at the shop.UK Uncut, a direct action group opposing corporate tax avoidance, was thought to be behind many of the attacks on shops, including the occupation of Fortnum & Mason. Members of the group waved black and red flags from the window above the retailer’s ubiquitous green and white clock.The group accuses Associated British Foods, which is 54 per cent controlled by Fortnum & Mason’s owner Whittington Investments, of avoiding £40m of tax.The Ritz was also attacked by protesters wearing balaclavas and hooded tops, shattering windows and throwing yellow and purple paint.As most of the protesters occupying Oxford Circus made their way towards Piccadilly, a small group of young people, dressed in black hooded tops with scarves pulled over their mouths, let off coloured flares and smoke bombs in the centre of the road.Riot police had largely left the scene when one group set fire to an 8ft high model horse they had brought with them to the march. Students claimed the “Trojan horse” signified the betrayal of the Liberal Democrats rescinded promise not to raise university fees.Branches of HSBC and a McDonald’s at Cambridge Circus were also attacked, with several protesters breaking in before riot police arrived.
324;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-03-16T18:24:16Z;India’s youth savour fast-food chains;;It is lunchtime and the McDonald’s at Mumbai’s Phoenix Mills – a textile factory turned upmarket shopping complex – is slowly filling up with college students, mothers and office workers.Among them is Akshaya Batta, 30, who grabs lunch at McDonald’s or Subway, at least once a week, rather than carry a packed lunch from home, as many Indians still routinely do. “This is like a snack to fill your tummy, not to satisfy your tastes,” says the marketing executive, as he tucks into a Fillet-O-Fish, fries and a Coke. “I don’t have a desk job – I can’t move around with a tiffin [lunchbox], so whenever I’m hungry and I see a McDonald’s, I stop.”When western fast-food chains such as McDonald’s, Domino’s Pizza and KFC initially opened their doors in India in the mid-1990s, they struggled to compete with spicy street food and the elaborate home-cooked meals Indian women regularly prepared for their families.But more hectic schedules, rising incomes and demographic realities – about 60 per cent of Indians are under 30 years old – have created new appetites among Indian consumers.Now, sales at western fast-food chains, and local rivals, are taking off, growing at an average of 28 per cent a year, as dining out moves from being a special occasion, to a routine part of Indians’ busier schedules.Indians spent an estimated $1.3bn on dining out in “chain restaurants” in 2009, of which about 400m was accounted for by fast food, according to research group Euromonitor.It is not just India’s biggest urban agglomerations, but smaller, second-tier cities where such restaurants are finding growing favour.“Whatever a guy anywhere in the world wants, a guy in India wants that as well,” said Amit Jatia, vice-chairman of McDonald’s India – south and west. “The consumer is beginning to recognise that quick-service restaurants mean quality and value for money.”Domino’s Pizza is growing at a blistering pace, with 364 outlets in 55 cities, all run by Domino’s Indian franchisee, Jubilant Foodworks, in New Delhi.Jubilant, which raised $71m in an initial public offering last year, increased sales by 61 per cent from April to December, compared to the previous year, buoyed by 54 new stores opened in the period.“The Indian market has been growing and evolving at a very fast pace,” says Hari Bhartia, Jubilant Foodworks co-chairman.Last month, US-based Dunkin’ Donuts, owned by the private equity firms Carlyle Group, Thomas H. Lee and Bain, announced a partnership with Jubilant to bring its deep-fried products to India.Subway is also gaining popularity in India, with 199 outlets, and Starbucks is gearing up for an Indian market launch this year.Hardcastle Restaurants, one of two Indian partners to McDonald’s, is buying out the US hamburger chain’s stake in the 50-50 joint venture that operates the chain in southern and western India, paving the way for accelerated expansion. Hardcastle aims to open 30 McDonald’s outlets this year. “It’s getting competitive,” said Mr Jatia.Western fast-food brands have gone through a tough learning process to cater to Indian tastes.Traditional menus were spiced up, vegetarian options enhanced, and low price, entry-level items developed to make the restaurants more accessible in a highly price-sensitive market.Such efforts have won the loyalties of consumers such as Sahal Amlani, 30, a store manager, who spends at least Rs50 ($1.10) on an afternoon snack at McDonald’s twice a week, and treats his wife, and one-year-old son to a McDonald’s meal, spending up to Rs300, every weekend.“My child likes French fries so much, and even my wife has a desire to go out and have some junk food,” he says.While fast-food chains have finally adapted their recipes to local tastes, they face other trials.Finding suitable real estate in crowded Indian cities is difficult. “Real estate is the single biggest challenge,” said Mr Jatia.Indian rivals also pose stiff competition. Café Coffee Day, a coffee chain based in Bangalore, has around 1,000 outlets, and a range of food offerings.Near McDonald’s at Phoenix Mills, cheery food stalls like Dosa Hut, On a Roll, Thai Chi, do brisk business serving up Indian and Asian dishes – which for many Indians are still more appealing than spiced up versions of Western fare.“Indian food is far safer and healthier if you eat on the street,” says Charu Gargi, 48, a film-maker, as she tucked into a south Indian lunch with friends.“They make it fresh, and I don’t want to have so many preservatives.”
325;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-03-08T22:08:06Z;Wall Street rises as oil fears ease;;Boeing gained ground after the group signed a multibillion-dollar deal with two airlines in China while US equities bounced back from recent losses as oil prices softened.The aerospace and defence company announced a deal to sell 43 large passenger jets worth up to $10bn to two Chinese airlines.Air China, the country’s flag-carrier, agreed to buy five of Boeing’s new 747-8 Intercontinental jets while Hong Kong Airlines placed a preliminary order for 38 planes.The news came just weeks after Boeing secured a $35bn deal to supply the US Air Force with refuelling aircraft, beating its European rival EADS.Its shares were up 1.6 per cent to $72.04, adding to the 8.6 per cent gains since the start of the year.Elsewhere in the sector, Lockheed Martin was up 1.2 per cent to $80.27 while United Technologies rose 1.2 per cent to $83.26. The S&P aerospace and defence sector was up 1.6 per cent.The S&P 500 index was up 0.9 per cent at 1,321.82 as the oil price fell on news that key oil producing nations were boosting their production to make up for lost supply out of Libya.The S&P 500 is still down 1.6 per cent since its mid-February highs on fears that elevated oil prices caused by the troubles in North Africa and the Middle East could damage the domestic economic recovery.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent to 12,214.46 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7 per cent to 2,765.77.Some strategists argued that this rally for US equities would be short-lived as turmoil in the oil markets looked set to continue.“While we might have a day or two of stable or falling oil prices, the situation in North Africa and the Middle East is far from over,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “Oil prices are likely to climb higher, which in turn will put further short term pressure of equities.”Financial and industrial stocks were some of the chief beneficiaries of the upturn in risk appetite in the session.General Electric added 1.2 per cent to $20.62 while 3M put on 1.5 per cent to $93.75. The S&P industrial index was up 1.5 per cent.Financial stocks saw even sharper gains with the S&P sub-index adding 2.2 per cent. PNC Financial Services gained 4.4 per cent to $63.37 while Zions Bancorporation rose 2.9 per cent to $23.14.Bank of America added 4.7 per cent to $14.69, helped by comments from Brian Moynihan, chief executive, at the bank’s first investor day conference since 2007.Mr Moynihan said he believed the bank had the ability to earn between $35bn and $40bn a year in pre-tax earnings when the business normalises, a figure significantly higher than any earnings reported in the past 15 years.The bank lost $1.3bn in 2010 and earned $4.4bn pre-tax in 2008 and 2009. In 2007, it earned $20.9bn, in 2006 $32bn and in 2005 $24.5bn.Mr Moynihan also said that the bank had no intentions of making any more acquisitions and instead would focus on returning “every dollar” in capital to shareholders through regular dividends, share buy-backs and special cash dividends.Only the energy sector lost ground in the session due to the lower oil prices.Marathon Oil was down 2.4 per cent to $50.18 while Conocophillips, another oil company, was down 1.1 per cent to $78.32. The S&P energy sector lost 0.6 per cent, although it is still up 13 per cent over the year.In corporate news, shares in Urban Outfitters lost ground after the retailer reported fourth-quarter sales and profit that fell short of expectations.The company reported earnings per share of 45 cents, falling short of the 52 cents expected on Wall Street. Its shares tumbled 16.7 per cent to $31.66.Analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note: “[Urban Outfitters is] a great long-term growth story but we are still more guarded on the near-term, given uncompelling valuation . . . risks of higher sourcing costs, and potential difficulty navigating through fashion shifts.”Elsewhere in the retail sector, Casey’s General Stores fell 7 per cent to $37.71 after reporting third-quarter earnings of 37 cents a share, falling short of the 49 cents a share expected by Wall Street.McDonald’s reported that same-store sales had risen by 3.9 per cent worldwide in February. This was ahead of expectations but its shares were down 1 per cent to $75.55 after like-for-like sales growth in US fell short of forecasts.
326;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-03-08T17:20:28Z;Mongolia: steppe change;Call for restraint is right, but achieving a better balance of growth is harder;"Ulan Bator doesn’t have a McDonald’s, but it does have a Louis Vuitton. So intense has been the rush to dig up its coal, gold and base metals that Mongolia has skipped a few stages of modernisation.Prime Minister Sukhbaatar Batbold is smart to call for restraint, as he did on Tuesday. The recent convulsions in this landlocked republic are consistent with an outbreak of Dutch disease, in which a country’s resources sector booms at the expense of almost everything else. Mongolia’s gross domestic product growth of 9.5 per cent this year is perhaps Asia’s fastest. It also has surging consumer price inflation: 12 per cent last year, and Standard & Poor’s estimates perhaps 20 per cent in 2011. The current account deficit may top 10 per cent of GDP, beaten only by mineral-rich Papua New Guinea. Mongolia even has the world’s best-performing stock market – up 138 per cent last year, it has almost doubled again already this year – and some of the most expensive rentals in Asia.Diagnosing the symptoms is the easy part, though; achieving a better balance of growth is a lot harder. Rival export industries such as cashmere, leather goods and metal processing will be damaged by the strength of the tugrik, which is up 16 per cent against the dollar since the beginning of 2010. China’s panda-hug, meanwhile, looks irresistible. Last year 36 per cent of its coking coal imports came from Mongolia, more than double the share of 2009.More exploitation surely awaits: just 27 per cent of Mongolia’s 1.6m sq km – the size of Western Europe – has been geologically mapped. For investors, it’s the “ultimate resource play,” as Macquarie puts it. But for people who actually live there, it’s far from fun and games.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
327;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-03-08T14:37:17Z;International demand boosts McDonald’s;;McDonald’s, the US fast food chain, said on Tuesday that its international restaurants led strong sales growth in February, as consumers in Europe and Asia were lured by expanded menu offerings.Comparable store sales at McDonald’s rose by 3.9 per cent in February from the same month a year ago – weaker than Wall Street analysts were expecting and slower than the same month a year ago, when sales climbed by 4.8 per cent.Last month, sales were driven by a 5.1 per cent jump in Europe and a 4 per cent increase in Asia. US same-store sales rose by a more modest 2.7 per cent.“McDonald’s commitment to connecting with customers around the world continues to drive our sales performance,” Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive, said in a statement.On Monday, Subway, the US sandwich shop chain, overtook McDonald’s as the world’s largest restaurant chain by units, with 34,225 in 95 countries. McDonald’s had 32,737 at the end of last year.The company said on Tuesday it is committed to expanding its McCafé options in the US to make the chain a “beverage” destination and that there has been strong appetite for its healthier options such as oatmeal.McDonald’s is also becoming increasingly competitive with Starbucks, as it has improved its coffee and drinks offerings and invested in modernising its restaurants.In January the company said that rising commodity prices could compel McDonald’s to raise prices in 2011.European sales were fuelled by a premium beef campaign in France and the launch of the “Big Tasty” promotion in the UK. Japan and Australia led sales in Asia, which were held back by slower sales in China due to the Chinese New Year holiday.Shares of McDonald’s slipped by 0.17 per cent to $76.16 in pre-market trading in New York.
328;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-03-07T22:45:07Z;Wall St gives up gains amid global uncertainty;;Shares in Starbucks ticked higher after a rating upgrade and comments from its chief executive officer about future acquisitions. But the wider markets endured another day of losses due to the ever-growing turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO, said he expected the coffee chain to make “a number of acquisitions” as part of its expansion into the single-cup, home-brewing market.“We are building and investing in resources and people to build a significant consumer products business that over time will rival the size and scale of our retail company,” Mr Schultz told the Wall Street Journal.Morgan Stanley also upgraded the coffee chain to “overweight” from “equal weight” with a $40 price target, saying it was optimistic about the company’s plans to enter the “rapidly growing $3bn global single-serve coffee market”. Shares in Starbucks were up 1.5 per cent to $33.60, one of the biggest gains on the S&P 500.Elsewhere in the sector, McDonald’s was up 0.3 per cent to $76.29. The S&P restaurant and bar index was up 0.4 per cent, one of the few sectors to rise in the session.The S&P 500 closed down 0.8 per cent to 1,310.13, adding to the 0.7 per cent loss in the previous session, as Libya lurched further towards civil war, causing oil and gold prices to spike higher for another day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to 12,090.03 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 per cent to 2,745.63 in the sessionThe S&P 500 index is now off 2.5 per cent from its mid-February high on fears that sustained high oil prices will hamper economic growth. “The recent surge in oil prices poses a threat to the US expansion,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a report.These fears over the economic recovery hit the materials sector particularly hard. Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 3 per cent to $50.14 while Cliff Natural Resources was down 3.4 per cent to $95.77. The S&P materials index was 1.8 per cent lower, the worst performing sector in the session.Industrial stocks also saw sharp losses for the same reasons. Boeing, the aerospace and defence company, was 1.3 per cent lower to $70.88 while Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, fell 2.9 per cent to $93.82. The S&P industrial index was down 0.8 per cent.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was up 8.1 per cent. The index is now up 31.4 per cent since its mid-February lows before the markets began reacting strongly to the global political tensions.Semiconductor stocks were some of the worse performing after Wells Fargo cut its view of the sector to “market weight” from “overweight” for the first time in more than two yearsThis left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 3.1 per cent as Micron Technology fell 5.2 per cent to $11.03 and Nvidia lost 1.4 per cent to $20.47.The technology sector was down 1.2 per cent despite deal activity elsewhere in the sector. Western Digital, the hard drive maker, announced a deal to buy Japanese rival Hitachi’s hard disk drive business for $4.3bn in cash and stock. The news sent shares in Western Digital up 16.2 per cent to $34.87.Accuray, the medical equipment maker, said it would buy TomoTherapy, a radiation treatment company for about $277m, or $4.80 a share in cash and stock. TomoTherapy was up 24.5 per cent to $4.57 while Accuray fell 10.1 per cent to $9.Shares in OCZ Technology Group were up 15.4 per cent to $9.12 after the company announced that it expected to report record fourth-quarter revenue. The company said it expected revenue of approximately $64m, an increase of nearly 100 per cent from the $32.4m reported in last year.Ciena, a maker of network equipment for phone companies, fell 9.8 per cent to $25.98 after reporting first-quarter results and forecasting that second-quarter revenue would come in below estimates.On Sunday, it was two years since the recession lows for the stock market. Since March 6 2009, when the S&P reached an intraday low of 666.79, the market has almost doubled.Since then, financials have added 169 per cent, consumer discretionary stocks are up 148 and industrials have added 143 per cent. One of the biggest gainers has been Netflix, which has gained 452 per cent to $207.40.
329;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-03-01T18:36:46Z;Korean prowess on show in south-east;;The small northern Cambodian town of Siem Reap has no fewer than 30 Korean restaurants, catering to the South Korean tourists visiting the nearby Angkor Wat temple complex.But the South Korean influence in Siem Reap stretches further than tourist dollars.It reflects the challenge South Korean prowess in heavy industry and services is mounting to Chinese and western commercial influence across south-east Asia, in sectors ranging from Vietnamese retailing to Burmese offshore gas.“The Koreans come and they keep coming. Other countries are a little slow,” Takreth Samrach, secretary to Cambodia’s council of ministers, says.South Korean companies are known for rapid decision-making, often due to hierarchical systems where a chairman’s decision is not debated internally.Only months after Collective Brands, the US shoes group, moved production to Indonesia, South Korean footwear maker Chang Shin launched a rival plant in the country.Hun Sen, Cambodia’s prime minister, has persuaded South Korean civil engineers to invest $500m in the Angkor International Airport company at Siem Reap, which will be the first airport in the country to accommodate direct long-haul flights from Europe and the US.He has picked South Korea’s Intercity Group to develop $400m of leisure facilities in Siem Reap, hoping to entice visitors to linger in Cambodia.South Korea’s approved projects in Cambodia last year were worth $1bn, surpassing the $700m of investments from China.It is the latest front in Seoul’s offensive across south-east Asia.Commercial ties are deeper with Vietnam, where South Koreans have sought production bases since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1992.With $23bn of invested capital, South Korea is neck-and-neck with Taiwan as the biggest investor in Vietnam.In Indonesia, steelmaker Posco is building a $6bn mill, its first overseas integrated plant, and Hankook Tire is planning a factory.The Korean approach across the region sees small and medium-sized investors leading the charge before conglomerates set up production bases.Although big electronics groups such as Samsung and LG have factories in Vietnam, more than 2,500 smaller companies do business there.But while South Korean investment in Vietnam remains robust, many South Korean companies say they prefer to direct new investment to Indonesia.Smaller businesses tend to be very sensitive to rising labour costs, a factor driving their earlier shift from China to Vietnam.They are now shifting to Indonesia, which has the added allure of a big domestic market.Lotte, the South Korean retailer, a rival to Tesco and Carrefour across Asia, is targeting Vietnam and Indonesia to boost overseas revenues from 5 per cent to 30 per cent by 2018. Last year, Lotte’s sales in Vietnam were up 32 per cent to 10,101bn dong ($483m) from the previous year, while its Indonesian sales rose 6 per cent to 64,475bn rupiah ($7.3bn). In the absence of McDonald’s in communist Vietnam, Lotte’s chain of Lotteria burger joints has proved a hit.Much of South Korea’s determination to secure investments in south-east Asia comes from its hunger for natural resources.Korea Electric Power Corporation is taking a 20 per cent stake in Bayan Resources, an Indonesian coal company, for $515m.Shenhua, China’s largest coal producer, is also exploiting Indonesian coal seams.South Korea is developing energy fields in Burma to compete with rivals such as France’s Total and China National Offshore Oil Corporation.Daewoo International, which has the operating contract for the Shwe offshore gas field, is developing it under a $1.4bn deal signed last year with Hyundai Heavy Industries. In financial services, South Korea is leading the development of stock exchanges in Laos and Cambodia.Explaining how South Korea is forging such a rapport with south-east Asian countries, Lee Tae-hwan, chairman of Angkor International Airport, says South Koreans have historical experience of investment as part of their own nation-building enterprise.This chimes with Cambodia’s development priorities, particularly in sharing technology and training Cambodians as engineers.“We built our economy from nothing after a civil war, and the Cambodians are in the same position now,” Mr Lee says.“We have gained experience through national development and have knowhow in overcoming difficulties that the Cambodians think will now be valuable for them.”Cambodian officials say that the new airport, due for completion in 2015, will replace a smaller one run by the Société Concessionaire des Aéroports, a private company from France, the old colonial power.Additional reporting by Anthony Deutsch in Jakarta
330;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;US envoy condemns China attacks on media;;Jon Huntsman, the US ambassador to China, personally condemned on Monday the violence used by Chinese security officers against foreign journalists reporting a planned anti-government protest at the weekend.Mr Huntsman, who is considering a run for the White House in 2012, said that the “harassment and intimidation” that some reporters had received was “unacceptable and deeply disturbing”.Several foreign journalists were beaten on Sunday as they visited a busy Beijing shopping street, where an anonymous online call had said protesters should congregate. In reality, there were few signs of any demonstrators, but the street was lined with hundreds of uniformed police and plain clothes security officials, some of whom were dressed as street cleaners.At the time of the planned protest, police evacuated a large area of Wangfujing, one of Beijing’s main shopping streets, locking hundreds of shoppers in the malls that line the street. A new construction project also began at the weekend in front of the McDonald’s restaurant, the site of the planned protest.According to one European diplomat, nine foreign journalists were beaten or manhandled and 16 were detained by the security services. An American television journalist was kicked and punched in the face and body, diplomats said, suffering a broken rib.“I call on the Chinese government to hold the perpetrators accountable for harassing and assaulting innocent individuals and ask that they respect the rights of foreign journalists to report in China,” said Mr Huntsman, who met on Monday with several of the reporters detained by police. “I also urge China to respect internationally recognised conventions that guarantee freedom of the press and freedom of expression.”A former Republican governor of Utah, Mr Huntsman is expected to leave his post in Beijing shortly and has indicated he is considering running for the Republican nomination in the next presidential election.His intervention in the events surrounding the call for a “Jasmine revolution” in China is likely to prompt criticism from Beijing that the US is trying to use the unrest in the Middle East to sow dissent in China. Privately, Chinese officials criticised Mr Huntsman after he was photographed in Wangfujing at the time of the first planned protest.Some officials in Beijing have said they believed the award of the Nobel peace prize last year to jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was part of a European and American effort to undermine China and amounted to an attempt to revive the Cold War.The delegation of the European Union also released a statement criticising the violence used against the journalists. “We call upon the Chinese authorities to fully investigate these cases and hold the perpetrators to account under Chinese law,” it said.A large number of foreign reporters in Beijing and Shanghai have also been called in for meetings with the local police in recent days and some have been warned of likely problems with their visas if they report on the planned protests.The anonymous internet messages about the protests, which many believe originated outside China, have called on people to gather in 18 cities across the country every Sunday to “stroll” for democracy.
331;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-02-21T20:46:00Z;Facebook ad potential starts feeding frenzy;;Advertising agencies and technology investors are rushing to snap up fledgling companies that are providing additional marketing services around Facebook, as a new industry grows up on the back of the social networking phenomenon.Start-up companies in the US and Europe have rushed to fill gaps left by Facebook’s own facilities for advertisers and their agencies, by providing tools to manage the “fan pages” of brands and more sophisticated ad-buying techniques.Vitrue and Buddy Media, two US companies providing Facebook page-management services, have carried out multimillion-dollar rounds of funding in recent months. Both provide technology to let large companies manage their Facebook presence across different countries and regions.“In the next five to 10 years, marketing organisations and agencies will use software to manage their contacts and connections,” said Reggie Bradford, chief executive of Atlanta-based Vitrue, which tripled its revenues last year.Its clients, which include McDonald's, Ford and Best Buy, pay for subscriptions to access Vitrue’s “software as a service” online console.Mark Read, chief executive of WPP Digital, the internet and investment arm of the marketing services group, led a $5m investment in Buddy Media last year – an indication of how seriously advertisers are taking social media.“Our clients are increasingly interested in Facebook,” he said. “There are a lot of practical challenges in managing pages, across countries, implementing campaigns. The better we are at implementing Facebook pages, the more work we’ll win from clients.”Last month, Experian, the UK-based information services company, acquired Techlightenment, a London start-up providing technology and consulting around Facebook.“Social is a very important place for us,” said Mark Zablan, UK managing director of marketing services at Experian. “You can get any [client] meeting by saying, ‘How can I help you with your social strategy?’ That is where all the eyeballs are.”Industry-watchers predict these deals are just the beginning.“Social media is massive, that is not news to anybody. What has been really remarkable over the past 12 months is how Facebook is the new de facto platform,” says Frederic Court of Advent Venture Partners, which participated in Vitrue’s $17m fundraising last week. “The demand [from marketers] is absolutely massive.”Part of the appeal for investors is that it provides them with a way to tap into the growth of Facebook, without having to tackle the hefty $60bn-plus valuation placed on the site itself. While providers of games on Facebook, such as Zynga, are also securing multibillion dollar valuations, marketing technology businesses relying on Facebook can fetch more reasonable valuations, in the tens of millions of dollars.“It’s a very interesting way to play Facebook. Backing companies that are offering a business-to-business solution is a very different type of risk to, say, a gaming company,” Mr Court said.Internet companies such as Google and Ebay have spawned their own ecosystems, from search-engine optimisation to automated bidding tools. With its open “platform” and system of hooks for third-party technology, Facebook makes it easy for other companies to integrate their services, often without Facebook itself having to be involved.With Facebook still struggling to hire enough advertising sales staff to cope with demand from large advertisers, these companies benefit from referrals from Facebook and capitalise on areas where its tools fall short of some clients’ needs. But that does leave some tech companies at risk of being overtaken by Facebook, as it scales up its team and expands its own ad-selling and management tools.
332;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-02-11T23:12:02Z;Wall St gains as consumer confidence rises;;Kraft Foods lost ground after lowering its full-year earnings forecast but the wider markets were up after healthy consumer confidence data and the resignation of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt.The world’s second-largest food company by sales forecast that 2011 earnings would come in below expectations, sending the shares down 1.5 per cent to $30.66.Operating income for the fourth-quarter was also disappointing, brought down by the integration costs from Kraft’s acquisition of Cadbury, a UK confectioner, last year.But the S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,329.15, a 2½-year high, paring earlier losses after data from the University of Michigan showed that consumer confidence rose in February. This helped the index post a weekly gain of 1.4 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 12,273.26, up 1.5 per cent over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7 per cent to 2,809.44, a gain of 1.4 per cent over the last five days.Markets were given a further lift after Hosni Mubarak stepped down as president of Egypt, ending the uncertainty that has worried the markets for 18 days. The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 2.6 per cent to 15.68.But the gains following the resignation were modest as investors struggled to work out long-term effects. “This is a short-term release for the markets, but it could be a long-term negative. We know we are losing a friend, but are we gaining an enemy?” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.Biotechnology stocks lost ground after Cephalon said its profits had fallen in the fourth quarter and that it had received a subpoena from the US Postal Service’s investigative arm seeking information about its cancer-pain drug Fentora.The shares were down 2.6 per cent to $58.56. Related stock Amgen lost 1 per cent to $53.74.In other earnings news, Expedia, the online travel company, reported a 30 per cent drop in net income for the fourth quarter. This fell short of expectations and sent shares down 17.1 per cent to $21.31. Bank of America Merrill Lynch also cut its recommendation to “neutral” from “buy”.Kinder Morgan, the energy pipeline operator, saw a successful first day of trading after its initial public offering. The shares were up 3.5 per cent to $31.05 after the largest private equity-backed US offering at $30 a share, valuing the company at $21bn.US shares in Nokia were down 14 per cent to $9.36 after it announced a “broad strategic partnership” with Microsoft to make Windows its main phone operating system to compete against Apple and Google in the smartphone market.But investors in Apple and Google were unruffled, with Apple up 0.7 per cent to $356.85, while Google rose 1.3 per cent to $624.50. Microsoft, however, was down 0.9 per cent to $27.25.The wider markets were given little direction from the Commerce Department’s balance of payments data for December. The figures showed that the US trade deficit had widened more than economists had expected at the end of the year. However, exports as well as imports continued to rise, pointing to a strengthening economic recovery late last year.The week was dominated by a spate of deal activity which drove the S&P higher. In other earnings news, Panera Bread, a bakery chain, jumped 16.5 per cent to $116.11 after the company lifted its full-year earnings estimate for 2011 to as much as $4.45 a share.Another restaurant chain, Chipotle Mexican Grill, rose 4.7 per cent to $268.73 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings on an adjusted basis of $1.47, beating the average estimate of $1.30.On Monday Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn in a move that would create the world’s second-largest offshore drilling company.Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn.Danaher was up 5.3 per cent to $51.61 over the week while Beckman Coulter was up 0.2 per cent to $82.78. Pride International gained 0.7 per cent to $40.08.This mergers and acquisition theme continued on Wednesday when NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, announced that it was in advanced merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange. NYSE gained 13.5 per cent to $38.31 over the week.Strong earnings results from McDonald’s and Walt Disney, up 3.7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively over the week, also helped the wider market push forward to 2½-year highs.
333;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-02-09T01:10:25Z;Largest McDonald’s franchisee prepares IPO;;Arcos Dorados, the largest McDonald’s franchisee globally, is preparing for a US listing that could hand a handsome return to investors on their $700m purchase of the business in 2007.People familiar with the matter said the company – which with about 1,800 restaurants in Latin America as well as kiosks and McCafés is the biggest restaurant owner in South America – might file for an initial public offering within days and could start trading in New York as soon as April.Arcos Dorados, which means Golden Arches in Spanish, is based in Buenos Aires. It has appointed Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan as underwriters on the offering, the people said.It was not clear how much of the company Arcos Dorados’ backers would sell in the listing or whether they intended to raise new funds.But people familiar with the sale suggested the IPO would rank as one of the largest by a Latin American company in the US, raising as much as $1bn.If so, it would be closely watched as an indication of the strength of investors’ demand to tap into the developing market for consumer products in South America.The company and its advisers either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.McDonald’s in 2007 agreed to franchise nearly 1,600 restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean for $700m to a group led by Woods Staton, the executive who had previously led the Latin American arm of McDonald’s.Among Mr Staton’s backers in the company that became Arcos Dorados were Capital International, Gavea Investimentos, the $6bn Brazilian hedge fund recently bought by JPMorgan, and DLJ South American partners.As part of the deal, McDonald’s took a $1.6bn impairment charge, $800m of which accounted for the difference between the Latin American business’s book value and the price paid by the investors.The remainder related to historical foreign currency losses.As a result of the sale, McDonald’s would collect a royalty payment from the business but not invest any further capital.McDonald’s, which had come under pressure from the hedge fund Pershing Square to shed its underperforming company-owned outlets, said at the time of the deal that currency volatility had made the company wary of investing in its Latin American operations.McDonald’s declined to comment on the potential Arcos Dorados listing.Since 2007, Arcos Dorados has been aggressively opening new restaurants across the continent, as well as ramping up its marketing and product development in the region.The company is one of the top 100 private businesses in Latin America, with revenues in 2009 of about $3.6bn, and has operations in 19 countries including Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.
334;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-02-08T22:50:35Z;Small business confidence lifts Wall Street;;"McDonald’s led gains for US equities as the wider markets edged up on news that small business confidence had risen to its highest level in three years.But disappointing earnings reports from smaller companies and a fall in energy stocks due to an interest rate rise in China pared gains for the session.McDonald’s, the world’s largest burger chain by sales, saw strong gains after reporting same-store sales had unexpectedly risen by 5.3 per cent in January compared with the same period a year earlier. The stock climbed 2.6 per cent to $75.36.The news lifted the restaurant sector. Starbucks was up 2.4 per cent to $33.12 while the S&P consumer services index was up 1.8 per cent to 306.96. This helped Wall Street add to the 2½-year highs reached on Monday.The S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent higher to 1,324.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 12,233.15 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent at 2,797.05.Also helping to lift markets was data from the National Federation of Independent Business showing that US small business confidence was at its highest level since December 2007.But the survey also showed that small businesses remained cautious about hiring and the group was far from jubilant about the future prospect for small business.“While recent political rhetoric favours small business, it is belied by the actions of policymakers whose new policies and activities almost exclusively support big businesses,” said Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Small Business. “While the economy is moving forward, albeit at a snail’s pace, it is not nearly fast enough to dramatically improve the unemployment situation, which continues to languish.”Also tempering sentiment on Wall Street was some lacklustre earnings news.Principal Financial, the life assurer, released disappointing fourth-quarter results, sending shares down 4.3 per cent to $32.24. The group reported a profit of $199.3m, or 62 cents a share, up 40 per cent from the previous year but short of the 68 cents predicted by analysts.Elsewhere, NYSE Euro-next, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, said fourth-quarter net profit had fallen 20 per cent as trading volumes in the US and Europe slowed. This sent shares in the group down 1 per cent to $33.41.The energy sector saw the greatest losses in the session on news that China had raised interest rates in an effort to combat domestic inflation.Schlumberger, the largest oil services group in the world, was down 0.9 per cent to $88.04 while Halliburton lost 2.6 per cent to $44.97.This was the third time that China had raised its benchmark interest rate since October and it sent the S&P energy index down 0.5 per cent to 552.71.The wider markets were not dragged down by the rate rise, however, as many investors saw the move as both expected and even necessary.“The Chinese keeping inflation under control is positive for US equities,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial. “It is only if investors think they are pulling back too hard that equities will really start to react badly.”In deal news, Kindred Healthcare agreed to acquire RehabCare Group in a move the companies said would create the largest US post-acute healthcare services group. The $900m deal sent shares in Kindred Healthcare up 28.3 per cent to $25; RehabCare Group shares climbed 45.5 per cent to $37.05.Herley Industries, a defence contractor, agreed to be acquired by Kratos Defense & Security Solutions for about $270m. This sent shares in Herley up 16.3 per cent to $18.89 while Kratos shares were flat at $14.01.Conexant Systems, the semiconductor maker, jumped 17.9 per cent to $2.47 after saying Golden Gate Private Equity had offered to buy it for $2.35 to $2.45 a share.These deals follow on from a series of bigger deals in the previous session. On Monday, Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn in a move that would create the world’s second-largest offshore driller by number of rigs. Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, also agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn."
335;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Fast food battle heats up in China;;Chinese consumers may have more spending power, but they also have less time to cook: a perfect recipe for the growth of fast food in China, where western and Asian chains are battling over the increasing appetite for restaurant meals.In urban China, high property prices, long commutes, gruelling working hours, a later marriage age and smaller families all add up to more fast food.The country’s food service industry has recorded double-digit annual growth since 2003 but is still only half the size of the US market, says AlixPartners, a consulting firm in China. The industry, estimated at about Rmb2,000bn ($303bn) in 2009, is forecast to grow to about Rmb3,000bn by 2014, according to industry estimates.Multinational fast food chains, such as KFC and McDonald’s, arrived early and have come to dominate the market for western quick service meals.Yum Brands, the US group that owns the KFC chain, opens more than one new restaurant in China every day. And it predicts it earned more operating profit in 2010 in China than in the US, for the first time.Yum expects soon to have a 3:1 market share lead over its nearest fast food rival, but McDonald’s is investing heavily to catch up. The US burger group took two decades to get to 1,000 restaurants in China, but expects to take only four years to get to 2,000.McDonald’s even offers home delivery in China. And now that China boasts the world’s largest auto market, it plans to equip half of its new mainland restaurants with drive-through windows.But the battle for “stomach share” in China is about more than fried chicken and Big Macs. Thanks in part to an influx of venture capital and private equity funds in recent years, Asian fast food chains are increasingly competitive.“Global brands are running into fierce local chains that are good at branding, and have raised the money to go national,” says Shaun Rein, of China Market Research in Shanghai.Lim Meng Ann, China head of Actis, a private equity fund that invested $50m in Xiabu Xiabu, a Chinese hotpot chain, at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008, says that “given a choice, Chinese people would always prefer Chinese food”. He adds that Xiabu’s revenues have grown by “well over 50 per cent” per year.No one is predicting that the Chinese will forswear burgers and fries anytime soon, not to mention KFC’s more indigenous offerings, including a dish sometimes referred to as rice porridge with pork and 1,000-year old eggs for breakfast – a dish so popular it often sells out before 8am.But diners recently riding on Shanghai’s “Lunch Bus” – a free shuttle that takes white-collar workers from the city’s financial district to a local fast food emporium – made clear that, given the time and the choice, they prefer Asian.Yan Bo, 25, a vegetable oil trader at a local bank, says he is “too Chinese” to lunch at McDonald’s.“Last year I was very busy and I ate McDonald’s five times in one week,” he says ruefully. “But I only do that if I have no time at all. It’s too unhealthy.”Lunch bus riders named Ajisen, a Japanese noodle chain that offers 98 menu choices, and Banana Leaf, a Thai curry chain, among their favourites. Little Sheep, a Mongolian hotpot chain part owned by Yum Brands, and Country Style Cooking Restaurants, a Sichuan chain that recently raised $82m in a New York IPO, and the ubiquitous Kungfu, are other Asian chain high-fliers.“I don’t think it is necessarily a battle between western and Chinese quick service restaurants,” says Mr Lim of Actis.Chain restaurants in general have very low market share, says Christian Paul of AlixPartners, but he predicts that will change. “Chinese consumers …like a brand to give them comfort,” and that is just as true of food as of handbags, he says.Xia Lianyue, vice-chairman of the China Fast Food Association, says rising urban salaries and long commutes are driving the emergence of an all-new “simple meal” market averaging Rmb50-Rmb100 per meal, a cut above fast food at Rmb30 per person. That will be the battleground for food companies in China: the battle for the stomach of China has just begun.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen in Shanghai
336;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-01-31T20:29:16Z;Nifty Fifty;Apple and Google investors could learn from once-mighty companies;Quick, name a “one decision stock” – a business team so good that valuation is a secondary consideration. For those investors foolish enough to believe in such things, Google and Apple – market darlings for the better part of a decade – might well fit the bill.But go back 40 years and Xerox and Kodak, two stocks that tumbled last week and have had awful decades, were similar bellwethers that fund managers happily owned at nearly any price. Leading members of a group dubbed the “Nifty Fifty”, they traded at an average of 42 times price-to-earnings at their 1972 peak, pricier than today’s tech leaders but a similar multiple of revenue.A decade ago , the finance professor Jeremy Siegel revisited the Nifty Fifty and calculated what a reasonable p/e ratio would have been with 29 years of perfect foresight. Xerox would have been fairly valued at 9 times and Kodak at 11 times. Polaroid, the most richly-valued of the group at 95 times in 1972, has since disappeared altogether.Not all did badly. McDonalds and Walt Disney had high starting valuations that eventually were justified. Somewhat cheaper Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Coca-Cola, did well too. Technology stocks did worst, but the best predictor of future return was not industry but starting valuation. The cheapest five stocks traded at 26 times earnings while the most expensive group sold for 63 times. Extrapolating returns calculated by Siegel, the cheaper group had a return 2.3 times higher.Duds such as Kodak or Polaroid notwithstanding, fund managers in 1972 did a decent job of picking lasting franchises but not good investments. A portfolio of companies chosen purely on the basis of a low p/e would have done better. Followers of Apple or Google might still ponder the words of Warren Buffett, who feasted on fallen members of the Nifty Fifty after the group dropped by 70 per cent in the subsequent bear market. “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.”E-mail the Lex team in confidence
337;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
338;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-01-25T16:10:32Z;Supply chain is a strategic discipline;;"Globalisation has driven a revolution in corporate procurement and put a new generation of professional supply chain managers and their technology tools at the forefront of the push to build sustainable and profitable businesses.Supply chain management has changed a great deal over the past decade.A complex web of global partners and suppliers, volatile energy and commodity prices coupled with currency fluctuations are now the norm.Rick Blasgen, chief executive of the Illinois-based Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, says: “The number one issue facing our members is the increasing pressure from global competition.”Mr Blasgen, whose 25-year career has included senior supply chain positions at three of the world’s largest food companies – Nabisco, Kraft Foods and ConAgra – took leadership of the Council in 2007. He says the second most important issue his members face is keeping tabs on the information transmitted between supply chain partners.Today, companies need to collaborate with supply chain partners to minimise risk and maximise transparency, he says. “You have to trust your partners with information that in the past you might have considered proprietary.”Businesses operating global supply chains also have a range of other factors to consider including the tax, regulatory and environmental impact of their decisions.Most importantly, they need to view the supply chain function in an entirely new way. Kevin O’Marah, a Gartner analyst in charge of supply chain research, says, “traditional planning cycles are obsolete.“Internet connectivity and global markets have accelerated change so dramatically that businesses must revisit daily investments in product development, manufacturing capacity, and inventory.”Businesses should also take advantage of technologies such as GPS (the global positioning system) tracking, RFID (radio frequency ID) tags, communications networks and software tools.“We always look at how technology is applied,” says Rob Riddleston, head of transport and logistics at Barclays, the banking group.When companies get it right, their supply chains can become a strategic and competitive advantage.Mr Blasgen notes: “Supply chain logistics used to be viewed as a cost-cutting mechanism; now they are being used as growth drivers to open up new markets, particularly emerging markets.”Which companies operate the most admired demand-driven supply chains and document their best practices?In October, Gartner’s AMR unit published its annual list of the top 25 companies that demonstrate leadership in supply chain management.Apple, whose extended supply chain is regularly cited as one of the most sophisticated and effective, took the top slot for the third year running, Procter & Gamble, the only company to have been in the top five for six consecutive years, came in at number two, followed by Cisco, Walmart Stores and Dell.Five companies joined the Top 25 for the first time: Research in Motion (RIM), Amazon, McDonald’s, Microsoft and Inditex, the fashion distribution group.But even the best managed supply chains still face unexpected challenges.Mr Blasgen cites the case of Mattel, the US toymaker that was forced to recall nearly 1m toys in 2007, after it emerged that a Chinese contract manufacturer had covered them with lead-based paint.As companies extend their supply bases and manufacturing operations across the globe, new risks are introduced, including intellectual property theft, supplier viability, volatile exchange rates, product safety, and even piracy.“Supply chain risk has become a big deal in the past five years, and very, very prominent at the time of the oil price spike,” says Mr O’Marah. “When oil was hitting $140 a barrel, people started worrying about whether they were over­exposed in Asia or whether they were overly reliant on materials that are based on oils such as plastics.Fortunately, there are technologies that can help manage these problems, but nevertheless, Noha Tohamy of Gartner says strategic thinking is essential.Generally, she says, software tools can be grouped into two main categories.First, there are those that enable strategic scenario management, or “what-if” analysis. Second, are tools that focus on what is happening in real time.Global logistics presents another set of challenges that have been amplified because while import/export was once a small slice of many economies, today it is big and vital.“The need for both adequate capacity on ocean lanes, rail, road and air links as well as visibility to where your shipments are and whether they’re at risk is suddenly mission-critical,” explains Mr O’Marah.But while many logistics firms are being pressed to provide capacity and visibility, adequate technology tools are still lacking, he says.Supply chain professionals also have to grapple with a new class of supply chain in emerging markets. “Economic growth is disproportionately coming from emerging markets such as India, China, Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa,” says Mr O’Marah.He adds: “Consumer demand is high, but supply chains often look very different, requiring companies to think and build their networks to suit these markets.So, for instance, in Brazil you have serious problems with the roads, whereas in China you have good roads but you have other issues with respect to borders.“Unfamiliar local distribution infrastructure, retail networks, manufacturing capacity and of course regulatory and cultural factors all call for specialised strategies.”Companies, particularly multinationals, are also more concerned about sustainability, while environmental accounting is expected to weigh increasingly on supply chains where factories and transportation contribute substantially to their carbon emissions.Such considerations mainly apply to physical products such as cars, food and clothing.These have a big variable cost component. Digital supply chains for music, software and games can be reproduced and “shipped” at essentially zero marginal cost and present different challenges.“Intellectual property ingredients of physical products can often be separated from the plastic, metal or other material that gets shipped,” says Mr O’Marah.Managing 21st century supply chains requires a new set of skills.The notion of “supply chain” as a professional discipline barely existed a decade ago, says Mr Blasgen.Before the internet connected companies globally, most people working in the shipping, production and purchasing departments of businesses were tactical operatives in cost centres.Today, supply chain competence has become a competitive weapon essential to success in launching products, entering markets and responding to competitive threats."

Halliburton, the second-largest US oilfields services company reported a profit of $605m, or 66 cents a share, up from $243m or 27 cents a share, as revenue from its North American operations soared 83 per cent from a year earlier due to a resurgence of drilling.Its stock was up 0.9 per cent to $39.55.The news helped the sector, with Cameron International rising 2 per cent to $51.27 and Schlumberger, which reported a 31 per cent jump in profit on Friday, up 0.9 per cent to $84.25. Material and technology stocks recorded the strongest gains.The S&P materials index rose 1 per cent to 235.69 as some commodity prices ticked up after the wobble in the previous week.Alcoa, the world’s largest producer of aluminium, was up 4.1 per cent to $16.43; Cliffs Natural Resources, the iron ore and coalminer, rose 1.6 per cent to $82.96.These gains helped the S&P 500 close 0.6 per cent higher to 1,290.84 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1 per cent to 2,717.55. The Nasdaq has added 28.2 per cent since the start of September, outperforming the S&P which is up 23 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.9 per cent to 11,980.52, flirting with the 12,000 mark that was last reached before the financial crisis in June 2008.The technology sector strode forward with Intel up 2 per cent to $21.24 after the chipmaker announced that it was going to buy back $10bn in stock.Motorola rose 4.1 per cent to $38.66 while Apple was up 3.3 per cent to $337.45 Nvidia was up 11.3 per cent to $24.73 after Barron’s, the financial magazine, wrote a positive article saying shares in the chip designer could “practically double”.The S&P technology index was up 1.8 per cent to $454.43.Investors were broadly optimistic ahead of a what will be a cluttered news week. In the next five days numerous earnings results, a Federal Reserve meeting and the president’s State of the Union address are expected. Earnings reports are due from 3M, Johnson & Johnson, Boeing, Starbucks, Caterpillar and Microsoft, among others.Stocks struggled to see gains last week in spite of strong quarterly profit results as investors have come to expect forecast-beating figures. The S&P 500 lost ground even after solid earnings results from Morgan Stanley, General Electric and Google.More than 70 per cent of earnings reports so far this season have surpassed expectations. Markets have also found it difficult to climb higher in recent days on the back of the strong earnings season due to a widely held belief that stocks on Wall Street are due for a correction after rising nearly 23 per cent in the past five months.“Everyone is ready for a big correction but the strong earnings figures and the economic numbers are just not giving them an excuse for one,” said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.Phil Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “We could see a 3 to 7 per cent correction some time in the first quarter . . . Trees do not grow to the sky.”The other big results news of the session was McDonald’s, which reported fourth-quarter earnings up 2 per cent and in line with forecasts. The fast-food company reported weaker than expected December sales due to poor weather and warned that food costs would likely rise in 2011. The stock was up 0.5 per cent to $75.38, recovering from losses in early trading.In deal news, Rock Tenn, the paper and packaging manufacturer was up after agreeing to buy its bigger rival Smurfit-Stone Container for $3.5bn, creating North America’s second-largest paper container producer.The move, which will triple Rock Tenn’s revenue to $9bn, sent the company’s shares up 3.7 per cent to $59.55. Smurfit-Stone was up 27.2 per cent to $35 on the news, which was announced on Sunday.The consumer discretionary sector was weighed down by RadioShack, which fell 11.3 per cent to $15.62 after the electronics retailer projected weak earnings for the fourth quarter and said Julian Day, chairman and chief executive, planned to retire in May.Also in the sector, JC Penney was up 7.2 per cent to $32.52 after it announced restructuring plans.Overall, the S&P consumer services index was up 0.4 per cent to 305.22."
340;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s profits rise despite soft winter sales;;McDonald’s, the US fast food chain, said on Monday that it may have to raise prices at its restaurants this year as it braces for rising costs of commodities.The company projects that its “grocery bill” of food ingredients will rise by up to 2.5 per cent in the US and 4.5 per cent in Europe in 2011, with beef prices being the biggest variable. It said that it will need to gauge how passing on higher prices to consumers will affect store traffic.Those projections come as food prices have been rising globally. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation has said food prices hit a record high last month, exceeding levels seen during the 2007-08 crisis.McDonald’s said that its outlook on the US economy was not much brighter than a year ago, as consumer confidence and unemployment remain at depressed levels. However, Mr Skinner said in a call with analysts that the McDonald’s business model “operates fairly well in these environments”.The restaurant giant is also looking to store renovations, a new breakfast menu and a more convenient drive-through system to drive growth. Fourth-quarter profits grew as it continued to spruce up its stores and promote a new array of coffee offerings, but harsh winter weather was a drag on sales.Comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were strongest in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, where they rose 5 per cent. In the US and Europe, where snow snarled traffic, same store sales rose 4.4 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively.McDonald’s has been moving aggressively to re-brand itself by refurbishing its stores, selling smoothies and frappe coffee beverages, and offering healthy options such as oatmeal. This month McDonald’s released a statement seeking to silence rumours about the ingredients in its chicken nuggets, promising that they are made with 100 per cent USDA Grade A Chicken.During the final three months of last year, net income at McDonald’s rose 2 per cent to $1.24bn, or $1.16 a share, from $1.21bn, or $1.11 in the fourth quarter of 2009. That was in line with analysts’ expectations and after initial investor disappointment in the soft sales, the company’s share price rose 0.52 per cent to $75.40 in midday trading in New York.Total revenues were also up in the final three months of the year, climbing 4 per cent to $6.2bn, and global comparable store sales were up 5 per cent. For the year, McDonald’s recorded $4.9bn in earnings, up 9 per cent from 2009, on $24bn in revenues.“McDonald’s continues to operate from a position of strength,” said Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive.McDonald’s said it will invest $2.5bn in 2011 in opening 750 net new stores and “re-imaging” existing locations. Peter Bensen, the company’s chief financial officer, said that McDonald’s, which has 32,000 restaurants globally, will open 150 in the US and 175 in China this year.
341;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-01-24T19:12:27Z;McDonald’s;Company’s share price looks under-appreciated;The Big Mac is such an institution that there is a cost-of-living index named after it. But the famous hamburger has assumed a position similar to that of Mickey Mouse at Disney: an instantly recognisable mascot, but one that no longer drives growth. Instead, McDonald’s, the world’s largest burger restaurant by sales, has profited from turning to the most important meal of the day – breakfast. Indeed, cappuccinos and caramel mochas helped it report 5 per cent growth in same-store sales and an 11 per cent increase in earnings per share last year.Expect the focus on breakfast, which accounts for about one-quarter of the chain’s sales, to continue. Indeed, the company’s addition of oatmeal to its menu may appear an attempt to placate health critics, but was perhaps more driven by a study by US researchers Technomic that found the cereal is more popular than sausages and hash browns.Investors will be happy that, aside from restyling its menu, the company is growing at a prodigious rate with about $1.3bn to be spent next year to develop 1,100 new stores. Russia has been touted as among the next big opportunities while the company, having become the first non-Chinese company to raise funds in renminbi, has further committed to already strong growth in Asia Pacific.All this appears to consign to history former chief executive Jim Cantalupo’s promise to “do fewer things and do them better”. This is not a bad thing. The relatively recession-proof McDonald’s has delivered 20 consecutive quarters of growth and current boss Jim Skinner has shown he can negotiate a financial crisis and food price inflation. So with expansion plans afoot, the company’s share price – about 16 times its earnings and still about one-third off its pre-recession peak – looks under-appreciated.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
342;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Republican plans to block healthcare reform;;As Republicans in the House revealed more details about their plans for potential budget cuts, they also began to show their hand on how they hope to block – or at least slow – the implementation of President Barack Obama’s healthcare legislation.On Wednesday, Republicans in the House unanimously voted to repeal healthcare legislation in a symbolic gesture that was ultimately irrelevant because the bill does not have the votes to pass in the Democratic-controlled Senate.An internal memo from Republicans on the House energy and commerce committee that was circulated this week said that reforming the methodology on how Medicare, the government-sponsored insurance programme for the elderly, pays for physicians’ services would be a “top priority”.Although Republicans have promised to dramatically cut government spending, the memo stated that they would “recapture” $500bn in proposed cuts to Medicare contained in the healthcare law in order to make it “more financially sound”.The House committee also announced a probe into the federal bureaucracy that has been determining whether certain companies can be granted waivers from regulations under the new healthcare bill. The Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight has granted 222 waivers – but also denied requests.McDonald’s and Jack in the Box, two fast-food chains, among dozens of other companies, were granted waivers from new rules that would have required the groups to raise the minimum annual benefit in their low-cost health plans, which are offered to part-time workers. The Department of Health and Human Services said it granted the waiver so that the companies would not drop the health insurance plans.The energy committee’s extensive document request included demands for all electronic communications between the CCIIO and companies seeking a waiver.“The inquiry is …part of a broader effort being undertaken by the Committee to scrutinise the massive bureaucracy created by the healthcare law and its consequences for consumers, employers and healthcare quality and access,” the committee said.
343;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-01-19T22:35:19Z;Case study: Coca-Cola;Drinks group rejuvenates its product line;The story: Coca-Cola is the world’s best-known beverage company. It traditionally manufactured concentrates, syrups and powders and sold them to authorised bottling partners, who converted them to finished products and sold them to distributors, wholesalers and retailers. Its core product offering is sparkling beverages but also includes still beverages such as water, juice and energy drinks.From its inception, the company was based on a franchise model – the “Coca-Cola System” – whereby Coca-Cola would sell concentrate to its many bottling partners worldwide. While Coca-Cola managed the overall brand strategy, concentrate production and some large multinational customers such as McDonald’s, the bottlers manufactured the final branded products, handled merchandising and distribution, and worked closely with local customers.The challenge: In developed markets, the growth of the sparkling drinks industry from the 1970s to the 1990s came to a halt.At the same time, competition was intensifying from beverage companies that produced still and health-oriented drinks, as consumers became more health-conscious. Many of the challengers were small businesses, enabling them to be more nimble and innovative than multinational organisations like Coca-Cola.The company’s franchise business model was also under pressure. The bottlers’ incentive was to use the precious concentrate in low-volume, high-margin products, whereas Coca-Cola’s profits were linked solely to the volume of concentrate sold to bottlers, rather than the price paid by customers. This was creating increased friction in the relationship between Coca-Cola and the partners on whom it relied.An additional challenge was responding to the environmental impact of transportation and packaging.The response: First, Coca-Cola focused on rejuvenating its core product line. The successful launch of Coke Zero, a diet variation of the drink pitched at men (Diet Coke or Coke Light is principally aimed at women) added volume and revenue growth.Second, the company made key acquisitions in the non-carbonated drinks sector to expand its presence in the growing market. These included a deal for Glaceau, maker of Vitaminwater, and a stake in Honest Tea, the organic iced tea producer.Third, the company co-operated more closely with its partners. Coca-Cola recognised that many of the bottling companies had become big businesses in their own right, with independent shareholders to worry about, and tried to find new ways of working together to the advantage of both sides.For example, an “incidence” approach to pricing was used more often, whereby both Coca-Cola and the bottler shared in the profit made by the combined system, rather than a fixed price per unit for concentrate.Fourth, Coca-Cola acquired the bottling operations of CCE, its US bottler. This was significant because it signalled that the company was moving away from a one-size-fits-all-markets business model. The franchise system might have worked when the company produced just one product, but as its output expanded to include every non-alcoholic beverage category, it had to evolve.Finally, Coca-Cola embraced sustainability with initiatives to conserve water in its manufacturing, materials in its packaging and even electricity in the millions of coolers it has dotted around the world.Key lessons: First, growth can be found in mature or stable categories. The success of Coke Zero underlines that. Rather than focus exclusively on categories where other companies are growing fast, companies should consider how they can rejuvenate core businesses.Second, companies should be flexible with regard to their business model. To drive innovation in the US, Coke needed to change the way its products were manufactured and distributed.The writer is a professor of marketing at IMD
344;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-01-10T00:03:43Z;Companies in pledge to offset cuts;;Leaders of some of Britain’s biggest companies will today promise to create thousands of jobs in 2011 as they attend a “jobs summit” at Downing Street hosted by David Cameron.The prime minister is determined to show that the private sector can generate enough growth to offset deep cuts to the public sector, where about 300,000 people are losing their jobs.Mr Cameron last week said he wanted to focus on “industries of the future”, such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals and green energy as well as tourism.However the 19 companies at today’s summit are instead dominated by nine retailers, which have pledged more than 34,000 – or 80 per cent – of the jobs promised for 2011.They include 7,500 at Asda, 1,000 jobs at Co-op, 4,000 at John Lewis, 6,500 at J Sainsbury, 6,000 at Wm Morrison and 9,000 at Tesco.Andrew Cave, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, said many of the jobs created by supermarket chains came at the expense of “small family independent retailers” closing down.Mr Cameron will say that business leaders have demonstrated their confidence in the economy, where 300,000 private sector jobs were created in the past six months alone.“We can only get our economy back on track by creating a climate in which the private sector can grow and develop,” he will say. “Across a whole range of areas you are going to see the most pro-business, pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda ever unleashed by a government.”Some of today’s corporate pledges do not give details on numbers, with Toyota promising to hire “a number of agency staff”, Shell saying it will “support jobs” and Marks and Spencer promising “significant job opportunities”.Those non-retailers offering more concrete figures on new posts include Centrica, recruiting 2,600 people, Amec, wanting to recruit up to 4,000, and Microsoft, which hopes to support 4,000 new jobs through its Britain Works programme.McDonald’s has promised 3,000 hires and InterContinental Hotels another 1,000.Mark Swift, of the EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, said it was unrealistic to expect much growth in employment in the sector for “a year or so” given that productivity tended to involve smaller workforces.“It would be unrealistic to think that manufacturing is going to take a significant number of new people on this year,” he said.Mr Cave said it was “unlikely” that small companies would be net hirers in the first half of the year. “Our members are predicting they will have to cut jobs for the next six months. We still need more practical help from the government,” he said.A report last week suggested that unemployment would rise to 2.7m this year, up from current level of 2.5m. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development predicted in the survey that public sector employment would fall by 120,000 and private sector net employment by 80,000.The body predicted “another year in the economic doldrums” rather than a return to recession or an outright bounceback.
345;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-01-07T01:23:10Z;Poultry ‘titan’ Donald Tyson dies;;Donald Tyson, who helped build his family’s Arkansas chicken hatchery into one of the world’s largest meat producers, has died of cancer at the age of 80.In a career that spanned five decades, Mr Tyson transformed Tyson Foods through serial acquisitions from one of many chicken producers – it was 14th in size in the US in 1968 – to the country’s largest.In 1968, it supplied 1 per cent of the country’s chicken. Last year, Tyson accounted for 20 per cent of chicken consumed in the US, according to the National Chicken Council.Mr Tyson served as chairman emeritus when his son engineered the acquisition of IBP, a leading producer of meat and pork, in 2001, after which Tyson Foods became the world’s largest meat company. In 2009, Brazil-based JBS eclipsed Tyson, taking over the number-one spot after its acquisition of Bertin and Pilgrim’s Pride.Like Frank Perdue, another major figure in the development of the industry in the US, Mr Tyson benefited from the steady growth in chicken consumption across America in the latter half of the 20th century. Mr Tyson was not well known outside the industry, or politics, where he was an active player for much of his career.In 1980, Mr Tyson helped the company develop a relationship with McDonald’s, supplying chicken meat for the restaurant chain’s experimental new product, the “Chicken McNugget”. The relationship continues to this day.In a statement, the National Chicken Council described Mr Tyson as “a titan of the modern chicken industry”, praising him as a visionary in the business. “He was a pioneer in moving beyond commodity chicken to value-added products and in the development of new products and international markets.”In the 1980s, the success of Tyson Foods and Arkansas-based Walmart, bolstered the national credentials of the state’s Democratic governor, Bill Clinton. Mr Tyson was a financial supporter of Mr Clinton during his presidential campaign in 1992.In 1997, Tyson Foods admitted giving $12,000 of illegal gratuities to Mike Espy, who had served as secretary of agriculture under President Clinton, and paid $6m in fines and costs. As part of the plea agreement, Mr Tyson and his son John were granted immunity from prosecution.
346;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Protests brew over Starbucks logo revamp;;"Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, has triggered a wave of protests from irate coffee drinkers after dropping its name and product from its logo.Reducing its logo to one of the sirens – the creatures in Greek mythology who lured sailors to their death – is “a total waste of time, energy and money” one comment posted on the coffee chain’s website said.Starbucks, noting the name has not been dropped entirely but is simply no longer attached to the logo, sees it differently.In a webcast that suggests the group will endorse a wider range of products, Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer, said: “We’ve allowed [the siren] to come out of the circle in a way that gives us the freedom and flexibility to think beyond coffee.”Starbucks has announced the termination of its US distribution agreement with Kraft Foods, a move that Kraft is disputing in court.In announcing the logo change, Mr Schultz indicated that the new trademark would be appropriate for non-coffee products. The company markets strawberry frappucino ice cream in the US, and wants to expand its presence in the packaged goods business.The new logo, which will appear in stores in March, comes as the company prepares to celebrate its 40th anniversary that month and is part of a broader rebranding which will affect the look and feel of stores and include new formats in the UK. Starbucks says there is no more “one size fits all” for its stores and markets.For example the coming months will see the opening of a narrow “walk-through’ store in London’s Borough High Street and a smaller Covent Garden store centred round a single large table and a spacious café complete with laptop area at Heathrow Terminal 5.Brand experts took a kinder view than coffee drinkers to the logo revamp. “If they believe as an organisation they can release the name from the symbol, that’s a pretty enviable and strong position to be in,” said David Roberts, creative director at Fitch, the branding design consultancy.Several other companies have taken Starbucks’ strategy, he noted, such as Royal Dutch Shell, the oil group; McDonald's’, the fast food chain ; Vodafone, the largest mobile operator by revenues; and Apple, the technology company.The other advantage of a word-free logo is that is translates more easily across digital media and overseas. Starbucks, like many companies, is now targeting a global audience with a wide range of written languages.Starbucks said it expected the new logo to be a talking point because “people like talking about us” and as it invites customers to engage.One post called on Starbucks to “Please listen to your customers and halt the printing of this new logo!!!” Last November Gap, the clothes retailer, was obliged to drop its digital new logo after a great deal of protest.But for Starbucks there is one upside: many of today’s bloggers said they would go out and buy as many coffees in old-logo cups as they could ‘while stocks lasted’."
347;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Case study: McDonald’s;How the company stuck to and revived the core;"The story: By the late-1990s fast-food chain McDonald’s had enjoyed 40 years of exceptional performance. In 1997, for example, the company had registered 10 years of 20 per cent per annum growth.The challenge: That year, Jack Greenberg became the company’s fourth chief executive. His main concern was how to lead the business in less favourable market conditions. McDonald’s was facing concerns about fatty foods and about beef; competition was squeezing margins; and growth from international markets was slowing.The strategy: Mr Greenberg did what the textbooks suggest. First, he focused on improving the core business, announcing it as his top priority. Then, he also set a second priority: to find a new platform for growth. With this audacious goal in mind, he supported five acquisitions of related restaurant businesses – including Chipotle, a Mexican food restaurant, and 50 per cent of Pret A Manger, the UK sandwich chain – and he set up the Partner Brands Division, to be responsible for these new businesses. Mr Greenberg also opened the door to a number of other, more organic initiatives led by his head of strategy, Mats Lederhausen.What happened: Mr Greenberg found it difficult to dedicate enough attention to both priorities. The core business continued to deteriorate and in 2001 McDonald’s announced its first quarterly loss and the resignation of Mr Greenberg.Jim Cantalupo, a retired McDonald’s executive, was asked to return as CEO. His first announcement was that McDonald’s had been trying to do too many things. He shut down many of the organic initiatives and housed all the new businesses into a structure called McDonald’s Ventures.Mr Cantalupo instructed Mr Lederhausen to identify those businesses that could become significant for McDonald’s without distracting management from its core business and to sell or close the rest. The result was that over the course of the next few years, almost all of them were either sold or closed.The lessons: First, this story is common. A company forecasts reduced growth in its core business, looks for new sources of revenue, launches initiatives, and makes acquisitions – only to find a few years later, that it is back where it started, having sold or closed its new ventures.Second, the textbook advice – set a growth ambition, try a portfolio of related ventures and invest heavily in the few successes at the same time as attending to the core – does not always work, in spite of its continuing popularity.So, what is the alternative? When the core business starts to mature, leaders should be patient rather than energetic. The main risk is that attention is distracted from the core. Therefore, avoid launching a portfolio of initiatives; don’t set targets for growth outside the core; and don’t set up a new business division or venturing unit.Do scan opportunities, but with a tough screening process and the expectation that none will be suitable. Expect to use spare cash to buy back shares, until a really good opportunity comes along.Above all, look for people rather than projects – successful new growth outside the core nearly always comes from individuals or teams who happen to have a rare combination of both grassroots knowledge of a particular area and an understanding of how your company’s strengths can be used to succeed.What happened next: The company’s leaders have stuck to and revived the core. In fact, as is often the case with a strong core, the hamburger business is growing again, partly because of the fast growth of emerging markets such as China.McDonald’s is still looking for other opportunities – but in a patient way.Andrew CampbellThe writer is a director of Ashridge Business School and author of ‘The growth gamble: when leaders should bet big on new businesses and how to avoid expensive failures’"
348;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2011-01-05T11:10:02Z;Global food prices hit record high;;Food prices hit a record high last month, surpassing the levels seen during the 2007-08 crisis, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation said on Wednesday.The Rome-based organisation said the increase did not constitute a crisis. But Abdolreza Abbassian, senior economist at the FAO, acknowledged that the situation was “alarming”. He added: “It will be foolish to assume this is the peak.”The jump will increase fears about the repetition of the crisis of 2007-2008. However, poor countries have not so far seen the wave of food riots that rocked countries such as Haiti and Bangladesh two years ago, when prices of agricultural commodities jumped.The increase in food costs will also hit developed economies, with companies from McDonald's to Kraft raising retail prices.Higher food prices are also boosting overall inflation, which is above the preferred targets of central banks in Europe.The FAO said its food price index, a basket tracking the wholesale cost of commodities such as wheat, corn, rice, oilseeds, dairy products, sugar and meats, jumped last month of 214.7 points – up almost 4.2 per cent from November.The FAO food index is at its highest since the measure was first calculated in 1990. During the 2007-08 food crisis, the index reached a peak of 213.5 in June 2008.The FAO is drawing comfort from relatively stable prices for rice, one of the two most important cereals for global food security, which remains far below its record high. Rice is the staple of 3bn people in Asia and Africa.However, the cost of the other critical staple, wheat, is now rising fast on the back of poor harvests.“This is a high prices situation,” said Mr Abbassian, although he pointed to the fact the costs of cereals – and particularly rice – were below the peaks set in 2007-08. “Rice and wheat are, from a global food security perspective, the critical agricultural commodities, not sugar, oilseeds or meat,” he said.The increasing costs of sugar, whose price recently hit a 30-year high, oilseeds and meat are the main reason behind the rise in the FAO food index.The rise of commodity prices makes it likely that the global food import bill will hit a record high in 2011, after topping $1,000bn last year for only the second time. In November, the FAO raised its 2010 forecast to $1,026bn, up almost 15 per cent from 2009 and within a whisker of a record high of $1,031bn set in 2008 during the food crisis.Agricultural commodities prices have surged following a series of crop failures caused by bad weather. The situation was aggravated when top producers such as Russia and Ukraine imposed export restrictions, prompting importers in the Middle East and North Africa to hoard supplies.The weakness of the US dollar, in which most food commodities are denominated, has also contributed to higher prices.
349;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;McDonald’s sued over Happy Meals;;A US consumer advocacy group has filed a lawsuit against McDonald’s, accusing the fast-food chain of using deceptive advertising practices to lure children to the company’s restaurants.The lawsuit, brought by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, accuses McDonald’s of using the promotional toys included in its Happy Meals to get children to pester their parents into bringing them to its restaurants.The complaint alleges that most Happy Meals deliver levels of fat, sodium and calories that are above the recommended levels for children under 8 years of age.The civil suit, filed in California, seeks class action status on behalf of the plaintiff, a 41-year-old mother of two.It is the second major assault on McDonald’s children’s marketing programmes in the nation’s largest state in recent weeks. The San Francisco board of supervisors voted in November to ban the sale of Happy Meals starting late next year.“We are proud of our Happy Meals and intend to vigorously defend our brand, our reputation and our food,” McDonald’s said in a statement. “We are confident that parents understand and appreciate that Happy Meals are a fun treat, with quality, right-sized food choices for their children that can fit into a balanced diet.”In an interview with the Financial Times this month, McDonald’s chief executive Jim Skinner defended his company against the growing chorus of “food police” in its home market who blame McDonald’s for contributing to an epidemic of obesity in the US.“Our customers are competent and capable of making decisions”, Mr Skinner said. Speaking about the the San Francisco ban, he added: “That approach is wrong-headed, and is not going to solve anything. It’s not going to solve obesity”.In its complaint, the CSPI cites an internal company newsletter which says that when families with children visit McDonald’s, the children are responsible for the choice of McDonalds 53 per cent of the time. The lawsuit alleges that McDonald’s advertises its Happy Meals to young children, with the offer of a promotional toy, knowing that the children will urge their parents to bring them to the company’s restaurants.“By choosing to thwart parental rights, McDonald’s is engaged in a deliberate and deceptive attack on children”, said Stephen Gardner, an attorney representing CSPI. “McDonald’s must be held responsible for and change its illegal behaviour”.The lawsuit does not seek damages from McDonald’s, other than attorneys’ fees and related costs, and asks for a judgment that will prevent the fast-food restaurant chain from continuing to advertise Happy Meals featuring toys to children in California.Josh Golin, associate director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, applauded the suit. “When it comes to undermining parental authority by targeting children directly, McDonald’s is the worst of the worst”, he said. “Their business model is based on getting their kids to pester their parents as often as possible”.
350;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-12-14T23:26:47Z;China’s top 50 brands reach $280bn valuation;;China’s 50 most valuable brands are worth $280bn, or more than 5 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product, according to a new ranking that highlights the rise of the country’s domestic consumer market.“Contrary to a common perception, there is real value being created here,” said David Roth, global head of BrandZ ranking at global marketing group WPP, which published its first study on the financial value of Chinese brands on Tuesday.There have been other Chinese brand rankings before, such as one by the Hurun Report, the publisher of an annual rich list for China. But the WPP list offers more context as it is compiled using the same methodology as the well-established global BrandZ ranking.State-owned enterprises top the list, with China Mobile, the world’s largest mobile operator by subscriber numbers, taking the top spot and seven state-owned banks, insurers and oil companies also in the top 10.The Chinese results contrast drastically with the global BrandZ ranking, which is topped by technology names including Google, IBM, Apple and Microsoft, closely followed by food brands such as Coca-Cola and McDonald’s.WPP’s brand experts said the main reasons why state-owned brands had done so well in the Chinese ranking were ample government support and relatively little competition.“They are born with a golden spoon in their mouth, so they can outspend everyone else in marketing,” said Raymond Tao, president of Ogilvy & Mather Advertising, a WPP affiliate.However, the Chinese ranking is set to change quickly. “I expect to see much more change here over the coming years than in the global line-up, because this market is so huge and growing so fast,” said Adrian Gonzalez, head of Greater China at Millward Brown, WPP’s research affiliate.Mr Tao said the state-owned enterprises topping China’s ranking could soon be challenged by some more ambitious privately owned companies including Suning and Gome, the electronics retailers, or Taobao, the consumer e-commerce company. “They could easily challenge China Mobile,” said Mr Tao.The study has found that some technology brands appear high in the ranking due to their offering innovative products and maintaining strong consumer ties.Tencent is China’s most valuable technology brand with QQ, the world’s largest instant messaging tool which it runs. Tencent ranks eighth, followed by Baidu, China’s leading online search engine. Lenovo, the world’s fourth-largest computer vendor, and Sina, China’s largest online news portal, are technology names included in the Top 50.But others are set to break into the ranks before long as an increasing number of Chinese technology companies go public – the ranking currently only covers listed companies.During the past week, Youku, the country’s leading internet video site, and Dangdang, its largest online book seller, launched their initial public offerings in New York. Tudou, another online video site, and Renren, China’s leading Twitter clone, are expected to follow soon.As the BrandZ ranking is based on a consumer survey plus certain financial figures, it excludes private companies that do not publish detailed financial reports. Huawei, the world’s third-largest network gear maker, and Taobao, China’s leading consumer e-commerce company, are therefore absent.
351;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s vows to keep it simple;;"It is a gauge of how far McDonald’s has come in the past seven years that, when the world’s largest hamburger chain unveiled a rise in same-store sales last week, investors reacted by sending the shares lower.Such is the transformation of the company under Jim Skinner, who was thrust into the job of chief executive in 2004, that the 4.8 per cent rise in November sales did not measure up to investors’ standards.It is a problem he and other members of the management team longed for in 2002, when McDonald’s net profit plunged to $893m from $1.6bn the prior year, same-store sales dropped 2.1 per cent and the only way McDonald’s could increase its top-line revenues was by opening new stores, which it was doing at the rate of 1,000 to 2,000 annually.“We had been spending $5bn on new stores and getting no incremental growth,” Mr Skinner tells the Financial Times. Chasing revenues at the expense of profits was leading the company in a bad and unsustainable direction, he says.Starting in 2003, McDonald’s began refurbishing its existing restaurants and improving its internal operations. “We focused on existing restaurants and doing a better job at the counter,” says Mr Skinner. The company also divested itself of stakes in other restaurant chains, such as Pret A Manger, which had become “distractions” to its franchisee base.That year, the company opened only a handful of new stores and its profits nearly doubled; from $893m to $1.5bn. In 2004, when Mr Skinner took over, the company added a few hundred new stores and its net profit jumped again; to $2.8bn.In the six years that followed, McDonald’s has seen a wave of global growth rarely seen in its history. With the exception of 2007, when McDonald’s took a $1.7bn hit from the sale of some of its Latin American operations, profits have grown steadily each year, rising to $4.6bn in 2009. Analysts expect the company’s 2010 net profit to top $4.95bn.The turnround is reflected in McDonald’s share price, which hit a low of $12.38 in 2003 but breached $80 last week, before closing at $77.56 on Friday.Mr Skinner’s success at McDonald’s is remarkable for two reasons: the onset of the global recession and the improbability of his ascent to the top job.He was named chief executive in November 2004 only after the company was rocked by twin tragedies. Jim Cantalupo, who had spent 16 months as chief executive, died of a heart attack in April 2004.Charlie Bell, who succeeded Mr Cantalupo, resigned seven months later after being diagnosed with cancer. Mr Bell died soon after.“He’s the accidental CEO,” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management. “And yet he has absolutely succeeded. He’s not a backslapper and he has no personal discernible grandiosity. He sets really clear standards, and doesn’t get trapped by clichés. He does not use MBA jargon, speaks in a straightforward way, and doesn’t try to mystify issues.”To hear Mr Skinner tell it, the company’s recent success is the product of a return to fundamentals, articulated in the so-called “plan to win” adopted by Mr Cantalupo. The plan called for the company to focus relentlessly on people, products, place, price and promotion.“The moment of truth is the 30-second transaction between you and the person who takes your order at the drive-through,” says Mr Skinner, 66. “It’s the only place where we make money”.The company has decentralised its decision-making processes: additions to its menu are no longer dictated from its headquarters in Oak Brook but evolve from experimentation round the world.McDonald’s has not only survived the global financial crisis – which has cut deep into its rivals’ profits – but emerged stronger than when the downturn began.Profits grew to $4.3bn in 2008, the year of the financial crisis, and rose to $4.6bn in 2009. Throughout the worst economic downturn in the US in recent memory, the company’s same-store sales numbers continued to grow. McDonald’s ability to offer affordable meals on its “dollar menu” helped it maintain growth during a period of 9.6 per cent unemployment.“Everyday affordability has become the most important thing,” says Mr Skinner. “People are pinched everywhere. They should not have to feel pinched at McDonald’s”.The quest for simplicity even extends to one of the most complex areas of management – protecting the company from volatile commodity prices and currency fluctuations, which have a direct impact on quarterly earnings.“We lock in reasonable prices,” says Mr Skinner. “But we’re not going to be speculators …We’re not going to play the market. I don’t want our people to have the pressure to feel they have to get the perfect price”.In terms of the future for the golden arches, McDonald’s has identified Russia as key: it has opened 11 new restaurants there this year, while same-store sales to October are up 9.6 per cent on 2009."
352;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-12-13T22:33:30Z;McDonald’s chief attacks children’s meal ‘food police’;;The chief executive of McDonald’s has described critics of the company who have tried to curtail the sale of Happy Meals aimed at children as “food police” and accused them of undermining parents in making decisions for their families.In an interview with the Financial Times, Jim Skinner responded to last month’s vote by the San Francisco board of supervisors to forbid restaurants from offering toys with meals unless the food complied with limits on calories, sodium, sugar and fat.“We’ll continue to sell Happy Meals,” said Mr Skinner, in the face of a ban that does not become effective until December 2011. The new rule “really takes personal choice away from families who are more than capable of making their own decisions”.Mr Skinner’s message was aimed beyond San Francisco, at the growing legion of “food police” who blame McDonald’s for contributing to an epidemic of obesity in the US and other developed nations.“We’ve seen many years of someone trying to dictate behaviour through legislation,” he said. “Our Happy Meals have been supported by parents since the 1970s. The nutrition of Happy Meals, which include apples, meets FDA guidelines. We sell choices on the menu that make our customers feel better about their lifestyle.”In the past 20 years, McDonald’s has moved beyond hamburgers and Chicken McNuggets to offer healthier options ranging from salads and wraps to fruit-based smoothies.However, as the world’s largest fast-food restaurant chain with 32,000 stores in 117 countries, McDonald’s remains synonymous with junk food in the eyes of many, in the way that Altria became a proxy for the tobacco industry.McDonald’s thus often finds itself in the crosshairs of ­regulators and activists who portray it as everything from the root cause of the US obesity epidemic to the primary culprit behind the problems associated with globalisation.The company might win some battles over Happy Meals, but the larger direction of the “healthy food” war is not in its favour, said Eric Dezenhall, a communications consultant.“Even though I think their approach to pushback is a good one, in the long run, it’s hard to fight what is really a cultural movement,” he said. “As with cigarettes or Humvees, that ­never-ending drumbeat takes a long-term toll that will force a company to be more nimble about its product offerings, which they are doing.”
353;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-12-13T22:30:03Z;Currencies: Yuan direction;China is internationalising its renminbi – in a process that could have a global impact;So new is the trade in offshore Chinese currency bonds that it has yet to gain a proper name. For want of anything else, it is often dubbed the “dim sum” market, in culinary recognition of its Hong Kong home base.In spite of its infancy, interest in the market is growing quickly. Caterpillar, the US-based maker of earthmoving equipment, launched a Rmb1bn ($150m) bond issue last month, making it the second multinational to tap the market, following an August issue by McDonald’s, the fast-food chain.What makes these bond issues important is that the offshore renminbi market is much more than just a new avenue for debt financing – it is one of the core components in a plan to internationalise the Chinese currency. The process will be a slow one, with more baby steps than giant leaps, and it is by no means assured that the renminbi – also known as the yuan – will forge a decisive international role. But it is one that could have a huge long-term impact on trade, the global financial system and even international politics.If the plan works, the renminbi could become the main currency for doing business in Asia, the world’s most economically dynamic region, and in the long run it could become a significant part of the reserves of the world’s central banks. Indeed, some Chinese officials have already called for the renminbi to be included in the International Monetary Fund’s basket of main currencies.The timing is also full of portents. The renminbi is starting to go global just as the future of the euro is looking increasingly uncertain. Eventually the shift could have an impact on the ability of the US to borrow overseas in its own currency. In China, some have taken to calling their currency the hongbi, or “redback”, to rival America’s greenback – a moniker that gives a flavour of the geopolitical undercurrents.“We may be on the verge of a financial revolution of truly epic proportions,” says Qu Hongbin, China economist at HSBC, one of the banks pushing the renminbi to its corporate clients. “The world economy is, slowly but surely, moving from greenbacks to redbacks.”In many ways, the surprise is how little the renminbi is currently used outside China’s borders. China is now the second-largest economy in the world, the largest exporter of manufactured goods and holder of the largest volume of foreign exchange reserves. Yet the amount of the currency held overseas is negligible – the result of China’s strict capital controls and restrictions on currency trade.“If aliens landed on earth today, they would look at the current global monetary system and think it is very weird and unreasonable,” Li Daokui, who sits on the monetary policy committee of the People’s Bank of China, told a forum in Beijing last month.Yet the financial crisis has changed attitudes in Beijing and bolstered support for China to seek a greater international role for its currency. Officials argue that the crisis came about because the international monetary system allows the US to run unsustainable current account deficits. As a result, over the past year Beijing has put in place some of the conditions for the renminbi to go global.The first step has been to encourage international trade to be conducted in renminbi. That process accelerated in June, when China expanded its year-old renminbi trade settlement scheme to every country in the world and to 20 Chinese provinces and municipalities, allowing imports and exports to be invoiced and settled in renminbi.Even if the use of the currency is to be limited to trade, companies and banks still need to be able to hold and invest renminbi offshore – which started to become possible in some scale from July when the authorities allowed renminbi-denominated financial markets to spring to life in Hong Kong. A month later, a select group of investors, including foreign central banks, were given limited access to China’s onshore bond market. Malaysia is believed to have become the first central bank to hold mainland renminbi assets in its reserves.The effect has been dramatic. The People’s Bank says trade settled in renminbi totalled Rmb340bn between June and November – from zero just a year and a half ago. The pace has stunned senior western bankers who know the region. Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong banks surged 45 per cent in October to Rmb217bn – another reflection of the use of the Chinese currency in trade.For Chinese companies, the attractions of settling cross-border trade in their own currency are clear. Avoiding the dollar allows them to cut transaction costs and minimise foreign exchange risks – a huge benefit in a world at risk of a global currency war.Sinochem, China’s biggest trading company, is one of the pioneers. The group’s offshore trading division in Singapore this year received renminbi as payment for sales of petrochemicals, rubber and fertiliser, after what it says were requests to do so from Chinese companies as well as units of Sinochem on the mainland. “This allows us to build a stronger bond with our customers,” says Song Song, finance manager at Sinochem International (Overseas), who expects the trend to continue.Indeed, an increasing number of western multinationals – including McDonald’s from the US, Ikea and Nokia in the Nordic region and Germany’s Metro – are also experimenting with using the renminbi in trade deals. “For our corporate clients, US dollars and euros are no longer the de facto currencies of trade,” says Shivkumar Seerapu, Asia head of trade finance at Deutsche Bank.Deutsche, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are among banks rapidly building the infrastructure needed to process renminbi transactions across the world. Standard Chartered and its rival HSBC are meanwhile already well placed to capitalise on the internationalisation of the renminbi because they have strong positions in Hong Kong, the designated offshore centre for the Chinese currency. Makers of products “from garments to gas cylinders” have started using the renminbi, says Neil Daswani, head of transaction banking for North Asia at Standard Chartered.Demand has been strongest from Hong Kong, he adds, but has also come from Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, the Middle East and the UK. According to economists and trade finance experts, the use of the renminbi in trade is likely to take off first in Asia and then between China and other developing countries.Momentum is clearly gathering behind the renminbi internationalisation drive, yet it is still a highly unusual process and one that is not guaranteed success. In the past, market forces have driven the greater international role of a currency: but in the case of China, that development is being developed by bureaucratic plan. “The attempt to create an international and eventually fully convertible currency through a policy-driven process is unprecedented – nothing like this has ever been tried before, even partially,” says Paola Subacchi of the UK’s Chatham House think-tank in a recent paper. “Beijing is openly aware of the fact that there is no roadmap to guide this process.”What makes the push even more unusual is that Beijing still intends to retain a raft of capital controls, to insulate its economy and to prevent the currency from becoming fully convertible for the time being, because of the leadership’s fears about the volatility of foreign exchange markets and the impact of open capital flows on the country’s still underdeveloped financial system. As Ms Subacchi says, “past experience shows that convertibility and opening of the capital account have always preceded the international use of a currency, rather than the other way round”.Instead, China is trying to use Hong Kong as a laboratory, where it can encourage international companies and investors to hold and trade renminbi-denominated products. The dim sum bonds are one part of that plan.Meanwhile, to boost the foreign availability of renminbi, Beijing has over the past two years signed currency swap agreements with central banks in eight countries – Argentina, Belarus, Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea – totalling a little over Rmb800bn. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city’s de facto central bank, last month drew down Rmb10bn of its Rmb200bn swap line, opening a new way for commercial banks in the city to obtain renminbi for their corporate clients to use in trade deals. Hong Kong banks can also obtain renminbi via mainland banks and the local branch of Bank of China, subject to quotas.Chinese officials admit, however, that while the offshore market in Hong Kong can help lay the groundwork for greater international use of the currency in trade, the renminbi cannot become a reserve currency until there is much greater access to the mainland bond markets and the renminbi is easier to trade on the foreign exchange market.Given China’s caution about liberalising its financial system, all of this suggests a process where the renminbi takes a greater international role over a period measured in decades rather than years, meaning it will be a long time before reserve managers are really considering shifting substantial holdings of dollars into renminbi.“There’s not a lot of point buying renminbi in Hong Kong if you can’t ultimately buy assets in China,” says John Greenwood, Invesco chief economist and architect of Hong Kong’s exchange rate mechanism. “[But Chinese policymakers] have got to be careful that they don’t make a hole in the dam that allows a huge flood in all directions – either inwards or outwards. China has a long way to go before its domestic capital markets can be opened up to foreign inflows without it being hugely destabilising.”Yet one of the big questions posed by the Chinese plan is whether the authorities will really be able to keep such a tight rein on the process. HSBC estimates that within three to five years at least half of China’s trade flows with other developing economies will be conducted in renminbi – about $2,000bn – making it one of the three top global trading currencies. With such a huge volume circulating outside the country, it could become much harder to prevent unwanted capital from entering.By encouraging the use of the renminbi, Beijing is also creating a constituency of investors, companies and central banks that will be lobbying for ever greater access to the currency and to Chinese markets.Indeed, one reason global financial institutions are so excited about the internationalisation process is that they expect it to punch new channels through the wall of controls that protect the domestic financial system. By pushing for greater use of its currency, China could open up more quickly than many in Beijing might think.
354;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-12-01T19:57:39Z;Multinationals cash in on EU funds;;"At €20m the European structural funding that IBM has been granted for its operations in the Polish city of Wroclaw represents just a fraction of the company’s $96bn (€68.7bn) turnover last year.But IBM’s funding is emblematic of a trend. Across Europe some of the biggest beneficiaries of the EU’s biggest regional aid programme – its structural funds – are multinational companies.According to a database of structural fund projects compiled by the Financial Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which was assembled from public records across Europe, EU funding allocations have also been made to corporations such as Fiat, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.Structural funds are supposed to be directed at small and medium companies, which provide the backbone of many economies in the 27-nation bloc. But multinationals are also eligible for funding and officials say the structural funds programme has become an element of competing in a global marketplace where companies are often courted by countries eager for their investment.“There is a global contest,” says Johannes Hahn, the EU commissioner for regional development. “If we don’t participate in this contest all the production sites will go out of Europe.”Whether that funding should come in the form of loans rather than grants is open to deb­ate, he says. But the goal is to avoid “a de-
industrialisation of Europe”.Research on whether subsidies influence decisions by multinationals on where to invest tends to say subsidies play a role but are rarely the only determinant.IBM applied for funding to create jobs in a shared service centre providing information technology services and global process services in Wroclaw, where it plans to invest about 605m zlotys ($198m), according to data provided by the government body that administers the European structural funds involved.The company declined to comment on EU funds for the Polish project as it was still under way. “It would be inappropriate to comment on structural funds in this case where no award has been completed,” it says. But it says decisions on where to locate operations depend on several factors, including “skills profiles, training opportunities, infrastructure and local commercial and government support”.Corporate recipients insist there is often a good reason for the EU funding.GlaxoSmithKline, the UK pharmaceuticals company received almost €1.9m in EU funding for its vaccines factory at Saint-Amand-Les-Eaux, to help increase its lyophilisation, or freeze-drying, capacity. But the company argues the money has helped create jobs in “a region of northern France that has an unemployment level that is higher than both the French and European average”.EU funding, the company says, came via the Competitiveness & Employment programme, a scheme that focuses on promoting enterprises with high technology content. As such, it met one of the priorities for the current structural fund phase, which include helping to fund research and development as well as innovation, something many multinationals have used.Fiat, the Italian carmaker, applied for €25m through the EU’s innovation programme in Poland through its subsidiary, Fiat Powertrain Technologies. The company says it plans to use the funds, which it has not yet received, for the new twin-cylinder engine being installed on its compact Fiat 500 model.But companies have also been given small grants. Coca-Cola received Ft500,000 ($2,342) to help “develop a water-bottling site in Hungary”, while American Express Bank obtained €62 of European Social Fund money “to support qualification activities of a female employee”, according to data from the Austrian public employment service.Poland, which at €67bn has won by far the largest allocation of structural funds, has invested heavily in using the funds to woo multinationals. A colourful brochure from the ministry for regional development touts the country as a location with where “support from the European Union means profits for business”.“EU money is very correctly spent in Poland and has very positive effects. It allows a business to build up long-term competitive advantage, which helps makes the Polish and European economy more innovative,” says Waldemar Slug­ocki, deputy minister of regional development.But using the funds to subsidise multinationals has its critics. “These subsidies are one-off payments,” says Markus Pieper, a German MEP who sits on the European Parliament’s regional development committee. “You can’t keep companies that way.”Additional reporting by Andrew Jack in London"
355;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;EU pays McDonald’s in Sweden;;It sounds like a classic case of a multinational company riding the EU gravy train, albeit on a relatively small scale.What could justify McDonald’s, the world’s biggest fast food chain, receiving nearly €60,000 of taxpayers’ funds to pay for “skills training” in the affluent Swedish university town of Uppsala?Yet, Sara Nord, a 21 year-old Swede who took part in the training, insists it was money well spent. “It’s the best thing I’ve ever done,” she says, explaining that the course was nothing to do with flipping hamburgers.The year-long programme in 2009 involved twice monthly sessions focused on areas such as leadership, social development and time management, with expert speakers brought in from outside to conduct many of the lectures.Mikael Sandlin, head of training for McDonald’s in Uppsala, says the fast food chain was granted the money because its workforce includes disproportionate numbers of women, young school-leavers, immigrants and people with disabilities – all groups targeted for benefits from the European Social Funds – a division of the EU structural funds.“We were not allowed to use the money for any training that McDonald’s would have done anyway,” he recalls. “It had to be something our employees would not otherwise have got. They were very strict about enforcing this.”Critics might still question why a multinational company should benefit from publicly-funded training. But Mr Sandlin points out the money was allocated to McDonald’s relatively small local franchise holder in Uppsala and says the business could not have afforded to provide the course without EU help.Applying for the money was an arduous process, involving a 25-page form and an estimated 60 hours of preparatory work.“We saw the opportunity to do something that would benefit our employees – not only while they are working for us but also in future,” recalls Mr Sandlin, noting that more than half the company’s 450-strong workforce attended the sessions.Ms Nord has since left McDonald’s and she says the training has continued to pay dividends in her new job with a computer game retailer. Her 20 year-old brother, Simon, also took the course and he is hoping to use it as a springboard into a management position with McDonald’s. “It has definitely given me a better understanding of the service industry,” he says.
356;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-11-28T08:04:44Z;Ka Keung Chan: fired up by HK’s prospects;HK is expected to be a major beneficiary of the fund outflow from China;F ew financial centres can boast a big boost in assets under management in the current economic climate.Hong Kong is one that can and its rapid development as an asset management hub in Asia fires Ka Keung Chan, financial services and treasury secretary, with enthusiasm.“When people are thinking [of investing in] China and Asia they think of Hong Kong,” says Mr Chan. He believes “[investor] sentiment in Hong Kong is strong. The stock market level and fund inflows have been doing well as people see Asia’s growth prospect,” he adds.The asset management business rebounded strongly in 2009, with assets under management increasing more than 57 per cent to HK$5,824bn ($750bn). Growth was driven by recovery in global financial markets and inflows into the Asia Pacific region.Mr Chan, a former dean of business and management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, believes “Hong Kong is to Asia and China what London is to Europe”. He cites Hong Kong’s well regulated financial environment, free flow of capital, stable currency and low tax regime as attractions.More asset managers are setting up offices to manage incoming money “with new funds starting up and an increase of fund managers applying to the regulator to operate”, he adds.The number of licensed asset managers in Hong Kong has increased by 20 per cent in the past two years, since September 2008, to nearly 800. These are largely local branches of international players, joint ventures between domestic and international companies and domestic asset managers. However, more than half are majority owned by Hong Kong shareholders, says Mr Chan.Gaining exposure to China, a market difficult for foreign investors to access, and to the renminbi, the mainland currency, play a big part in attracting international investors.China’s recent key reform of liberalising the renminbi in Hong Kong brings “an exciting opportunity” to the territory. On China’s side the move is part of the plan to gradually internationalise the currency. For Hong Kong, Mr Chan believes it will open the way to a spate of financial innovation in the asset management industry with new products emerging across asset classes.Keen to develop the renminbi business, the stock exchange is considering plans to allow shares and fund products to be priced in renminbi. Fund managers, in addition to banks and insurance companies, are busy planning a wide array of products denominated in renminbi as investor demand for exposure to the Chinese currency increases. “Many Hong Kong fund managers are planning to launch some renminbi funds,” he adds.Hong Kong already has a fledgling renminbi-denominated bond market with Chinese and Hong Kong companies issuing bonds in the currency.In August, McDonald’s, the US burger chain, became the first foreign multinational to issue renminbi-denominated bonds in Hong Kong.But Mr Chan sees the mainland’s currency liberalisation as just part of the picture.“China is gradually opening up the capital account, which means there will be more Chinese fund flows, Chinese capital going out of China being invested overseas,” he says. Hong Kong will be “a major beneficiary of the fund outflow from China”.He believes Hong Kong will attract mainland investors because it is “the most liquid international financial market in China and Chinese investors are already familiar with it, as the stock exchange has a high concentration of Chinese listed shares”. The “increasing presence of mainland Chinese banks and fund managers in Hong Kong” will also help attract Chinese investors, he adds.Currently nearly two thirds of investors in the territory’s combined fund management activities are international, according to a 2009 survey by the Securities and Futures Commission.But this is likely to shift if Hong Kong succeeds in its aim to become a renminbi offshore centre.The territory is already one of the main exchange traded fund centres in Asia, second to Japan in terms of assets under management. It has 67 ETFs listed on the stock exchange, is growing rapidly, and had an average daily turnover of US$550m at the end of October.Hong Kong is keen to increase its cross border listings and already has three of its ETFs listed on the Taiwan stock exchange and a Taiwan ETF listed in Hong Kong. Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges plan to list the first cross-border ETFs focusing on companies in Hong Kong next year as investors in mainland China look for diversification through a basket of underlying Hong Kong stocks that also include international and Chinese companies.Mr Chan wants cross-border activity to work in both directions between the mainland and Hong Kong. He wants “to bridge the gap between the Hong Kong and China markets and to create vehicles so there is a cross listing of products that allow Hong Kong investors to participate in the Shanghai market and vice versa”.Some China observers see this as increasing competition between the territory and the mainland for fledgling remninbi business but Mr Chan believes developing a two-way trade will be beneficial to both sides.He hopes to see a Hong Kong ETF traded and listed in Shanghai in the future, and is currently working with the Chinese regulator on this.
357;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Employers grapple with ageing workforces;;Employers are faced with a loss of vital skills and experience as the baby-boomer generation, born in the aftermath of the second world war, approaches the end of its working life.Retailing offers work patterns that appeal to older workers but sectors such as engineering and manufacturing have less flexibility, while smaller companies have fewer opportunities to accommodate older workers in less demanding jobs.Syd Prior, the 96-year-old part-time assistant at DIY chain B&Q who was featured in last week’s Executive Appointments cover feature, is proof that age need not be a bar to employment. His working career spans 81 years and he was full-time at the company’s New Malden store in south-west London until the age of 93.Mr Prior is one of 1.4m people above the current UK state pension age of 65 (for men – the age for women is gradually rising from 60 to 65) still at work while the number of people of (official) working age is falling.Managing an ageing workforce is therefore a growing and significant challenge for business. UK government proposals to abolish the 65 “default retirement age” have been welcomed by age campaigners but are seen as a cause of concern by many employers.Yet answers must be found. Apart from the demographic imperative, action on employing older workers is underpinned by UK legislation that adds age to the list of factors – notably sex and race – that cannot be used to discriminate against individuals. The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations of 2006 make it illegal to discriminate against workers on the grounds of age in recruitment, promotion and training.“We saw a lot of employers start to think about ageing issues when regulations came in four years ago,” says Rachel Krys, campaign director at the Employers Forum on Age, an independent network of employers that promotes the idea of an age-diverse workforce. “It put it on the radar for employers who had not thought about it as a discrimination issue.”Despite this growing awareness there is still a long way to go.“We have not seen a massive increase in employers who see demographics as presenting a real opportunity to motivate people as they age and to embed skills in the workplace,” says Ms Krys. “Employers need to think about retraining and developing the skills they have already got.”Ninety-three per cent of employers agree that the knowledge and skills of older workers are highly valuable, according to a recent survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the Chartered Management Institute.But only 14 per cent of managers considered their organisations very well-placed to cope with the issues posed by an ageing workforce. Only one-third reported there was board-level recognition of the need for an effective strategy on employing older workers.Employers who have taken action extol the benefits of age diversity in their workforce. Employees aged 60 and over deliver a significant boost to business, according to a survey carried out for McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, by Lancaster University Management School. Levels of customer satisfaction were on average 20 per cent higher in restaurants employing older staff.Sixty-nine per cent of the company’s restaurant managers said “later-life” workers “empathise with and connect well with customers”. Almost half cited older employers’ ability “to go the extra mile” to deliver customer service, while 44 per cent believed older workers brought mentoring skills to the workplace, helping younger colleagues develop and mature.“For McDonald’s the presence of older employees improves customer satisfaction and, in a service business such as theirs, this drives the bottom line,” the researchers found. “Mature employees are a key part of the performance recipe.”Companies seeking to retain their older workers cannot afford to wait until they are approaching retirement. “Pre-retirement initiatives were taking place too late,” says a pilot study of ways to improve the health of 50-plus employees by Sandwell Primary Care Trust.“People felt they needed to plan lifestyle changes and have access to appropriate information from a much earlier age to decide whether to retire or continue working,” the study, cited by the Employers Forum, concluded.As the Sandwell project showed, programmes aimed at retaining older workers need to focus on issues other than age to be successful. Centrica, the energy group whose main UK operating arm is British Gas, launched an age action group, covering health, flexible working and apprenticeships long before the enactment of age discrimination regulations.“Our policy was to go beyond compliance to bring in a culture change,” explains Melanie Flogdell, head of human resources policy. “We have brought in pro-active policies that are age friendly.”The company started by removing the 25-year age limit on its apprenticeship scheme – even though this lost the scheme government funding – and one-third of its apprentices are now aged over 25 when they start with British Gas. Its oldest apprentice, who joined after a career change, was 57.“It is a cost to us but we get a diverse mix of applicants that matches our customers,” says Ms Flogdell.“We have a more mature mix within our engineering workforce, with the older ones bringing gravitas and acting as life mentors to the younger ones.”Flexible working is also widespread throughout the company, appealing to older workers with caring or family responsibilities outside work, while an engineers’ well-being programme has been designed to improve employee health and reduce absences. All these measures help keep older employees in work and have won recognition in the 2010 AARP International Innovative Employer Awards for non-US-based employers.More generally, workplace programmes tend to focus on retaining office or blue-collar skills in the middle and lower-income grades. People in more senior positions tend to be better placed to determine their future, although age discrimination legislation applies equally to them.In practice though, not a lot has changed in a field where many senior jobs require experience, sometimes stretching back decades.“Clients still want to take a view of the energy and experience levels of applicants,” says Stephen Bampfylde, chairman and founder of Saxton Bampfylde, an executive search firm.“Since you can’t say how old people are, clients talk in terms of how much runway someone has left. In the UK, the implicit view is that 70 is the cut-off age. If you are looking to employ someone for six or seven years you are going to count back from there.“It is never said or discussed but that is the reality.”UK employers have had four years to adjust to the original age discrimination regulations but they now face further upheaval with the proposed abolition from April 2011 of 65 as the UK’s default retirement age.“The problem employers face is of managing their older workers with confidence,” says Neil Carberry, head of employment policy at the CBI employers’ organisation.“If someone is in their 60s you want to know what they intend to do going forward, because you need a succession plan.“But you would be taking a substantial risk talking to employees about how long they wanted to work without implying that you wanted to get rid of them.“There needs to be a mechanism for employers to have a ‘no prejudice’ discussion with their employees.”Financing healthcare provision for older workers is also likely to become more expensive if the retirement age increases, says Mr Carberry. One suggestion put forward by employers is for the default retirement age to be retained but for it to increase in line with the raising of the state pension age.
358;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-11-24T15:09:52Z;Caterpillar launches renminbi bond;;Caterpillar, the US-based manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, launched a two-year Rmb1bn bond with a coupon of 2 per cent in Hong Kong on Wednesday, becoming the first foreign industrial multinational to issue debt in the Chinese currency.The issue, which is only the second of its kind by a multinational to date, dwarfs a Rmb200m issue launched by McDonald’s in August. The deal will give momentum to the nascent offshore market in renminbi-denominated debt which financiers hope will become an important fundraising route for companies with operations in China.The offering, which was placed with institutional investors by Goldman Sachs, was said to be seven times oversubscribed. McDonald’s three-year note was also quickly oversubscribed and secured a 3 per cent coupon.Caterpillar has secured approval from Chinese regulators – including the People’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange – to transfer the proceeds of the bond sale to the Chinese mainland, where it can be loaned out to support customer purchases.“Proceeds from the issuance will be utilised to support Cat Financial as it provides competitive financing options for Caterpillar customers in China through its subsidiary, Caterpillar (China) Financial Leasing Company,” the manufacturer said.Caterpillar, which has operated in China for three decades, has a substantial manufacturing and dealer presence in the country, where it employs about 7,400 workers.“In the late 1970s, Caterpillar was the first heavy equipment manufacturer from the United States to sell into China, and now, Caterpillar’s captive finance subsidiary is one of the first US companies to issue renminbi-denominated notes,” said Jiming Zhu, Caterpillar’s vice-president with responsibility for China.China is expected to account for about 9 per cent of the company’s $41bn-$42bn annual revenues this year. Caterpillar has a market share of about 7 per cent in the Chinese heavy machinery sector.Rich Lavin, the manufacturer’s group president and head of its emerging markets team, will be based in Hong Kong from January. The relocation is intended to show Caterpillar’s commitment to China.HSBC last year signalled its determination to expand in China and across Asia by moving Michael Geoghegan, its chief executive, from London to be based full-time in Hong Kong.Caterpillar’s bond, which is being arranged by Goldman Sachs, comes two days after China’s government announced it would sell Rmb8bn ($1.2bn) of bonds in its second such sale in Hong Kong.The Chinese finance ministry will sell Rmb5bn of the debt to institutional investors this month, with maturities of three, five and 10 years, while Rmb3bn of two-year bonds will be allocated to individuals.By issuing debt at a range of maturities, the government intends to deepen the offshore market for renminbi-denominated debt and establish pricing reference points for corporate issuers.McDonald’s became the first multinational company to sell renminbi bonds in Hong Kong in August, after China lifted a series of restrictions on the use of the currency outside the mainland.While so-called “dim sum” bonds – renminbi-denominated bonds issued in Hong Kong– have been around since 2007, there have been about 20 deals so far, as issuance was initially restricted to Chinese financial institutions.Since February, it has become possible for any company in the world to tap the “dim sum” market. But issuers still need to gain approval from Beijing to move the proceeds from Hong Kong to the mainland.Beijing has liberalised the use of the renminbi in Hong Kong as part of a much bigger plan to boost the international role of the currency and reduce China’s reliance on the US dollar.
359;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-11-14T23:31:20Z;Retailing: Slow-floating consumer goods arrive;;The gaudy blue-painted boat on the muddy River Pará in the Brazilian Amazon looked like something out of Fitzcaraldo, the Werner Herzog film about a rubber baron, who at the start of the 20th century drags a steamship over a hill to access a rich rubber-producing territory.In fact it was an air-conditioned Nestlé “floating supermarket”, steaming gently downstream, its immaculate shelves and fridges neatly stacked with 300 of the Swiss company’s products.When the “Terra Grande”, docked at the town of Barcarena, a crowd of curious locals flocked on board. Raimunda Pachego says: “It’s good to come here to the town, but they need to go to the remote communities. The cost of goods there is a lot more.”In fact, that is just what the boat will do. Nestlé says it will serve 18 remote communities from its home port of Belém, in north-eastern Brazil.More than 30m Brazilians have risen from poverty over the past decade and the Terra Grande is part of a general push by fast-moving consumer goods companies to expand their reach to less well-heeled but upwardly-mobile consumers – both in and far beyond the main cities.At a cost of R$1m ($590,000), however, it is an expensive investment – and not one that will necessarily generate much return.“I don’t want to say whether we will make a profit,” says Alexandre Costa, Nestlé director for regionalisation. “But it will give us customer feedback.”Over the past decade, many consumer goods companies have thrived by serving the rising “middle classes” – families earning between R$1,115 and R$4,807 ($660-$2,800) a month and who last year became the majority for the first time.To penetrate this market more deeply, some companies have started offering free samples in upmarket areas of big cities, as a way to test consumer tastes, create ties with them and “pre-launch” or redesign their products.Companies such as Unilever, Brazil Foods, and AmBev, a brewer, have all joined in with this “try-vertising”.Because of rising prosperity, however, many are also turning their attention to lower-income groups.Over the past six years, the annual growth in income of the bottom 30 per cent of the population has exceeded 9 per cent, while the top 30 per cent has grown at half that rate.Cláudio Felisoni, president of the Fundação Instituto de Administração, a business school, believes the increasing availability of credit to low-income groups is a key factor.Official data show the household debt-to-income ratio rose to 35 per cent last year, from 18 per cent at the beginning of 2005.Prof Felisoni’s research in São Paulo found 70 per cent of low earners own mobile telephones and 55 per cent have credit cards.Three big retailers, Pão de Açúcar, Carrefour and Walmart, are boosting their investment in businesses and strategies aimed at the lower-middle classes.McDonald’s is also investing. It announced this year it was focusing on “Minas Gerais and the states of the north and north-east.” The north and north-east are the poorest of the country’s five regions.In the Amazon, Bradesco, a big bank, last December launched a floating outlet on the River Solomões, that sails between Tabatinga and Manaus.However, the Terra Grande is Brazil’s first floating shop.Nestlé says the country’s C, D and E social classes – the “bottom of the pyramid”, or BOP – comprise 157m people who account for 72 per cent of food consumption.“BOP is the market, not simply a segment,” says Mr Costa. In 2006 Nestlé launched its Porta-a-Porta door-to-door project, using housewives as freelance sales reps. Today, 7,500 revendedores – resellers – earn R$750 a month from it, and are forecast to visit 3.2m homes this year.Nestlé has been in Brazil for almost 90 years. As the economy continues to grow quickly – the current growth rate is 7 per cent year-on-year – the company is hoping rising incomes among the poor will bring its higher priced goods within their reach.If the economy keeps on performing, this seems a safe bet. While 32m have moved up from the lower D and E classes over the past seven years, another 36m could follow in the next four, forecasts the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, a think tank.The Terra Grande only sells Nestlé products, and the absence of staples such as rice, beans and chicken, not to mention the dearth of fresh fruit or vegetables, would make it hard to cook a full meal after shopping there.Nevertheless, at Barcarena, as it prepares to leave, local encyclopedia salesman Luzeilton Costa enthuses. “The idea is really cool,” he says. “Today, you have to innovate and go after the customer.”
360;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-11-14T21:17:17Z;Rebound for Applebee’s as diners return;;With 2,000 restaurants across North America, Applebee’s is a fraction of the size of McDonald’s, the burger chain, but in the casual dining segment in the US, it is the largest player.DineEquity, Applebee’s parent company, reported this month that same store sales at the chain had grown 3.3 per cent for the quarter ended September over the comparable period in 2009, a clear indication of a rebound.In the US, the performance of casual dining chains such as Applebee’s reflects consumer confidence among the middle class customers that have fled the full-service restaurant segment since the financial crisis of 2008.“Casual dining is slowly coming back,” says Matthew DiFrisco, an analyst at Oppenheimer. “It’s a good barometer of the middle class.”Based on a recent visit to a New York City Applebee’s, the business seems to be on the mend.“Up until two months ago we were down 70 per cent compared with last year but it’s picking up now,” said Antonio Britto, a manager at an Applebee’s in the Bronx borough of New York. “Now we’re only down 9 per cent, which is great.”From families celebrating a baby’s baptism to couples who come once a week, everyone in the restaurant mentions Applebee’s two for $20 deal as a big incentive to dine here: for $20, diners can choose two main courses and an appetiser from a simple selection that includes steak, burgers and chicken salad.Kimberly Quezata, 25, sits eating dinner with her partner and two children on a Sunday evening. A social worker who lives nearby, she lost her job and was unemployed for six months during the recession. “I stopped going out for six months but now we come here about once a week,” she said.At the bar, sipping beer and watching a game of American football, Chris Quezada, 29, who works at Macy’s department store, said: “I’ve always come here, I might have cut down a little bit but I’ve started coming back more – the happy hour is enticing.”It is not just regular customers who are being lured through the doors, but higher-end diners who are trading down from more expensive eateries.“Business people have started coming in here during weekdays, for breakfast or lunch, people from the local hospitals or top management at the schools having meetings,” said Mr Britto, who said he thinks the good value offering will keep these newer customers returning even after the economy improves. “They’ll be back,” he says.
361;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-11-10T23:32:43Z;Choose tomorrow’s leader today;;"W ith so much hanging on successful leadership, you might expect boards to be experts at picking the perfect candidate to pilot their companies. Recent chief executive shake-outs at BP, Nokia and LG Electronics suggest otherwise.Concerns over succession are not confined to the handful of premature CEO departures that play out in the media spotlight. Berkshire Hathaway’s announcement last month of Todd Combs as an investment manager prompted speculation that he could be the chosen successor to 80-year-old Warren Buffett.In Creating People Advantage 2010, a recent global executive survey conducted by Boston Consulting Group and the World Federation of People Management Associations, half the respondents identified gaps in their ability to generate tomorrow’s CEOs. Yet, paradoxically, CEO succession ranks higher on boardroom agendas than ever.Treating succession as an “event, rather than a process or a discipline” is a common failing, says Roselinde Torres, a partner at BCG who leads the company’s leadership practice. History has a habit of repeating itself, she says: the loss of one CEO triggers a search, internal candidates are scrutinised and headhunters summoned. Then the directors make a choice and succession drops off the agenda – until next time.Yet sustained investment in succession can pay dividends. A long-standing policy of developing future leaders allowed McDonald’s to appoint the current CEO Jim Skinner to replace Jim Cantalupo and then Charlie Bell, who died within a year of each other, without hiring externally. Richard Floersch, chief human resources officer, says McDonald’s now requires managers right down to individual restaurants to name “ready-now” and “ready-future” candidates who could replace them. The relevant employees then agree on a career development plan.At Procter & Gamble, CEO Bob McDonald has had his feet under the desk for just over a year, but already half a dozen hopefuls are locked in competition to succeed him. Between now and the next succession, the contenders will be wined and dined, mentored and given development roles designed to reveal “how they stack up against each other”, says Moheet Nagrath, global HR officer. “It’s a constant process that takes place year in year out.”The P&G model resembles the General Electric horse race in which Jack Welch pitted successor Jeff Immelt against rival contenders James McNerney and Bob Nardelli, both of whom left to run other companies. While less of a gamble than grooming a single heir-apparent, who could fall from grace or be poached by a competitor, contests still need managing to deliver the best candidate.Getting succession on the agenda can be a challenge in itself. Although boards are ultimately responsible for CEO appointments, the fact that non-executives do not work in the business means that, in practice, it is the incumbent CEO, assisted by the chief human resources officer, who develops the succession pool and puts forward candidates. “If CEOs want to duck the succession issue they find ways of doing it,” says Joseph Bower, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of The CEO Within.Criteria for choosing between candidates are not hard and fast. If the outgoing CEO has done well, a business may be tempted to go for a clone who, it hopes, will do the same. But this risks picking leaders to fight yesterday’s battles. As Chip Goodyear, former CEO of BHP Billiton, puts it: “There’s not one right CEO [for a business].” A strong financial manager may suit a recession; whereas an upturn may favour an entrepreneur.At BHP Billiton, Mr Goodyear developed a handful of managers who could replace him. The board chose Marius Kloppers. But all the frontrunners, Mr Goodyear says, “could handle a CEO role”.Mr Goodyear, who joined BHP as chief financial officer, is himself no stranger to the highs and lows of leadership transition. Having parachuted into the CEO job in a leadership crisis in 2003, he transformed the organisation after its merger with Billiton into one of the world’s most successful mining businesses. Last year, however, he joined Temasek Holdings, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, as CEO-elect. But disagreements on strategy led to his appointment being terminated before he took up the role. Of this experience he merely comments: “When you come in from the outside …there are going to be risks.”Being involved part-time in the business means boards have limited chances to study candidates close up, potentially favouring the biggest self-promoters. One way round this, says Richard Emerton, a senior client partner at executive search group Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann, is to give candidates special projects so directors can “observe and interrogate them on a genuine business issue”. Better still, he adds, is if the incumbent can be prevailed upon to hand over some of his or her responsibilities so the board can watch how the contenders shape up in actual CEO roles.Persuading CEOs that this is a good idea could prove tough, however. In the October issue of the Harvard Business Review Anne Mulcahy, former CEO of Xerox, described how hard she had found it to “give up power and accountability” to Ursula Burns, her preferred successor.According to Shlomo Ben-Hur, a professor of leadership and organisational behaviour at IMD, thousands of years of human history have primed leaders to mistrust power-sharing: “As the chief of a tribe, you don’t necessarily want to assign a deputy. You want to remain [powerful] until the very end.”How much consideration should companies give to external candidates? Analysis by Booz & Co, the consultancy, suggests that internally appointed CEOs generate higher shareholder returns than external hires. But that is not to say companies can ignore the world outside. If competitors are generating better candidates, you need to know about it.One company hoping to break the rule that insiders outperform outsiders is Unilever. In 2008, its board selected Paul Polman, a former P&G and Nestlé executive, as its first externally appointed CEO. “We had three outstanding internal candidates. But Paul was better, so he got the job,” says Sandy Ogg, chief human resour­ces officer.The divisions that succession contests create can return to haunt a new leader. If the contest is bruising, there is a strong chance the defeated candidates will leave – followed shortly by their protégés and associates, who may have concluded that their own prospects look gloomy, with their guy out of the picture.P&G acted to forestall such an outcome. Before taking office, Mr McDonald sat down with Mr Nagrath and outgoing CEO A.G. Lafley to draw up a list of high-fliers at risk of leaving that he would get to know as soon as his appointment was announced. “If you don’t know the new leader,” Mr Nagrath says, “it’s only human nature to ask ‘where does that leave me?’”The appointment of a new CEO might solve the immediate problem of who will lead the company. But, if followed by an exodus of tomorrow’s rising stars, the problem won’t stay solved for long."

363;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-11-09T19:25:01Z;Carlsberg warns of beer price rises;;Carlsberg has warned of looming beer price increases, in the latest sign of pressure on consumers from rising global food prices, following poor harvests this year in some of the world’s most important bread baskets.The fourth-largest brewer by sales said it had been hit by soaring prices of barley and malt after the Russian drought in the summer, leaving consumers of brands such as Carlsberg, Tuborg and Kronenbourg with the prospect of bigger tabs at the bar.Carlsberg had told investors in August that it did not expect “any material impact” from higher raw material costs. But Jørgen Buhl Rasmussen, chief executive, admitted on Tuesday the company had made an underestimation.“We are facing higher input costs than previously expected and this will require price increases across most of our markets,” he told the Financial Times.Carlsberg’s shares fell 5 per cent in response to the warning.Global food prices have soared to their highest level since a peak in 2007-08 sparked riots across the developing world.McDonald’s and Kraft are among other companies to have announced plans to pass on higher costs to consumers, after the worst Russian drought on record was compounded by poor harvests in Brazil and parts of North America and Europe.Carlsberg is more heavily exposed than other brewers to Russian barley because of its dominant position in the Russian beer market, which accounts for almost half of company profits.Analysts said it was harder to secure long-term supplies and to hedge against price fluctuations in eastern Europe compared with more developed markets, increasing Carlsberg’s vulnerability.Trevor Stirling, analyst at Bernstein, predicted that Carlsberg would need to raise prices by 10-12 per cent in Russia to cover higher input costs. This was likely to slow recovery in a market already under pressure from a recent increase in taxation on beer as part of the Kremlin’s efforts to clamp down on alcoholism.Mr Rasmussen expected beer drinkers to endure higher prices, pointing to a 2 per cent rise in Russian sales in the third quarter. “Apart from higher input costs, all the indicators in eastern Europe are pointing in a positive direction.”Higher raw material prices threaten to slow recent gains in Carlsberg’s profit margins after two years of aggressive cost cuts. Net profits rose 31 per cent in the third quarter to DKr1.95bn ($362m).Recovery in Russia, combined with strong growth in Asia, lifted revenues 8 per cent to DKr17.08bn.Western Europe remained weak, with the overall beer market continuing to decline. But Carlsberg said it had gained over rivals share after a sharp rise in marketing investment.
364;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-11-08T22:11:52Z;Deal speculations lifts tech stocks;;"Deal speculation and an analyst upgrade for Hewlett-Packard helped the technology sector edge up while the broader S&P 500 fell. Hewlett-Packard rose 1.2 per cent to $44.25 after it was added to the UBS short term buy list.Analysts said holiday sales of computers and servers would drive fourth quarter results. But they kept its long term rating “neutral” on concerns of increasing competition.Intel was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” by UBS and given a price target of $25. Shares rose during the day but closed down 0.1 per cent at $21.23. Analysts predicted that the PC component inventory cycle had bottomed out and that the threat from tablet computers was included in the sales outlook.Amazon.com surged 0.7 per cent to $171.99 after the online retailer bought privately owned Quidsi, which owns diapers.com and soap.com. It paid $500m in cash for the company that will help it expand into baby care products.Yahoo rose 1.1 per cent to $16.44 after it was reported that the search engine operator could be exploring a tie-up with AOL. The latter’s shares climbed 4.7 per cent to $26.10.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,223.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.3 per cent to close at 11,406.84, but the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.1 at 2,580.05.Last week, stocks hit their highest levels in two years as investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s decision to extend quantitative easing and the Republican victory in the House of Representatives. David Bianco, head of US equity strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, comparing the market to last time the S&P 500 broke out above 1,200 in April, said: “There are many fundamental reasons for stocks to rally further.“Higher earnings per share has made the S&P cheaper today than in April. Currently, the S&P is trading at 13.8 times annualised third-quarter earnings per share compared with 15.2 times annualised first-quarter earnings per share in April.“We believe the rising likelihood of Congress passing a tax package before year-end can get the S&P close to 1,300.”Financials fell 0.8 per cent as regional banks continued to suffer since they reported their third-quarter results.The S&P 500 regional banking index slid 0.8 per cent with Regions Financial Corp losing 1.7 per cent to $6.34 and PNC Financial Services declining 1.3 per cent to $57.65.Analysts at Oppenheimer reaffirmed their “overweight” rating for the industrial sector but said they were selectively increasing risk exposure, looking at machinery and road and rail stocks. They said machinery stocks were attractive because they would benefit from new orders and construction spending trends. Analysts at Credit Suisse echoed this recommendation, saying the stocks were cheap.Oppenheimer analysts also said road and rail stocks were expected to increase their sales, earnings and margins at a higher rate than the overall sector in 2011 because of freight volumes and truck tonnage increasing significantly in recent months.The S&P 500 industrials sector lost 0.3 per cent.But manufacturing and construction company Fluor added 2.2 per cent to $55.72 and rail transport stocks CSX and Union Pacific both edged up.CSX rose 0.7 per cent to $62.23 and Union Pacific, which benefited from an upgrade at Credit Suisse, was up 0.8 per cent to $91.98. Also in industrials, Boeing shares fell in spite of a $3.3bn order from Saudi Arabian Airlines for 12 aircraft and were lower by
1.5 per cent at $70.21.In materials, General Steel Holdings fell 6.8 per cent to $2.76 after the Chinese group reported a surprise third-quarter loss as it suffered from higher prices of iron ore and coking coal.McDonald’s was almost flat at $79.31 after it reported its global sales in October. The rise of 6.5 per cent was helped in recent months by sales of smoothies and its dollar menu but the increase in the US was lower than analysts had forecast. Sysco, which distributes food for the food service industry, fell 2.7 per cent to $29.23 after it reported its earnings were squeezed by higher food and commodity costs."
365;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-11-05T18:54:26Z;Starbucks;Howard Schultz’s return to the helm appears to be working;Inspirational founder leaves business in the hands of mere managers. Overambition and innovations muddy a company’s clear cultural waters. The founder returns, makes smart decisions and reinvigorates staff. Shareholders cheer.Such stories do not always go to plan, but so far Howard Schultz’s return to the helm at Starbucks appears to be working. Results this week confirmed that the world’s largest chain of coffee shops has its buzz back. Higher traffic and higher prices boosted growth and operating margins. Forecasts were raised.Part of that turnround is due to changes that only someone with Mr Schultz’s credibility could accomplish. Coffee aficionados might have scowled at the decision to introduce flavoured coffees and the introduction of Starbucks-branded instant coffee. But Via notched up $135m of sales in its first year, and the move to end a distribution arrangement with Kraft indicates further take-home ambitions.The group has also learnt to live with competition from the fast-food chains, focusing efforts on customers prepared to spend a little more on their morning coffee. Indeed, McDonald’s efforts to sell cappuccinos indicates expansion of the overall market for quality coffee, ultimately creating more demand for Starbucks’ premium product. Wine and food in some prestige locations may be ways to extract more cash from existing customers.Starbucks’ shares have quadrupled since the 2008 low. On 24 times prospective earnings, they trade on a higher multiple than McDonald’s has achieved at any point in the past decade, even though the burger chain’s 31 per cent operating margin is twice that of Starbucks and sales growth is only slightly slower.

366;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-11-04T02:54:43Z;Executive quits Accor after ‘differences’;;Gilles Pélisson, executive chairman of Accor, is to quit the hotels group co-founded by his uncle after “strategic differences” with core shareholders and the board.He is to be replaced by Denis Hennequin, chairman and chief executive of McDonald’s Europe and an Accor director since last year.Mr Hennequin joined the board after the mass resignation in February 2009 of six directors in protest at growing control of Colony Capital and Eurazeo, the private equity groups which together own 29 per cent of Accor.The sudden departure of Mr Pélisson comes five months after he pushed through a split of the group’s hotels and services businesses, a move supported by Colony and Eurazeo but opposed by a number of former directors and by the FSI, the French sovereign wealth fund.The promotion of the 53-year old Mr Pélisson from chief executive to executive chairman triggered last year’s boardroom split, after the directors, including Serge Weinberg, the then chairman, argued that concentrating both roles in the hands of one person posed serious corporate governance problems given the size of the Colony and Eurazeo stake.Mr Pélisson pressed ahead with plans to sell off hotel properties in favour of management contracts and franchises after the hotel business was demerged from the services unit, now called Edenred, in June.The board said Accor had moved into “a new phase in its development, during which the definition of priorities and their execution will be key factors in its success.”It is the second time Accor has lost a chief executive since Colony and Eurazeo started their stakebuilding.Within six months of Colony’s original €1bn ($1.4bn) investment in 2005, Jean-Marc Espalioux quit suddenly as chief executive to be replaced by Mr Pélisson.A former chief executive of Euro Disney and Bouygues Telecom, he is also a nephew of Gérard Pélisson, Accor’s co-founder.Philippe Citerne, vice-chairman, praised Mr Pélisson on Wednesday for his “crucial contribution to Accor’s development”.Mr Pélisson said in a statement he was “proud” to be leaving Accor in “the best of health” but could not reached for further comment.Mr Pélisson will stay as chairman until January 15 2011 and is expected to leave with a two-year pay-off of not more than €5m.One source close to the company said the two had decided to part company over a series of disagreements linked to the future growth of Accor as a standalone hotels business. The board’s decision appears to have been unanimous save for one abstention.Mr Hennequin, who has spent 26 years with McDonald’s, is expected to accelerate Accor’s franchise operations. He will take over as chief executive on December 1 and become executive chairman once Mr Pélisson leaves.
367;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Food price rises stoke riot fears;;"Food prices have soared to lev­els last seen in the 2007-08 crisis after a big October rise, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation said on Tuesday.The increase will renew fears about a repetition of the wave of food riots that rocked poor countries from Bangladesh to Haiti two years ago.Higher agricultural commodities costs will also hit consumers in richer countries, with food companies such as McDonald’s and Kraft already announcing price rises for 2011.“The situation has deteriorated rapidly,” said Abdolreza Abbassian, economist at the FAO in Rome, adding that prices were “getting closer to the levels of 2008”.The FAO said its price index, a basket of wheat, corn, rice, oilseeds, dairy products, sugar and meats, jumped last month to 197.1 points – up nearly 5 per cent from September and the highest level in more than two years.The index has now surpassed the levels seen during the early stages of the 2007 food crisis, and it is only below the peak of the calamity between February and July of 2008.“Prospects for improvements are very limited,” said Mr Abbassian, echoing a view widely held among crop commodities traders.Until recently, the FAO had predicted that food prices would fall soon, but now officials are concerned that high costs could continue well into next year or even rise further. Wheat planting in the breadbasket region of the Black Sea is well below expectations, prompting forecasts of another low crop in 2011.Moscow said last week that Russia’s farmers were set to plant about 15.5m hectares of winter grain crops this year – down from an earlier forecast of 18m hectares. Russia has banned grain exports until mid-2011 while Ukraine has put quotas on wheat, corn and barley, limiting overseas sales.The rally in global food cost in October was led by sugar prices, which hit a 30-year high on Tuesday, and costlier corn, soyabeans and milk.The FAO drew comfort from relatively stable prices for wheat and rice, the two more important cereals for global food security, which remain far below their all-time highs. Wheat and rice are the staple of 5bn people in Asia and Africa.Rice hit an all-time high of over $1,000 a tonne in mid-2008, but traded last week at $505. Wheat hit a record $12.5 a bushel in February 2008 and traded at $7 a bushel on Tuesday.
●Legislators in Ukraine approved a law permitting the sale of grain-export quotas imposed last month.The measure was backed on first reading by 249 members of the 450-seat parliament in Kiev. It needs approval in two more readings and President Viktor Yanukovich’s signature to take effect.Ukraine, the world’s largest barley exporter in the year that ended in September, has capped outbound shipments of all grains at 2.7m tonnes for the rest of 2010 to avoid domestic shortages after dry summer weather damaged crops. The quotas exclude 2m tonnes of corn to be sent to Russia. Surging food prices are pushing Ukrainian inflation higher.“Ukraine can export a maximum 6m tonnes of grain from now [until] the end of the marketing year [in June],” Hryhoriy Kalyetnik, of Mr Yanukovich’s Regions party and the law’s sponsor, told parliament. “Export-quota sale at auctions will increase transparency in quota distribution.”"
368;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-11-02T16:56:04Z;Investors gauge election bounce;;Even though Republicans, touting business-friendly policies, appear set to take control of the US House of Representatives from Democrats, analysts are far from certain about the potential for a positive bounce for the US stock market.Historically, US markets have performed extremely well in the fourth quarter of a midterm year, following the typical loss of seats for the president’s party in the midterm election.The S&P 500 index has not made a total return of less than 10 per cent in such a quarter since 1950, according to figures from LPL Financial. UBS research shows that the year after a midterm, the S&P 500 sees a median price increase of nearly 20 per cent.Stock markets tend to prize political gridlock, believing fewer new regulations will emerge and less government deficit spending will keep borrowing rates low. A study by Fidelity Investments found that large-cap stocks saw average price gains of 23 per cent during the four periods of gridlock – a split in party control of the White House and both houses of Congress – since 1970.Some of those gains will already be priced in, however, in part because gridlock to some degree has been the rule in Washington since Democrats lost their 60th vote in the Senate. Only a surprise Republican seizure of the Senate could be a near-term catalyst for further gridlock-led gains.Other factors will also limit the effect. The largest looming change resulting from increased clout for the Republicans – an agreement to extend the Bush tax cuts, which would lower government revenues by $500bn, according to the Congressional Budget Office – will probably not be resolved to the market’s satisfaction by the election.“The changes may not be permanent,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. “A one-year extension of current tax rates may not be as welcome as a [permanent] resolution of the tax rate uncertainty.”A report on deficits by a bipartisan committee set for December could be a much more important event for clarity on tax cuts, analysts said, as a recommendation to extend would provide cover for Democrats who may face frustration from their own base if they agree to cuts.If such changes do come to pass, higher-yielding stocks could rally as investors look to take advantage of the extended tax break to pocket dividends.“High dividend-paying sectors such as telecoms and utilities may benefit. Cash-rich companies in other sectors may also benefit as they introduce or substantially increase their dividend payout as they look to attract a new class of investors seeking yield,” said Mr Kleintop.Many strategists have argued that the S&P 500 index has been discounted in 2010 due to uncertainty created by the tax expiration, heavier regulation and deficit spending. The S&P has risen just 6 per cent so far this year, even as earnings-per-share are projected to increase 35 per cent this year.Thomas Doerflinger, strategist at UBS, termed recent policies such as healthcare reform, financial regulation, a Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium and the tax rises likely to follow from deficit spending, “the Great Suppression”.“It should be positive for equities if the 2010 elections begin a policy shift toward lower taxes, less spending, and lighter regulation,” he said.He warned, however, that the Republican victory would not represent an immediate reversal of the “Great Suppression”. He said he was watching for a “tax holiday” on a repatriation of foreign earnings, which could signal a significant shift in the balance of power.Economists at RBS warned that a sizable victory may also raise expectations of Republican victory in the 2012 presidential election, and could hinder the economy over the next two years.“Hopes of a more business-friendly fiscal agenda, if the Republicans sweep both the presidency and Congress in 2012, could keep companies from aggressively hiring and capital spending near-term,” said Michelle Girard and Omair Sharif of RBS.The circumstances of this election are also historically unique, coming on the eve of what is expected to be a massive intervention by the US Federal Reserve in the form of “quantitative easing”.Bruce Bittles, equity strategist at Robert W. Baird, said the expected election result would not be a strong catalyst itself, instead only raising the relative importance of the Fed as an economic actor.“If we get political gridlock in Washington, as expected, the Federal Reserve will be the one left with any ability to provide stimulus to the economy,” he said.Economists at Société Générale suggested that changing course could unravel the gains seen as “QE2” has been priced in, and from a cheap dollar powering global revenues at multinational groups.“New fiscal stimulus, more likely [if the Democrats retain significant power], could prove potent, particularly when combined with further monetary easing,” they said. “The increased presence of conservatives could lead to premature fiscal tightening, which would be a negative for the economy, and risky assets.”The economy is also not in a typical position. In the 1980s and 1990s, gridlock was prized because it was not to going to upset already strong growth. The 1994 Republican sweep into power in Congress saw the S&P 500 index return 30 per cent in the fourth quarter of that year.The poorest showing for the market after a midterm election was in 1978, when inflation was rampant and investors were frustrated that the government was not cutting spending faster. The S&P rose 12 per cent.In an environment with high unemployment and deflation, gridlock may similarly not be as valuable to the market.Richard Soultanian of Nus Consulting, who advises companies on financial decisions, said: “Gridlock can be a positive when the country’s underlying economy and fiscal situation are in good order. Today this is not the case …The act of doing nothing will hamper the global economic recovery rather than accelerating it.”
369;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-10-28T18:30:35Z;Pressured exchanges evaluate options;;If one word describes the US equity options industry, it is “fragmented”.First, liquidity has fractured, following the introduction in 2007 of penny pricing, an initiative by the Securities and Exchange Commission to quote options prices in one-cent increments rather than the traditional 5-cent or 10-cent jumps.This has meant that for all but a handful of the most liquid stock options, the size of displayed bids and offers has plunged – to 10- and 20-lots when they were formerly in the thousands.But the market itself has fragmented, with sharp growth in recent years in the number of options exchanges. On Friday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the original and still the biggest options exchange, will add to this fragmentation with the launch of C2, an all-electronic trading platform taking the total number of US options exchanges to nine.The increase in the number of exchanges has made the options marketplace fiercely competitive, with rivals fighting tooth-and-nail for fractions of market share. Some exchanges accuse others of forgoing profitability so as to increase their slice of the business. The single-minded pursuit of market share has made some aspects of the industry look dysfunctional.C2’s launch has prompted some to ask what benefit yet another exchange brings to the market and to pose the broader question of how the industry can “grow the pie” by attracting more volume, rather than cutting it into ever-smaller pieces.For the CBOE – which had its initial public offering in June – the new venture holds out the possibility of clawing back some of the market share it has lost in recent years.Part-floor-traded, part-electronic, the exchange’s fee structure is a traditional “payment for order flow” system in which customers trade for free, but marketmakers pay a fee that is redistributed back through them to pay broker-dealers for providing customer order flow.The exchange has lost market share in part because of the growth of electronic exchanges with “maker-taker” fees, a model adopted from the equities market in which traders get paid rebates for trades which are deemed to “make”, or add overall liquidity to the exchange. By contrast, traders are charged for trades that “take” liquidity off the exchange.To try to steal back some of this market, the CBOE will also adopt “maker-taker” fees for C2. It hopes this will enable it to appeal to the algorithmic traders who are increasingly important in the market, and is locating C2 in New York to attract the high-frequency traders based there who currently focus on equities.By having both a traditional and an electronic maker-taker platform, the CBOE aims to emulate the pricing flexibility enjoyed by NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, each of which operates two US options exchanges.Yet by launching with popular options on stocks such as Ford, AT&T and McDonald’s, using a fee model already used by several other exchanges, some say the CBOE is bringing little new to the market.“We’re not growing the market with adding another exchange, I will confess that,” says Ed Tilly, CBOE executive vice-chairman, “but this enables us to handle all our customer needs from an order-handling perspective.”The CBOE is trying to appeal to existing customers for whom certain strategies can be executed more efficiently and cheaply on C2, as well as to avoid having to route orders to other exchanges when it does not have the best pricing. Yet there is a danger that the new platform could end up cannibalising trading volume from its parent exchange.“If it’s simply a fully electronic, high-speed, technology-enabled platform that replicates what exists already, it’s going to steal market share both from their competitors as well as from CBOE,” says Andy Nybo, head of derivatives at the Tabb Group.That points up a central criticism of the way the overall market has evolved. In seeking market share, some industry experts say, exchanges are engaging in a range of practices that are harmful to the overall industry.Through their fee structures, some exchanges are in effect paying customers to trade with them, taking a loss in order to increase volumes. Exchange groups such as Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext, BATS and now the CBOE can afford to subsidise unprofitable trading platforms for the time being, but the phenomenon raises the question of the sustainability of that model – even if options volumes return to their pre-crisis growth rates.The International Securities Exchange, one of the biggest options-trading platforms, accuses rival Nasdaq OMX’s PHLX market of inflating its volumes by allowing “dividend trades”, in which professional traders profit at the expense of retail investors who fail to convert options into shares in time for dividends.A further 10 per cent of the market is thought to be simply high-frequency traders arbitraging fees between the exchanges to collect rebates without actually using options as part of an investing strategy.While exchanges continue to squabble over market share, experts say the industry needs innovative product offerings to expand overall volumes. One important innovation would be if C2 were to introduce electronic trading of “SPX” – options on the S&P 500 index, a hugely popular proprietary product now principally traded in the CBOE’s biggest trading pit in Chicago.Mr Tilly says that proposal is being reviewed by regulators, with a launch targeted for next year. However, he could face significant opposition from the CBOE’s own trading floor, where traders would not be keen to see their wide spreads contract on an electronic market.“That pit has long resisted any idea of going electronic,” says Mark Longo, a former SPX trader who now runs the Options Insider, an options education website. “They have a monopoly now – if you want to trade SPX you have to come to the floor and trade their wide markets. The CBOE might have a big internal fight on their hands there.”www.ft.com/tradingroom
370;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-10-26T18:07:04Z;Indian poultry group closes in on Blackburn;;Blackburn Rovers is on the brink of being acquired by Venky’s, an Indian poultry group, in the latest takeover deal involving an English Premier League football club.The deal, if completed, would make the Mumbai-listed company – which supplies chicken to south Asian outlets of fast food giants such as KFC, McDonald’s and Pizza Hut – the first Indian group to own a Premier League club.It would also make Blackburn the latest Premier League to club fall under foreign ownership. Liverpool was this month bought by New England Sports Ventures, owners of the Boston Red Sox baseball team.Talks to buy Blackburn, which won the premiership title in 1995, are expected to value the indebted north English club at about £46m ($73m), B Venkatesh Rao, managing director of Venky’s, told Indian news channels.John Williams, Blackburn chairman, said he hoped to sell the club to the Rao family by next month.“A series of meetings, including discussions with the Premier League, have followed an extensive due diligence process. Both parties are hopeful that the transaction will be completed in November,” he said in a statement.According to Deloitte, Blackburn’s debts last year were £20m while revenues were £51m, and the club made a pre-tax profit of £3.6m. The club’s Ewood Park stadium has a 31,000 capacity, but average attendances last season were only 25,000.Mr Rao said it was a “prestigious moment” for Venky’s to be on the verge of completing the deal. He added that the family owned group would have to pump more money into the club but declined to give details.Venkateshwara Hatcheries, the Rao family’s holding company, has a market value of about of $450m, according to the company.The group, which also has a pharmaceutical arm, operates in 17 countries.It is run by 47-year-old Anuradha Desai, who took over from her father Banda Vasudev Rao who founded his first poultry farm with 500 birds.Although football is far from being the most popular sport in India – the world’s most populous cricket-playing and watching nation – the fan base for the game is slowly growing.Ahsan Ali Syed, an Indian investor based in the Gulf, was in talks with Blackburn earlier this year, but failed to reach an agreement with management.
371;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-10-21T22:58:09Z;McDonald’s lifted by frappes and smoothies;;"McDonald’s reported a 6 per cent improvement in same-store sales for the third quarter of 2010, in spite of rising food costs and sluggish economic conditions.The company said its revenues were $6.3bn, a 4 per cent increase over the same period of 2009, and its net income was $1.4bn, a 10 per cent improvement.In spite of the performance, management warned investors that the company was easing off on its capital expenditure budget for renovating existing restaurants for the remainder of this year. The company also warned that increases in the cost of its “goods basket” – which includes food and packaging materials – might lead to selective price increases of some menu items in 2011.The hamburger chain reported a 5.3 per cent increase in sales at its US restaurants; a 4.1 per cent increase in Europe, where restaurant dining has decreased; and an 8.1 per cent upswing in the rest of the world.“The global economy remains fragile and consumers remain cautious,” said Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive, in a conference call with analysts.While the same-store sales numbers in McDonald’s home market have been strong in recent months, the performance in Europe surprised some analysts, especially after weak August numbers had raised questions about business on the continent.The company attributed the August hiccup to a weak performance in France, which did not participate in a promotion involving the giveaway of a free Coca-Cola glass with the purchase of a Happy Meal or similar product. The glass promotion turned out to be a hit in Germany and elsewhere, McDonald’s said.“While the overall eating out category in Europe was in decline, we continued to gain share,” said Mr Skinner.In the US, the company attributed its performance to the addition of profitable new drinks, such as frappes and smoothies, which carry high margins.The restaurant chain is also pushing its franchise base to increase their hours of operation. In the US, close to 40 per cent of McDonald’s restaurants are now open 24 hours a day, and 80 per cent of the US stores are open by 5am.The company said that US results so far in October indicate a continued same-store-sales increase of 5 to 6 per cent in the near term.McDonald’s said it expected commodity costs to rise by about 2 per cent in Europe, and labour costs to follow a similar path.The spectre of value-added taxes is also likely to push the chain to increase what it charges for its meals."
372;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-10-20T17:09:01Z;Dependable stocks are cheap – and an opportunity;UK household names deserve to trade at premium in difficult times;The phrase “nifty fifty” conjures mixed emotions in those able to remember that particular episode in investment history.The saga ended badly, with shares that had enjoyed extraordinary popularity as part of this elite band of “one-decision” stocks performing catastrophically through the bear market of 1973/74. Enduring household names such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Walt Disney and American Express were among these companies and their share prices fell by more than 60 per cent in the two years to the end of 1974, compared with a decline of 40 per cent in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This was despite possessing characteristics that should, under most circumstances, have allowed them to outperform such difficult market conditions.This extreme underperformance can be explained by one word: valuation. The incredible status these shares enjoyed prior to the bear market took valuations to unsustainable levels. Walt Disney had traded at 80 times earnings. McDonald’s and Coca-Cola were at 70 and 50 times, respectively, and American Express was a relative steal at 38 times. Operationally, they proved dependable throughout what was a period of muted growth for the US economy, but their valuations could not be sustained.There are clear parallels with the late-1990s bubble, although the nifty fifty at least had enduring characteristics deserving of some sort of valuation premium. It is important to remember that the nifty fifty enjoyed such a reputation because they offered dependable growth. Dependability in stock market terms equates to quality, and quality deserves a premium.So what can today’s investor learn from this? When growth is hard to come by for the wider economy, investors are prepared to pay for companies that can provide growth in shareholder returns no matter what the economy throws at them.It is interesting, therefore, that shares in some of the UK’s most dependable businesses currently trade at unusually low valuations. AstraZeneca, Vodafone and BAE Systems all trade on single-digit price/earnings multiples, representing a substantial discount to the market as a whole. GlaxoSmithKline, Imperial Tobacco and Scottish and Southern Energy also trade at p/e discounts to the market.Dividends from these businesses look safe, are likely to grow, and provide an attractive income yield that is very difficult to replicate from any other asset class – unusually these businesses’ own corporate bonds provide a yield substantially less than their dividend yield. The asset class as a whole is now cheap but, despite obvious dependable characteristics – operating in resilient, non-cyclical industries, with proven records of consistent growth in earnings and dividends – these shares are cheaper than the market and are inexpensive compared to historic valuations. These businesses face challenges but they can influence their own destiny in a way that companies more vulnerable to the economic cycle cannot.There is no doubt in my mind that the economic outlook remains challenging. Credit growth is largely absent, banks continue to repair balance sheets and consumers remain intent on rebuilding their finances following a prolonged period of debt-fuelled spending. Deleveraging will remain a dominant theme for many years and growth will be lacklustre, with deflation a greater threat than inflation. The proposed fiscal consolidation brings further risks domestically and much of the west faces similar challenges. Asia and Latin America look better placed but they cannot fully detach themselves from the developed world. The precarious entanglement of the US and China highlights how intertwined the global economy has become. There is no easy way out.The economic outlook is fraught with uncertainty, so to me it is inexplicable that the stock market is not embracing certainty or dependability where it can find it. Perhaps it is because investment horizons appear to be getting shorter and shorter, encouraging brief bursts of risk on/risk off activity that seem to characterise current markets, stimulated by the latest batch of economic data. Or maybe the whole asset class is out of favour – the current yield on UK equities relative to other asset classes suggests this is so. Whatever the reason, fundamentals are being ignored.In time, I believe companies with dependable characteristics will be valued more sensibly. I’m not suggesting these shares deserve to trade on valuations similar to the nifty fifty, but a valuation premium for dependability is normal and justified. In difficult economic times, the quality premium deserves to be even bigger than usual and I strongly believe that, ultimately, the premium will be restored. Patience is required, but in the meantime, the combination of dividend yield and dividend growth from dependable growth companies should result in very satisfactory returns for investors, even without the implicit re-rating.Neil Woodford is head of investment at Invesco Perpetual
373;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-10-13T22:44:05Z;CBOE to launch electronic options market;;The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options-trading venue, said on Wednesday it plans to launch a new, all-electronic exchange on October 29. It will be the US’s ninth options exchange.C2, the new exchange, represents the CBOE’s attempt to attract a bigger slice of the high-frequency securities trading market. It will be based in New York, to enable the fastest access for firms based there, and will use “maker-taker” pricing, a model adopted from the equities market in which trading firms get paid rebates for “making” liquidity and customers are charged for “taking” liquidity.“Maker-taker” is markedly different from the “payment for order flow” system used at the CBOE, in which customers trade free, but market-makers pay a fee that is redistributed back through them to pay broker-dealers for providing customer order flow.The new exchange will enter an already crowded and fragmented market in which options exchanges hotly contest every fraction of market share. Since several electronic exchanges already use “maker-taker” fees, some critics charge C2 will bring nothing new to the market.However, the CBOE could significantly grow the electronic options market if it were to introduce trading options on SPX, the S&P 500 index, a hugely popular proprietary product now principally traded on the floor in Chicago.CBOE said C2 would begin on its first day with options on Ford and within the first week would roll out trading on AT&T, Merck, McDonald’s, Texas Instruments, Xerox, and exchange traded funds on the S&P 500 Depositary Receipts, PowerShares QQQ Trust and iShares Russell 2000 index.The exchange said C2 would be “capable” of listing exclusive products such as SPX, and said “plans for those products [are] expected to be announced at a later date”.It said that more than 30 firms had already connected or were in the process of connecting to C2. Market-makers would pay $5,000 a month to access the exchange while regular trading access would cost $1,000 per month.The International Securities Exchange, an all-electronic exchange owned by Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, that is one of the CBOE’s fiercest rivals, has also said it is considering launching a second exchange. Both NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX operate two US options exchanges.The CBOE has filed a petition for a “declaratory judgment” from an Illinois federal court in an attempt to pre-empt litigation from the ISE that could re-ignite a five-year-old case in which the ISE sued the CBOE, claiming the Chicago-based company had infringed on its patent for an automated order-matching system. That case is not yet resolved.The CBOE said on Wednesday that it did not know when a decision would come in its request for a judgment, but that the issue would not delay the launch of C2 as planned.
374;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:00+0000;China: How to share in forecast renminbi rises;;The long march towards a truly international Chinese currency has recently taken some small but highly significant steps. In August, hamburger chain McDonald’s became a trailblazer in the renminbi-denominated bond market, as it issued $29m of debt in Hong Kong – a first by a western company.In Malaysia the ringgit hit a 13-year high after China opened up currency trading channels between the two countries over the summer.Another precedent was set in early August, when Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) allowed an Indonesian client of Chinese technology company Huawei access to a $50m credit line in renminbi, a first for a non-Chinese company.Nicholas Kwan, chief Asia economist at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong, says the renminbi will be the biggest global currency story of the next 10 years.“In the coming decade we will see the birth of a new international currency. It may not quite rival the euro or the US dollar, but certainly it will be on a par with the smaller currencies like sterling, the Swiss franc and even, in some respects, the Japanese yen.”However, Mr Kwan says the renminbi is still a long way off becoming a true reserve currency, principally due to its lack of convertibility. Central banks cannot include renminbi holdings as official reserves under International Monetary Fund guidelines.The internationalisation of the currency has been progressing steadily in recent months, but currency flexibility has been much slower in coming. In June the Chinese authorities loosened the renminbi’s dollar peg, reopening the trading band back to its pre-crisis levels of plus or minus 0.5 per cent a day from a reference point set daily by the state. The Chinese currency had been firmly pegged to the US dollar since the onset of the credit crisis in 2008.The results of this renewed flexibility were initially rather muted, with the Chinese currency experiencing increased volatility during August rather than appreciation. GaveKal-Dragonomics, a Hong Kong-based research house, wrote in a note that this was an intentional policy.“China has allowed for more ‘volatility’ since it began appreciating mid-summer. We expect more of the same – perhaps as a tactic to throw off traders and minimise ‘hot money’ inflows.”Despite the added risk of depreciating, the renminbi has, since the start of September, recorded a series of highs against the dollar. Analysts are expecting further appreciation in the coming months. Qing Wang, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, sees the renminbi hitting 6.60 by the end of the year, and 6.20 by year end 2011.“We believe the renminbi is substantially undervalued and that its appreciation will be a multi-year phenomenon,” wrote Mr Wang in a client note.Both the rate and level of appreciation are still dictated more by politics than by economics. Mr Kwan says that while the economic fundamentals might support a 20 per cent rise, politics will probably push Chinese policymakers towards a 5-10 per cent appreciation over a number of years. Richard Yetsenga, head of FX strategy at HSBC in Hong Kong, points to an annual 2 per cent rise.But the question for investors is how to get exposure.Rule changes over the summer mean banks in Hong Kong can now open up renminbi bank accounts. Companies and financial groups can also buy deliverable renminbi in the Hong Kong market, helping to create a $100bn offshore market for China’s currency. Now the channels exist, Mr Yetsenga expects the supply of renminbi to go up dramatically. “More renminbi-denominated assets should follow,” he said.For individual investors, the options are limited. Those with Hong Kong residency permits can buy up to HK$20,000 (US$2,600) a day of renminbi. But for now, global investors will have to invest via a fund.Non-deliverable forwards – essentially a futures derivative on the Chinese currency – do offer investors a chance to buy the renminbi’s rise. However, Mr Yetsenga points out that the market is already pricing in a 1.2 per cent rise over the next year.Mr Yetsenga sees the potential for other regional currencies to appreciate more than the renminbi in coming months and years.But, despite the renminbi’s newfound volatility, its lack of dramatic price fluctuations still makes it attractive for the more cautious investor.“While a currency like the South Korean won may be a very attractive long-term investment, it could leave you with some sleepless nights,” he says.“By comparison, the renminbi looks like a reasonably stable investment.”
375;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-09-19T17:33:35Z;US groups warn on lawsuit proposals;;Plans to force US companies to disclose potential losses from any class action lawsuits that could have a severe impact are provoking a backlash, spearheaded by more than 140 of the biggest US businesses.Companies warn the proposals will fuel America’s class action industry, offering plaintiffs’ attorneys a “road map” to the level of damages to seek and making shareholder-friendly settlements more difficult.The companies fear new rules would open up a front in the ongoing war between corporate America and the attorneys who specialise in bringing hundreds of class actions each year, in lawsuits that are often settled for a tiny proportion of the headline claim.In addition, there are expectations that the proposals could trigger litigation against businesses that make inaccurate estimates of future losses.“The only folks who benefit from this are people on the plaintiffs’ bar, who would love more information about what companies deem the value of litigation may be,” Susan Hackett, senior vice-president of the Association of Corporate Counsel, told the Financial Times.The Financial Accounting Standards Board proposals would require companies to report publicly far more information on the potential costs of ongoing litigation, including a running tally of the estimated or accrued amounts for each class of claim.Companies would have to disclose their estimated liability for claims that could have a severe impact, even if they had only a “remote” chance of success. Companies would also have to disclose reports in reputable scientific journals of potentially significant liabilities related to their products or operations, even if no claim had been brought.The FASB declined to comment on the concerns. But its discussion document said the new regime would help improve information for shareholders, avoiding unpleasant surprises when companies disclosed accruals for expected losses.So far, 140 companies have signed a response objecting to the planned rules that will be submitted on Monday by the Association of Corporate Counsel, while others have expressed their concerns separately.Companies objecting to the proposals include AT&T, Bank of America, Citigroup, Coca-Cola, Ford Motor, General Electric, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and McDonald’s.
376;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Soros and Paulson lead hedge fund table;;The top 10 hedge fund managers have earned more than $153bn for their investors since they were founded, a third of the 7,000-strong industry’s returns, latest research shows.Since they opened, George Soros’s Quantum fund and John Paulson’s Paulson & Co have together made more money than Walt Disney or McDonald’s.Paulson’s returns – $26.4bn – are only just short of the net income of Boeing since Mr Paulson opened the firm in 1994.The study by LCH Investments, an investor in hedge funds managed by the Edmond de Rothschild Group, comes as some money managers look more closely at hedge fund returns. Investors typically pile into a fund after strong returns, missing out on the best years.Rick Sopher, chairman of LCH, said what most of the top funds had in common was that they strictly controlled capital inflows, so that they did not become too big to hurt their strategies.David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management, for example, has earned investors $12.4bn yet runs only $12.5bn after regular cash returns.However, several top managers said a lack of market direction was making trading tough.Louis Bacon, whose Moore Capital came eighth, said multiple smaller countries were influencing the markets as credit worries came to the fore.“The markets have become like the European Union in that there are so many people that have a seat at the table,” he said. “It waters down the leadership and confuses the focus, causing more commotion than direction.”
377;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-09-10T15:34:09Z;Breakfast sales boost JD Wetherspoon profits;;"A continued programme of new pub openings and the increasing popularity of its breakfasts and coffees have helped to buoy full-year sales at JD Wetherspoon, with revenues particularly buoyant toward the end of the summer.Total sales rose just over 4 per cent for the full year to July, although most of these sales increases came from new pubs; the group opened 47 new pubs during the year, taking its total estate to 775 pubs.Like-for-like sales, which exclude the impact of new pub openings, were only up 0.1 per cent during the year. But there was a marked improvement towards the end of the 12-month period, with like-for-like sales up 1.5 per cent in the six weeks to September.Some of the improvement toward the end of the financial year can be attributed to earlier opening hours.In April, more than 90 per cent of Wetherspoon pubs began opening at 7am, allowing the group to serve breakfasts, and in the past year it served 400,000 breakfasts and 600,000 coffees each week. Last year, when the group did not break down the figures, JD Wetherspoon sold a combined 715,000 breakfasts and coffees per week.“The 7am opening has had an encouraging start,” said Keith Down, finance director of JD Wetherspoon.“In breakfasts we’re second only to McDonald's and in coffee we’re third only to Starbucks and Costa Coffee so [breakfast and coffee] is a big area for us.”Pre-tax profits for the year increased 3.4 per cent to £60m on revenues that rose 4.3 per cent to £996m. Excluding exceptional items, pre-tax profits rose 7.3 per cent to £71m. Earnings per share rose 61 per cent to 29.3p. JD Wetherspoon paid a full-year dividend of 19p, 7p of which was a special dividend.Shares in JD Wetherspoon fell 3.6p to 439.9p.The proverbial early bird catches the worm, and for JD Wetherspoon, the early birds have helped the group to turn round falling food sales. At the half-year, before early opening was introduced, the group’s like-for-like food sales were down 1 per cent. But by the year-end, like-for-like sales of food were up 0.1 per cent, a catch-up that was built on a foundation of several million sausages and coffees. This superior food performance compares with sales of drinks that fell 0.8 per cent, and thus marks a reversal of Wetherspoon’s traditional strength in drinks and relative weakness in food. The group’s shares are on a forward p/e of just under 12, compared with Mitchells & Butlers on 10. Growing food sales are being built at the expense of margin in the short term. But investors may judge that the potential of Wetherspoon’s food market and its continued expansion programme justifies this premium."
378;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;McDonald’s reports rise in sales;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast-food chain, reported that its same-store sales for August were up 4.9 per cent globally year-on-year.This continues the company’s run of strong monthly revenues, but disappointed analysts who expected better numbers, particularly in Europe.In the US, McDonald’s continued to outperform other fast food chains with a 4.6 per cent increase in sales over the previous August, when same store sales were up only 1.7 per cent from the 2008 totals. Analysts had been expecting a 4.4 per cent increase.In Europe, the company reported a 2.2 per cent rise in monthly sales over its August 2009 totals, well below consensus estimates of a 5.2 per cent rise, and below the 3.5 per cent gains posted last year over the chain’s August 2008 same-store sales on the continent.McDonald’s said its performance in the UK and Russia was strong, but that gains in those markets were offset by weakness in France. The company noted that seasonal specials – such as the promotion of summer barbecue foods in the UK – helped drive strong sales there.“France hurt them and it is a value issue,” said Matthew DiFrisco, an analyst with Oppenheimer. “They will likely try to encourage the franchise partners in the country to add more compelling items to the 1- and 2-euro menu.”Mark Kalinowski, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets, said that in July 2009, France lowered its value-added tax on restaurant meals from 19.6 per cent to 5.5 per cent, a move which helped the chain over the subsequent 12 months of reported same-store sales, but which is now making monthly comparisons in the market more difficult.Systemwide, including revenues from newly opened restaurants, McDonald’s saw a 3.3 per cent decline in revenues across Europe in August, compared with the previous year. On a constant currency basis, the company said its systemwide revenues in Europe were up 4.5 per cent.“Europe posted its weakest same store sales number on a 2-year basis since May of 2006,” Mr DiFrisco said. “One month doesn’t make a trend but does warrant watching.”In its Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa division, McDonald’s reported a same-store sales gain of 7.8 per cent in August over the comparable period in 2009, when same-store sales in the region were actually below those of 2008. On a systemwide basis, the company’s revenues were up 16.1 per cent, reflecting strong potential in those markets even with fluctuating exchange rates.
379;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-09-09T21:05:11Z;Positive data boost US equities;;US stocks rose after the number of initial claims for jobless benefits dropped and US exports climbed.The S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent at 1,104.19, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.3 per cent to close at 10,415.24 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent to close higher at 2,236.20.Initial jobless claims fell by 27,000 to 451,000. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time was projected to fall to 470,000 from the previously reported 472,000.A separate release showed that the US trade deficit narrowed more than forecast in July as imports fell and exports climbed to the highest level in almost two years. The gap shrank 14 per cent to $42.8bn, above economists’ projections of $47bn.Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, said the unexpectedly large decline in initial unemployment claims was partly distorted because of staff holidays, and the unchanged continuing claims number showed the labour market was stagnant.But he added: “The sharp narrowing in the trade deficit, however, is harder to ignore, even after taking into account the rising volatility in this series . . . The rise in exports supports the view that the recovery in manufacturing is alive and well, while the decline in imports suggests that the consumer is still focused on boosting savings not spending.“[There is now] a smaller probability of a negative third-quarter GDP but also a smaller probability of an unexpectedly large GDP gain.”But investors revisited their concerns about European debt and shares gave up some of their gains after it was reported that Deutsche Bank was set to launch a rights issue. The fundraising would strengthen its capital ratios ahead of an expected rise in banks’ capital requirements by the Basel committee.US-listed shares in Deutsche Bankfell 3.2 per cent to $59.99.But the broader financial sector rose after Morgan Stanley said banks would be able to boost dividends and buy back shares next year.The S&P 500 financials index rose 1.2 per cent, with Morgan Stanley gaining 4 per cent to $27.01 and Bank of America adding 1 per cent to $13.50.Goldman Sachswas up 1.1 per cent to $149.14 in spite of a fine of £17.5m ($27m) from the UK’s Financial Services Authority. The penalty was for failing to disclose that it was under investigation for fraud by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Elsewhere, deals activity dominated, with 3M continuing the spending spree it began with two acquisitions at the end of August.The industrial conglomerate bought Arizant, which makes products to protect patients against hypothermia, for $810m. Shares in 3M edged up 0.3 per cent to $82.96.Casey’s General Storesrose 1.9 per cent to $43.95 after it was reported that 7-Eleven was the anonymous second bidder which had offered $40 a share for the convenience store chain. Since April, Casey’s has been fending off a hostile bid from Canada’s Alimentation Couche-Tard.Airgas, subject of a bid by Air Products & Chemicals, rose 0.4 per cent to $64.83 after it said its shareholders had been told by proxy advisory companies to vote against a move by Air Products & Chemicals to push out most of its board. Shares in Air Products & Chemicals were higher by 0.2 per cent to $77.95.TNS, which provides data communications to credit card payment processors, nudged up 0.2 per cent to $15.78 after it agreed to buy Cequint, which produces caller identification technology, for as much as $112.5m. TNS also said it would buy back up to $50m of its own stock.In technology, Apple said it planned to relax restrictions for iPhone application developers. Shares in Apple edged higher by 0.1 per cent to $263.07 and Adobe, which creates tools that Apple had previously restricted, jumped 12.1 per cent to $32.86.McDonald's said same store sales in August rose 4.9 per cent, slightly lower than analysts’ estimates of 5 per cent. Shares in the food chain, which hit an all-time high earlier in the week, fell 2.3 per cent to $74.37.
380;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-08-29T19:06:05Z;US consumers split into two camps;;Consumer spending in the US has turned into a tale of two cities in 2010, with an entire segment of consumers splurging confidently on the finer things in life, while another segment, concerned about unemployment and with little or no discretionary income, spends only on bare necessities.This bifurcation of the US consumer has become apparent across the spectrum, from restaurants and grocery stores to products such as coffee and beer.In each case, a consistent trend has emerged: people who have survived the worst of the economic downturn of 2008-2009 with secure jobs are spending the way that consumers normally spend at the tail end of a recession. But unlike the circumstances after previous US recessions, where spending rebounded across the board, an entire segment of American consumers has been left behind.Steven Burd, chief executive of the Safeway supermarket chain, described the situation in an earnings call with analysts last month.“There are some people that still feel challenged and there are others that don’t,” Mr Burd said in response to a question about consumer spending. “There’s an element of the economy [where people] haven’t been laid off, it’s been two-plus years, they’re comfortable it’s not going to happen [and there’s been] some recovery in their investment portfolio.“They feel safe. They’re starting to spend. And then you’ve got another chunk of the economy that isn’t quite in the same position. So I think really consumer behaviour is a bit bifurcated here”.Safeway’s same-store sales declined in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier results. Whole Foods, a pricier chain of grocery stores offering organic products, reported an 8.8 per cent increase in same-store sales for its most recent quarter compared with 2009.“At least over the past year asset prices have rebounded and that helps high income individuals that would seem to align with the gut instinct that the upper end is spending and the lower end isn’t,” says Michael Feroli, economist at JPMorgan.Sung Won Sohn, professor of economics at California State University and vice-chairman of Forever 21, the retailer, describes it as “barbell” shaped behaviour by consumers.“People with money are not accelerating spending but are spending probably at the same levels as they have in the past – Mercedes and BMW are still going well,” says Mr Sohn. “But the middle-income folks in America have become extremely value-conscious.”With the exception of McDonald’s, most low-priced fast-food restaurant chains have posted weak growth in the US in 2010. Large food companies, including Kraft and PepsiCo, have also struggled with domestic sales.By contrast, same-store sales at higher-end restaurant chains such as Starbucks, Panera and Chipotle – where prices are higher than at fast-food outlets – have grown this year.At the high end of the restaurant category, steak house chain Morton’s reported an increase in quarterly sales earlier this year.At a time when US unemployment is 9.5 per cent, and a similar-sized chunk of the workforce is underemployed or not showing up on the unemployment rolls, there’s a huge divide among consumers, says Al Moffatt, chief executive of Worldwide Partners, a network of owner-operated ad agencies.“You’ll be around employed people, and it’s like, what recession?” Mr Moffatt says. “It’s incredibly well disguised. There’s some conspicuous consumption, but people skimp in other areas”.Conventional wisdom holds that in a down economy, cash-strapped beer drinkers are likely to trade down for cheaper malt beverages, but that rule does not appear to be in effect in the US this year.“Selected brands are doing well, but the whole low end is doing poorly now,” says Bump Williams, a Connecticut-based beer industry consultant. So far this year, shipments of beer in the US are down 2.6 per cent, Mr Williams says.The exception is in the high end of the beer sector where selected imports and super-premium beers are growing. The craft brewing segment, which includes speciality beers that come in 750ml bottles, is growing at a 15 per cent clip in 2010, Mr Williams says.
381;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;US chains beef up meals to lift profits;;Fast-food chains in the US are rolling out more expensive premium products after two years of relentless focus on lower priced meals in the hope of recouping profit margins surrendered during the recession of 2008 and 2009.McDonald’s is selling a “smokehouse deluxe” burger in Canada priced at more than US$5.00 at close to 100 restaurants in the province of Ontario.Burger King, meanwhile, has been selling its “BK fire-grilled ribs” meals for $8.99 in the US for the past three months. On their own, six-rib portions retailed for $5.69 and eight-rib servings for $7.19.“The chains have talked about a barbell strategy,” says Scott Hume, editor of BurgerBusiness.com, emphasising a pricing plan which divides products into two categories, premium and value.“They’re staying with that, but moving the weights on the high end, wanting to see how much elasticity there is on price.”For McDonald’s, the market leader, to go through the $5 barrier is a significant move, Mr Hume says. “You never want to price a burger above $4.99 in quick service restaurants,” he says. “It has always been a pullback number for consumers.”The experimentation with a premium menu reflects some confidence on the part of the biggest fast-food chains, as well as a competitive thrust aimed at the casual dining sector.“Two years ago, it wasn’t as prevalent for everyone to have a dollar menu,” says Jeffrey Bernstein, restaurant analyst at Barclays Capital. “The two ends of the barbell were not as pronounced.”The recession of 2008 and 2009 forced most fast-food chains to expand their low-priced offerings, especially since a significant portion of their customers were people most affected by the economic slowdown in the US. In quarterly earnings calls, McDonald’s, Burger King and other chains have cited the stubbornly high US unemployment rate as a drag on North American sales.“None of these companies want to do value menus 24-7,” says Mr Bernstein. “If they knew that everyone would come in and just buy the dollar item and get their drink at home, they wouldn’t keep the value menus. It’s a loss leader. In the past six months, companies have been trying to ease up on the value push”.McDonald’s foray into high-margin products includes the introduction this year of smoothies and frappes, which have supplanted milk shakes as premium-priced drinks.The push into more expensive items comes at a time when inflation has returned to food prices, after a period of deflation.“We’re seeing commodity cost pressures come back into play”, says Mr Bernstein. “Favourable commodity trends allowed chains to cut costs in the past year or two. Now it’s forcing companies to offer more premium products”.As for the pricing trend, Mr Hume predicts that “five dollars will be the new $2.99”.
382;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-08-15T18:19:29Z;Sponsors score with World Cup;;Budweiser, Coca-Cola and McDonald’s have lauded their sponsorships of the Fifa World Cup this summer, claiming the costly investment proved a resounding success.AB InBev, maker of Budweiser beer, and the other two multinationals – who are each believed to be paying Fifa $25m per year for the exclusive sponsorship rights – all said in recent second-quarter earnings calls that their World Cup sponsorships had boosted sales.In the UK, Budweiser beer sales were up 18.6 per cent in the quarter over the comparable period in 2009, in large part because of World Cup-related Budweiser promotions, AB InBev said.In China, Budweiser and Harbin, another AB InBev brand, also benefited from such promotions, the company added.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chief executive, attributed the group’s 7 per cent increase in Latin American sales over the comparable period in 2009 largely to World Cup sponsorship.During its earnings call last month, McDonald’s said its World Cup sponsorship helped the fast food group in the UK, where football-related promotions of its Big Mac and fries generated a spurt in sales.However, it was not all a success for the global hamburger chain. Pete Bensen, the company’s finance chief, told investors that the football matches were so popular in Europe that traffic in McDonald’s stores dropped off in June.“Europeans love to stay home and watch the soccer matches and a lot of those matches were timed such that they were on during the dinner hour in Europe,” Mr Bensen said. “So, we estimate that maybe it was up to a point of a hit in June on the sales, and obviously the tournament continued on into July.”Greg Luckman, chief executive of the sports division of Group M, WPP Group’s media company, said Budweiser had generated “incredible engagement” with its customers.In addition to running commercials for Budweiser and some of its country-specific local brands during the football telecasts, Budweiser sponsored a “man of the match” vote following every one of the 64 games, which generated 1.5m fan votes.In digital marketing efforts, 2.7m fans participated in Budweiser’s “paint your face” promotion through Facebook and the company’s web series, “Bud House”, registered 7m views online.“It’s become increasingly harder to reach your target audience,” Mr Luckman said. “To have those kinds of results and get people to choose to engage in your content leads to brand engagement, which leads to sales.”Coca-Cola began “activating” its sponsorship almost a year ago, with its Fifa World Cup “trophy tour”, which brought the championship trophy to 94 cities in 84 countries, giving it direct exposure to an estimated 1m consumers who flocked to these events.
383;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-08-13T02:01:35Z;Johnson & Johnson borrows at record lows;;Johnson & Johnson joined the list of well-known, highly rated companies taking advantage of the plunge in interest rates to borrow at record lows.The maker of Tylenol, Band-aids and baby lotion on Thursday was selling $1.1bn of 10-year and 30-year bonds, both with the lowest ever coupon payments.“Investors are putting money in the corporate bond market because it is considered a safe place notwithstanding the fact that the macroeconomic picture is not very strong,” said David Trahan, head of the US investment grade syndicate at Citigroup, which was a bookrunner on the deal.With the stock market volatile and the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yield well below 3 per cent, investors have been buying corporate debt to gain some additional yield for what they perceive as modest extra risk. Corporate default rates have plummeted since the financial crisis and companies have been hoarding cash.But the rock-bottom rates are not tempting all investors. Some caution that these levels leave little room for error in an uncertain economic environment and one where rates ultimately have to rise.“Companies are playing bond buyers for the fool,” said Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.J&J, which carries a rare triple A rating, was selling 10-year bonds with an expected final coupon of 2.95 per cent and 30-year bonds with an expected final coupon of 4.5 per cent, the lowest ever paid on both types of debt, according to Thomson Reuters.The 10-year debt came with lower proposed interest payment than the previous records set by PSEG and McDonald’s in recent deals, while the coupon on the 30-year bonds J&J sold was lower than for a recent deal priced by Northern State Power Minnesota.IBM last week sold bonds to investors at the lowest rate for any corporate bond, according to bankers. It raised $1.5bn in three-year bonds with a coupon of 1 per cent, or just 30 basis points over Treasuries.While absolute yields are at historic lows, risk premiums, or spreads to Treasuries, have not reached this level. The yields on J&Js bonds, which priced at a slight discount to par, were at a spread of 43bp and 68bp, respectively, for the 10 and 30-year tranches.Even as corporate borrowing costs have steadily ratcheted lower, bankers said that J&J could represent the bottom. “It is not going to be easily eclipsed,” said Mr Trahan.“I doubt we will see [bonds sales] with rates below Treasuries anytime soon.”

The S&P 500 homebuilder index was up 3.1 per cent, with DR Horton gaining 4.3 per cent to $11.06 and Pulte Group advancing 2.1 per cent to $8.85.Some consumer stocks advanced on positive news. McDonald’s rose 1.6 per cent to $72.92 after it reported a 7 per cent jump in global sales in July at restaurants open for more than a year. Sales were buoyed by a strong performance in Asia.Target , the discount retailer, was up 2 per cent to $53.35. Visa climbed 3.6 per cent to $74.74 after it was reported that growth in the use of credit and debit cards could offset tighter fee regulation.In contrast, Sara Lee fell 0.1 per cent to $14.82 after Brenda Barnes, chairman and chief executive, said she would resign because of her health, following a stroke in May. Marcel Smits will continue as interim chief executive and James S. Crown will remain chairman.Rising metal prices pushed up shares in metals companies, with Alcoa, aluminium producer, gaining 0.6 per cent to $11.66, Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore producer, advancing 4.1 per cent to $62.46 and speciality metal manufacturer Allegheny Technologies rising 2.1 per cent to $49.42.American International Group rose 1.7 per cent to $41.64 in spite of saying that US financial reform may force it to raise capital, undergo stress tests and limit investment in private equity and hedge funds.Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage finance company, said it would need another $1.8bn in aid from taxpayers, bringing its total request for government money to more than $64bn.

385;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Asia leads McDonald’s sales growth;;McDonald’s reported a 7 per cent increase in same-store sales for July, led by double-digit growth in its Asia/Pacific, Middle East and African regions, where sales in existing restaurants rose 10.1 per cent above the levels for July 2009.The growth was even more pronounced for its so-called APMEA unit when figures for franchised restaurants were included, as the company’s systemwide sales in the month jumped 17.5 per cent over July 2009. On a constant currency basis – which excludes currency fluctuations – the systemwide growth in the APMEA regions was 11.1 per cent.The company attributed the APMEA gains primarily to strong sales in Japan, Australia and China.In the US, McDonald’s same-store sales were up 5.7 per cent in July, well above the 2.6 per cent growth registered in July 2009 over July 2008.The company said strong sales of its beverages, including the recently launched lines of smoothies and frappes, helped spark the gains. The company also said its low-priced value menus contributed to the positive results.In Europe, McDonald’s same store sales were up 5.3 per cent, a step down from the 7.2 per cent increase in sales recorded in July 2009 over July 2008.
386;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-08-03T22:14:24Z;US food and drinks groups drawn to Russia;PepsiCo, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola to keep investing in country;The promise of the Russian consumer market has emerged as a big theme of earnings reports from US food and drinks companies, with PepsiCo, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola all singing its praises in their review of second-quarter results.The positive comments last week stand in contrast with the announcement by ConocoPhillips, the US energy group, that it was selling its stake in Lukoil, the Russian oil company.PepsiCo, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola all said they planned to keep investing in Russia.McDonald’s, for example, is planning to open 45 restaurants in Russia this year and add drive-through windows to many of its existing outlets.“Russia has been one of our top investment markets for capital expenditures,” McDonald’s said.PepsiCo also expressed optimism about a market where it has operated since 1959, when Russia was part of the Soviet Union.With sales of more than $2bn a year, PepsiCo is the largest multinational food and beverage company in Russia.“It’s the largest consumer goods market in Europe,” said Zein Abdalla, PepsiCo Europe chief executive. “You have 140m consumers with some of the world’s largest oil reserves. That’s a formula for success.”In 2008, PepsiCo acquired Lebedyansky, the leading Russian juice company. Mr Abdallah said Russia’s low per-capita consumption of ready-to-drink juices and teas as well as savoury snacks presents a tremendous upside.Sales of Coca-Cola’s flagship brand in Russia grew 19 per cent in the second quarter over the year-earlier period, although Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chief executive, told investors not to expect steady, predictable results.“My 30-plus years’ experience, at that time with the Soviet Union and then later in the last 20 years with Russia, has always been that it is very volatile,” he said. “It goes into deep economic issues . . . and it comes out very quickly.”Vladimir Pantyushin, Russia economist at Barclays Capital, said: “What will determine the continued success of the multinational is the fact that consumers have now put the [financial] crisis behind them and are ready to spend.“In the US and UK and every western country, there are heavy debt levels and consumers are concerned about cleaning up their balance sheet. This is not the case in Russia. The wallet is pretty much open.”
387;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-07-28T19:07:02Z;P&G in 10-year deal with Olympics;;Tide laundry detergent, Crest toothpaste and Olay facecream will be among the global brands backing the 2012 London Olympics, under a new deal between the International Olympic Committee and Procter & Gamble.P&G, the world’s largest consumer products company, said on Wednesday it had signed a 10-year sponsorship agreement with the IOC that will cover the next three summer games and two winter Olympics, joining established IOC sponsors such as Coca-Cola, Visa and McDonald’s.The deal, which gives P&G the right to use the Olympic rings logo globally, is the first with the IOC that covers multiple brands under one sponsor, and follows P&G’s sponsorship of the US national team at the Vancouver 2010 winter games.In addition to intense television advertising during broadcasts of the games in the US, the company set up a “family home” in Vancouver that offered athletes a free overnight laundry service, baby-changing facilities and supplies of its Pringles branded snacks.Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief marketing officer, said that the Vancouver marketing effort resulted in almost $100m in incremental sales in the US and six billion consumer marketing impressions.He also said that the effort increased the effectiveness of its brands’ advertising with consumers by 30-37 per cent.“We used Vancouver as a pilot programme, and then from there …decided to go ahead and scale it up,” he said.Mr Pritchard declined to give details of the costs, but said that the scale of the Olympic marketing efforts made the investment “a very efficient spend”.Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC, said in London that P&G’s global reach – with more than 40 per cent of its $79bn annual sales last year coming from the developing world – would support increased awareness of the Olympic movement.P&G has set itself a target of reaching more than 5bn consumers around the world over the next five years, from 4bn currently, with most of the growth expected to come from developing markets.Mr Pritchard noted that the 2014 winter games were taking place in Russia and that the 2016 summer games in Brazil, both important markets for P&G. “We definitely intend to use this to build our developing markets,” he said.P&G’s efforts under the new deal will include producing videos ahead of the 2012 London Games featuring the mothers of six famous Olympic athletes including Usain Bolt, the Jamaican sprinter, Paula Radcliffe, the British runner, and Michael Phelps, the US swimmer.This month Dow Chemical also said it had signed a similar deal with the IOC.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1 per cent to close at 10,424.62, and up 3.2 per cent on the week, and the Nasdaq was 1.1 per cent higher, closing at 2,269.47 and up 4.2 per cent over the five days.The stress test results, released at midday in New York, revealed that only seven out of 91 European banks failed the stress tests.Len Blum, managing partner at Westwood Capital, said there were concerns about how rigorous the tests were and that there was a need for more transparency about the methodology. But he added: “It’s a result that probably gives enough people in the market the confidence that the markets will get through this.”Biotech company Genzyme jumped 15.4 per cent to $62.52 after speculation that French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis, was interested in acquiring the company. Sanofi-Aventis’ US shares fell 4.2 per cent to close at $29.35.General Electric was up 3.3 per cent to $15.71 after it said it would raise its quarterly dividend by 20 per cent to 12 cents a share and will resume stock buy-backs this quarter, sooner than it had expected. The S&P 500 Industrials sector also rose on the news, up 2 per cent to $260.91.Positive earnings news boosted the markets with Ford reporting second-quarter earnings of 68 cents per share, compared with estimates of 40 cents per share, making its first half the most profitable since 1998. Shares were up 5.3 per cent to $12.73, and the stock has gained 26 per cent for the year to date.Verizon Communications, the largest mobile operator in America, rose by 3.8
per cent to $28.02 after it also reported better-than-
expected earnings.Verizon won customers with Android smartphones and profit, excluding costs to cut jobs, fell to 58 cents from 63 cents for the same period the year before. Analysts had forecast 56 cents a share profit on the same basis.Industrial conglomerate Honeywell rose 2 per cent to $43.51 after profits rose
4 per cent and it boosted its forecast, citing recovering demand for industrial products.Elsewhere the reaction to earnings was negative. Microsoft, which reported after the closing bell on Thursday, lost 0.1 per cent to $25.81 as net income soared 48 per cent to $4.52bn, beating analysts’ forecasts. The world’s largest software maker posted its biggest sales gain in two-and-a-half years.Investors took a dim view of earnings from Amazon, whose shares plunged 12 per cent to its intra-day low, finished the day down just 1 per cent to $118.87, after missing analysts’ estimates due to higher operating costs, when it reported on Thursday.McDonald’s fell 2.1 per cent to $69.90 after the fast-food chain recorded a 12 per cent rise in profit for the second quarter but reported weaker-than-expected sales at established restaurants. Net income just beat expectations at $1.13 per share, compared with the $1.12 average estimate.Also reporting after the markets closed on Thursday, American Express beat analysts’ estimates and the shares rose 3.6 per cent to $44.76, even as the credit card company suffered from weak consumer loan demand.Shares in Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, retreated 3.2 per cent to $59.35 after it reported a 33 per cent
jump in quarterly profit to $818m, in line with analysts’ expectations.Also reporting, Kimberly-Clark rose 1.1 per cent to $63.63 and McGraw-Hill fell 3.5 per cent to $29.65.In other deals news, Quicksilver Resources, the oil and gas company, rose 2.8 per cent to $13.11 on Friday, a day after the company agreed to sell its limited partnership Quicksilver Gas Services, which was up 4.1 per cent to $22.20, to Crestwood Midstream Partners II for $701m."
389;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-07-23T13:21:11Z;McDonald’s menu price cut pays off;;McDonald’s strategy of lowering the price of its menu in the face of high unemployment and a struggling economy appeared to pay off in the second quarter.The world’s largest fast food chain said same-store sales in the US market increased 3.7 per cent for the quarter year-on-year as more customers flocked to its outlets.McDonald’s operating profit benefited from lower costs for the foodstuffs and other materials that make up its basket of goods required for each restaurant.Peter Bensen, chief financial officer, said the basket price dropped 6 per cent in the quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, and forecast an overall decline of 3-4 per cent for the year in the company’s home market.Overall, net profit for the quarter rose 12 per cent to $1.23bn, while sales rose 5 per cent to $5.9bn. Comparable store sales, which are a more accurate barometer of performance, were up 4.8 per cent.McDonald’s reported a 5.2 per cent jump in same-store sales in Europe and a 4.6 per cent gain across the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa regions.Don Thompson, McDonald’s president, said increased guest counts at restaurants were making up for lower price menus and lower average checks.“This was a very deliberate approach based on economy”, he said. “More than 100 per cent of our comparable sales growth is driven by guest counts.”Operating income was up 10 per cent for the quarter following a robust performance in Europe, where the UK, France and Russia delivered strong results.The company attributed this to continuing modernisation of stores, new menu items and aggressive marketing practices.“While the overall market in Europe continued to decline, we grew market share,” said Mr Thompson.However, the company warned analysts that McDonald’s future performance in Europe was likely to be affected by the austerity measures being imposed across the continent.The company has received a big boost from its roll-out of espresso-based coffee and other high-margin drinks such as frappes. That business is exceeding the company’s goal of adding $125,000 of incremental sales per unit, according to Mr Thompson.McDonald’s beverage expansion was seen as a direct attack on the core business of coffee shop chain Starbucks, but so far the two companies appear to be appealing to different diners.This week, Starbucks said sales at restaurants open at least 13 months jumped 9 per cent in the June quarter, driven by a 6 per cent increase in traffic and a 3 per cent rise in spending per visit.
390;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-07-19T22:07:35Z;Navigating cultural differences;;Walking through a labyrinthine tunnel apparently made of purple, lime and yellow-coloured ights may not be an obvious route to boosting a bank’s profits. But HSBC hopes its sponsorship of an exhibition by Brazilian artist Ernesto Neto in London may help to do just that.The bank, known for its “world’s local bank” slogan, has backed this summer’s Festival Brazil, a programme of cultural activities at London’s South Bank Centre celebrating the country that is predicted to be the world’s fifth-largest economy by 2025. Marah Winn-Moon, HSBC’s global head of cultural sponsorship, says such events are integral to a strategy that posits understanding different cultures as key to developing successful business relations. “Individual consumers might see Brazil from a different perspective and break down stereotypes about Brazil, not just being about carnival. They might work for an SME and HSBC might provide an entry point for operating in Brazil,” she says.David Kotheimer, deputy chief executive of HSBC Brazil , an American who worked in London before moving to São Paolo last year, believes the festival helps business. “Understanding the creativity in the culture, you get a sense of the country and that helps spot opportunities to expand the bank’s business,” he says.Colin Tweedy, chief executive of Arts & Business, a UK body that encourages private investment in the arts, sees this as “cultural diplomacy”, which he describes as “extending the company’s brand into a foreign market”. Such marketing strategies are only effective, he says, if the companies are prepared to work at “getting people, including foreign journalists and trade emissaries, to engage with these events”.HSBC, for example, is also involved in a parallel programme of business seminars and conferences about operating in Brazil, including a research project with The Economist, conferences with the Financial Times and a publication with Time Out magazine.Celebration of a country’s difference runs counter to the notion that the world is becoming culturally homogenised through the spread of the internet, the internationalisation of business and the development of a cadre of high-flying MBAs that appear to speak the same business language.Such a belief can fool managers into believing cultural differences do not matter, according to Paul Bennett, chief creative officer and managing partner at Ideo, a global innovation and design consultancy. In fact, he says, global companies must understand different cultures and turn that to business advantage: “It’s the understanding of the subtleties that are important.”As Maarten Nijhoff Asser, consultant at Trompenaars Hampden-Turner, which advises companies on cross-cultural challenges, says: “If your strategy is just growth without thinking about adapting to local markets, then you are just the Royal Bank of Scotland and you will falter. Too many companies don’t listen. It can be long-winded, but it is ultimately more successful.”All companies, says Andrew Kakab­adse, professor of international management development at Cranfield School of Management, have done localisation “badly at some point”. The key to making it work is “clarity of strategy”, which is formed “when a company interrogates itself about what it’s really good at”, he says.One global brand that has adapted to local tastes is fast-food chain McDonald’s. From the beginning of its development in the US, to its spread in Europe and, more recently, India and China, the company has targeted a variety of products at consumers in different markets.Key to its successful localisation have been research and investment in products adapted to local tastes.Big Macs were never going to succeed in India, where 80 per cent of people do not eat beef. But the company did not treat the country as a single market, and conducted in-depth analysis in several states. So, when McDonald’s opened a restaurant in Gujarat, where most citizens are vegetarian, it offered vegetarian burgers and other Indian dishes, such as samosas. In New Delhi, however, McDonald’s introduced meat burgers for non-beef eaters – such as the Maharaja Mac with lamb or chicken.The company has also made an effort to recruit local managers, for example establishing joint ventures with two local entrepreneurs in New Delhi who were selected to manage the fast-food restaurant. According to a 2007 article in the Journal of Business Case Studies by Bahaudin Mujtaba and Bina Patel, of Nova Southeastern University, this strategic move helped the company negotiate Indian bureaucracy.Not all overseas managers need to be local recruits. But Mr Bennett says that when staff are sent overseas they need to become immersed in the local culture. He cites the example of one employee who moved to Shanghai and cycled to work instead of having a driver. “Relocation can be like dropping people from the sky so that they lead from above rather than becoming part of the community you need them to sell to,” he says.Increasingly, this process is also taking place in reverse, with companies from the growing Bric economies expanding overseas. “It used to be that it was western companies growing in new markets – now it is the likes of Tata, Lenovo and Mahindra that are expanding overseas,” says Mr Nijhoff Asser.The reasons why many companies expand overseas are changing. He adds that there was a time when “companies went overseas for costs [of production]” or to reach new markets, “but now they are going there to find innovation in the local market”.Last year, Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble of the Tuck School of Business co-authored an article with Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, in Harvard Business Review on “reverse innovation”, a process whereby goods developed as inexpensive models to meet the needs of emerging markets are repackaged as low-cost products for western consumers.Prof Kakabadse says this is a reversal of the old strategy of “think global, act local”. Now, it is “think local, then act global”. So, rather than companies customising products to a local market, the focus should be to start with the local products and then try to leverage them globally.But not all global companies need to adapt to different cultures. Apple sells the same iPad in Tokyo as in Toronto. Rather than localisation, it competes on pace of innovation, says Mr Nijhoff Asser. “HSBC, Ryanair and Apple’s top teams have asked themselves what makes their companies better than anyone else. HSBC looked at its 19th-century origins when it was operating in Hong Kong and Shanghai and serviced the local needs,” he says.But, he adds, Ryanair does not worry about adapting its product to local markets. Its competitiveness lies in price: “Whether you decide to differentiate your market is entirely dependent on your product.”
391;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-07-14T18:57:56Z;Yum Brands;A focus on one number can lead investors down the wrong path;It should be no surprise by now that a ruthless focus on one number can lead investors down the wrong path. On Wednesday Yum Brands’ shares slipped backwards in spite of a decent set of results that met expectations without resorting to cosmetic tricks. The bad news: Chinese same-store sales growth was merely 4 per cent.That metric gets more attention than it deserves because the world’s largest restaurant operator, with more than 37,000 outlets worldwide, is heavily exposed to China. The bright signs of its KFC and Pizza Hut chains are one of the most visible indications of growing consumer appetites, and an early and aggressive push into the country means that Yum’s 3,600 stores there produce almost two-fifths of the group’s operating profit. By 2011, the US, where Credit Suisse calculates Taco Bell is the other highly profitable jewel in Yum’s crown, may be the smallest contributor to profits after China and the international division.However, in China investors might be better off watching return on invested capital, consistently coming in at a mid-30’s percentage level. Sales growth is affected by intentional cannibalisation in some areas, while pent up demand in new regions makes year one comps tough to match. But profitably growing a business in developing markets deserves credit. Rising Chinese wages might be a short-term threat to high levels of profitability in the country, but the improvement to middle-class incomes, not to mention a revaluing renminbi, will also help.Meanwhile, back in the US the group is busy fixing the domestic business by handing poor performing company-owned stores over to franchisees. Given the boost McDonald’s shares received from a domestic turnround, Yum may soon have many appetising numbers for investors to chew on.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
392;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-06-28T17:18:46Z;FA hope sponsors keep faith in side;;“You Let Your Country Down,” roared the Sun, Britain’s biggest selling daily newspaper, on the morning after England’s exit from the World Cup.England’s players returned to Heathrow, their reputation in tatters, their international future in doubt. But those were the least of the problems confronting the team’s administrators.England’s Football Association is financially stretched and without a permanent chairman. The FA is on it third chief executive in under a year and its bid to host the 2018 World Cup has suffered setbacks. Now, the future of Fabio Capello, England’s Italian coach, is in doubt. So this is hardly an opportune time be talking to sponsors about backing the England team.A four-year deal with Nationwide, the independent British mutual that has backed the team for almost a dozen years, expires at the end of the World Cup. All the signs are that England’s humiliating 4-1 defeat to Germany on Sunday has shifted the market against the seller and in favour of the buyer.“The FA has been in a very unstable situation for a long time,” says Tim Crow of Synergy, a sponsorship consultancy. “The reality is they will take a price for the England team sponsorship rather than set the price.”World Cup failure has already come at a price for France, which failed to make it past the tournament’s group stage. Internal feuding, which resulted in a players’ boycott, led to the team’s sponsors demanding explanations and Crédit Agricole pulling their World Cup advertisements.For sponsors, it is all part of the risk that goes with backing sports teams and individuals. “You have got to be pretty pragmatic about it and realise that there are going to be good times and there are going to be bad times,” says Chris Hull head of sponsorship at Nationwide, which has been in talks with the FA for some months about renewing their deal.“Yes, the Germany result was incredibly disappointing for fans and for everybody involved, but we have enjoyed an incredible amount of exposure that has been wall-to-wall – we have been a part of that. Our research tells us that people appreciate the support we give to the national team.”Some reports this month suggested the FA rejected one renewal offer from Nationwide because it wanted more money.But it is not all gloom for the English FA on the sponsorship front.Carlsberg has signed up as a beer sponsor for the next four years and McDonald’s is on board until 2013. Nigel Currie of Brand Rapport, another sponsorship consultancy, says the bottom line for many national team sponsors is that the team qualifies for major tournaments.“As long as England qualify, the level of exposure and interest they get in a World Cup period is massive,” he says. “Everybody wants a part of it.”It is with good reason that Nationwide’s England sponsorship strapline reads: “We’re in it together”.
393;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-06-27T17:52:25Z;Shining a light on energy costs;;"If you were to tell an MBA student that their summer internship would be spent changing light bulbs, they would no doubt be horrified. However, assessing the potential for energy efficiency gains in lighting systems is among the challenges facing students on this year’s EDF Climate Corps internship – and the organisation running the programme has had students queuing up for places on it.Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a New York-based non-profit organisation, launched the Climate Corps internship programme in 2008 after working with Walmart on an energy efficiency project that delivered substantial financial gains for the retailer from energy savings.“We wondered why companies weren’t all over this,” says Victoria Mills, EDF Climate Corps programme director. “We figured it must be because of some organisational barriers that prevented them acting on this opportunity.”Seeing this as a business problem rather than an environmental one, EDF had the idea of placing MBAs within corporations and giving them a specific mission to cut the companies’ energy costs. Since the first internship programme – with seven MBAs in seven companies – the scheme has expanded rapidly. This year 51 students will be going into 47 companies.EDF works with Net Impact – a corporate responsibility network of MBA students and young professionals – to identify prospective interns. It then matches them with an appropriate company.Before embarking on their internships, students undergo a training workshop run by EDF. “They cover a lot of energy basics and financial modelling of energy-related topics,” says Koji Kitazume, a joint degree MBA student at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business who is spending the summer working in McDonalds’ Chicago offices.The preliminary training also covers organisational management issues and some of the barriers that students may encounter during their internship. “Often, [managing energy
efficiency] is no one person’s job, responsibility is spread across departments and there can be split incentives,” says Ms Mills. “So the MBAs work across the organisation and get people talking to each other.”After the internships, EDF maintains links with the company to see if the interns’ recommendations are being followed. So far, it has tracked implementation rates of more than 80 per cent.Students find that the internships hone their technical, organisational and communications skills and also expose them to new industries.For Jamie Mikkelsen, an MBA student at University of Michigan’s Erb Institute who is spending the summer with the retailer Target in Minneapolis, the internship will help her move from economic consulting into a career that marries her interests in business and the environment. Ms Mikkelsen points out that the Climate Corps students can have a longer lasting impact on a company than they might during an internship at an investment bank or consultancy.“One of the most important things for us is that the recommendations have a series of steps and suggest procedures for the company to use to continue with the work,” she says. “So the fellows know their work will last beyond the internship.”Collectively, the interns have had a big impact. The 2008 and 2009 fellows identified almost $90m in energy savings, cutting the equivalent of 280m kilowatt hours of energy use annually – enough to power 24,000 homes – and avoiding a total of 157,000 metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.Sarah Shapiro, a University of Michigan MBA/MS student, interned at Cisco Systems and, after analysing temperatures in the data labs, found that reducing the intensity of cooling of the centres by a fraction could save the company $1.8m a year without harming the IT equipment.“That’s the nature of energy efficiency,” says Ms Mills. “The losses are small and diffuse so they often dribble out of companies’ pockets like change – but that means you could be losing millions.”Stemming these losses is what excites the students. “McDonald’s has tens of thousands of restaurants worldwide,” says Mr Kitazume. “So if I could identify a small savings potential that could be applied across all restaurants, the impact could be significant – that scale is fascinating.”"
394;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-06-18T21:50:07Z;Appetite grows for US ‘fast casual’ food;;The restaurant business in the US remains challenged going into its all-important summer season, but in one segment of the industry, known as fast casual, several groups have outperformed the giant fast-food chains and taken significant business from higher-end restaurants.Panera Bread and Chipotle Mexican Grill, which together make up more than 25 per cent of the fast-casual segment – which sits between fast food and casual restaurant dining – both posted double-digit percentage increases in first-quarter sales over the same period the previous year, driven by the opening of new outlets and robust increases in same-store sales.By contrast, US revenues at McDonald’s suffered in 2009 and, for the first five months of this year, same-store sales are up 3 per cent over the same period a year ago.Burger King, the other large chain, has struggled, with revenues in the US and Canada down 4 per cent for the first three months of this year.Yum Brands, which includes fast-food chains such as KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, also suffered from weak domestic sales.The more upmarket casual dining sector, consisting of family-style restaurants with table service and beer and wine, has been hit hard by the recession and growing unemployment.The fiscal year at Darden Restaurants ended in late May, but during the nine months ending in February, same-store sales were off 2.8 per cent at its chains, which include Olive Garden, Red Lobster and Longhorn Steak House. Revenues have dropped at another casual dining group, Brinker International, owing to the sale of restaurant lines.Analysts said the leading fast-casual chains have thrived by focusing on their core consumers – who tend to be employed with some disposable income – rather than by cutting prices in an attempt to expand their customer base downwards.Panera, a chain of 1,388 restaurants specialising in breakfast and lunch offerings, reported $364m in revenues for the first quarter of 2010, a 14 per cent gain over the same period in 2009. Same-store sales in the quarter rose 9.5 per cent.“We didn’t have the dips that other people had” in 2009, said Ron Shaich, executive chairman of Panera. “We decided that value was not defined by how cheap you were but by how much people want to go to you.”The National Restaurant Industry reports that traffic across all types of restaurants declined in 31 of the past 32 months.“That’s basically all tied to the economy, the drop-off in jobs, disposable income and confidence,” says Bruce Grindy, senior director of economic analysis at the trade association.
395;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-06-16T21:54:18Z;Oil has become the new tobacco;Corporations’ reserves make them ‘deep pockets’;"When Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, testifies to the US Congress on Thursday about the company’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, he will be only the latest corporate leader in the Washington hot seat.A lot is made in the UK of the fact that Mr Hayward is British and runs a UK-listed company, as if it accounts for the political anger that has exploded at BP over its failure to cap the gusher left behind by the Deepwater Horizon rig. In reality, nationalism has little to do with it – the sound and fury would be just as intense had it been ExxonMobil.The heads of Goldman Sachs, Moody’s, Toyota and other corporate sinners have been paraded in Congress in recent months, with little sign that being a US company confers an advantage. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman was born in the Bronx but he was treated as contemptuously as if he had worn a monocle, top hat and tails.The contest on show on Thursday – also evident in President Barack Obama’s televised address to his nation from the Oval Office this week – will not be Americans against Brits but US politicians, channelling the mood of voters, versus big corporations.For a time, it looked as if public anger over the financial crisis of two years ago would be confined to Wall Street banks. But the gulf spill raises a broader threat to companies and shareholders. Oil is becoming the new tobacco and other industries could well be next.If chief executives were brought to Washington merely to be humiliated, investors would not care. But the pressure on BP to suspend dividends to shareholders and put $20bn into an escrow fund for compensation and clean-up before anyone knows what it will cost is ominous.It has echoes of the 1998 tobacco settlement in which the industry paid $246bn to states following legal action by their attorneys-general. Only 5 per cent of that money was spent on tobacco-related initiatives, with Virginia, for example, investing in higher education, fibreoptic cables and research into energy.Willie Sutton, the robber, sagely observed that he raided banks because that was where the money was, and US politicians know this lesson well. The voters do not have a lot since they are recovering from a loss of paper wealth in the housing bust and governments around the world (as well as US states) face yawning budget deficits.Who does have cash? Large, dividend-paying corporations such as BP. They include energy producers and utilities; consumer goods brands; food, drink and drugs companies – all of the mature businesses that cluster in indexes such as the FTSE 100 and the Standard and Poor’s 500.Adam Posen of the Bank of England monetary policy committee has pointed out that UK companies hold financial surpluses equal to 8 per cent of gross domestic product. Industrial companies in the S&P 500 had a record $836bn in cash in March, according to Howard Silverblatt, an S&P index analyst.Cash matters to investors. The S&P’s “Dividend Aristocrats” index of reliable dividend payers in the S&P 500 includes Exxon, McDonald’s, PepsiCo and Walmart, and S&P estimates that dividends have made up a third of total shareholder returns since 1926.These reserves also make corporations what lawyers call “deep pockets” – defendants that are worth suing because they can afford to pay large sums in compensation. The tactics of Congress and Mr Obama against BP are reminiscent of tort lawyers, who are big funders of the Democrats.It is now clear that BP not only took needless risks before the rig explosion, but was unprepared for the environmental disaster that followed. It is responsible for cleaning up the damage and for meeting fair compensation claims, as it has readily conceded.Instead of sticking with the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, passed after the Exxon Valdez disaster, Washington has moved to impose punitive damages. At one point, politicians were telling BP to pay wages to all oil workers laid off as a result of Mr Obama’s suspension of gulf drilling, including those employed by others.Meanwhile, in his address, Mr Obama proposed an effort to reverse decades of gulf coast environmental degradation that had nothing to do with BP. If the tobacco settlement is any guide, that will not stop states trying to raid the escrow fund – BP’s initial payouts to Alabama, Florida and Mississippi already have a pork-barrel flavour to them.Other companies may look at all this and believe that they and their investors are liability-free because they have not spilled oil in the gulf, sold cigarettes, made cars that do not brake or constructed synthetic collateralised debt obligations.That would be a mistake. Many of S&P’s dividend aristocrats rely on the goodwill of consumers and politicians to keep accumulating cash for payouts. The mood following the bail-out of Wall Street is now so hostile to corporations, and public budgets so strained, that any slip would make them vulnerable.Robert Reich, the former US labour secretary who wants the US government to put BP into temporary receivership although many of its investors are UK-based, defines the affair as a “contest between citizenship interests and shareholder interests”.That sounds good but most people are both. Investors and pensioners, both in the UK and the US, depend on BP and other dividend aristocrats for retirement. If politicians strip the aristocrats’ assets, the citizens will eventually pay for it.john.gapper@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/gapper"

The commander of the US spill-response team said it was not known how much crude continued to leak from the company’s Gulf of Mexico well. BP faces pressure by US lawmakers to reduce its dividend payment.Caterpillar rallied 1.4 per cent to $56.61 after the construction equipment company affirmed its long-term profit target. It said it expected to earn $8 to $10 per share during 2012.Talbots, an apparel retailer, lost 9.5 per cent to $12.20 in spite of reporting better-than-expected second-quarter profit. It forecast full-year earnings that beat average analyst estimates.Dollar General gained 2.1 per cent to $29.83 after the discount retailer reported its first-quarter results and raised its profit forecast for the full year. It expects to earn as much as $1.69 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.63 per share.Fast food restaurant chain McDonald’s pushed 2.4 per cent higher to $68.38 as it reported better-than-expected May sales. Established restaurant sales were up 4.8 per cent globally.But the company said a weak euro was expected to lower full-year profit. About 41 per cent of McDonald’s revenues were recorded in Europe last year.Rival Burger King said on Monday it was also expecting unfavourable currency conversion effects to hurt its full-year results. The chain was up 0.8 per cent to $18.37 on Tuesday.Materials stocks were some of the session’s best performers as the price of gold and copper rose.Southern Copper added 6.3 per cent to $27.89, Newmont Mining climbed 2.3 per cent to $56.45 and Alcoa rallied 2.4 per cent to $10.76.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was 4.8 per cent higher at $61.48. The metals producer was upgraded to “overweight” from “neutral” at HSBC, but the broker reduced its 12-month target price to $80 from $85.“We believe that FCX’s cash flows should benefit from US dollar strength, especially at its operations in Indonesia and South America,” the broker said.Intel, a maker of semiconductors, was down 0.6 per cent to $20.18 and Nvidia, which makes visual computing technologies, fell 2.8 per cent to $11.18.Internet-based stocks were also lower, weighed down by several downgrades at Bank of America.Amazon fell 2.6 per cent to $118.84 as the broker lowered its target price to $150 from $155 and Google declined 0.2 per cent to $484.78 as its target price was cut to $630 from $685. Netflix, an online film rental company, bucked the trend to rise 1.1 per cent to $110.33 as its target price was increased to $130 from $120 at Caris.JPMorgan Chase rose 2.9 per cent to $37.78 on reports it is selling about $716m of bonds tied to commercial properties on less favourable terms than when the debt was issued.Bank of America was up 3.4 per cent to $15.33, Citigroup added 2.2 per cent to $3.72, and Morgan Stanley advanced 1.2 per cent to $25.59.
397;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-06-04T21:09:09Z;Greencore gets taste for US;;Greencore, the Irish convenience food producer, is re-exporting the TV dinner to American consumers by expanding its ready meal operations into the United States.The US convenience food market is dominated by frozen meals, restaurant “take out” and gourmet offerings from the supermarket delicatessen counter, rather than fresh ready meals.So when US retailers wanted to develop their own ranges of fresh ready meals and pre-packaged sandwiches, they turned to European food producers who they saw as the world leaders in microwave dinners.“We started off with a pretty strong hunch that this was an interesting market,” said Patrick Covenay, chief executive at Greencore. “But this was quickly and positively reinforced by more than 20 visits to the UK by different US retailers who were all impressed by what we did.”In the 1990s, the UK’s highly competitive retailers developed the fresh ready meal category with their suppliers and it became a thriving private label operation.In the UK, Northern Foods, Premier Foods, Iceland-based Bakkavor and Greencore dominate the market which is worth £7.1bn ($10.3bn) according to research by Kantar Worldpanel.Demand from the US came just as Greencore was looking to diversify from its reliance on its sugar business, which became unprofitable because of a reduction in EU subsidies.“What [US supermarkets] were looking for was a solution that could deliver more consistent taste, packaging and that was produced in aggregate at lower costs,” said Mr Covenay.“The traditional deli counter was very important in terms of providing in-store theatre and consumer engagement but had a pretty limited range of fresh prepared food offerings.”Bob Wintz, chairman of Runaton, acts as an intermediary between supermarkets and manufacturers and took US retailers to visit ready meal aisles in the UK. “The UK consumer embraced Starbucks, McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. Why would the US consumer not embrace the quality of what many of them see when they go to the UK?” he said.Greencore’s ready meals have been a hit with US shoppers with like-for-like sales up 27 per cent in the first half to March, albeit from a low base.Mr Covenay hopes US sales will rise to $500m (£344m) in the next four years, which would make up almost half of the Greencore’s revenues.“We’ve been very, very taken by the market potential, also kind of humbled by the size of the US market,” said Mr Covenay who has decided to focus on the north-east and mid-west, where Greencore’s factories are located.The company is not completely without competition. Local start-ups are beginning to challenge Greencore, and Bakkavor is buying up factories on the West Coast. But Greencore’s deal with Kroger, the second largest supermarket in the US, should stand it in good stead.“Supermarket retailers have needed to introduce more and better products as they’ve lost share to food away from home and lost share to Walmart. They’ve needed to be more innovative,” said Neil Currie, retail analyst at UBS.“They’ve looked around the world and seen the growth in chilled food in the UK, and Kroger has had a bit more foresight in the area to turn to Greencore.”Mr Covenay said it was key to Greencore’s strategy to send out senior managers to give advice on the ground as many retailers need to change their store lay-out and staff training to incorporate fresh ready meals.Those managers have had to adapt to what the US customer prefers.“The portions are larger, the prices are higher and the food is celebrated much more,” said Mr Covenay.
398;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-06-04T18:26:15Z;McDonald’s announces ‘Shrek’ glasses recall;;McDonald’s on Friday announced the recall of about 12m promotional drinking glasses in the US after the Consumer Product Safety Commission determined that paint on one-fourth of the glasses had potentially unsafe levels of cadmium.The hamburger restaurant chain launched the promotion two weeks ago, to coincide with the release of the cartoon Shrek Forever After.McDonald’s said the glassware was evaluated by a third-party laboratory accredited by the CPSC before its roll-out and was found to be in compliance with existing standards for levels of cadmium – a known carcinogen.The CPSC is in the process of re-evaluating the range of cadmium levels in products deemed safe.The CPSC said that of the four different cartoon character images represented on the promotional glasses – Shrek, Fiona, Puss n’ Boots and Donkey – only one was found to have paint with problematic levels of cadmium. They declined to identify which glassware model had the offending cadmium levels.Exposure to cadmium has become a hot topic in the US among consumers as well as lawmakers.Two weeks ago, Walmart announced that it would pull its line of Miley Cyrus-branded jewellery from its store shelves after tests conducted by the Associated Press determined that the products had elevated levels of cadmium.Earlier in May, the CSPC issued a recall notice for a children’s jewellery range featuring “Best Friends” bracelets after determining that the bracelets, made in China, had high levels of cadmium.According to the CSPC, long-term exposure to cadmium can cause adverse health effects.In the toy industry, cadmium is believed to have replaced lead as a cost-effective ingredient for trinkets and promotional items, in part because of federal laws restricting the use of lead.McDonald’s Shrek-branded glasses were manufactured by ARC International of New Jersey, a subsidiary of an international glassware manufacturer based in Paris, France.ARC could not be reached for comment.“Companies need to ensure that their business partners have been tested,” says Mike Rozembajgier of Expert Recall, a consulting firm that deals with product recalls. “This is a critical moment in time with regard to safety. McDonald’s is doing the right thing.”According to the CPSC, the inquiry into McDonald’s Shrek glassware began after questions were raised about the product by the office of Jackie Speier, a California Congresswoman.In a statement, Ms Speier said: “Although McDonald’s did the right thing by recalling these products, we need stronger testing standards to assure that all children’s products are proven safe before they hit the shelves.”
399;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-05-23T20:45:23Z;Dollar’s rise to hit global US groups;;"Foreign exchange volatility could take its toll on the financial results of US multinationals such as Kraft, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Nike, in spite of efforts to blunt the effects through hedging.Each of these companies felt the effects of currency swings in their 2009 earnings, and they’re on track to sustain even greater forex-related ups and downs to their EPS for 2010.“This is definitely going to affect earnings,” says Matthew DiFrisco, a restaurant analyst at Oppenheimer, of the dollar’s recent run-up versus the Euro.McDonald’s, which generated 65 per cent of its revenues outside the US in 2009, reported a 15 per cent jump in revenues in Europe for the first quarter 2010 over the same period last year, but a gain of only 7 per cent on a constant currency basis. The euro has been struggling against the dollar this year, but was weaker against the greenback in early 2009.Kraft, which completed its acquisition of Cadbury in February, reported a revenue jump of 40.5 per cent in Europe for the first quarter of 2010 over the same period a year ago. Almost 31 percentage points of that jump was attributable to new revenues from Cadbury, while 8 percentage points came from favourable exchange rates.Coca-Cola’s operating income jumped 17 per cent in the first quarter over last year’s total, aided by a 9 per cent foreign exchange boost from a generally weak US dollar. In Eurasia and Africa, the currency boost was 13 per cent; in Europe, 6 per cent; 9 per cent in Latin America and 9 per cent in the Pacific region.Of the US consumer goods multinationals, Procter & Gamble is among the most active players in the area of foreign currency hedging, entering contracts of up to five years to protect it from exchange rate volatility. According to its annual report for 2009, P&G lost $1bn in income last year from its efforts to manage currency exposures, after recording a $1.4bn gain in 2008 through similar activities.In the first quarter of 2010, P&G recorded a loss of $595m from foreign currency contracts. The total notional value of the company’s forex derivatives as of March 31 was $12.3bn.Nike says it “hedges up to 100 per cent of anticipated exposures typically 12 months in advance, but has hedged as much as 34 months in advance.” For the quarter ended in February this year, Nike reported a gain of $210m from foreign exchange forward contracts and options.In its most recent quarterly earnings statement, McDonald’s informed investors that some 70 per cent of its non-US revenues are generated in Euros, British pounds, Australian dollars and Canadian dollars. “If all four of these currencies moved by 10 per cent in the same direction compared with 2009, the company’s annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 17 to 19 cents,” or almost 5 per cent, the company said."
400;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-05-18T14:05:59Z;Dollar damage to profits;A strong greenback will hit multinationals’ earnings;With the luxuries of a huge domestic market and the international reserve currency, Americans normally put exchange rates far down on their list of economic worries. But, whether or not they realise it, their stock market is far more cosmopolitan than America in general. Nearly half of the S&P 500’s revenue now comes from abroad and almost 30 per cent from Europe, compared with only 12 per cent of US output from gross exports, a fact that boosted dollar earnings substantially in recent years. That effect may soon go into reverse, however, as the euro takes a tumble and China faces pressure to revalue the renminbi.The impact of currency weakness is naturally uneven, with utilities, telecommunications companies and others barely affected, while the largest US corporation, ExxonMobil, is mostly indifferent as oil is priced in dollars everywhere. But other multinationals such as General Electric, Caterpillar, Pfizer or Apple stand to see big translation gains from 2006 until 2008 become losses.Analysts at Bank of America laid out scenarios for the S&P 500’s earnings in 2011 based on various oil prices, growth levels and exchange rates. Holding oil and growth steady at moderate levels, earnings could range from $78 to $95 based on either euro-dollar parity or a rate of $1.30, respectively. In other words, investors could be paying as little as 12 or as much as 15 times prospective earnings by owning US equities – no small difference.Even this understates the sensitivity as a big fall in the euro might stem from an economic trauma such as a Greek default. US investors who pay little attention to exchange rates may soon learn the hard way that household names such as Coca-Cola and McDonald’s are as American as spinach pie.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
401;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-05-17T17:29:18Z;Mobiles deployed to entice shoppers;;"US retailers have become engaged in a battle for hearts and mobiles.As leading retailers, including Wal-Mart and JC Penney, continue to grapple with the potential of the internet, the proliferation of smartphones has inevitably caught their attention.Three years after Apple launched its first iPhone, mobile connectivity is shaking up the way retailers do business, not only online but in their stores.“Unlock the code,” says the poster in the window of a Best Buy consumer electronics store on New York’s Fifth Avenue. Beneath is a pixellated black and white square – a QR, or quick response code – that can be scanned by a smartphone camera to link the device to the retailer’s mobile website.For retailers, the black and white square is sign of dramatic changes under way as a growing number of customers arrive in stores equipped with smartphones that give them access to the internet.“I think its one of the most exciting developments in retail,” says Scott Silverman, head of Shop.org, a national online retailers group, of the impact of mobile connectivity on retail. “You have all the abilities that you have with online shopping . . . and you can take that into the store.”Customers of the US retailers are already using the phones not just to make online purchases but to check prices at other retailers, to look up information on potential purchases, and to receive digital money-off coupons that can be scanned at check-out. “Everyone needs to get past this idea of buying things on this small little screen,” says Mr Silverman.“There are so many other things that the small screen can do right now.”Thirty-one per cent of all mobile phones sold in the US in the first quarter of 2010 were smartphones, according to NPD, the consumer data group, up from 21 per cent in the same quarter in 2009, which give customers enhanced access to internet services.Compete, a consultancy that produces a quarterly study of smartphone usage, found that two thirds of users had reseached information about stores on their phones, while half of them had used phones to look up product reviews.More strikingly for retailers, one-third had used their devices while in stores to compare prices at rival retailers. Only 28 per cent had used the phones to make purchases.“We are definitely seeing a lot more being used for research than for shopping,” says Danielle Nohe, an analyst at Compete.TheFind.com, an online search engine, found that 2m of the 30m searches during last year’s Christmas shopping season in the US were made from mobile devices.Siva Kumar, founder and chief executive, says a surge of mobile useage on Black Friday – the day of the post-Thanksgiving sales – to 200,000 from 5,000 last year showed “people were checking prices while they were in the store”.Over the past 18 months, leading US retailers including Walmart, Sears and Gap have responded by launching mobile versions of their websites, together with shopping and browsing applications for iPhones and BlackBerrys.Now they are rapidly exploring ways to tie their brands into Facebook and other social networking sites, and pursuing a range of other initiatives aimed at delivering marketing messages and promotions to smartphone wielding companies.Retailers such as JC Penney and Sephora have embraced Facebook’s new initiative that enables users to populate their Facebook pages with product information, images and reviews.The retailers are, in part, responding to a challenge to their traditional grip on instore information from a plethora of independent services and smartphone apps.Shopsavvy, for example, is one of a range of apps that deliver price comparisons, reviews and product information, based on scanning a product’s indentifying bar code.Snaptell, now part of Amazon, delivers customer reviews, ratings and information to customers in response to camera-phone images of books, CD or other media product.“The retailers can’t be absent from that conversation,” says Mr Silverman.Smartphones also intensify the risk that shoppers will choose to visit retailers’ physical stores to view products, followed by a purchase made from a rival, lower-cost retailer online.But Mr Silverman argues that this kind of price transparency already exists on price comparision search engines such as Pricegrabber, and TheFind.“If you talk to folks, price plays a role but its not the final factor. Brand and trust are really important as well. So I think the brand promise; service; trust; these are all tools that the retailers will use to win sales.”Much of that battle, argues Mike Boylson, chief marketing officer of JC Penney, will be waged on mobile phones. “We really believe that the handset is where the future interaction is going be between the customer and the retailer,” he says."
402;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Big names prove worth in crisis;;"For companies whose financial value depends heavily on the health of their brands, the severity and abruptness of the recession was a challenge.The abruptness with which many consumers stopped spending, and large companies reduced capital investment and wound down capital investment, caused a shock to the system. Many companies experienced not only the financial crisis, but also a crisis of confidence.Marketers and advertising agencies preach the gospel that the companies that emerge best out of recessions are those that maintain their marketing budget and protect brands when the going gets tough. In practice, few companies were certain enough of the future to comply.Yet some of the Doomsday scenarios about the value of brands in a new, less leveraged world, have not come to pass. Emerging from the recession, luxury goods companies and many other consumer brand companies are enjoying a rebound.The underlying value of any brand – the premium commanded by products and services with strong reputations and identities – has not been eliminated by the crisis. Even those companies that did not invest heavily in their portfolio in the worst times are regaining some confidence.Indeed, this year’s BrandZ brands survey suggests that, even if the value of brands is below its 2007 peak, it has rebounded more sharply than the S&P 500. Millward Brown Optimor, the WPP subsidiary that compiles the ranking, calculates that a portfolio of the top 100 brands – updated each year as a new list is compiled – is 18.5 per cent up from its level four years ago, compared with an 11.5 per cent fall in the S&P 500.The premium for the top 100 brands was squeezed as many countries went into recession but it opened up again coming out. In other words, the outlook for brands has not been fundamentally altered as a result of the recession; instead, it looks familiar.“Brands outperform in good times and when there is a recession they do go down, but they come out the other side with a sustainable advantage,” says Joanna Seddon, chief executive of MBO.The nature of brands continues to evolve. Technology rather than marketing is now the defining characteristic of seven of the top 10 brands, with Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Marlboro making up the other three.Google remains the world’s most valuable brand, but edging up close behind it are two other technology companies, IBM and Apple. Both of these outrank Microsoft, whose brand value was stable during the year.Meanwhile, China Mobile, General Electric and Vodafone occupy the lowest three places in the top 10, which comprises the same brands as last year’s ranking. Although GE’s brand value fell by 25 per cent from $59.8bn in the list published a year ago, due mainly to its difficulties with GE Capital, the technology and infrastructure-related parts of its business retain their strength.The resurgence in Apple under Steve Jobs, through the iPod, the iPhone and now the iPad, continues unabated and, on present trends, it could be pressing Google for first place within a year or two. That is a tribute to a company that inspires devotion among customers.It may also be a reflection of the value of inspirational leadership, and the way in which consumers identify some of the world’s most valuable brands, such as Oracle and Starbucks, with founders who embodies their qualities. Larry Ellison of Oracle and Howard Schultz of Starbucks are not only the founders but keepers of the flame.This broad shift towards technology is a reflection of the importance of the internet and communications in the fortunes of many companies, including Telcel, the mobile phone group controlled by Carlos Slim Helu. Telcel is the first Mexican company to enter the top 100 (in 69th place).The social media boom led by companies such as Facebook and Twitter – as well the rise in smartphones led by Apple – has had a broader impact on the top 100. It has boosted mobile operators such as Verizon and AT&T, despite the complaints of iPhone users about AT&T’s 3G coverage.Although mobile phone companies are struggling to upgrade their data networks, the trend towards the mobile internet is giving them valuable revenue opportunities. “Everyone is twittering and sending pictures on iPhones, and data is what makes money,” says Ms Seddon.Yet technology can also disturb traditional brand values and make it easier for young competitors to break into markets. The best example of that at the moment is the media industry, where technology companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple dominate distribution.That is causing problems for media conglomerates with old-established brands in film, television and print. They are facing similar problems to the consumer goods companies that confront powerful discounting distributors, particularly Walmart.Apart from the influence of technology, the biggest secular shift in brand value is the continuing rise of emerging market brands. Some 13 of the top 100 brands now come from emerging markets, with seven of these from China. In the 2006 ranking there was just one emerging-market brand – China Mobile.For the moment, most of these brands tend to be based on finance or resources, with banks such as ICICI of India and China Construction Bank, and energy companies such as PetroChina and Petrobras combining both financial value and a large domestic market.One reason for the two latter groups’ debut in the latest BrandZ Top 100 is that MBO has used new research to reflect the upstream brand value of oil companies for the first time. Previously, only the downstream distribution arms of energy groups such as BP and ExxonMobil were fully reflected in the brand rankings.This has had a significant effect, with BP being allocated a brand value of $17bn and entering the top 100 at 34 while ExxonMobil comes in just behind it in 39th place, with brand value of $15.5bn. It is an illustration of how brands matter not just to customers but in a business-to-business context.As ever, the year included examples of famous brands having difficulties – the most notable being Toyota, the Japanese car company. Problems with the brakes on some models led to product recalls in the US and damage to its reputation for quality.Toyota’s brand value fell from $29.9bn in the 2009 ranking to $21.7bn in the latest one, and the effect of the product recalls may not yet have fully worked its way through. Toyota joined Home Depot, another well-established brand that lost its way, falling from a brand value of $18.3bn in 2007 to $9bn this year.Many analysts expected problems for luxury clothing and goods makers, which faced a wave of discounting by retailers at the end of 2008, and fears about whether consumers would continue to be extremely high prices for a luxury image.In practice, however, well-established luxury goods brands such as Louis Vuitton have kept their value, even if they have not seen the kind of growth they might have hoped for. The value of the Louis Vuitton brand, at $19.8bn, is 2 per cent up on the previous year.So, despite the shock that many experienced following the financial crisis, brands are playing their traditional role of giving companies some cushion against market pressures. They have proved their capacity to retain loyalty among consumers even through downturns.Many brands will experience crises, or simply stagnate, in the coming year and have to claw their way back but the aftermath of the crisis has proven once again an old lesson. Brands may suffer, but they are hard to destroy altogether."
403;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Across the sectors: brand value rankings for 17 business categories;;Reflecting last year’s less volatile business environment when compared with 2008, the rises and falls in the aggregate brand values of the 17 categories covered by the 2010 BrandZ ranking are less marked.Whereas the biggest risers in the 2009 ranking were mobile operators, up 28 per cent, and soft drinks, up 24 per cent, the steepest rise this time is just 12 per cent for financial institutions, reversing the 11 per cent decline a year earlier.At the other end of the table, cars and insurance are still battling for the wooden spoon, but at least this time both sectors have stemmed the decline. After a whopping 48 per cent decline in brand value in last year’s ranking, insurance has fallen just 7 per cent this time, while cars are down 15 per cent, compared with 22 per cent a year ago.Financial Institutions12%Beer10%Technology6%Fast Food1%Retail-1%Soft Drinks-1%Mobile Networks-1%Bottled Water-2%Gaming Consoles-3%Spirits-3%Luxury-3%Apparel-4%Personal Care-4%Coffee-6%Insurance-7%Cars-15%Here are briefing notes on all the categories, with comments from Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor, Peter Walshe, MBO’s global BrandZ director, Nick Cooper, senior vice-president of MBO in the UK and Europe, and Cristiana Pearson, an MBO director. (NB: to produce the top 10s and in some cases top 20s, many brands are included that are too small for the Top 100. So, while all constituents of the financial services Top 20 are in the Top 100, none of the bottled water Top 10 are anywhere near big enough to get in. The Coffee and Games Consoles categories have only eight and six constituents respectively).ApparelPearson: “Not much movement but Nike has taken back its number one position from H&M”. Seddon: “People are no longer totally shopping at H&M, they’re not feeling quite as poor.” Pearson: “Next is a recovery brand, it was down 40 per cent last year so has recovered its value. It has tried to adopt the Zara/H&M model of quick turnround of trends and moving its products fast through the stores. It has also adopted a strategy of moving from the cities to larger spaces in retail parks, which has been quite successful.”BeerPearson: “As last year, light beer brands are growing faster. Corona, the Mexican brand is also doing well, helped by its “Corona tu espacio” concept of having a moment alone with your Corona. Skol is benefiting from the merger of Anheuser-Busch and InBev, and from its strong position in Brazil where it is very involved in cultural events, music festivals, things that young people really bond with.”Bottled waterPearson: “The only brand really going up is Evian, with its Roller Babies campaign which was very successful.” Nick: “Evian’s Live Young campaign suggests and communicates a benefit and that there is actually a point to drinking water, which I think has perhaps helped the brand.”CarsPearson: “Toyota is no longer top, as a corporation it has been affected by the recalls, so that has impacted on the financials [which form an element of the brand value formula]. Walshe: “Millward Brown did some research in the US in January, which said, not surprisingly, that people’s perception of Toyota as a reliable brand had slipped, and also it wasn’t to be trusted as much as their domestic brands. But when you split that out between users or owners, and non-owners, with the owners there was only a very slight slip, so there was an inherent loyalty there, which is to do with what the brand has done in the past. Toyota is trying quite hard now [to rebuild its reputation] with advertising, inviting owners to contact them, saying that all the cars have been checked, and guaranteeing it all. Now, I think it’s a brand that might have a greater chance of being believed simply because of its strength in the past.” Seddon: “All the brands are down except for Ford, VW and Audi in the top 10. Ford, apart from having the best social media campaign ever, has stepped into the hole left by GM. Ford dealt with the whole [crisis in the US car industry] beautifully from a brand and reputation point-of-view.”CoffeePearson: “The same story as last year, Nespresso is the big winner. It continues to do incredibly well for the same reasons as before – it’s affordable luxury. It continues to introduce new flavours and new machines.” Seddon: “Otherwise, everything’s down apart from Starbucks, and of course this brand now includes coffee sold at supermarkets.” Pearson: “Because of the recession Starbucks has introduced different packages which are more like value packs, so you pay less for bigger packs and this has worked quite well, especially in the US.”Fast foodSeddon: “Look how dominant McDonald’s is. It hasn’t particularly grown [brand value is actually down 1 per cent] but it’s a fabulous brand.” Pearson: “Last year was the fast food year, [the sector rose 16 per cent in the 2009 ranking, but only 1 per cent this time] and a lot of that was driven by McDonald’s.” Seddon: “Burger King is down quite sharply, it claims that the reason it is are not doing so well is because of the weather and swine flu.” Pearson: “Compared with McDonald’s Burger King is very much more exposed to the US, even though it is opening a lot of stores outside the US.” Seddon: “Subway is worth a mention – it has a really healthy reputation but it’s the $5 Footlong which has really benefited it. The Footlong was supposed to be temporary when Subway launched it and it has been incredibly successful and kind of turbocharged Subway’s performance.”Financial InstitutionsSee separate article.Games ConsolesPearson: “This is all about a technology switch as new generations of consoles come in. Nintendo’s Wii is still growing, as is PlayStation 3, but next year we’ll probably not see PlayStation 2 at all. Also the at-home consoles are doing better than the portable ones like Nintendo DS because the hardcore and serious gamers don’t really use handhelds.”InsuranceSeddon: “This category is all over the place [brand value changes range from a 19 per cent rise at State Farm to a 47 per cent fall at ING]. Pearson: “State farm has a top score of 5 in brand contribution so it is very trusted.” Seddon: “ING won’t be in business next year [last October ING unveiled a radical break-up forced on it by the European Commission that will see the Dutch financial services group sell off its insurance and investment management business following the state bail-out in 2008]. Walshe: Zurich Insurance have done a big branding campaign in Europe, which has been successful.LuxuryPearson: “This category is a bit of a mixed bag again. Louis Vuitton, Hermès and Gucci were the three brands that rose [apart from Tiffany] and these really are the traditional, staple luxury brands.” Seddon: “It was generally a bit of a dismal year for luxury but those three brands stuck to their knitting, they all said ‘We are the classic luxury brands, we’re not compromising. They are real, classic luxury brands. The other brands are not so classic. People have been drinking less champagne – all those investment bankers, there’s fewer of them.”Mobile operatorsSeddon: “Here we’ve got the modern, legal form of addiction in mature markets. All the top 10 mobile operators are in the top 100, and a lot of this is because of apps – it’s all that data flowing through, which increased the arpu (average revenue per user). Verizon Wireless has done a very good job, part of this is about the fact that AT&T had the iPhone and, big though their network was, the iPhone apps were too popular, leading to reception problems, and Verizon took that on, head on, and went with Google’s Android [mobile operating system]. The positioning is very different, it’s more techy and less fluffy and social, but Verizon have done very well. For AT&T the iPhone was too popular for its own good. Elsewhere, very few companies have two of their brands in the Top 100, but Spain’s Telefónica owns both Movistar and O2. Movistar has been doing very well – that is really about growth in Latin America. O2 has been very successful in monetising the brand through apps and use of the phone, so for example it has got a platform called O2 Money, which is enormously successful. It has also got one of the best music downloads. And it has successfully grown the brand outside the UK in Ireland, Germany and the Czech Republic. O2 has also gone into fixed line with ADSL [asymmetric digital subscriber line] quite recently. Finally, China Mobile’s brand value went down. It has been enormously successful, but now it has new competition in China, as China Telecom has been licensed to compete with it.”Oil and gas brandsSee separate article.Personal careColgate is the only brand to have achieved a rise of 10 per cent or more in this category, and across the Top 15 there are more fallers than risers. Dove, the Unilever brand which is outside the Top 100, also did well, while Avon and Nivea are the biggest fallers.RetailersSeddon: “Amazon is the top performer in this category. It continues to take business away from Ebay [the biggest faller in this category by a long chalk] and in fact is every retailer’s biggest competitor now. Amazon’s biggest competitor is Walmart, that’s who it is targeting. If you look at Amazon’s sales, it is general merchandise – the stuff that Walmart sells, that is rising fastest. So Amazon has really branched out from being just a book and media merchandiser to being Walmart on the internet. And don’t forget the Kindle [e-book] which has been enormously successful – I’ve seen people reading Kindles on public transport everywhere from the Moscow metro to New York.” Pearson: “The other important thing is that, a year ago, we were talking about people buying online to save money in the recession, but in fact I think there’s a long-term shift on the way people are shopping. Amazon is also constantly innovating, so last year it was Amazon Prime, in which you pay once a year and get free delivery. Now it is allowing individuals to sell their products online without charging a fee, and that is a direct challenge to Ebay.” Walshe: Best Buy [just outside the Top 10] is also doing well, it has benefited from the closure of some of its rivals.Soft drinksPearson: “There is still the theme that diet and light brands are doing better than staple products – we see that in Diet Pepsi. Although Diet Coke is down, there has been a big rise in Coke Zero’s brand value.” Seddon: “Coke Zero has been the most successful launch that Coca-Cola has had in 22 years – it’s ‘bloke Coke’.” Pepsi’s fall is for financial reasons although the brand contribution is relatively stable, while Gatorade’s brand contribution increased significantly, offsetting the slightly negative financial results. This brand is outside the Top 100.SpiritsPearson: “This is terribly unexciting, not much has happened at all. It has been a tough year in general for spirits brands, it is a difficult category to innovate in because it’s all about flavours and bottles and packaging.”TechnologyThis is one of the biggest categories, with huge variations in performance across the top 20. The three biggest risers, Samsung, Baidu and Hewlett-Packard, are covered in the Risers and Fallers article. Then come Apple and IBM with a 32 and 30 per cent rise respectively. Walshe: “All the brands in the Top 100 are either extremely trusted or highly recommended by their users, and a lot of them are both. Both companies’ brand values have risen by about $20bn, so they are the top actual value growers in the rankings. IBM is driven hugely by trust whereas for Apple it is recommendation.”Seddon: “IBM has done has done a very, very good job of buying up software companies. Whenever it sees there’s a need in the marketplace it finds a software company that’s doing it and then pumps it through its brand marketing machine with fabulous branding, fabulous marketing and that’s what you get. So, it’s very much a branded story, it was “e-business” now it’s “a smarter planet”. It’s a company that was turned around by Lou Gerstner, very much on the idea of brand. It’s also a global brand with global executions, it shows you the power that you can get from leveraging one brand globally across the world.” Seddon: “BlackBerry has been one of our enormous growers and over the past five years its brand value has more than doubled, but that has slowed off. It’s a great device and it’s become a great brand, but does it have as strong an emotional connection with the users as, say, Apple’s iPhone? Maybe not. It’s marketed more as a device than as an enabler of your life. And the growth of the iPhone has probably stopped BlackBerry growing as fast as it could, because consumers want the exciting apps [that the iPhone offers]. Seddon: “Another interesting one is Oracle. Oracle has bought Sun but its brand value doesn’t include Sun because it has not rebranded Sun, so they are separate. Oracle is famously aggressive, is ruthlessly controlled from the top, global and it’s in both business productivity, software as well as in databases. Oracle is also interesting because it comes back to one of our themes this year, the brand that is driven by the chief executive. SAP is Oracle’s biggest competitor, and since SAP’s founder retired it has been losing market share to Oracle.”Three of the four worst-performing brands in this year’s Top 100, Nokia, Intel and Siemens, are in this category and are covered in the Risers and Fallers article. Another poor performer this year was Dell, down 24 places at 66th after a 23 per cent fall in brand value. Seddon: “Dell was the biggest, number one in PC market share, but HP has come back from the dead and taken over that position. Also, Dell has traditionally only sold direct and there is a fundamental love that people have for wanting to twiddle with technology before they buy. [If you sell direct and focus on low prices], it’s not a sustainable positioning because the Chinese brands, the Acers of this world, will come out and underprice you. So, I think there’s a brand building story under way, hopefully.”Finally, scraping in at No. 20 in the Technology Top 10, but not yet in the Top 100, is Facebook, with brand value of $5.5bn. Walshe: “A few years ago Facebook would have been in the Top 100 with a value at that level.” Pearson: “The structure has changed because Facebook’s users were young people, originally, but there was a shift last year and older people and businesses are on it now. That is what happened with Twitter, too.”
404;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-04-21T14:06:11Z;Non-US sales drive strong McDonald’s results;;McDonald’s recorded an 11 per cent gain in earnings for the first quarter over the comparable period last year, driven by strong same-store sales and favourable exchange rates.Excluding the currency fluctuations, the Illinois-based hamburger chain still grew net income by 5 per cent.Once again, the restaurant chain’s performance was buoyed by increased revenues outside the US, its home market. Same-store sales rose by 5.2 per cent in Europe and 5.7 per cent in the Asia/Pacific, Africa and Middle East region. In the US, same-store sales grew by 1.5 per cent.US total revenues for the quarter were flat, while revenues from Europe grew 7 per cent, before currency translation, and by more than 6 per cent in all other markets.Operating income in the US grew by 12 per cent during the period, while the performance in Europe was almost double, at 23 per cent, after taking into account favourable exchange rates.Excluding currency fluctuations, operating income in Europe grew by 14 per cent. In the rest of the world, McDonald’s operating income grew 27 per cent in the quarter, or 9 per cent in constant currencies.“McDonald’s compelling menu, unmatched convenience and unbeatable value generated another strong quarterly performance,” said Jim Skinner, chief executive.“For the first quarter, we delivered comparable sales and guest count growth in each geographic segment along with global double-digit operating income growth.”
405;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;McDonald’s relies on Europe for growth;;Fast-food chain McDonald’s is expected to show continued dependence for growth on Europe when it reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.In the category of same-store sales – the most important metric for fast-food restaurant chains – McDonald’s European operations outperformed those in the US by two-to-one, with 5.2 per cent growth compared with 2.6 per cent in the US for 2009.The growth rate in Europe has continued in the first quarter of this year, said Jeffrey Bernstein, of Barclays Capital. Currency fluctuations between the British pound, the euro and the dollar have affected the region’s contributions to McDonald’s overall profits, but the strong performance of the chain’s European operations reflects the success of the company’s efforts to “re-image” itself, said Mr Bernstein.In the US, McDonald’s adopted a new strategy about five years ago, revamping existing stores rather than adding new outlets, resulting in improved same-store sales there.Now, after a concerted effort to refurbish its European stores, the fast-food restaurant chain is benefiting from a similar jump in comparable sales, said Mr Bernstein.Some analysts suggested McDonald’s US operations are benefiting from the success of its European stores, through menu innovations as well as improved decor.“Most of the interesting ideas of McDonald’s are coming from outside the US,” said Scott Hume, editor of BurgerBusiness.com. “In 2009, Europe carried the chain.”In Europe, McDonald’s enjoys a more sophisticated image, with many of its restaurants located in fashionable downtown areas, added Mr Bernstein, while in the US it is still perceived as a downmarket quick service restaurant.In 2009, total revenues in Europe for McDonald’s grew 5 per cent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, but declined 2 per cent in the US. Of the company’s $22.7bn in revenues last year, $9.3bn came from its European operations, $7.9bn from the US, and $4.3bn from the Asia/Pacific-Middle East-Africa region.“McDonald’s is becoming a European chain with stores in the US,” said Mr Hume.www.ft.com/retail
406;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-04-13T18:25:21Z;Beef price surges following harsh US winter;;"Beef prices are soaring after cattle failed to fatten up during the harsh US winter and cash-strapped ranchers culled herds to cope with the recession.Cattle futures have risen more than 20 per cent since December and are again flirting with $1 a pound, a milestone previously reached during the commodity price rise of 2008.Worldwide, beef and veal production is heading for a third straight year of decline, according to the US Department of Agriculture. For several years cattle raisers have been reducing the size of their herds as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad-cow disease, hurt trade volumes; a US drought and record corn feed prices pinched profits; and the recession cut demand.Then came the hard US winter, as cattle struggling to keep warm failed to gain weight at the usual pace, resulting in thinner cows shipped to slaughterhouses.“It may be the biggest rally in fed cattle prices from December till April in the last 30 years,” said James Herring, president of Friona Industries, a Texas feedlot operator that supplies Cargill, the US agribusiness group.CME cattle futures on Tuesday were 98 cents a pound, almost 25 per cent higher than lows late last year. Hog futures have also gained after pork producers slashed supply.Rising beef prices are likely to translate into higher prices for goods such as McDonald’s hamburgers and filet mignons at Morton’s, the US steakhouse chain, according to restaurant analysts.“The underlying cost is the driver to eventual price increases,” said Matthew DiFrisco, executive director of equity research at Oppenheimer & Co.Oppenheimer estimates that ground beef accounts for 10 per cent or higher of McDonald’s costs of goods sold. Although the chain’s basket of costs is expected to remain flat for much of 2010, within that basket the price of beef and dairy products are expected to rise.Steakhouse chains, from Texas Roadhouse in the middle market to Morton’s at the high end, have a higher exposure to beef costs – as much as 40 per cent, said Mr DiFrisco.Rising beef prices would affect menu offerings at casual dining chains, said Scott Hume, who publishes a daily newsletter, Burger Business. “What restaurants decide that we love is correlated to what it costs them.”"
407;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-03-21T22:12:42Z;Return of the barista-in-chief;;Sitting in his spacious but modestly furnished office at Starbucks’ headquarters on an industrial lot south of Seattle, Howard Schultz claims he is nothing more than a purveyor of high-quality coffee beans. “What I really am is a merchant,” he says, flashing a smile. “I have a sense of what people want.”“Merchant” is rather a modest job description for the 56-year-old New York native, who returned to a day-to-day role as chief executive two years ago to revive the fortunes of the company he nurtured from infancy into a global brand. Some see Mr Schultz as a visionary leader, rallying a despondent workforce against the mediocrity that had gained a foothold in the company.One thing it is impossible to deny is his passion for the company. Asked why he came back as chief executive, he replies: “The reason is love …I love this company. I love its 180,000 people. I feel a responsibility to them and to the shareholder base.”When Mr Schultz replaced Jim Donald in January 2008, the company was in disarray, a victim of overexpansion. From 2000 to 2007, it swelled from 9,000 stores to 15,000, with a presence in 43 countries, but it was stumbling badly in the US, posting like-for-like declines across many stores.Worse, Starbucks’ competitive advantage throughout the 1990s – its position as the “first mover” in the coffee shop category – had evaporated. At the high end, US chains such as Peet’s and other speciality shops pecked away at Starbucks’ premium position, while in the mass market, rivals such as McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts improved the quality of their offerings and undercut Starbucks on price. McDonald’s even purchased advertising space on billboards, skewering Starbucks’ high prices with lines such as “four bucks is dumb” and “large is the new grande”, lampooning Starbucks’ Italian-language sizes.In 2007, as the recession took hold, Starbucks’ sales eased. Soon the company came to be seen as a poster child for the frothy excess of a bygone era.Mr Schultz took the criticism personally. “When you love something and someone tries to take it away from you, you fight,” he says. Over freshly brewed coffee, he recalls the slights from the analysts and pundits that Starbucks’ “best days were over”.Mr Schultz’s history with Starbucks – which holds its annual meeting this week – goes back to 1982, when he left his comfortable position as a sales executive with a home-supply company to become marketing director at Starbucks, at that time a chain of four coffee bean stores in Seattle. The following year, in Milan, he had an epiphany when he witnessed the showmanship of Italian baristas and the sense of community those baristas engendered at Italian coffee bars.His pleas that Starbucks should serve fresh-brewed coffee fell on deaf ears, so he left to start Il Giornale, his own coffee bar. But in 1987, he raised $4m from investors that backed Il Giornale to buy Starbucks and refashion it as a chain of high-quality coffee stores. Five years later, he took it public and launched it on its meteoric rise. He vacated the chief executive position to become chairman in 2000.Mr Schultz went on to buy the Seattle Supersonics, a professional basketball team, promising to bring a championship to the second-tier team by running it like a business. He quickly realised he had made a mistake. “I knew early on that I had jumped into the deep end of the pool and I didn’t like the temperature,” he says.After several disappointing seasons, Mr Schultz sold the team to out-of-town investors who moved the squad to Oklahoma, transforming him into a pariah in his adopted city.Meanwhile, Starbucks had started to stumble. In February 2007, in what is now known as the “Valentine’s day memo”, Mr Schultz ripped into what he perceived to be the “commoditisation” of the Starbucks experience. The memorandum undermined Mr Donald but struck a chord among long-time store managers, who had witnessed the erosion of the Starbucks “experience”. The following January, when he reclaimed the chief executive role, Mr Schultz decided it was important to acknowledge the company’s errors, and his own role in them. “We had to sit and admit to ourselves that we had made mistakes,” he says. “Even though I wasn’t the CEO, I was the chairman.”In 2008, the company announced that it would close 600 underperforming stores and lay off 12,000 people. It also embarked on a productivity campaign designed to wring costs out of its stores while improving customer service. Mr Schultz says his status in the company meant he had more leeway – from employees, shareholders and analysts – to make drastic changes.More important, Mr Schultz also articulated a vision of where he thought Starbucks should be heading and blasted out memos to the entire workforce sharing that vision. “I had to overcommunicate in ways I have never done before,” he says.To read the memos now, which were labelled “Howard Schultz Transformation Agenda Communication #1” and “Howard Schultz Transformation Agenda Communication #2” and so on, is to enter a world where the chief executive had become a kind of “dear leader”, inspiring his charges. In “Communication #4”, under the heading, “What I Know to be True”, Mr Schultz wrote: “We will not be deterred from our course – we are and will be a great, enduring company, known for inspiring and nurturing the human spirit.” Finally, in a flourish worthy of Napoleon on the eve of battle, Mr Schultz vowed: “I will lead us back to the place where we belong, but I need your help and support …My expectations of you are high, but higher of myself.”Such exhortations might seem corny but in a company where Mr Schultz is regarded as a messiah, the missives set an important tone. Quality improved across the chain, the company took $580m of costs out of its expenses and like-for-like sales in the US picked up 4 per cent in the last quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago. Globally, the company has annual revenues of about $10bn (€7.3bn, £6.5bn).But not all costs were slashed. Mr Schultz drew criticism for flying 10,000 US store managers to New Orleans for a three-day leadership conference in October 2008. At the time, the capital markets were trembling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the bail-out of AIG and the nation’s biggest banks.Mr Schultz spent what he describes as “tens of millions of dollars” to bring Starbucks staff to a city that was still recovering from hurricane Katrina. Employees volunteered more than 50,000 hours of labour to help non-governmental organisations fix up houses and clean roads. Then they gathered in a big auditorium where Mr Schultz talked about the “crucible” they were all in, and how they would make their way out.“That was one of the smartest things we did to reinstall the values of the company,” says Mr Schultz of the New Orleans retreat. By reorienting the workforce, Starbucks recouped the cost of the adventure many times over, he insists.It is a message, he adds, that must continue to be reinforced. After the Financial Times interview is over, Mr Schultz speaks at a conference of 50 store managers across the street from its headquarters. After congratulating them for their role in “one of the most historic turnrounds in corporate history”, he warns against complacency. “We can’t allow mediocrity to creep back into the business. The worst thing we could do is not understand what happened three years ago.”
408;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-03-19T22:32:24Z;Giving Harry Ramsden’s some ‘passion and love’;;With 229m portions served annually, fish and chips is still one of the nation’s favourite takeaways.Yet in spite of its popularity, and the success of fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Pret A Manger and Domino’s Pizza, nobody has yet managed to create a successful national chain of fish and chip shops.West Midlands entrepreneur Ranjit Boparan is aiming to change that. Earlier this year he bought the struggling Harry Ramsden’s business from Swedish private equity group EQT Partners for £10m.“Usually the best opportunities are the ones that are looking at you in the face – and this was one of them,” says Mr Boparan, whose move for Harry Ramsden’s came less than a year after he bought the Fishworks restaurant chain out of administration.He says: “The UK has got so many [fast food] brands from abroad that are very successful. There is no reason why British brands can’t be strong here and overseas too.”Mr Boparan has experience of turning around failed businesses.He started working in a butchers’ shop when he was 12 and then at 16 started running his own company.The salmonella in eggs scare in the late 1980s forced it into administration, but he has since rebuilt it.Now it generates nearly £1bn ($1.5bn) in turnover and counts Tesco and Marks and Spencer among its customers.As Mr Boparan sees it, the problem with the fish and chip industry is that it remains fragmented and localised. While there are more than 10,500 chippies in the UK, most are run by families, which makes it difficult to scale up on a national level.Even Harry Ramsden’s has only 35 UK outlets, against 1,200 for McDonald’s and 600 for Domino’s.“With fish and chips being in the hands of a lot of mamas and papas, everyone has got their own way of operating,” says Mr Boparan.“No one has a blueprint which can be rolled across the UK and overseas. If you look at the nationals, they are very consistent and disciplined and systematic in how they are sourced, how they are produced and how they are served. Those are the three things that we have got to do in our stores.”Founded in 1928 in Guiseley, near Leeds, where Harry Ramsden once plied his trade from a wooden hut, the company has had a chequered history. It was a listed company between 1989 and 2000 and at its peak boasted a market capitalisation of £49m with branches in Hong Kong and Melbourne.But growing competition in the eating-out market from younger and more nimble operators such as Ask, Prezzo and Pizza Express saw it fall out of favour. It was purchased by Granada for £20m and then passed to EQT in 2006 when Compass (which had merged with Granada) sold it as part of a portfolio of unwanted assets.While Mr Boparan believes Harry Ramsden’s has “huge potential”, especially as the recession prompts cost-conscious Britons to turn their backs on fashionable restaurants in favour of the humble fish supper, he also feels that the brand has suffered from under-investment.“Harry was a brand that lacked passion and love,” says Mr Boparan. “It needed continual capital investment, customer focus, but it just became a number in the system.”To revitalise the business, Mr Boparan is planning to invest £15m in new stores, refurbishments and marketing in the UK.While the goal is to expand the chain to a further 100 sites over the next five years, Mr Boparan is also looking at opportunities to take the brand to India and China.“Harry Ramsden’s is an iconic brand and fish is one of those dishes that crosses religions and cultures,” says Mr Boparan, adding that overseas expansion is very much a medium-term ambition.“We want to get it right here first before moving aboard.”
409;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-03-09T18:16:34Z;Wall St up on one-year anniversary of bottom;;US equities rallied modestly on Tuesday, a year to the day since markets closed at their lows during the financial crisis, as investors took stock of the recovery.Discounting the significance of the anniversary– the S&P 500 has risen 68.6 per cent over the past year – Stephen Auth, chief investment officer at Federated Investors, said: “People are overly focused on the March 9 date. At that point, what the market was discounting was Armageddon. Volumes were low.“The real low [of the crisis] was October 10, which was a high volume day.“We are up only 35 per cent off the real low in the market. Investors have massively taken off short positions against the end of capitalism.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 1,140.45, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent to 10,564.38 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent to 2,340.68.Since a year ago, 204 stocks in the S&P 500 index are up 100 per cent or more, 33 are 300 per cent higher or more and two are up 1,000 per cent or more, according to Capital IQ.Shares in Cisco Systems, were flat at $26.13 in spite of the largest maker of networking equipment announcing a new router that it said could handle 12 times the data of the nearest competing product.Cisco climbed 4 per cent on Monday in anticipation of the announcement.The airline sector posted gains after United and Continental said in an investor call that they were seeing demand return among business customers.“The return of higher quality traffic, combined with the significant reductions in capacity that we undertook in 2009, has really begun to improve our relative revenue results,” Kathryn Mikells, UAL chief financial officer, said.UAL was up 3.7 per cent to $18.16, Continental gained 4.9 per cent to $21.19 while AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose 9.3 per cent to $9.77.Yum, the restaurant chain that owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, rose 3.4 per cent to $36.60 after the stock was raised to “buy” from “neutral” by analysts at UBS and the target price raised from $38 to $44.“Although Yum has been refranchising units for the bulk of the past decade, we are just now hitting an inflection point where the full refranchising impact becomes apparent,” David Palmer, analyst at UBS, said.Rival Burger King strengthened 2.2 per cent to $18.72 while McDonald’s was flat at $65.10.Texas Instruments, a maker of semiconductors and calculators, was one of the biggest fallers in the S&P 500, losing 2 per cent to $24.19 after it raised the low end of its quarterly forecasts but failed to reassure some analysts about strength of demand beyond this quarter.It said it was struggling to complete orders in time as demand exceeded capacity.Northrop Grumman the US defence group, lost 0.3 per cent to $64 after it said it would not bid for the US Air Force’s $35bn tanker project.It had previously threatened to withdraw from the bidding unless the US government changed some of the conditions.The move leaves Boeing as the only bidder. Its shares were up 0.8 per cent to $67.79.Chevron, the second-largest US energy company by market capitalisation, fell 0.5 per cent to $74.30 on news that it was to sell a UK oil refinery, cut 2,000 jobs and divest assets in the Caribbean and Central America to help reduce losses from its fuel business.Financials performed well, helped by the perceived easing of risk surrounding European sovereign debt.Citigroup was the highest riser in the sector, gaining 7.3 per cent to $3.82 on continued speculation that the US government was set to sell a part of its stake in the bank.The stock has gained 263.8 per cent over the past year.Bank of America gained 0.4 per cent to $16.80 but Goldman Sachs declined 0.6 per cent to $168.85.First Solar, the largest maker of thin-film solar cells, retreated 2.2 per cent to $106.22 after the stock was cut to “underweight” from “neutral” by JPMorgan.
410;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-03-08T21:45:51Z;Volatility ebbs but Wall Street is flat;;"Improving sentiment surrounding European sovereign debt was not enough to significantly move US stocks on Monday in the absence of significant macroeconomic or corporate news.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,138.50 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent to 10,552.52.The Nasdaq inched 0.3 per cent higher at 2,332.21, an 18-month high.“What we are seeing is the market drifting higher in the absence of significant news flow,” said Justin Golden, a strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, a New York-based equity derivatives strategy and execution brokerage. “[French] President Sarkozy’s comments over the weekend [pledging support to the Greek government] were taken as an important vote of confidence.”The Vix index, a measure of expected market volatility, hovered around its lowest levels for the year at 17.63, but was up 1.2 per cent on Monday. Values below 20 generally correspond to less volatile markets.“The Vix has closed down 16 out of the last 18 sessions – we haven’t seen it do that in such a consistent manner since 1997. [The low level] suggests that the Vix is not fully reflecting the amount of risk in the market right now,” said Mr Golden.Insurer AIG gained 3.6 per cent to $29.10 after agreeing to sell its American Life Insurance unit, one of its overseas insurance operations, to MetLife, a US life assurer, for $15.5bn. It is AIG’s second divestiture this month.AIG also put its remaining 9.2m share interest in Transatlantic Holdings up for sale through a public offering.Shares in MetLife rose 5.1 per cent to $40.90.McDonald’s strengthened 2.3 per cent to $65.12 on the back of better than expected global February comparable-store sales. The fast food restaurant chain increased sales 4.8 per cent during the month compared with the same period last year. Sales were projected to rise 4 per cent by analysts.Sales in Asia were the strongest, rising 10.5 per cent. In the US they increased 0.6 per cent, helped by a $1 breakfast menu and aggressive

411;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-03-08T18:25:44Z;Intertek buoyed by increase in product testing;;Ongoing product recalls, such as those by Toyota of more than 8m cars, are likely to spur companies to outsource further testing to third parties, the chief executive of Intertek said after the certification group lifted annual profits by a fifth.71.2p“All these recalls …they are driving our business,” said Wolfhart Hauser, who added that the FTSE 100 company’s biggest competitors were potential clients who chose to do product testing themselves.The toys-to-textiles certification group is set to increase its total dividend by 23 per cent after pre-tax profits in the year to December 31 rose from £169.2m to £138.6m on revenue of £1.24bn (£1bn).Intertek, which verifies the quality and safety of products for a range a blue-chip clients from General Electric to McDonald’s, benefited from the weakness of sterling. Assuming currencies had been constant, sales improved by a more modest 7 per cent.Intertek said negotiations were continuing with Det Norske Veritas, a Norwegian foundation, to acquire the majority of its business assurance division. Mr Hauser added: “In April …you should expect an announcement.”A successful deal would result in DNV becoming a large shareholder in the private sector company and Mr Hauser said it could pave the way for acquisitions of other not-for-profit testing enterprises.Earnings per share rose from 58.9p to 71.2p. A proposed final dividend of 17.3p takes the total pay-out to 25.5p (20.8p). The shares closed down 18p at £13.28.● FT CommentGiven that a single consumer products safety law in the US accounted for a 10th of revenue improvement in the first half, comparative figures are likely to be tough to beat over the coming months. Organic revenue improvement has slowed, particularly in oil, chemical and agriculture. But the investment rationale – the tendency for companies to outsource complex quality assurance – remains sound. Regulation will help, although only a small part of Intertek’s business is derived from compulsory testing. Having outperformed the blue-chip index by almost 5 per cent since the turn of the year, Intertek shares trade on less than 16 times forecast earnings per share of 84p, a discount to its nearest peer, SGS. Although frequently the subject of speculation that SGS could mount a bid, investors should be confident that Intertek is able to perform on its merits.
412;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Coca-Cola and industrials help stocks rally;;Encouraging results from Coca-Cola and renewed optimism in the industrials sector helped US stocks bounce back yesterday.Reports of a rescue package for Greece also reassured investors who had feared the country’s fiscal problems could spark a wider crisis across the eurozone.The S&P 500 gained 1.3 per cent to 1,070.52, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.5 per cent to 10,058.64 and the Nasdaq was 1.2 per cent higher at 2,150.87.“The recent bearish charge appears to have run into a brick wall,” said Andrew Wilkinson, a senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “Rumour-driven or not, investors’ jitters were abruptly abandoned as traders began to put faith in some kind of practical resolution for Greek state finances.”Strong demand from China, Brazil and India helped Coca-Cola to offset declines in North America and post quarterly results in line with estimates. The soft-drinks maker also gained market share during the period, both in the carbonated and non-carbonated segments. The stock rose 2.6 per cent to $54.01.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, McDonald’s reported that sales had risen 2.6 per cent at restaurants open for more than a year. While revenues continued to decline in the US, sales rose in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Shares in McDonald’s the rose 1 per cent to $63.57.Caterpillar added to the market’s gains after Morgan Stanley boosted its rating on the world’s largest manufacturer of construction equipment to “overweight” from “underweight”. Analysts at the bank also upgraded the US industrial sector to “attractive” from “in-line”, citing stronger than expected order books. Caterpillar added 5.4 per cent to $53.53, while the S&P 500 industrials index rose 1.7 per cent.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, also benefited from an upgrade and was up 2 per cent at $75.72. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised their rating on the group to “buy” from “neutral”, saying it was well-positioned to gain market share in US corn seed.It emerged that India’s government rejected the country’s first genetically modified food after protests by farmers. Monsanto had supplied the gene for the test vegetable, and the government’s decision to halt production was considered a blow to the group’s prospects for growth in India.NYSE Euronext climbed 5.1 per cent to $23.65 after the transatlantic exchange operator posted a higher profit for the last quarter than analysts had been expecting. Cost-cutting had helped offset declining trading volumes and a diminishing share of the equities market.ADC Telecommunications also surprised the market by reporting a quarterly profit. Analysts had expected the telephone equipment maker to break even. Its shares surged 21.4 per cent to $6.53.Electronic Arts weighed on the market, tumbling 8.8 per cent to $15.96, after the video game publisher gave a disappointing forecast for next year. The group, which is the world’s second-largest player in the sector, blamed its lowered guidance on the lack of blockbuster titles, poor demand in Europe and the adverse impact of foreign exchange movements.Pulte Homes, the country’s largest housebuilder, posted a smaller loss for the last quarter thanks to tax benefits. Revenues rose 5 per cent in the period but the results were worse than expected. Shares in the Michigan group lost 0.5 per cent to $11.08.In the pharmaceutical sector, Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, reported encouraging results from trials of a bone-strengthening treatment. After early strength, the shares lost 0.4 per cent to $57.21.While financial stocks rebounded from the previous session’s lows, the sector still lagged behind the market.Lincoln National, one of the country’s largest life insurers, climbed 4.3 per cent to $24.50 after reporting a higher-than-expected profit for the last quarter.The group suffered from investment losses in the financial crisis but was given a $950m cash injection by the government and has also raised additional funds through a share offering.
413;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
414;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-02-09T22:10:16Z;Greek rescue hopes help bourses regain poise;US treasuries slide as traders greet signs of action;22:00 GMT. Dow below 10,000! Europe on the fiscal precipice! Never fear, Jean-Claude is coming.The euro rallied, commodities perked up and global stocks recovered their poise after it emerged that Jean-Claude Trichet, European Central Bank president, was to leave a summit with his peers in Australia early and fly to the rescue of the eurozone.Mr Trichet’s attendance at Thursday’s special meeting of European leaders, called to address the region’s economy, was seen as evidence that a deal to support Greece would be thrashed out. And statements of German intent helped Greek bond yields fall sharply in response.“There is nothing like a change in a VIP’s travel plans to excite the imaginations of market participants,” noted Stephen Lewis at Monument Securities.“Some will remember the market panic that followed [UK] Chancellor Healey’s U-turn, yards short of Heathrow Airport in September 1976. Others will recall Mr Greenspan’s unscheduled return to Washington from Dallas on 20 October 1987.”Never mind that it has since emerged Mr Trichet’s travel arrangements were for logistical reasons and that he had accepted in January the invitation to the EU leader gathering. A circulating rumour that Berlin was planning to rescue Greece were also put to rest when Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, flatly denied it.A German official later said the eurozone would have to “face up to the fact” that some action is expected. Investors remained hopeful that a bail-out could provide a firebreak to the current sovereign debt firestorm.Worries about the fiscal burden facing Greece and the potential for any default to spread into other eurozone nations has roiled markets of late. Traders fear for the fragile global economic recovery should such a scenario unfold, and this has caused a sharp reduction in risk appetite – battering stocks and commodities, but boosting haven bonds and the dollar.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had closed on Monday below the 10,000 level for the first time since November. The Vix measure of market volatility rose to 26.5 as investors became increasingly wary of the inability of major indices to stop the slide that has seen stocks lose more than 8 per cent in 14 trading days.However, the Dow recaptured 10,000 on Tuesday and the Vix fell 2 per cent to 26.0 as risk appetite returned. Whether this was indeed down to the assumption that a solution for Greece was imminent or merely a reaction to supposedly oversold conditions remains to be seen. The Dow had given back its gains at lunchtime, but rallied later in the day as speculation renewed that a bail-out proposal for Greece was likely.Of course, it is also possible that the euro’s bounce is the result of a classic contrarian play. News that speculators have amassed their biggest ever bearish positions against the single currency will be taken by many traders as a sign that negativity towards the euro has reached its peak, and now is the time to push the other way. It can be an unsightly mess when bears are forced to remove their shorts.● Yields on Greek, Portuguese and Spanish sovereign debt dropped sharply and the cost of the nations’ credit default swaps fell back as hopes for an end to the speculation about default took hold. The yield on Greek 10-year debt fell nearly 50 basis points at one stage to 6.3 per cent, crunching the yield spread with German Bunds to less than 320 basis points. The spread had breached 400bp last month.Perceived ‘haven’ government bond markets were generally softer as the so-called risk aversion trade was trimmed back. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury added 8 basis points to 3.64 per cent, a move that was replicated across much of the complex.An auction of $40bn of 3-year notes drew yields of 1.377 per cent, higher than consensus expectations of 1.362 per cent. It was the first of three auctions that will total $81bn this week. “It will be interesting to see the degree to which supply weighs on the flight-to-quality rally,” said Barclays Capital in a note.● The euro rose 1 per cent versus the dollar to trade at $1.3788. At one stage on Monday, the euro had hit a fresh eight-month low below $1.36 as concerns about the eurozone festered. The euro also recovered 1.5 per cent against the yen.The calmer mood resulted in flows away from the dollar, which lost 0.7 per cent on a trade-weighted basis.● European bourses initially felt the impact of Wall Street’s late Monday swoon, but soon recovered. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was up slightly as life assurers and banks stabilised after recent savage falls on debt exposure concerns. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.4 per cent, supported by its mining exposure. Athens jumped 5 per cent as the banks found favour.The S&P 500 on Wall Street rose 1.3 per cent, with support also coming from a sturdy sales update from McDonald‘s. The FTSE World index climbed 0.9 per cent.Asian stocks were mixed but off their lows. Early closers, such as Tokyo and Sydney, recorded minor losses, but as the session wore on the firming euro helped sentiment in those centres still trading. Shanghai added 0.5 per cent, Hong Kong rose 1.2 per cent and the FTSE Asia-Pacific index climbed 0.4 per cent.● The weaker dollar gave a boost to gold. The precious metal added 1.4 per cent to $1,078 an ounce. Oil rose 2.6 per cent to $73.72 a barrel, a snowy coldfront on the US east coast providing impetus.
415;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-02-09T20:00:35Z;Japan’s healthy eating, with a side of McDonald’s fries;;Selling beef patties and fried potatoes to a nation obsessed with the freshness of its food might seem a daunting task.But in the nearly 30 years since it first landed in Japan, McDonald’s has shown that even rice and miso soup eaters can develop a craving for “Texas Burgers”.The yellow arches, which first appeared in the 1970s, have grown to more than 3,700, and in 2008, McDonald’s became the first fast-food chain in Japan to exceed Y500bn ($5.5m) in sales.But, amid Japan’s severe economic climate, it is not just Y100 burgers that are pulling in the crowds.Last month, on the day McDonald’s introduced the “Texas Burger”, it reaped record one-day revenues of Y2.9bn, surpassing the previous record, when the Japanese discovered the joys of the “Quarter Pounder”.In a year when many fast-food restaurants have suffered a slowdown in sales, McDonald’s on Tuesday reported record full-year sales.Capitalising on its winning streak, McDonald’s is closing 433 existing stores that do not meet its standards for kitchen size and brand image.The plan is to open larger stores instead, which will be able to accommodate more customers and thereby raise revenues.Japanese health officials have been sounding the alarm about rising obesity, but if McDonald’s success is any indication, Japanese consumers are clearly not listening.Challenge for SAPAnyone who believes business is boring should think again. Some of history’s biggest dramas have been played out in boardrooms – from the dissolution of the company that built the Eiffel Tower in the 19th century to the Porsche-Piëch family saga that is only now reaching its climax.There have been numerous corporate causes célèbres, but few are likely to match the intensity of what promises to become a transatlantic contest for the world software and information technology market. In one corner is Larry Ellison, co-founder and chairman of Oracle, and one of the most competitive businessmen around. In the other is Hasso Plattner, chairman of SAP and one of the co-founders of the German software group.The two share a common passion – sailing. Mr Ellison has spent a fortune building a yacht to challenge the Swiss billionaire holder of the America’s Cup Ernesto Bertarelli in the Mediterranean this week. He has also spent vast sums in legal fees in his dispute with the former biotechnology mogul over the rules governing the sailing competition.Mr Plattner is not quite in the same sailing league, but he is also a competitive yachtsman and has raced against Mr Ellison. Their most notorious encounter was in the 1996 Kenwood Cup off Hawaii, when Mr Plattner’s yacht, Morning Glory, broke a mast and Mr Ellison’s Sayonara sailed past. When Mr Ellison’s support boat did not come to Mr Plattner’s aid, the SAP chairman pulled his trousers down in disgust at his American rivals.Trousers or no trousers, Mr Ellison has tended to gain the upper hand in sailing clashes against Mr Plattner. But what has been more troublesome for his rival is that since Mr Plattner gave up day-to-day control of SAP some years ago, the German group has been losing ground and market share to its US competitor. This may well explain why Mr Plattner has decided to assume a more active role again following the surprise resignation of Léo Apotheker, who had taken over as chief executive less than a year ago.In recent months, SAP seems to have lost the confidence of some of its customers. Internal morale appears undermined by Mr Apotheker’s cost-cutting strategy. And investors have become disenchanted.In the meantime, Mr Ellison has been credited by investors for pursuing a nimble and focused strategy including a clever acquisition spree culminating with his takeover of Sun Microsystems. The result is that SAP is valued at €40bn ($55bn) against Oracle’s market capitalisation of about $116bn. That makes Oracle number two behind Microsoft.Mr Plattner’s new mission is to restore some balance between the perception that SAP is losing the battle to Oracle and the reality that the group is a key operator in its field and likely to remain so.Mr Ellison seems to think his challenge is no longer to topple SAP from its pedestal – he probably thinks he has already succeeded – but to challenge Microsoft and IBM outright.But the SAP chairman may have a few tricks up his sleeve. Not least his link with IBM – there have been rumours of a possible merger between the two. Should German political sensibilities allow such a combination, Mr Plattner may well be tempted to pull down his trousers again as he sails, this time, past his rival.world.view@ft.com
416;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-02-05T18:52:49Z;Lower league advertisers seize on Super Bowl;;The underdogs are favoured to win the 44th Super Bowl this Sunday – in advertising terms, at least.The culmination of the US football season is an annual snapshot of the country’s advertising industry, where groups try to outdo each other with fresh ideas.Half the 100m-strong audience will tune in more to see what brands have come up with in the advertising breaks than to watch the battle between the Indianapolis Colts and the New Orleans Saints.This year, Detroit carmakers, which traditionally featured at the event, are lying low and PepsiCo, which defined Super Bowl celebrity endorsements with commercials featuring Ozzy Osbourne and Britney Spears, will be absent, for the first time in 23 years.Smaller brands have instead seized the chance to capture the buzz guaranteed by an event where the advertisements generate as much Monday morning analysis as the game itself.“A lot of challenger brands have come in,” says Antony Young, chief executive of Optimedia, the media agency.In place of General Motors and Toyota, Kia and Volkswagen are among newcomers hoping to benefit from the uniquely American event.Other lower league advertisers include TruTV – a network formerly known as Court TV – and Focus on the Family, a Christian advocacy organisation known for its anti-abortion stance.According to Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern university’s Kellogg management school, Super Bowl participants increasingly fall into two categories: those pushing big product launches, such as Unilever with a new Dove men’s skincare line, and those repositioning their brands, such as Levi Strauss, which wants to revitalise Dockers.Advertisers have been lured by prices lower than last year’s record $3m per 30 seconds. Then, many bookings were taken before the financial markets collapsed.The 60-plus spots on CBS, at $2.5m-$3m each, sold out faster than in recent years.It is still a big sum compared with the $30m annual marketing budget of Diamond Foods, which is pushing two challenger brands – Emerald Nuts and Pop Secret popcorn – in a single commercial featuring a flamboyant dolphin trainer.According to Michael Mendes, its chief executive, the expense is worthwhile because Super Bowl audiences pay attention to the advertisements, whereas “most of the time you’re an irritating break in their programming”.Diamond Foods signed up for its third Super Bowl as much to reach retailers as consumers.Being part of the event has given it a better story in order to secure prominent in-store displays and win over more distribution partners, Mr Mendes says.Even PepsiCo, which is advertising its Doritos snacks during the game but spending most of its $20m budget on digital marketing, is using interest in Super Bowl advertising to attract attention for its “refresh” campaign, which encourages consumers to nominate ideas that deserve funding online.Coca-Cola has pledged a $500,000 philanthropic donation as part of a campaign with Facebook but is planning two light-hearted commercials in sought-after parts of the game.Hamish McLennan, chief executive of Young & Rubicam Advertising, the WPP-owned agency, says that this year should see a return to the humour for which Super Bowl campaigns are known, with advertisers taking creative risks after last year’s focus on value, optimism and sympathy with consumers’ troubles.“You’ll see a more confident tone because consumers are a little more confident,” he says.“They’ve survived a near-death experience in the financial markets.”Mr Young says: “You can see why challenger brands are jumping into it.“Kia can’t compete with Toyota in marketing terms the rest of the year, Dr Pepper can’t compete with Pepsi the rest of the year and Denny can’t compete with McDonald’s the rest of the year.”This Sunday, at least, they will enjoy a level playing field.
417;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-02-03T21:56:34Z;Wall Street falls after disappointing results;;"Wall Street lingered in negative territory on Wednesday after disappointing company results gave investors an excuse to pause following the market’s strongest two-day rally this year.The benchmark S&P 500 finished 0.6 per cent at 1,097.28, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 10,270.55 but the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged at 2,190.91.US stocks fell almost 4 per cent in January on concerns over new banking regulations and the pace of economic growth in China. However, the S&P 500 index staged a recovery earlier this week on the back of positive manufacturing data, rising 2.7 per cent over Monday and Tuesday.But Pfizer, the world’s biggest drugmaker, weighed on the market on Wednesday, dropping 2.3 per cent to $18.62. The group missed quarterly estimates and also gave a disappointing outlook, citing the impact of a stronger dollar on its international sales.Walgreen, the retail pharmacy chain, fell 5.9 per cent to $34.62 after posting a surprise drop in January sales. Revenue from stores open for more than a year fell
1.1 per cent after analysts had expected a 2.2 per cent gain. The chain blamed falling prices for generic drugs and the fact that January 2010 had contained one weekday less than the previous year.Western Union showed the steepest decline on the S&P 500, losing 8.9 per cent to $17.17. The world’s largest money-transfer business reported a 6.6 per cent decline in quarterly profits and gave a pessimistic outlook for the coming year. It was the first time in five quarters that the company managed to only meet the consensus estimate rather than beat it.The series of corporate disappointments overshadowed the release of positive unemployment data. Private companies in the US last month cut jobs at the slowest rate in two years, according to the latest survey by ADP employer services.“Wall Street remains reticent to move ahead in the face of data suggesting only modest expansion,” said Andrew Wilkinson, a senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “Investors’ muted response conveys the perspective that every silver lining comes with a cloud attached. What the street wants to see is job creation and so a slower pace of lay-offs isn’t providing enough impetus at present.“Each positive earnings report seems to come complete with some sort of revenue or profit caveat,” he added.Polo Ralph Lauren posted better-than-expected quarterly profits but the fashion group missed its revenue forecast, sending the shares down 8.4 per cent to $78.51.The media industry was also in focus. AOL reported a decline in quarterly revenues due to continued weakness in the advertising market but the shares still climbed 2.4 per cent to $25.23 because the results were better than expected.AOL, which Time Warner spun off last December, also reported a profit compared with a loss in the previous year.Meanwhile, Time Warner swung to a quarterly profit and became the second media company to raise its dividend this week. But investors were quick to claim profits and the shares dropped 2.1 per cent to $27.90.After the market’s close on Tuesday, News Corp had also announced it would raise its dividend by 25 per cent after the media group’s quarterly results beat expectations.Improving demand for advertising and the success of its 3-D movie Avatar, which has brought in more than $2bn in ticket sales, allowed the group to increase its revenues by 10 per cent over the period. News Corp also sharply increased its full-year earnings guidance, helping to boost its shares 7.1 per cent to $13.67.Shares in Alcoa initially rose after UBS upgraded the country’s largest aluminium producer to “buy”. Analysts at the bank noted that the stock’s recent correction was overdone given the longer-term prospects for Chinese growth and re-stocking by US and European businesses. The shares were later down 1.1 per cent at $13.49.But McDonald’s gained 1.8 per cent to $65.21 as Goldman Sachs added the fast-food empire to their “conviction buy” list."
418;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-02-01T15:31:09Z;China fumes after US arms sales to Taiwan;;Chinese internet users and state media joined in blasting the US on Monday for Washington’s $6.4bn arms package for Taiwan.A few commentators on the internet called for boycotts of American companies.“Let us netizens unite to boycott all American goods,” said a web user on Sina.com, one of China’s biggest internet portals. “No KFC, no McDonald's, and no sightseeing trips to the US”“ China’s response [to impose sanctions] , no matter how vehement, is justified,” said the English-language China Daily, accusing the US of double standards and hypocrisy. People’s Daily said Washington’s “pre-emptive cold war mentality and moral hypocrisy” had surprised the Chinese people. “The US government is ignoring the overall situation of US-China relations and giving in to military and industrial enterprises. This is a pathetic and short-sighted strategy,” it said.Xinhua, the official news agency, paid tribute to the “wrath of the netizens” in a splash on its website during the day but changed to another headline later.On the website of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid owned by the People’s Daily, the Communist party’s leading mouthpiece, more than 61,000 people digitally signed a resolution that pledged: “In the face of America’s hegemonism, China’s netizens can no longer remain quiet. Let us strongly condemn US behaviour!”Some internet users called for China to help strengthen US enemies. “I suggest we sell Iran and North Korea our country’s advanced air defence missiles and other related weapons,” wrote a commentator under the online monicker “Veteran76”.On Tiexue, a web forum for military enthusiasts, several users lamented what they described as too soft a stance by the government. “China should not stop at blaming America but should take concrete action,” wrote one.“Attack across the [Taiwan] Strait, unify China!” said another.But calls for retaliation remained limited.The reaction appeared more moderate than the wave of fury that swept across Chinese cyberspace and culminated in widespread calls for a boycott of Carrefour, the French retailer, after pro-Tibetan protesters disrupted China’s Olympic torch run in Paris in May 2008.A netizen from Sichuan province wrote on Monday “It doesn’t matter if we oppose this or not… and, there’s no need for us to comment… We should recognise our place in the world and not see ourselves as the man in the house.”Nationalist web users said they had failed to get their comments published on Sina.com. An editor at another web portal said websites had received instructions that “extreme comment” should be limited.
419;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-01-31T20:00:14Z;How Guantánamo could rescue Iceland;;There can be little doubt that Iceland was the greatest casualty of the global financial crisis of 2008-09. There was a run on the nation’s banks, which caused all three of them to go bankrupt. Unemployment has skyrocketed and inflation has risen sharply because of a plunge in the value of the currency. McDonald’s has closed its three restaurants on the island because of the high cost of importing food supplies.The crisis has also left a legacy of debt. The European Union wants Reykjavik to repay retail depositors in the UK and the Netherlands for $5.6bn (£3.4bn, €4bn) they had deposited in Icelandic banks. As Iceland is trying to join the European Union its parliament agreed to pay, but the president vetoed the bill because of public anger. Sixty thousand people signed a petition against repaying the deposits with government money. They feared such a large debt because gross domestic product is only $12bn.The global press and recent books have portrayed the Icelandic disaster as a financial event. It actually should be classified as a geopolitical event because of Reykjavik’s special relationship with the US. Iceland entered the 20th century as a Danish colony and the Danish king was head of state. When the Nazis occupied Denmark in 1940, Iceland appointed a regent in his place. The US occupied Iceland in 1942 and the country declared itself a republic in 1944. The US built a major air and naval base at Keflavik. When the war ended, the base stayed open because the US used it to monitor the Soviet navy in the north Atlantic. The US closed the base four years ago because of the end of the cold war.There is an old geopolitical tradition that countries with US military bases never default. This was last upheld in South Korea 13 years ago. In 1997, there was a run on Korea’s banking system by foreign investors and foreign exchange reserves were nearly exhausted. Default appeared imminent but the US promptly intervened to stage a rescue. The International Monetary Fund immediately offered financial assistance. Robert Rubin, the Treasury secretary, and Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, spent the Christmas holiday calling bankers all over the world to request that they roll over Korean loans.If the US had not closed the Keflavik base, Iceland would have experienced a similar rescue. The IMF would have offered assistance as soon as the currency began to weaken. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke would have called for European banks to maintain credit lines. The Pentagon would have told Her Majesty’s Treasury it could not invoke an anti-terror law to seize the assets of the island’s largest banks. The credit rating would have been stable and there would have been no run on the banks. On the contrary, Kaupthing Bank might have taken advantage of the global financial crisis to launch a takeover bid for Royal Bank of Scotland.The challenge for Iceland today is to reopen the US base. It would no longer have a military function but could be an ideal solution to President Barack Obama’s problem of where to place the Guantánamo prisoners. The US has offered Palau $200m to accept 13 prisoners. Bermuda accepted a few to protect its status as a tax haven. The US could show its appreciation to Reykjavik for hosting prisoners by allowing its banks to join the troubled asset relief programme. The US Treasury could cover the cost of repaying Iceland’s retail deposits in the UK and the Netherlands with just one-half of the profit it made on its Goldman Sachs shares. As the prisoners come primarily from Afghanistan, they would probably prefer Iceland’s cooler climate to the tropical heat of Cuba.Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said in November 2008 that the US should not waste a good financial crisis. He was referring to the opportunity that the crisis created to increase federal spending on long-cherished Democratic programmes. His statement could also apply to foreign policy and Guantánamo. The American people do not want any suspected terrorists in their backyard. There are less fortunate countries that would accept Guantánamo prisoners in return for cash. Iceland is ideal to play such a role because it was the closure of a US military base that allowed its financial collapse. Iceland could escape from default and depression if the base were to reopen.The writer is chairman of David Hale Global Economics
420;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-01-22T23:23:15Z;Bank stocks lead Wall Street retreat;;Wall Street suffered its biggest weekly loss since last October after concerns over banks and Chinese monetary policy wreaked havoc on the market.Banking stocks continued their downward slide on Friday following the Obama administration’s revelation on Thursday of a far-reaching overhaul of the sector.Goldman Sachs fell 4.2 per cent to $154.12 and was down 6.7 per cent over the week. Bank of America was 3.7 per cent lower at $14.90.JPMorgan Chase, the second-largest bank by assets, initially opened higher after analysts at Citigroup upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”, saying the new regulations would have a limited impact on the bank. However, the shares were later down 3.4 per cent at $39.16. Citigroup itselfonly lost 0.6 per cent to $3.25.Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: “Reaction to moves by the US government to increase regulation in the banking sector has been mixed with regional banks rallying and larger banks under pressure, which suggests that this move could alter the competitive landscape in that sector.”The S&P 500 fell 2.2 per cent to close near its lowest point of the day at 1,091.76, suffering greater losses than Thursday’s session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.1 per cent to 10,172.98 and the Nasdaq fell 2.7 per cent to 2,205.29. The benchmark index is now showing a loss for 2010, having fallen 2.1 per cent since the start of January.Wall Street also found itself at the mercy of Washington earlier in the week after a shake-up in the Senate prompted a rally among healthcare stocks. Republican Scott Brown’s surprising win in Massachusetts deprived the Democrats of their 60-seat “super-majority”, which could thwart plans to reform the healthcare system.While the Republican victory was widely considered a bullish sign for the market, investors’ attention quickly turned to China.The S&P 500 materials sector had its worst week since October last year after China’s move to tighten monetary policy raised concerns over global demand for commodities. Analysts at Goldman put further pressure on the materials index on Friday after downgrading the US metal and steel sector to “neutral” from “attractive”. United States Steel fell 4.6 per cent to $55 and Alcoa lost 6 per cent to $13.40.Over the week, which was curtailed due to the national holiday on Monday, the S&P 500 was down 3.9 per cent, the Dow had lost 4.1 per cent and the Nasdaq was 3.6 per cent lower. The Vix index, which tracks the market’s volatility via option prices and is known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, surged 25 per cent.The technology sector added to the market’s losses on Friday. Google fell 5.7 per cent to $550.01 after reporting disappointing quarterly revenue growth.Advanced Micro Devices, the second-largest maker of personal computer processors, led the S&P 500 lower for most of the session. Although the company beat both quarterly profit and revenue estimates, analysts feared growth in PC-related stocks was peaking. AMD shares, which had doubled over the past 10 weeks, slid 12.4 per cent to $7.88.Meanwhile, positive signs from corporate America’s heavyweights were largely overshadowed.General Electric edged 0.6 per cent higher to $16.11 after the conglomerate posted a higher quarterly profit than analysts had been expecting. Cost-cutting had helped offset weak demand for industrial equipment, it said.McDonald’s also beat quarterly profit estimates, sending shares in the fast-food chain 0.3 per cent higher to $63.39. But demand was still weak in its US home market due to high levels of unemployment. The stock was the only Dow component to finish higher on Thursday as investors dumped their holdings in the wake of Mr Obama’s address.
421;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Burger King beefs up in battle with Big Mac;;"For years Burger King’s golden crown has lacked the lustre of McDonald’s golden arches. But the home of the Whopper is now trying to lift its game.The two groups may be the world’s largest fast food brands but McDonald’s dwarfs its rival in almost every way. It has 31,000 restaurants globally, compared with Burger King’s 12,000, and its annual global sales, at $23bn, are nearly 10 times larger than its rival’s.McDonald’s has revamped its restaurants, introduced healthier menus and seen its sales climb, while Burger King, owned by three private equity groups, has older outlets, a limited menu and sliding sales.Over the past 12 months Burger King’s shares have slipped 17 per cent to about $18 on Friday, while McDonald’s shares have risen nearly 10 per cent to $63.39.McDonald’s reported sharply higher fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, while Burger King, which reports on February 4, is expected to post a slightly lower profit than last year.Meanwhile, Burger King’s share of the US burger market stands at about 14 per cent, compared with the 47 per cent held by McDonald’s.To lift sales Burger King has been pushing cheaper menu items, such as a $1 double cheeseburger that was launched in mid-October after 18 months of development and testing.Over Christmas it ran a website promotion encouraging people to send their friends a greetings card with a real $1 note inside to be used for cheeseburger purchases.Strong sales of the burger helped stabilise Burger King’s same-store sales in November following a 2.9 per cent drop in global comparable sales in the three months to September, analysts say.“It’s somewhat of a victory,” says UBS analyst David Palmer. “The key question is: will they be able to do the second leg in the prototypical fast-food turnround, trading the consumer back up to premium items to take the pressure off margins?”However, the cheeseburger’s introduction has angered Burger King’s franchisees, which account for some 90 per cent of its restaurants globally.In November the National Franchisee Association filed a class-action lawsuit claiming the company had set a price for the cheeseburger below what it cost franchisees to produce and sell.The cheeseburger could be discontinued in mid-April if franchisees do not vote to keep it. The $1 cheeseburger is a success story Burger King can ill afford to lose.All fast-food chains have struggled in the recession as more people – particularly the unemployed – eat at home. “If you don’t have a job, you’re probably having cereal for breakfast, not an egg McMuffin,” Mr Palmer says.Other retailers have targeted low-cost food sales during the economic downturn and McDonald’s “Dollar Menu” has proved highly successful.McDonald’s also says it will start selling breakfast items such as sausage sandwiches and hash browns for $1 from early this year.Compounding this, analysts say Burger King’s restaurants are among the oldest in the US fast-food industry. The average age of Burger King’s US restaurants is almost 25 years compared with 18 years for McDonald’s restaurants.Burger King is spending $250,000-$1m per store on furnishings that fit into a red and black colour theme.Some 60 restaurants have been redesigned globally, with another 75 expected by the end of this year.Burger King is also attempting to modernise its systems to provide real-time information from its stores on sales and profits, although many in the industry, including McDonald’s, already have such systems in place.Burger King remains heavily exposed in Germany – whose economy is believed to have contracted some 5 per cent last year – where it has more than 650 stores. McDonald’s has some 1,355 restaurants in Germany, but its global scale means it can absorb exposure to weak economies more easily.Elsewhere, Burger King has some catching up to do.The company opened its first outlet in Moscow this week, with another to follow in the next few days; this comes a decade after McDonald’s first got there.Meanwhile, John Chidsey, Burger King’s chairman and chief executive, opened the company’s 12,000th restaurant last month in the Joy City mall in downtown Beijing.China is at the top of Burger King’s priority list for future expansion, but the Joy City outlet is the company’s first in the nation’s capital and only its 25th in the whole of mainland China.That compares with 2,500 KFC outlets and more than 1,000 McDonald’s in the mainland.“The fundamental reason we have some catching up to do in the international market, not just in China, is because the brand was underinvested for decades under its former owners,” Mr Chidsey says from a corner booth seat in the crowded restaurant.Mr Chidsey explains that in the mid-1960s one of the founders of Burger King was told he had cancer and convinced his partner to sell the brand to food conglomerate Pillsbury, of Pillsbury Doughboy fame.By the time he realised it was a false alarm and he was cancer-free, the brand belonged to Pillsbury, which later sold it to the UK’s Grand Metropolitan, which became Diageo.In 2003 the languishing Burger King brand was bought by a troika of private equity groups – TPG Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Bain Capital – which set an aggressive new strategy that focused on rapid expansion in fast-growing markets such as China, Brazil and Russia.At present, 5,000 of the 12,000 Burger King restaurants are outside the US, providing just one third of the company’s pre-tax profits.To help rectify this, Burger King is hoping to diversify its product range and shake up its image through the opening of “Whopper Bars”.Mr Chidsey claims the bars – which are only open in a few cities including Singapore and Munich – will allow customers to choose from some 20 different toppings when ordering their burgers.Some 200-300 bars are expected to be opened globally in the next 5-6 years, many in locations such as airports, casinos, cruise ships and theme parks, which Mr Chidsey describes as “white space” opportunities.Mr Chidsey says 90 per cent of Burger King’s growth comes from outside the US and he expects international stores to provide half of total pre-tax profits within six years.“There are a lot of green fields out there for us and our biggest obstacle is finding enough suitable locations,” says Peter Tan, president of BK Asia-Pacific, gesturing around the Joy City restaurant. “If there were 20 locations like this available today in Beijing, we’d open 20 new stores immediately.”Burger King’s changes may not be fast enough to steal customers back from McDonald’s, which has been quicker to make changes to stay ahead of the competition. In Europe, McDonald’s has introduced kiosks in France where customers can order their own food; it has accelerated its store remodelling and plans to introduce free Wifi access in some 5,000 stores.Nearly half its 6,600 European stores have been redesigned, with the company swapping its previous red and yellow colour theme for green, white and brown.“They do not make things easy for their competitors,” says Keith Siegner, analyst at Credit Suisse."
422;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Two US groups bring hope with results;;Two of America’s best-known companies posted better-than-expected results on Friday, painting a more optimistic picture of the global appetite for everything from hamburgers to healthcare products and services.General Electric, a bellwether for the broader US economy, posted a sharp decline in profits in the fourth quarter but the results beat predictions and the company reassured investors it would return to growth in 2011.McDonald’s, the fast-food restaurant chain, posted strong quarterly earnings, helped by its performance in Europe.“The world we look at really has improved,” said Jeff Immelt, GE chief executive, pointing to stabilisation at its finance arm and a record industrial order backlog. GE’s portfolio includes products from gas turbines to medical-imaging equipment.In the fourth quarter, GE’s net income fell 19 per cent from the previous year to $3.1bn, or $0.28 a share, dragged down by its finance operations. Analysts expected earnings of about $0.26 a share.For the quarter, McDonald’s net income jumped 23 per cent to $1.2bn, or $1.11 per share, up from $985m in the same period of 2008 and narrowly beating consensus estimates.Over the full year, McDonald’s same-store sales rose 5.2 per cent in Europe while the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region gained 3.4 per cent. US comparable stores’ sales were up 2.6 per cent.McDonald’s shares were up 1 per cent to $63.75 while GE shares added 2 per cent to $16.26 in late trading in New York.
423;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Europe proves a feast for McDonald’s;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food chain, on Friday posted strong quarterly net profits, helped by a solid performance in Europe.The increase in profits occurred against a backdrop of economic uncertainty, especially in the US.The world’s largest fast food chain said that fourth-quarter net profit surged 23 per cent to $1.2bn, up from $985m in the same period last year. Full-year net profit rose 6 per cent to $4.6bn.Same-store sales increased 3.8 per cent for the year. In the US, the comparable stores sales were up 2.6 per cent, while in Europe, the figure was 5.2 per cent. For Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, the gain was 3.4 per cent.Full-year earnings per share were $4.11, up 9 per cent from the previous year.The company generated its strongest growth outside the US, led by Europe and the Asia/Pacific Middle East-Africa (Apmea) operations. Excluding currency fluctuations, revenues were up 5 per cent in Europe for the year and 6 per cent in the Apmea regions. By contrast, total revenues were down 2 per cent in the US.Denis Henniquin, head of McDonald’s European operations, said: “In Europe we’ve 40 per cent of the operating income of the global business, on 30 per cent of the sales and 20 per cent of the restaurants. We’re getting half of the capital allocation this year for the whole business to transform our growth.”In Europe, McDonald’s is redesigning restaurants to keep customers on site for longer, which would lead to greater spending per unit. Already, the average customer purchase in Europe is higher than in the US.For the first three quarters, McDonald’s international earnings were impeded by a weakening US dollar, a trend which reversed in the fourth quarter, giving the company an additional earnings boost in the last three months of 2009.While the Apmea region’s results were strong, revenues in China lagged behind. “Although the economy [in China] is improving, it will still be some time before consumers regain confidence and [are] willing to spend more,” said Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive.
424;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-01-19T21:43:09Z;Healthcare stocks lead Wall Street higher;;"Speculation over a Republican victory in Massachusetts prompted a rally among healthcare and helped Wall Street hit a fresh 15-month high.The S&P 500 healthcare index recorded its largest daily gain since July last year, rising 2 per cent, as voters in the northeastern state headed to the polls in a crucial election for a new US senator.A win for the Republicans could derail Democrat plans for sweeping healthcare reform, which has weighed on the sector in recent months.Last-minute opinion polls indicated the Republican candidate had the lead over Martha Coakley, the state’s Democrat attorney-general.Wellpoint, one of the largest US health insurers, climbed 2.1 per cent to $68.06, while United Health Group was up 4.1 per cent at $35.13.Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said: “Massachusetts may be sending a message that a lot of voters do not want substantial healthcare reform.“That surprising outcome would be viewed as a positive [for the sector] because it could lead to stalemate and a reconsideration of the whole healthcare agenda.“It has been weighing on the healthcare sector but more importantly the uncertainty about healthcare costs and new taxes stands as an impediment to any corporation that may be looking at expanding their business.”Technology stocks also rose, in anticipation of positive quarterly results from IBM after the closing bell. Shares in the software company – considered the sector’s bellwether – rose 1.8 per cent to $134.14. Last week, Intel reported revenues and profits sharply above analysts’ expectations and gave an optimistic forecast for the first quarter, citing improving demand for electronic goods in the recovery. The shares were up 1.2 per cent at $21.05.However, shares in Google initially fell after the group announced it had postponed the launch of two mobile phones in China. Last week, the company threatened to quit China following suspected cyberattacks, raising fears of a deterioration in the country’s trade relations with the US. However, the shares ended 1.3 per cent up at $587.62 in anticipation of good results from the search engine this week.Elsewhere, Alcatel-Lucent, the world’s largest supplier of fixed-line phone networks, fell 3 per cent to $3.61 after Unicredit cut the stock to “sell” from “hold”. Analysts said the group could suffer from increased competition from China’s Huawei, the country’s largest telecoms provider.After climbing steadily higher, the S&P 500 closed at the highest level since October last year, having risen 1.25 per cent to 1,150.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent to 10,725.43 and the Nasdaq was 1.4 per cent higher at 2,320.40.Wall Street had initially opened lower after results from Citigroup unsettled the market.Citigroup reported a fourth-quarter loss of $7.6bn after its decision to repay government bail-out funds put an end to its run of three consecutive profitable quarters. The results were broadly in line with expectations but the shares, which lost more than 50 per cent last year, dipped in and out of the red as investors picked through the details. The stock was later up 3.5 per cent at $3.54.Last Friday, JPMorgan reported higher profits than Wall Street had been expecting but the shares fell sharply because of to concerns over rising loan losses. JPMorgan was down again on Tuesday, falling 0.9 per cent to $43.28.Shares in Kraft Foods fell 0.6 per cent to $29.41 after the consumer group finally agreed to a revised deal to buy Cadbury for about $19.6bn.The agreement follows months of hostile relations after Kraft made an unsolicited bid for the British confectioner last August.Fast-food chains were also in focus after Credit Suisse adjusted its ratings on the sector. McDonald’s rose 1.9 per cent to $63.48 after analysts raised the stock to “outperform” from “neutral”.However, Burger King was cut to “neutral” from “outperform”, sending its shares down 2.7 per cent
to $18.00."
425;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2010-01-19T17:17:49Z;Growing taste for quality lures big brands;Jenny Wiggins on tapping ‘optimism’ of emerging markets;When Cadbury introduced a new version of Dairy Milk in Mumbai this month, the confectioner claimed it had created a chocolate bar with the quality to match its products anywhere in the world. “Consumers are moving forward,” said Anand Kripalu, Cadbury’s managing director in India. “There is huge set of emerging consumers who want world-class products.”At Rs49 ($1, £0.65, €0.74) for a 69g bar, Dairy Milk Silk is more expensive than regular Dairy Milk and it will be promoted with slick television advertisements made by Ogilvy, the global agency. It is aimed, says Cadbury, at the “upper socio-economic classes”.The bar’s launch after three years of research and development is evidence that the consumer market is not all about cheap, made-to-measure products.Cadbury’s longstanding presence in India, where it controls almost two-thirds of the chocolate market, is one of the reasons it is being acquired by Kraft, the US food group.Harish Manwani, who runs the emerging market businesses of Unilever, the soup and soap multinational, claims there are no longer big differences between emerging and developed market consumers because of “a tectonic shift” in the global economy.Increasingly, Unilever is launching products in developing markets, such as the brand Clear, an anti-dandruff shampoo introduced to China more than two years ago. The Clear brand was then extended into more than 30 countries, including Brazil and Russia.Still, while emerging markets consumers are becoming wealthier, some consumption habits have been hard to change. In Russia, suspicion of products that are discounted or sold on promotion has only recently begun to dissipate.Before the Soviet Union’s collapse, products were discounted because there was something wrong with them – such as milk on the verge of going off, says Irene Shvakman, in the Moscow office of McKinsey & Co. To gauge quality in an era when there were no brands, consumers used to find out where products were made, because certain factories were known to produce better-quality goods than others. Today, Russians are still fussy about where products come from, forcing dairy suppliers to build lots of local factories to keep supplies fresh, Ms Shvakman adds. But even as companies expand to take advantage of the country’s rising wealth, they need to be careful how they price products.Russia is the fastest-growing market in Europe for McDonald’s in terms of restaurant openings: it plans to add up to 45 outlets over the next two years to the 245 it already has. Still, Khamzat Khasbulatov, chief executive of McDonald’s Russia, says the fast food chain keeps price increases lower than the rate of inflation. “Consumers in Russia are really price sensitive …we’ve been very careful in managing our menu prices.”The key difference between emerging markets’ consumers and others may be how they think about the future.“The emerging market consumer has much more of his life in front of him …and they have an amazing optimism about the future,” says Bharat Puri, global chocolate category director for Cadbury. Half the population in India is under 25 years of age, whereas in many developed markets, the average age is about 40.Diageo, the drinks group that owns the Guinness stout brand, is tapping into this sense of optimism in even the most underdeveloped markets.Nigeria recently overtook Ireland to become the second biggest market for Guinness, partly due to the success of a pan-regional advertising campaign themed “Greatness” that portrays a prosperous future for African men.The latest advertisement shows Tommy Howe, an English football scout, visiting west Africa in search of players. Mr Howe appears surprised at the talent he finds, saying: “Here, give a man half the chance and he takes it.”
426;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Fund focus: Martin Currie North American fund;;"Martin Currie’s Tom Walker is probably the UK retail industry’s best-known US equity manager, with nearly £750m ($1.2bn, €841m) under management in two open-ended funds.Staking out a reputation for stock picking in the world’s most efficient equity market is no mean feat: the S&P 500 is a famously hard benchmark to beat.Mr Walker and his co-manager David Forsyth use the slightly broader MSCI North America index instead, but it has proved just as challenging a match.Over the past five years, the core Martin Currie North American fund has returned 27.5 per cent, a whisker under the benchmark growth of 27.6 per cent.Against his peers in the IMA North America sector, Mr Walker’s long-term track-record looks better, however. The average fund has netted just 17.9 per cent over the past half decade – less than two-thirds of the index return. It has been a tough few years for active management.Mr Walker himself did not emerge unscathed from the crisis.He outperformed strongly in the first half of 2008 thanks to hefty exposure to resource companies, but when the commodity story soured, so too did his performance record.His relatively light exposure to the so-called “megacaps” – the top 20 stocks in the index, which benefited from the “flight to size” – did not help matters either. He ended the year with a 21 per cent loss – worse than both the benchmark and the peer group.The manager gradually sold down his commodity exposure through the third and fourth quarters as the full economic impact of the banking crisis became clear. But 2009 has proved the mirror opposite of the second half of 2008, with resource companies leading the upwards charge.A portfolio full of defensive holdings has meant Mr Walker has again struggled in relative terms. “The quality companies have been left behind. McDonald’s has had positive earnings revisions but it has been derated and derated,” he
complains.Mr Walker is now focusing on companies such as McDonald’s that have the size and credibility necessary to increase market share during a downturn.Another high-profile example is Apple, Mr Walker’s single largest holding, which, with its iPhone, continues to take market share in the smartphones market that used to be monopolised by Research in Motion’s BlackBerry.Such companies benefit from strong branding and high barriers to entry, factors Mr Walker loosely defines as “quality”.Quality is one of the four pillars of the Martin Currie investment philosophy. The other three are value, growth and – most importantly – “change”.What change means in concrete terms is that Mr Walker is particularly attentive to revisions in sell-side analysts’ profit forecasts. He likes companies that have seen their earnings outlook upgraded.This year’s focus on change has meant he has missed out on most of the strong rebound stories, for example in the banking and retail sectors. He has steered clear of Bank of America, which has rocketed by a factor of five from its low.“We have always said to investors that we look for positive change before buying into companies.“Bank of America continues to have negative
earnings revisions,” he explains.Stephen Wilmot is features writer at Investment Adviser"
427;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-12-11T21:44:36Z;US stocks rise after strong sales data;;US stocks edged higher on Friday after retail sales growth in November proved to have been twice as strong as expected.However, the positive data also sent the dollar higher and raised concerns over future interest rate hikes, containing Wall Street’s gains.After briefly dipping into the red, the S&P 500 regained momentum in the afternoon and closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,106.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 10,471.50 and the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged at 2,190.31.“The low-rate environment has been the reason to own stocks but people are starting to think twice,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.A stronger dollar and lingering concerns over the sovereign debt of Dubai, Greece and Spain weighed on the market at the beginning of the week.Disappointing sales results from corporate heavyweights also left investors concerned about the pace of economic recovery.Over the week, the S&P was unchanged, the Dow rose 0.8 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 0.2 per cent.After last week’s disappointing November sales results from retailers, investors had been nervously awaiting Friday’s reading on the sector.McDonald’s also heightened investor anxieties on Tuesday by reporting its second straight month of sales declines at its US restaurants. The announcement sent its shares down more than 2 per cent.The following day, CKE Restaurants, which owns the Carl’s Jr hamburger chain, lost 3.6 per cent after reporting lower third-quarter profit than had been expected.But Christopher & Banks, the women’s clothing chain, added to Wall Street’s optimism over consumer spending on Friday.Its shares soared 26.9 per cent to $7.64 after the retailer said it expected to make a profit in the third quarter and not a loss as it had previously forecast.Encouraging corporate announcements from manufacturers also buoyed the market.Boeing said it would finally test its 787 Dreamliner jet, which has been facing more than two years of delays. The group’s shares gained 1.1 per cent to $55.60.Meanwhile, Esterline Technologies, which manufactures jet engine parts, said profits had slumped more than 20 per cent in the fourth quarter. However, the results were still better than expected and the group said it expects sales to pick up through the year. Its shares climbed 4.2 per cent to $42.72.United Technologies rose 2.2 per cent to $69.40 after the diversified manufacturer said profit would rise 10 per cent next year.The group said it expected commercial construction to remain weak in the US and Europe but hoped that a year of aggressive cost-cutting would pay off.On Thursday, the company’s shares rose 0.8 per cent after it increased its stake in Clipper Windpower, the British wind turbine manufacturer.NCR, which is best known for its manufacture of ATMs, was raised to “overweight” from “neutral” by JPMorgan, lifting its shares 9.5 per cent to $10.72.Analysts said the group’s acquisition this week of Dvdplay, an operator of 1,300 film rental kiosks, would help the group increase revenues by 5 per cent next year.Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence company climbed 1.1 per cent to $76.78 after winning a $318m contract to provide support services in Iraq and Afghanistan.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods company, bought Sara Lee’s air freshener business, including the Ambi Pur brand, for $470m.While Procter & Gamble edged 0.2 per cent higher to $62.34, Sara Lee also gained 0.2 per cent to $12.21.
428;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-12-09T22:46:14Z;Vevo could be saviour of music video;;Video may have killed the radio star but some of the music industry’s most senior executives lined up on Tuesday night to declare that online video could be the salvation for stars and labels after a decade of digital mis-steps.The chief executives of Universal Music, Sony Music and EMI Music joined forces with Eric Schmidt, chairman and chief executive of Google, to hail the launch of Vevo, their online music video joint venture, as the best thing for the business since MTV began in 1981.“Vevo is a chance, perhaps the chance to please stop playing defence,” Doug Morris, chairman and chief executive of Universal Music told attendees of the lavish launch party, who included the singers 50 Cent and Lady Gaga. “Vevo is a huge platform, and you know what’s best of all? It’s our platform,” Mr Morris added.Vevo, developed by Google’s YouTube online video sharing site, launched on Tuesday night with content from Universal and Sony. EMI, which signed up at the last minute, will make its videos available in the new year, while Warner Music has yet to agree whether to join.Despite some limitations, including a number of initial technical bugs and no high definition video until next year, executives and artists lavished praise on what they see as a promising venture.Mr Morris said it had already secured “millions of advertising dollars” from brands including AT&T, MasterCard and McDonald’s, which are keen to reach “the most sought-after demographic” of young music fans. Vevo is reportedly pushing for high CPMs – the cost per thousand advertising impressions – of $25 to $40.He hinted that the partners could charge for content in time, saying it would experiment with subscription, e-commerce and other models and – without mentioning Apple’s highly-controlled iTunes store – “we don’t have to ask anyone’s permission”.Rio Caraeff, the Universal executive in charge of the venture, announced new partners including AOL and CBS, which plan to embed Vevo’s technology in their own sites to expand its distribution.Vevo, which has financial backing from the Abu Dhabi Media Company, should benefit from heavy traffic from the start, as Google is effectively moving all full-length professional music videos from YouTube to the new site.It would start with “tens and tens of millions of users”, said Mr Morris, who this week used a Bloomberg interview to confirm that Lucian Grainge, head of Universal’s international operations, would succeed him at the helm of the Vivendi division after 2010.Performers including Mariah Carey and John Mayer underlined Vevo’s potential for reinventing the music video, an art form that has lost its commercial rationale since MTV’s heyday.
429;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-12-08T21:48:54Z;McDonald’s adds to Wall St jitters;;Sales declines at McDonald’s added to investor jitters about the pace of economic recovery, sending US stocks sharply lower on Tuesday.Fears resurfaced about the developing debt crisis in Dubai and investors also became more concerned about Greece’s ability to manage its fiscal deficit following Fitch’s downgrade.“The problem with Dubai and Greece is that it could spread to other emerging markets, which will then affect risk assets here in the United States,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global. “We’re watching the Bovespa and keeping an eye on contagion because that’s where the opportunities are and that’s where we need to be careful.”Disappointing news from corporate America heightened investors’ concerns about economic recovery closer to home.McDonald’s reported its second straight month of sales declines at its restaurants in the US. Sales fell 0.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis in the company’s home market and also declined in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Strong demand in Europe helped the group post a 0.7 per cent rise in global like-for-like sales but it was the smallest monthly gain in five years. The restaurant chain’s shares were down 2.1 per cent at $60.61.A lower than expected profit forecast from 3M, the diversified manufacturer, also weighed on the market from the opening bell.However, it said it still planned to spend about $1bn on acquisitions over the next 12 months. Shares in the group, which makes Post-it notes, fell 1 per cent to $77.11.Kroger fell the most in the benchmark index after the grocery chain reported quarterly results sharply below estimates and cut its forecast. The retailer said it had suffered from greater competition and declining food prices. Its shares plunged 11.9 per cent to $20.13.The pessimism spread to its competitors, sending shares in Safeway down 6.8 per cent to $20.91 and Supervalu 8.7 per cent lower to $13.18.The S&P 500 closed down 1 per cent at 1,091.94 and all the S&P sectors were in the red. Energy stocks showed the sharpest declines as oil prices fell due to the stronger dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 10,285.97 and the Nasdaq lost 0.8 per cent to 2,172.99.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Procter & Gamble said AG Lafley, chairman, would retire in early 2010 and Bob McDonald, chief executive, would take over the role as chairman. Shares in the world’s biggest consumer products company fell 1 per cent to $61.87.Kimco Realty, the shopping centre owner, announced plans to sell 25m shares to pay down debt. Last month, the group trimmed its outlook after reporting a 63 per cent drop in third-quarter profit. The group has been plagued by rising vacancies as retailers have downsized in the recession. Its shares fell 4.4 per cent to $12.51.Strong demand for Jack Daniel’s whiskey helped Brown-Forman post quarterly profit above expectations, prompting the drinks group to raise its outlook. Its shares slipped 0.2 per cent to $52.12.After weeks of wrangling, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sealed a deal to buy Diedrich Coffee for about $290m in cash. Green Mountain had been locked in a bidding war with Peet’s Coffee & Tea over the company but Peet’s announced on Monday that it would not raise its offer any further. Diedrich dropped 1.3 per cent to $34.68, Green Mountain gained 4 per cent to $62.82 and Peet’s was up 3.1 per cent to $31.95.In other deal news, Francisco Partners, the private equity group, announced it was buying QuadraMed for $126m, sending shares in the healthcare information technology company 29.6 per cent higher to $8.31.FedEx helped to lift investor confidence after the shipping company raised its profit forecast, sending its shares up 2.7 per cent to $89.88.Shares in Relm Wireless showed some of Wall Street’s sharpest gains, surging 61.3 per cent to $3.92.The maker of wireless communication products won a five-year contract to provide the US government with digital two-way radios.
430;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-12-08T19:26:25Z;McDonald’s chews on weak sales;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food chain, reported on Tuesday its weakest monthly global sales performance since the start of the US recession, while comparable sales at its US stores fell for the second month in a row.The company’s global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months increased just 0.7 per cent.US restaurant sales declined 0.6 per cent on a comparable basis, following a 0.1 per cent decline in September.Sales in Europe grew by 2.5 per cent, with continued strength in the UK and France offset by weakness in Germany.McDonald’s company- owned and franchised restaurants in the Middle East, Asia and Africa reported a 2 per cent decline in comparable sales, as weakness in Japan added to continued slack demand in China.In the US, the retailer’s low-cost food offerings, epitomised by its Dollar Menu, have consistently outperformed much of the competition since the start of the global economic slump.It has also boosted sales and customer traffic with the national roll-out of its McCafe speciality coffees, a strategy aimed at increasing breakfast-time visits to its stores.But the company’s steadily increasing US monthly sales began to turn negative in September, in an apparent response to rising levels of unemployment.McDonald’s said that its US results reflected “the sluggish economy but remained among the best in the industry”. Its US fast-food competitors have also responded to the slow economy with a range of “value” offerings, such as the “Why Pay More?” menu recently launched by Yum Brands’ Taco Bell, and Subway’s “$5 foot-long” sandwiches.Yum, owner of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, warned last week that it faced a “difficult consumer environment” in its current fourth quarter and predicted an 8 per cent fall in comparable US sales.It also highlighted falling demand in China, which accounts for about half of its revenues, with sales in the country expected to decline by 3 per cent.Western fast food restaurants in China have lost business as consumers switch back to eating at cheaper local restaurants, and have been hit by the decline of demand in coastal industrial cities.McDonald’s monthly sales update disappointed investors, and its shares fell more than 1 per cent by lunchtime in New York to $60.75.● Kroger, owner of the largest network of traditional US supermarkets, saw its shares fall over 10 per cent on Tuesday, after reporting disappointing third-quarter results.The retailer cited “persistent deflation, unusually intense competition and the cautious mind-set of customers”, as it cut its full- year earnings guidance to $1.60 to $1.70 per share, from a previous forecast of $1.90 to $2.00.Kroger also announced a $1.05bn writedown on the value of its Ralph’s grocery chain.
431;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-12-08T18:33:58Z;McDonald’s;Sometimes even a value meal doesn’t cut it;Sometimes even a value meal doesn’t cut it. McDonald’s comparable sales for November showed weakness globally, even though the fast-food chain has generally succeeded in winning market share in the slump. US sales unexpectedly fell, as rising unemployment hit breakfast sales in particular and rivals ramped up cut-price marketing campaigns. Previously strong European sales managed only 2.5 per cent growth, half what was expected. And despite their positive macroeconomic gloss, emerging market sales contracted.Adjust for the number of trading days month-to-month, however, and underlying trends look broadly similar to October, Deutsche Bank points out. In Asia, last November’s 13 per cent growth set a high bar to beat. But another poor month in China, where McDonald’s is a more upmarket choice than on home turf, suggests consumer confidence is lagging behind improvements in output – particularly in the coastal regions where McDonald’s has many of its restaurants.That softness means McDonald’s will open only 140 stores in China this year, not the expected 175. But that should leave it with opportunities ready to go as the Chinese rediscover their taste for Big Macs. Meanwhile, the company expects to remodel about 800 US stores in 2010, about double its haul this year. Only about 40 per cent of its US restaurants have had the treatment since 2003, associated with a significant sales uplift. That could help keep the Golden Arches competitive. Trading at a little below 14 times 2010 forecast earnings, McDonald’s shares – which have gone sideways for two years – are close to the bottom end of their historical range. Those doubting next year’s prospects should take comfort in a historically high dividend yield. After Tuesday’s sell-off, McDonald’s stock looks a decent-value bite.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially

After hitting a new intraday high for the year in the first hour of trading, the S&P 500 fell into the red and ended flat at 1,109.24.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 10,452.68 but the Nasdaq clung to its gains, finishing the session 0.4 per cent higher at 2,185.03.On Tuesday, stocks rallied as fears receded over Dubai’s debt crisis. Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, said the market’s turnround in late morning trading was due to the renewed strength of the dollar. “The market was rallying and then the dollar strengthened and it shut down the market,” he said.He added that Wall Street was looking ahead to the unemployment report due out on Friday and was also wary of technical breakthroughs by the benchmark index. Optimistic comments from the Federal Reserve in its Beige Book report had little obvious impact on the market.But airlines remained in favour throughout the session after Morgan Stanley turned bullish on the sector, upgrading AMR, parent of American Airlines, and UAL, which owns United Airlines, from “equal weight” to “overweight”.The brokerage said there was a reduced risk of a liquidity crisis at one of the major carriers and told investors they would be unlikely to find a better entry point for the industry. AMR gained 8 per cent to $6.79 and UAL jumped 12.5 per cent to $9.29. ExpressJet also gained 3 per cent to $3.76 after Jim Ream, chief executive of the regional carrier, said he was leaving to become head of maintenance at AMR.There were also management changes at McDonald’s. Shares in the fast food empire fell 1.6 per cent to $62.50 after Ralph Alvarez, president and chief operating officer, said he would retire due to health reasons. Mr Alvarez had been considered a likely replacement for Jim Skinner, chief executive, who is nearing retirement.Homebuilders were also in focus after Credit Suisse upgraded KB Home from “neutral” to “outperform”, citing an attractive valuation.While KB Home shares held on to a 0.6 per cent gain at $13.77, the rest of the sector fared worse with Pulte Homes, the country’s largest homebuilder, finishing flat at $9.31. An unexpected jump in pending home sales had buoyed the sector on Tuesday.A series of deals helped to boost sentiment in the technology sector. Intuit, which makes accountancy software, agreed to sell Real Estate Solutions to Vista Equity Partners, the buy-out group, for about $128m. Intuit shares rose 0.8 per cent to $29.67.TeleCommunication Systems, the wireless provider, announced that it was buying Networks In Motion for $170m, sending its shares down 0.6 per cent to $8.84.The group hopes the acquisition of the privately-held company will bolster its navigation services.Amazongave the index the biggest lift, up 2.7 per cent to $142.25 after reports suggested the online retailer had been popular over the Thanksgiving holiday.Elsewhere in retail, Joseph A Bank Clothiers, the men’s clothing chain, posted third-quarter results above expectations.Sales at the upmarket chain have held up during the recession, helped by promotional offers. Its shares gained 2.6 per cent to $43.92.While financial stocks were broadly down on comments by US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on derivatives regulation, regional banks fared better.SunTrust Banks, the Atlanta-based bank, rose 0.4 per cent to $23.29 after Credit Suisse raised its stock to “outperform”.Marshall & Ilsley, based in Wisconsin, announced after the closing bell on Tuesday an offer to buy up to $400m in debt securities. After an early surge, shares in the financial group lost 0.9 per cent to $5.67.Elsewhere in the sector, SWS Group, the financial services company, lost 2.7 per cent to $12.34 after it offered 4.1m shares to raise funds for acquisitions.

Shares in the fast food empire fell 1.6 per cent to $62.50 after Ralph Alvarez, president and chief operating officer, said he would retire due to health reasons.Mr Alvarez had been considered a likely replacement for Jim Skinner, chief executive, who is nearing retirement.Homebuilders were also in focus after Credit Suisse upgraded KB Home from “neutral” to “outperform”, citing an attractive valuation.While KB Home shares hung on to a 0.6 per cent gain to $13.77, the rest of the sector fared worse with Pulte Homes, the country’s largest homebuilder, finishing flat at $9.31. An unexpected jump in pending home sales had buoyed the sector on Tuesday.A series of deals helped to boost sentiment in the technology sector.Intuit, which makes accountancy software, agreed to sell Real Estate Solutions to the buy-out firm Vista Equity Partners for about $128m. Intuit shares rose 0.8 per cent to $29.67.TeleCommunication Systems, the wireless provider, announced that it was buying Networks In Motion for $170m, sending its shares down 0.6 per cent to $8.84.The group hopes the acquisition of the privately- held company will bolster its navigation services.Amazon shares gave the index the biggest lift, climbing 2.7 per cent to $142.25 after reports suggested that the online retailer had been popular over the Thanksgiving holiday.Elsewhere in retail, Joseph A Bank Clothiers, the men’s clothing chain, posted third-quarter results above expectations.Sales at the upmarket chain have held up during the recession, helped by promotional offers. Its shares gained 2.6 per cent to $43.92.While financial stocks were broadly down on comments by US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on derivatives regulation, regional banks fared better. Shares in SunTrust Banks, the Atlanta-based bank, rose 0.4 per cent to $23.29 after Credit Suisse raised the stock to “outperform”.Marshall & Ilsley, based in Wisconsin, announced after the closing bell on Tuesday an offer to purchase up to $400m in debt securities. After an early surge, shares in the company lost 0.9 per cent to $5.67.Elsewhere in the sector, SWS Group, the financial services group, lost 2.7 per cent to $12.34 after it offered 4.1m shares to raise funds for acquisitions.
434;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Recession sees growth in fast-food outlets;;From takeaway pizza outlets to purveyors of deep-fried chickens, the recession has proven to be a boon for fast-food operators as more people have turned to cheap and easy food.At a time when restaurant chains, hit by higher operating costs and lower spending among diners, are scaling back growth plans, fast food companies, emboldened by new custom and lower rent, have expanded their presence on high streets. According to the Local Data Company, which monitors 705 town centres across the UK, the number of fast-food chains in the top 10 UK cities rose 8.2 per cent in the year to October, after a 6.6 per cent increase the previous year.Central London posted the biggest gain, adding 73 units to bring the number of outlets to 847. It was followed by Manchester and Glasgow, which added 16 and 13 respectively bringing their number of fast-food restaurants to 74 and 94.But the growing popularity of fast food has not been all bad news for the nation’s waistlines.Indeed, some of the biggest increases in numbers of stores have been among the more healthy sandwich sellers on the high street, such as Prêt a Manger and Eat, although the largest store expansion has been from Subway, which has increased its stores across all town centres and shopping centres by more than a quarter.Domino, which operates a franchise business, and KFC were among the traditional fast-food sellers to have also grown store presence although McDonald’s and Burger King have done little or even shrunk their numbers.Stephen Broome, leisure analyst at PwC, the professional services firm, said the numbers were in line with rising demand for what is deemed as “healthy fast food”.“People still want their burgers and chips . . . but more and more people are understanding the need for a balanced diet and that is stimulating the demand for healthier fast food,” he said.While many of the larger chains have been able to take advantage of the problems on the high street to secure prime locations at cheaper rents, the increase in healthier fast food offerings can also be attributed to a rise in the proportion of independent food operators opening over the past year.Analysts suggest that more people have launched new businesses, including independent cafés and sandwich shops, having lost jobs or closed businesses. The percentage of independent fast-food chains – those with fewer than five stores – has increased to 46.8 per cent of the market, from 44.6 per cent.But as the battle for the British food budget intensifies, restaurant chains have begun to hit back. Two-for-one meal offers at mid-price chains such as Strada or Pizza Express are now a frequent fixture in newspapers and magazines, while a growing number of restaurant operators are seeing home delivery as a way to reduce losses.
435;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-11-09T22:14:00Z;US stocks rally on deals;;"Deal activity by companies from chocolate makers to a nuclear submarine manufacturer buoyed Wall Street confidence on Monday, lifting US stocks after last week’s strong gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2 per cent at 10,226.94, its highest level since October last year.The S&P 500 gained 2.2 per cent to 1,093.08 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2 per cent at 2,154.06.In spite of volatile trading, Wall Street closed higher every day last week, shrugging off Friday’s data that showed a spike in unemployment.A rally in the technology sector after Cisco’s results gave the Nasdaq its biggest daily gain since July.“The market was probably too short going into those payroll numbers and the fact that there wasn’t a downside on Friday has injected some confidence,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.After an indicative offer two months ago, Kraft launched a formal hostile bid for Cadbury on Monday, valuing the UK company at £9.8bn ($16.4bn).The terms were the same as the original offer but, due to the fall in Kraft’s share price, the implied value of the latest bid was slightly lower. Cadbury rejected the offer as “derisory”.While the deal activity boosted market sentiment, Kraft was the only Dow company to end the day in negative territory, losing 0.9 per cent to $26.53. Cadbury shares edged up in London.In other deals, Northrop Grumman, one of the largest US defence contractors, agreed to sell TASC, its advisory services unit, for $1.65bn to private equity groups General Atlantic and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.The sale is the latest sign of a revival in leveraged buy-outs. Northrop rose 3 per cent to $53.93.Reports also revealed that Comcast was planning to finalise a deal to buy a controlling stake in NBC Universal from General Electric by next Monday. The acquisition would create one of the US’s largest media companies and values NBC Universal at about $30bn.Comcast rose 3.8 per cent to $15.15 and General Electricgained 3.4 per cent to $15.85.A pledge by the G20 over the weekend to keep stimulus programmes in place until the recovery was more certain added to the market’s optimism and boosted financial stocks. Bank of Americawas up 4.8 per cent to $15.77 and Citigroup gained 3.2 per cent to $4.19.Elsewhere in the banking sector, East West Bancorpsurged 55 per cent to $13.41 after the California-based bank purchased its main rival United Commercial Bank (UCB), which was seized by regulators last week.UCB, based in San Francisco, was the 120th bank to fail this year and was estimated to have assets worth $11.2bn. Morgan Stanley analysts welcomed the deal, upgrading East West from “equal-weight” to “overweight”.The G20 assurances pushed gold to fresh highs and boosted other metal prices. ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, was raised from “neutral” to “buy” by MF Global, pushing the shares 4.9 per cent higher to $36.82.United States Steel gained 3.6 per cent to $38.11 and the S&P Materials sector was up 3.2 per cent.Global sales figures from McDonald’s sent shares in the fast food chain up 1.5 per cent to $62.64.Total like-for-like sales rose 3.3 per cent in October, helped by strong demand from Europe. The gains help to offset a 0.1 per cent decline in US sales – the first monthly decline in the fast food retailer’s home market since March 2008.Shares in RadioShack, the electronics retailer, were set to hit their highest level for two years after jumping 14.3 per cent to $20.27. The chain announced plans to sell versions of Apple’s iPhone later this month.Dish Network rose 5.2 per cent to $20.14 after the company, America’s second-largest satellite TV provider, beat Wall Street forecasts.Trex, the deckings and railings maker, was one of the market’s few casualties.Its shares fell 2.5 per cent to $16.86 after the group posted a quarterly loss due to an impairment charge and continued weakness
in the home construction sector."
436;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;McDonald’s pulls out of Iceland;;Iceland edged further towards the margins of the global economy on Monday when McDonald’s announced the closure of its three restaurants in the crisis-hit country and said that it had no plans to return.The move will see Iceland, one of the world’s wealthiest nations per capita until the collapse of its banking sector last year, join Albania, Armenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in a small band of European countries without a McDonald’s.The loss of the Golden Arches highlights the extent of Iceland’s economic demise since the pre-crisis boom years when its “Viking Raider” entrepreneurs turned Reykjavik into an international finance centre and launched a buying spree of high-profile European assets.McDonald’s blamed the closures on the “very challenging economic climate” and the “unique operational complexity” of doing business in an island nation of just 300,000 people on the edge of the Arctic Circle.Most ingredients used by McDonald’s in Iceland are imported from Germany – leading to a doubling in costs as the krona has collapsed while the euro has strengthened.Magnus Ogmundsson, managing director of Lyst, the McDonald’s franchise holder in Iceland, said that price rises of at least 20 per cent were needed to produce an acceptable profit. That would have pushed the price of a Big Mac burger well above the $5.75 it costs to buy one in Switzerland, home to the world’s most expensive McDonald’s, according to the Big Mac index.Lyst plans to rebrand its three restaurants – all in the Reykjavik area – under a new name, Metro, and adapt the menu to use more locally produced meat and vegetables after its McDonald’s franchise ends on Saturday.Mr Ogmundsson admitted that some customers were alarmed by the symbolism of such a recognisable brand abandoning Iceland but others have reacted positively. “People are pleased that we will be sourcing more goods locally,” he says.
437;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-10-22T20:45:44Z;Wall St rebounds from early losses;;US equities rebounded from early losses on Thursday, led by a surge in financials and some upbeat results from blue chip companies.Investors initially displayed caution on Thursday, with the earnings and guidance posted by some companies sparking profit-taking.Some analysts and money managers expect further gains for the broad market as earnings season continues to broadly exceed expectations.“With stock markets enjoying the macro sweet spot and third-quarter earnings likely to beat expectations again, we remain confident that the S&P 500 index will reach our year-end target of 1,200,” said John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International.However, he also cautioned that “stocks are likely to remain volatile” due to over-bought conditions and valuations getting stretched, the S&P now trades at an earnings multiple of 20 times, up from 10 times in March. Investors also have concerns about the sustainability of the economy’s recovery and uncertainty about central banks exiting their programmes of buying bonds and normalising overnight borrowing rates.At the closing bell in New York, the S&P 500 had risen 1.1 per cent to 1,092.91 and bounced from an early drop of 0.7 per cent to 1,074.31.After the closing bell, Amazon reported third-quarter earnings of 45 cents per share, beating estimates of 33 cents. The stock surged 7 per cent above $100 in after-hours trading, having closed a fraction higher at $93.45 in regular trade.Also out with earnings after the bell was American Express and while third-quarter income fell 25 per cent, the result beat estimates and credit card company reported fewer customer’ defaults. The stock closed up $1.34 at $36.44, and was trading above $37 in after-hours activity.Meanwhile, equity volatility as measured by the Vix dropped below 21, near its lowest level in more than a year.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,165.29 and outweighed the drag from Ebay, which disappointed investors after it forecast fourth-quarter profit and revenue towards the lower end of analysts’ estimates late on Wednesday.The stock slid 4.2 per cent to $23.97 after the internet auction site reported a third-quarter net profit of $350m, or 27 cents a share, down from $492m, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to close at 10,081.31 as earnings results from a host of its members boosted sentiment for blue chips.Among Dow constituents reporting on Thursday was 3M, and its stock rose 3.2 per cent to $78.79, after it reported third-quarter net income of $957m, or $1.35 a share, while revenue fell 5.6 per cent to $6.2bn. The earnings beat expectations and the company raised its full-year guidance, pushing the stock to a 52-week trading high of $78.75.“We believe the positive results reflect the company’s early-cycle business model, noting an 8 per cent sequential gain in revenue,” said Mathew Christy, industrials analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.He raised the target price on 3M by $2 to $86.Shares in McDonald’s jumped 2 per cent to $59.50 after the fast food giant recorded a rise of 5.9 per cent in earnings as global comparable sales increased more than analysts had expected.AT&T saw its earnings dip as revenue dropped 1.6 per cent during the quarter as its landline business continued to shrink. A bright spot was the company’s growth in wireless subscribers by 2m during the quarter, boosted by the iPhone. The stock rose 0.6 per cent to $26.10.Meanwhile, Travelers, another Dow member, reported earnings of $1.65 per diluted share, and boosted its guidance for the full year. Its shares jumped 7.7 per cent to $51.70.Shares in Merck rose 0.6 per cent to $32.87 as the drugmaker earned $3.46bn, and excluding special items, it posted 90 cents a share in earnings, ahead of an expected 82 cents a share.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart lost 0.3 per cent to $50.48, in the wake of a 2.1 per cent drop on Wednesday. The retailer warned of a “tough” Christmas with consumers delaying purchases.”
438;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Premium products boost McDonald’s sales;;Growing sales of its higher-end items boosted McDonald’s income in the US and Europe, as the fast-food chain expands its speciality offerings to lure increasingly cost-conscious consumers to its restaurants.McDonald’s reported a 3.8 per cent rise in global comparable sales, with gains in every market and particularly strength in Europe.The gains have been steadily declining – last year global comparable sales rose 7.1 per cent. But the company’s results surpassed analysts’ estimates, with earnings per share growing 10 per cent over the same quarter last year to $1.15, compared with expectations of $1.10. Overall, revenues fell 4 per cent to $6.05bn, due to foreign exchange impact.“Alignment behind McDonald’s long-term business strategy, the Plan to Win, is clear as our growth continues to be a systemwide effort with each area of the world contributing,” said Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive. “McDonald’s global results demonstrate the resilience of our strategies and our ability to execute successfully.”European sales grew 5.8 per cent, as premium products and promotions drove a 10 per cent increase in operating income.In the US, comparable store sales grew 2.5 per cent, boosted by higher-end items, including McCafe coffees, introduced as a lower-cost alternative to speciality coffee chains such as Starbucks, and Angus Third Pounders. Sales of core menu items were also strong.Sales in Asia, Africa and the Middle East grew 2.2 per cent, and opening income rose 21 per cent in constant currencies.Mr Skinner said he expected comparable sales to grow in October, despite the falling global “informal eating out market”.McDonald’s shares rose 2.8 per cent to 59.97 in pre-market trading.
439;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
440;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-10-11T21:40:31Z;Gilead tops list for best investor value;;"In a volatile decade for the corporate world and its investors, Gilead Sciences, Apple and British American Tobacco stood out for their performances, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group.The three companies top the list for creating the most value for their shareholders relative to peers that trade on the same home stock market.Gilead, the US medical device company, posted a total return more than 36 per cent better than the average listing, BCG said.Something that was more remarkable was that the company outperformed the market every year from 1999-2008.Apple, maker of the ubiquitous iPod music device and other consumer electronics, produced a total return 25 per cent better than that of the average company.BAT, a consumer goods company, boasted a return of almost 18 per cent above its local market average, according to BCG.There were four mining and materials companies, including Brazil’s Vale and BHP Billiton of Australia, and four medical technology manufacturers within the top 25.Although some of the top performers clearly benefited from some of the decade’s sweeping trends – for example, globalisation and rising commodity prices – the list’s overall diversity suggest there is more than one way to generate consistently good returns for investors.“When you get to top ranks, the secular trends don’t matter as much,” said Eric Olsen, a senior partner at BCG and one of the study’s authors.“It’s what you do with your company’s strategy, your capital deployment and your management agenda,” Mr Olsen added.Utilities such as Exelon of the US and Germany’s Eon found spots on the Top 25 list, as did mature industrial companies, including Lockheed Martin, Schlumberger and United Technologies.McDonald’s, Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble also made the list.Mr Olsen and his co-authors’ study will be released on Tuesday.They observed that the decade’s most successful companies often took one of four pathways.They each delivered sales growth well above their home country’s gross domestic product; they churned out enough cash to appease investors; they transformed their portfolio of businesses through a series of timely acquisitions and divestitures; or they simply found a combination of ways to exceed shareholders’ expectations consistently.Gilead and Apple benefited from surging demand for their products, while the renewed focus of McDonald’s on boosting margins even as growth slowed rewarded investors with a total return of 7.9 per cent above the market average, Mr Olsen said.Of course, the Top 25 companies now have more in common than just an impressive 10-year total return: they face the daunting task of remaining at the head of the ranking for the next decade, he said.“It’s a matter of being able to beat expectations continuously,” Mr Olsen said.“That’s hard to do.”"
441;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-10-06T22:52:30Z;Pizza Hut sales drop as consumers heat at home;;Pizza Hut, one of the largest US pizza restaurant and home delivery chains, has been hit by a sharp slump in orders as competitors tout the lower cost of their frozen, heat-at-home alternatives.Yum Brands, owner of the Pizza Hut brand, said on Tuesday that comparable sales at its more than 6,000 US franchised and company owned locations had dropped 13 per cent during its third quarter, compared with the same period last year.The poor performance at Pizza Hut contributed to a 6 per cent fall in comparable US sales at Yum Brands’ more than 17,000 US locations, which also include KFC, Taco Bell and other brands.Pizza Hut’s comparable US sales started falling in the first quarter of this year, putting pressure on the company’s overall comparable sales after six previous quarters of growth. Its sales were down 8 per cent in the second quarter on an annual basis.Kraft, the largest US food company, has reported strong growth of its DiGiorno frozen pizza since the start of the consumer slump. Walmart, the largest US retailer, has also been promoting its “take and bake” pizza, which it has claimed could save a family that ordered pizza deliveries once a week about $312 a year.The fate of pizza in the recession has contrasted with the stronger performance of McDonald’s, the largest US hamburger chain, whose sales have been supported by its low-cost, value meals.In spite of the US pizza slump, Yum Brands reported third-quarter earnings that were ahead of Wall Street expectations, and raised its full-year earnings per share guidance from $2.10 to $2.14, citing stronger than expected business in China, and a lower tax rate.Yum Brands earnings rose 18 per cent to $334m, or 69 cents per share. Total revenue fell 2 per cent to $2.78bn.●Pepsi Bottling Group, Pepsi-Cola’s largest US bottler, underlined the changing habits of the US consumer as it reported third-quarter results on Tuesday. It said it was continuing to see more strength in supermarket and discount store sales than in restaurants.PBG, which is in the process of being acquired by PepsiCo, its largest shareholder, reported a 10 per cent increase in earnings to $254m, or diluted earnings per share of $1.14, while revenues fell 5 per cent to $3.6bn.
442;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-09-23T22:04:09Z;Haul of business golds;;"The first gold medal of last year’s Beijing Olympics was awarded not in the Water Cube or the Bird’s Nest stadium (above), but at a nearby McDonald’s restaurant.At an event attended by dignitaries including Peter Ueberroth, then chairman of the US Olympic Committee, and Timo Lumme, the International Olympic Committee’s marketing director, on the eve of the opening ceremony, four teams of McDonald’s employees raced to make as many hamburgers as they could in three minutes. One team was coached by Carl Lewis, the US sprinter. As the excitement rose, Mr Ueberroth jokingly suggested to Mr Lumme: “Maybe you will accept Building a Big Mac as an event in the Olympic Games.”It is easy to lampoon such marketing stunts as tacky parodies of the Olympic spirit, yet it is in part by tolerating – and, to a degree, embracing – such overt commercialism in the margins of the games that the Olympic movement has transformed itself in the past 25 years from a body brought to its knees by terrorism and political boycotts into an organisation of extraordinary prosperity and power.With the IOC meeting in Copenhagen next week to decide who will host the 2016 summer games, the question is how the world’s most powerful sporting movement is coping with the recession. The answer: extremely well.Four years after London won the right to stage the 2012 Olympics, organisers are well on the way to meeting their national sponsorship target of £650m, with about 20 sponsors so far contributing more than £500m in cash and value-in-kind services.“We made a very conscious decision …to bring the business partners on early,” says Lord Coe, chairman of the London 2012 organising committee. “Our view was that this is an extraordinary economy …but life does change and it was unlikely that over the course of the seven years it was going to remain at that level.”The Olympic movement generates revenue from four main sources: sponsorship, broadcasting rights, ticketing and merchandising/licensing. In the four years culminating with the Athens Olympics in 2004, income from these areas totalled $4.2bn. Official figures for the Olympic “quadrennium” ending with last year’s Beijing games are not expected until next month, but estimates put the total for 2005-08 at $5.4bn. That was achieved when economic conditions were generally buoyant and with a strong contribution from the fast-developing Chinese market.By contrast, the movement’s commercial success in the lead-up to London has largely been down to a shift from sponsorship to broadcasting rights as the fastest-growing source of revenue.Of the income earned in the 2005-08 period, just under half – $2.57bn – came from broadcasting rights. Yet, according to Richard Carrión, a Puerto Rican banker who has chaired the IOC’s finance commission since 2002 and is one of the movement’s foremost business strategists, for 2009-12, “we will probably come in north of $3.8bn”.Mr Carrión can be confident about this near 50 per cent expansion because almost all the deals have already been signed. IOC negotiating teams have moved on to agreements for 2013-16.The IOC has the luxury of being able to negotiate so far in advance because of the huge viewing figures the summer Olympics attracts. According to the Futures Sport and Entertainment consultancy, the opening ceremony at Beijing achieved “the largest TV audience of all time”, with a global live average of 593m and a total audience of close to 1bn.“We can already predict with confidence that the 2016 Olympic Games will be, by a country mile, the most popular global TV event of that year,” says Kevin Alavy, FSE’s head of analytics.Beyond the advantage of predictability, the IOC has also generated growth by modifying its model of negotiating media rights. Historically, outside the US, rights were sold via regional blocs. So, for the Beijing games, TV rights for China were sold as part of a regional deal with the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union that brought in $18.1m.For 2009-12, however, Chinese rights across all broadcast platforms have been sold separately to CCTV, China’s main state broadcaster, raising $100m.Similarly, the IOC has split Europe’s five biggest markets – the UK, Germany, Spain, France and Italy – for 2013-16, preferring to negotiate directly with broadcasters rather than with the pan-continental European Broadcasting Union, its traditional partner. According to Mr Alavy, this arrangement makes it much easier for the IOC “to build competition” between media outlets, thus driving up revenue.The IOC has also been quick to see how digital technology can be made to work to its advantage. Though the Olympic Charter commits the movement to ensuring “the widest possible audience” for the games, the IOC has been able to sell rights to pay-TV companies by limiting to 200 hours the amount of live coverage that must be available free-to-air.“For other sports properties, pay-TV is a substitute for free-to-air; for the Olympic Games, the two media are complementary,” says Mr Alavy. “Prior to the proliferation of channels and media platforms that digitalisation has made possible, you could say that the Olympic Games was almost too big. People only have one head and two eyes; there was only so much they could watch. Now the movement can cater much better for specialist audiences.”Mr Carrión says: “You are going to have a wider set of media platforms to amortise the investment and give people more choice as to how and when you can see these things.”While media rights have surged in value, the recession has affected growth in corporate sponsorship, which provides the Olympic movement’s second-biggest income stream – even though ­arenas are kept advertising-free.Jacques Rogge, IOC president, recently disclosed that the nine sponsors in the Olympic Partner programme (TOP) so far signed for 2009-12, which include Samsung and McDonald’s, have yielded “a little over $900m” in cash and value-in-kind services. This is more than the $866m raised by the programme in 2005-08, though far below the rate of growth the movement has come to expect.Some believe that the TOP programme has exhausted its growth potential. The time may have come for the movement to consider changes to its corporate sponsorship programmes by, for example, trying harder to appeal to less traditional brands.“I think the IOC will find it more difficult to sell the types of sponsorship they have been successful in marketing up to this point,” says Andrew Benett, global chief strategy officer for Euro RSCG Worldwide, the advertising agency.Even Mr Carrión admits that reform is “something clearly that one has to look at”. However, with one TOP sponsor, Coca-Cola, already signed up until 2020, the direction of any such reform may not become clear until after the 2016 games have taken place."

Its shares rose 2.1 per cent to $50.53.United Technologies gained 1.4 per cent to $61.24 after Goldman raised its price target on the stock.The market retreated slightly by mid-afternoon after the release of the Beige Book by the Federal Reserve, which said that labour markets remained weak and retail sales were flat. But after a late recovery, the S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent to 1,033.37 – the highest level since October.The Nasdaq outperformed the other indices after Ebay, the online auction group, rose 3.9 per cent to $22.68 after an upgrade.The technology-heavy index rose 1.1 per cent to 2,060.39, also reaching its highest level since October, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.5 per cent higher at 9,547.22.Encouraging data on the housing sector initially helped boost sentiment. Mortgage applications were shown to have risen to their highest level since May.But the dollar, which was hovering around its 2009 low against the basket of leading currencies, weighed on sentiment in early trade.Oil prices also showed signs of stalling before resuming their upward trend, briefly bringing the energy sector back into positive territory.But by the end of the day, ExxonMobil fell back 0.2 per cent to $70.50 while Chevron also slipped 0.2 per cent to $70.33.Commodities have helped propel equities higher in recent sessions with gold breaking through the $1,000 level.Health insurers came into focus again ahead of Barack Obama’s address to Congress on Wednesday evening as he was expected to outline his proposed reforms of the healthcare system.After losing more than 4 per cent on Tuesday, Wellpoint clawed back 1.9 per cent to $52.84.The consumer discretionary sector weighed on the market after McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant group, missed August sales expectations.Fast-food chains have benefited in the recession, outperforming many of their upmarket rivals, but the group said high unemployment in the US had hit profitable breakfast and beverage sales. While same-store sales rose 3.5 per cent in Europe, they only crept up 1.7 per cent in the US and fell 0.5 per cent in the company’s restaurants in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa.The group’s shares fell 2 per cent to $55.09.Yum!

444;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s loses trademark fight against McCurry;;McDonald’s on Tuesday lost an eight-year legal battle to prevent its Mc prefix being used by a Malaysian curry restaurant, potentially opening the way for other food retailers to borrow the celebrated prefix in the region.The ruling by Malaysia’s highest court allowing a privately owned Kuala Lumpur restaurant to call itself McCurry is the latest in a 70-year battle to protect the trademark of one of the world’s most famous fast food franchises.The US-based chain known for its Big Mac hamburgers, Golden Arches logo and Ronald McDonald mascot has aggressively sought to stamp out brand likenesses in other countries to varying levels of success.Failed attempts include one in Canada to prevent the use of the name McBeans for the sale of coffee and another in the UK seeking to bar the use of the trademark McChina Wok Away.In the mid-nineties McDonald’s stopped a Seattle coffee shop from using the name McCoffee, under which it had operated for 17 years.“We respect the court’s decision,” McDonald’s said in response to the Malaysian court ruling. “Meanwhile, we will continue to vigorously defend our trademarks and brand around the world, as we always have.”The federal court ruling closed the legal avenue for McDonald’s, which had argued that McCurry was using the prefix in an attempt to pass itself off as being related to the US chain. McCurry argued through a series of court hearings that its name was short for Malaysian Chicken Curry, a staple dish. The restaurant, which is open 24 hours a day, also serves fish head curry, but not the western fast food associated with McDonald’s.“It is unfortunate that we have to dismiss the application with costs,” chief judge Ariffin Zakaria said. The court awarded McCurry costs of M$10,000 (US$2,850).“We feel great that this eight-year legal battle is finally over, and we can now go ahead with whatever we plan to do such as opening new branches,” McCurry owner P. Suppiah told Reuters in Malaysia after the decision.The court ruling means that McDonald’s can no longer claim the unique use of the prefix Mc in Malaysia, although it does not prevent the company from bringing further cases asserting that food providers are trading on its name or image.
445;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Pret A Manger steps up US expansion plans;;Pret A Manger, the sandwich chain, is stepping up its expansion plans in the US, even though the toughest recession in a generation has eroded its like-for-like sales by about 10 per cent.The company is increasing the number of store openings and expanding into Washington DC, and sees the US as a key driver of growth after UK profits have flattened out.But its management team says there has been a sharp dip in sales in stores that have been open for more than a year, while growth has returned in the UK after a period of contraction last year.“We are not entirely sure why sales in the US appear to be lagging the UK in terms of spending at our stores,” says Clive Schlee, chief executive. “But we are determined to turn it round and we intend to do so.”The company described comparable sales, which it does not publish, as falling in the “low double digits” in the US, but growing in the “high single digits” in the UK.The move marks the second push by the company to conquer the US, after a first attempt was met by indifferent New Yorkers, who were not keen on buying pre-packaged lunches.But Mr Schlee says the company has now “educated” the American consumer on the value of its freshly prepared food, which is made in on-site kitchens before being boxed and displayed.It has also changed its product mix, increasing the number of soups it sells and focusing on filter coffee rather than more elaborate drink options for which customers have to queue.But it remains committed to pre-packing its food rather than making it at a counter in front of the customer, in the model of the archetypal New York delicatessen.“In 2000, Pret went into the US with a UK model, opening up a lot of stores and deciding to iron out the problems later,” says Mr Schlee.“That led to excessive overheads and a story that wasn’t right for the US consumer.“But since we have stepped back and adjusted the model, we see this as a key area for growth.”The company aims to have 26 stores open in New York and Washington DC by the end of the year, and is also looking at moving into Chicago.It hopes the renewed push will bring back the 20 per cent comparable sales growth in the US it enjoyed in the years prior to the recession.Pret reported £30m ($49m) in global earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – the same figure as reported in the previous year. It expects to make slightly more than that this year.But that translated into a £34.2m pre-tax loss, as interest repayments following a leveraged buy-out by private equity group Bridgepoint this year took a chunk out of its profits.However, the company said that £19.6m of those repayments were owed to the company’s shareholders following the buy-out and were marked down for accountancy purposes rather than actually being paid.Nick Candler, finance director, says: “We’re comfortable with our debt. We have facilities in place until 2014 and external debt repayments of about £13m a year, which is easily payable with £30m of earnings.”The acquisition by Bridgepoint pushed out another of the company’s high-profile backers, a McDonald’s subsidiary, which Mr Candler admitted had not been good for the company’s image.“It was not helpful for our brand to be connected with McDonald’s, even though they were super people,” Mr Candler says.Pret was founded by entrepreneurs Julian Metcalfe and Sinclair Beecham in 1986 in London.Both remain involved with the business, with Mr Beecham retaining a seat on the board and Mr Metcalfe advising on the food side of the business.It has never been in public ownership, but Bridgepoint said it envisaged holding on to the company for another four years.“After that, the natural option would be for an initial public offering,” says William Jackson, managing partner at Bridgepoint.
446;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-08-25T21:27:59Z;US stocks set record for year;;"US stocks once again set a record high for the year on Tuesday as encouraging economic data was enough to keep the rally going even in the face of a marked drop in the price of oil.Data from Case-Shiller and the Federal Housing Finance Agency suggested that home prices increased in June for a second consecutive month. This, added to an unexpectedly steep spike in consumer confidence, saw homebuilders and discretionary cosumer stocks lead the rally.This further bolstered optimistic sentiment, which was sparked early by president Barack Obama’s nomination of Ben Bernanke for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.“The market wants continuity right now,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.“With Bernanke they know what they are getting, and equities are up slightly as a result.”The markets drifted from the morning’s highs during the afernoon, however, as a sharp dip in the price of oil put pressure on energy stocks, with Schlumberger falling 2.1 per cent to $56.13. But the economic data was enough to see all three closely-watched market measures close at new highs for the year.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished 0.2 per cent higher at 1,028.00 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index both gained 0.3 per cent to 9,539.29 and 2,024.23, respectively.Consumer discretionary stocks led after the confidence figures underlined promising results from Burger King and optimistic words from home improvement chain Lowe’s.Lowe’s rose 1.7 per cent to $21.07 after Don Stallings, president of Lowe’s Canada, said on Monday night that he saw recovery beginning in the first quarter of next year. That was followed on Tuesday by an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, as well as the news that the company would open stores in Australia in partnership with Woolworths.The promise of recovery also boosted shares in rival Home Depot 1.1 per cent to $27.32.Meanwhile Burger King saw profits rise 16 per cent, which lifted the shares 6.2 per cent to $18.75.Investors overlooked a lack of clarity about future sales, which the company said would be “soft” in the first half of the 2010 fiscal year, resulting in a lack of guidance on ull-year profits.Rival McDonald’s also gained, rising 1 per cent to $56.45.The hope that car production has reached a bottom spurred buying in car
radio maker Harman International Industries on Tuesday after JPMorgan said the company could see “a major turnround over the next two years”. Harman rose 9.8 per cent to $29.75."
447;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-08-18T17:10:42Z;Businesses face deluge of job-hunters;;"The recession has provided employers with a big opportunity – and a potential dilemma – in the form of burgeoning piles of applications from eager job-hunters.Smaller employers who would normally receive five to 10 applications for an advertised job vacancy can now expect 10 times that number, says the Federation of Small Businesses.Rising unemployment, currently standing at a 14-year high of 2.4m, means employers can also expect a choice of high-quality candidates who, in better economic times, might not be available.But, says the FSB, with 17 pieces of employment legislation introduced over the past decade, companies need to ensure that their handling of applications is demonstrably fair. “It’s a privileged position to be in demand but it’s a headache too,” says Stephen Alambritis of the FSB.Large employers, such as the fast food chain McDonald’s, which is now receiving 2,200 applications every day for entry level “crew” positions and hiring 140 people daily, can rely on human resources personnel.But for small business people, such as the North Shields shellfish processor Tom Newton, advertising a vacancy can open the floodgates.“It would appear that 99 per cent of the male population of the North East has a forklift certificate,” says Mr Newton, who was recently swamped with applications when he advertised with JobCentre Plus for a forklift operative with a clean driving licence for his company, Coquet Island Shellfish.This job, he says, has its downsides – including a 5am start, working in the cold with wet shellfish and big fluctuations in the number of hours to be worked weekly.Yet within a fortnight, 200 applications had landed on his desk. The quality of applications was “staggering”, he says. “People laid off, paid off, made redundant, shut down; there’s a massive amount of people who have suddenly found themselves out of work. I was extremely saddened.”Still more applications would have piled up had he not asked JobCentre Plus urgently to withdraw the advertisement. According to recent Conservative Party research, there are 805 forklift truck drivers in north-east England chasing each advertised vacancy, and 1,428 people for each job in process and plant operations. Nationally, it said, the average number of jobseekers pursuing each vacancy advertised by JobCentre Plus rose from two last October to seven in April.More than 9,000 people in the North East were seeking work as sales assistants, it said, but only 191 such jobs were advertised. Morrisons, the supermarket operator, has just reported an “amazing response” at its new Wallsend store in north Tyneside: more than 900 people applied for 35 posts.Employers in other sectors are similarly inundated. JDR Cable Systems, which last month opened a factory in Hartlepool, has a head start in recruiting its first 50 Teesside employees without advertising: more than 100 jobhunters contacted it last year, simply on hearing news of the project.“Many are still available,” says Patrick Phelan, managing director. “If they aren’t out of work they are under the threat of redundancy with their current employer. They are keen to work for a company with prospects.”He adds: “We will be able to pick and choose and get the best.”At Manchester Airport, where an advertisement posted online for just two weeks in February for four places on its graduate training scheme produced almost 2,000 applications, Andrew Cornish, managing director, is similarly bullish. The HR team whittled down the 2,000 to 600. Then Mr Cornish and two senior colleagues took home a third of the CVs each and cut the list to 200.Often, says Mr Alambritis, time-pressed business people sift CVs away from the office. “They will probably take these CVs home and go through them on the kitchen table or the sofa.”An online test pruned the airport’s 200 to 60, who were interviewed. The chosen 15 – “the crème de la crème”, says Mr Cornish – had dinner with the senior management and underwent a day’s work and assessment. “It took a lot of management time but it’s worth it,” he said. “One of these could well be managing director one day.”Mr Newton’s 200 fared less well. Having believed that JobCentre Plus rules forbade him from stipulating where his potential recruit should live, he ended up with nobody applying from the area he wanted. This mattered, since he wanted a recruit who lived near his staff in Amble, Northumberland, to collect them and drive them to work for a 6am start.The advertisement did, however, bring somebody some work: so moved was Mr Newton by the jobhunters’ efforts that he paid somebody to help his secretary reply to all 200.He is nervous now of re-advertising. “The ideal scenario is [that] somebody falls into our lap.”"
448;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-08-11T22:20:57Z;Fast food link with Olympics;;McDonald’s, the fast food chain, is in talks to become the official branded food outlet at the 2012 London Olympics, sparking criticism from health and environmental campaigners.London Olympic organisers would not say whether other food brands would also be allowed in the Olympic Park.The news comes after the government launched its food strategy, promising action to encourage restaurants to highlight calorie counts and pledged the launch of a new Healthier Food Mark this year.London 2012 said a wide range of other foods would be available to reflect the diversity of cultures attending the event. But other offerings are unlikely to be allowed to carry company branding.Betty McBride, director of policy at the British Heart Foundation, said: “If McDonald’s gets this gold medal status, just when the rest of the country is waking up to the obesity timebomb, it doesn’t feel right.“What is clearly driving this is money rather than health and fitness.”Jenny Jones, Green party member of the London assembly, added: “I am horrified. This would have been an opportunity for smaller, local businesses to make an impact.”McDonald’s said it had been involved with the Olympics for 40 years. The fast food chain said it was “proud to be a main sponsor of the London 2012 Olympic Games. Our sponsorship programme is still being developed and no final decisions have been made for London 2012 yet.”● A lack of sports facilities being built in London could hurt government pledges to use the 2012 Olympics to promote healthier lifestyles. A survey by Drivers Jonas, commercial property consultants, found that the number of sports centres being opened or refurbished in London had slowed over the past two years, with the number of schemes in the pipeline down from 36 to 21.
449;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Coffee perks up McDonald’s global sales;;McDonald’s move into mochas and iced lattes has helped the fast-food chain report its seventh consecutive month of increases in global sales this year, underscoring the resilience of its business model in the recession.The company’s shares rose 1.9 per cent on Monday to $56.27 after it said comparable-stores sales had risen 4.3 per cent in July, compared with an increase of 8 per cent a year earlier but beating analysts’ consensus expectations of a 3.2 per cent climb and ahead of June’s 2.6 per cent rise.Jason West, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the global sales increase had alleviated concern about a possible “downward spiral” in comparable sales, as had been seen at competitors like Burger King. “Globally, they have not had a negative month [in sales] in several years,” he said.Sales were up 2.6 per cent in the US – which contributes about half the company’s profits – because of strong sales of coffees and core menu items like hamburgers and fries.McDonald’s expansion into fancy coffees under the McCafé brand is part of a strategy to capture more customers at breakfast time and win them over from coffee chains to its lower-priced drinks.The move has forced Starbucks to defend its brand. It has been running marketing campaigns with the slogan: “It’s not just coffee. It’s Starbucks.”In the US, McDonald’s is selling espressos and mochas in its existing stores.In Europe, it is emulating its Australian business and opening separate McCafé counters, operating in or next to its restaurants. The group plans to have 1,200 McCafés in Europe by the end of the year.McDonald’s strongest sales were in Europe, up 7.2 per cent because of the popularity of its “tiered menu” – which offers cheap, middling and expensive options – as well as summer specials such as chicken, bacon and onion sandwiches in France and burgers based on the “great tastes of America” in the UK.These include a “New York special”, which has beef, streaky bacon, smoked cheese, lettuce, onions and onion mayo in a chilli, chive and sesame bun.In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa – which make up 13 per cent of total profit – sales rose 2.1 per cent. McDonald’s attributed the rise to the “creativity” of its Australian business, which runs marketing campaigns based on a single theme – currently, family – and has introduced apple and cinnamon mini-muffins and spinach feta strudels, as well as opening more 24-hour and drive-through stores.But sales in China, where it has been slowing new store openings, were weaker as consumers favour cheaper local brands.McDonald’s has some 1,000 stores in China and plans to open 150 this year, compared with earlier projections of 175.
450;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-08-10T20:47:39Z;Strong dollar takes toll on metals groups;;US stocks drifted from last week’s highs on Monday, with investors looking to bank profits even as several experts gave a relatively bullish analysis for equities.Analysts at Citigroup said they expected companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index to earn more in 2010 than they had previously forecast.This followed suggestions over the weekend from Laura Tyson, an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, and Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, that the recession may be ending.But sellers were in the ascendency on Monday as investors looked to take advantage of the recent four-week rally and pull money off the table.The S&P and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 0.3 per cent down at 1,007.10 and 9,337.95 respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.4 per cent to 1,992.24.Investors were also betting that stocks could be set for a sharper tumble, with futures for the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility, trading higher than the index itself.“There is an idea that people are buying short-dated S&P volatility options in anticipation of a sell-off,” said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital.Cyclical sectors, which led the buying last week, were the steepest fallers, with industrial, retail and materials stocks all lagging behind the market.Metals producers were among the hardest hit as investors bought the dollar, betting that the unexpected dip in unemployment announced last week could signal that the US will recover ahead of other economies.The currency’s strength hampered metals prices and shares in companies that produce them. US Steel lost 2.3 per cent to $43.85, while rival AK Steel dropped 4.7 per cent to $20.31.It was also a disappointing day for retailers, many of which will announce their results this week.Electronics retailer Best Buy fell 5.3 per cent to $37.66 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the shares, warning increased competition could hamper the company’s growth.Other retailers also declined ahead of earnings announcements later in the week. Macy’s dropped 4.8 per cent to $15.23 and Kohl’s gave up 1.8 per cent to $52.53.“I don’t think there is going to be much new information from retailers’ results,” said Mr Knapp.“They are likely to show very little top line growth, and investors are waiting now to see what happens during the back-to-school season.”But McDonald’s provided some optimism on consumer spending after it announced stronger July sales than analysts had been expecting, helped by the success of the company’s recent McCafé coffee offering. Its shares climbed 1.9 per cent to $56.27.The financial sector was mixed, with volumes much lower than they were last week.Citigroup rose 2.3 per cent to $3.94, outperforming other banks and building on last week’s stellar performance, during which its shares rose more than 20 per cent.Bank of America also found gains, rising 1.6 per cent to $16.68, but Wells Fargo dropped 0.4 per cent to $28.64.Meanwhile Freddie Mac, the mortgage provider rescued by the government last year, surged 128.4 per cent to $1.69 after it reported its first profit in two years and said it would not need to seek more government aid in the foreseeable future.State Street then triggered a dip in the sector during the afternoon after saying the amount of money it has set aside to cover legal claims coming from subprime losses may not be enough.The stock and sector dropped on the news, with some appearing to misinterpret the words as meaning the money manager was increasing its subprime loss reserve.Both then recovered much of that ground, but remained lower for the day. State Street closed 2.4 per cent down at $52.57.“A lot of the names that have done extremely well have gone back a bit, which looks like a normal profit-taking day,” said Jeff Mortimer, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab. “That is a healthy pause for the markets.”
451;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-07-27T21:37:55Z;O’Leary sees opportunities in rivals’ distress;;Already deep into the recession, Ryanair, the low-cost and low-fare leader in the European airline industry, is showing no sign of being forced to abandon its contrarian strategy.Most airlines are shrinking – removing flights, cutting capacity and grounding aircraft . They face falling revenue, mounting losses and shrinking cash piles. Many, including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and British Airways, have had to come to the capital markets for more cash.But Ryanair has by far the lowest cost base and can therefore act differently.It is adding aircraft and has recently concluded a $1.5bn (£910m) deal with a syndicate of three banks, backed by US Ex-Im Bank guarantees to finance another 55 Boeing jets. It is opening new operating bases and new routes. Profits are rising again after a tough 12 months when it was hit by record oil prices.It is leading the charge to cut fares – in order to fill seats and grab market share – and it is loving it.Michael O’Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the group would be the only big European airline “to deliver passenger and profit growth in the current year. The winners in a deep recession will always be those companies, such as Aldi, Lidl, McDonald’s and Ryanair, who offer lowest prices.”Most of the group’s competitors have recently reported declining traffic, falling yields and substantial losses. “This is accelerating the pace of airline closures and consolidations,” Mr O’Leary said. In recent weeks SkyEurope has sought bankruptcy protection in the Slovak courts and MyAir has ceased operations in Italy.Mr O’Leary continued to rail on Monday against UK aviation taxes and the high level of charges at BAA’s Stansted airport, its biggest base in Europe, but the Irish carrier is becoming less dependent on the UK, still its biggest single market with 30 per cent of its passengers.It has become a truly pan-European operator – to a greater extent than any other airline – with 33 bases and more than 850 routes. Already Italy is its second-largest market, accounting for 17 per cent of passengers, with Spain accounting for 14 per cent.Mr O’Leary said Ryanair, already Europe’s biggest short-haul airline, continued “to see enormous opportunities to grow our business”. He said it was being “besieged” by European airports offering cut-price deals to attract Ryan­air services, as it was one of the few airlines growing in the recession.It is expected to announce a batch of new routes this week. However, profit gains in the first quarter were driven by lower fuel prices.A year ago the group was unhedged while oil prices were surging to record levels. It has taken full advantage of the subsequent oil price fall and has also locked in the lower prices for this year by extensive hedging. Its full-year fuel bill saving could be €460m (£397m).Most ominously for rival airlines, Mr O’Leary warned fuel and other cost savings would be used to fund “continuous fare reductions”. Average fares for the full year could fall 20 per cent to make sure the airline was filling its growing fleet.It appears that Mr O’Leary is not taking his foot off the throttle – or off the neck of his competitors.

Bristol-Myers rose 2.8 per cent to $20.86 and Medarex soared 89.2 per cent to $15.89.Amazon announced its expansion into the clothing sector with a $928m deal for privately-held Zappos.com, the online shoe retailer.
The shares rose 5.7 per cent to $93.87.Amazon’s rival Ebay further boosted market sentiment after sales and profits topped estimates. The shares climbed 10.6 per cent to $21.52.Two smaller healthcare companies added to Bristol-Myers’ gains, helping the sector outperform the broader market.Rival drugmaker Celgene jumped 18.6 per cent to $55.97 after it beat estimates for its profits and said a test showed that a blood cancer drug could be used earlier in a patients’ treatment than thought.Intuitive Surgical surged 26.8 per cent to $215.37 after profits that were 26 per cent better than analysts’ forecasts as sales of its robotic system for surgery easily beat expectations.Ford showed signs of strength from the US consumer as it reported a smaller operating loss and cash-burn rate than exppected. Its shares gained 9.4 per cent to $6.98.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.3 per cent up at 976.29, while the Dow rose 2.1 per cent to 9,069.29 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.5 per cent to 1,973.60.“The markets broke through a key resistance level,” said Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group. “Now the S&P can get to 1,100 before you get significant resistance.”But Richard Hughes, co-president of Portfolio Management Consultants, warned: “Much of this is fuelled by short covering. Some see signs of stabilisation in spending, but with the exception of tech stocks most companies have not seen revenue growth.”Economic data gave further fuel to the rally. The number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits unexpectedly fell and sales of existing homes rose more than expected.This helped homebuilders rally strongly as DR Horton climbed 7.6 per cent to $11.17 and Lennar gained 6 per cent to $11.26.But the session was dominated by earnings news, with two companies in particular boosting the Dow.Strong sales at 3M helped the maker of Post-It Notes easily beat revenue and profit expectations. The shares picked up 7.4 per cent to $69.43.AT&T, the telecoms company, also beat expectations, helped by strong sales of Apple’s iPhone, which in the US operates only on the AT&T network. The stock advanced 2.6 per cent to $25.48.But McDonald’s injected an element of caution as the restaurant group’s revenues missed Wall Street expectations and analysts warned that its results were a sign of continued weakness from the US consumer. McDonald’s shares fell
4.6 per cent to $56.09.Omnicom, the advertising conglomerate, and UPS, the parcel deliverer, experienced continuing declines in revenue and profits, suggesting business spending remained constrained.But both reversed early losses as the rally gathered steam and Omnicom closed up 0.4 per cent at $34.56 and UPS was 2.3 per cent higher at $53.51.There were mixed results from banks as both Huntington Bancshares and Fifth Third reported their earnings. Investors remain concerned over future write-offs from bad loans. Huntington more than tripling the reserves set aside for such losses and Fifth Third saw an 82 per cent rise in net charge-offs.Huntington fell 4.9 per cent to $3.73 but Fifth Third, which made a smaller operating loss than expected, jumped 14.3 per cent to $8.01."
453;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Cheap meals drive McDonald’s sales growth;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast-food chain, reported another quarter of sales growth on Thursday in each of its global markets as its low-cost meals continued to appeal to budget conscious customers.Comparable worldwide sales rose by 4.8 per cent, with US sales up 3.5 per cent and Europe up 6.9 per cent. Comparable ales in Asia, the Middle East and Africa rose 4.4 per cent.Jim Skinner, chief executive, said the results reflected McDonald’s appeal to consumers who “ find themselves more cash-strapped and time-challenged”.However the strong dollar weighed on McDonald’s overall revenues, which fell 7 per cent to $5.64bn, while net income fell 8 per cent to $1.09bn, or 9 cents per diluted share from a year ago.The impact of the strong dollar reduced profit by 9 cents a share in the quarter. The company said it now expected foreign exchange to cut full-year earnings by 21 cents a share, a penny more than it forecast last month.The company said its US business gained market share during the quarter “with a balanced focus on classic menu favourites like the Big Mac, beverage value offerings and the national launch of the McCafe premium coffee line-up”.The company has been spending heavily on advertising its new coffee offering since the spring.Mr Skinner also said that the company’s comparable sales so far in July, the first month of its new quarter, were “similar to or better than June.”The company’s shares fell over 3 per cent in New York to $56.70.
454;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Starbucks’ restructuring starts to show results;;"Starbucks, the coffee retailer, reported improvements in its comparable sales and transaction trends during its third quarter, pushing its shares up almost 10 per cent in after-hours trading.Howard Schultz, chief executive, said the results showed that a drive to improve the company’s performance that has included closing hundreds of stores and working to improve its service was bearing fruit. But he remained cautious about the outlook: “There is no victory lap going on at Starbucks . . . we realise how tough the environment is in terms of the economy . . . and we have to be very careful to recognise that the headwind is still in front of us.”Comparable sales at its US stores fell 6 per cent against the same quarter last year, but this was better than the 8 per cent decline in the second quarter. Worldwide comparable sales were down 5 per cent.In addition to closing stores and cutting costs, Starbucks has been trying to drive sales to more budget-conscious customers with lower-cost food and drink combinations and discounts for its loyalty-card holders.It has also been conducting its biggest marketing campaign, aimed at countering what it says is an unjustified popular perception that its prices are too high – at the same time as McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, has been promoting its new lower-cost McCafe expresso coffee offerings.Mr Schultz said there had been an “unprecedented” level of advertising aimed at coffee consumers in the quarter, which he argued had reinforced Starbucks’ own advertising efforts. “I think we are quite pleased with the fact that the things that we are doing in both in store and out of store are beginning to resonate with our customers.”Troy Alstead, chief financial officer, said the company had also seen US comparable sales improve from month to month during the quarter, and had significantly improved its operating margins.“We have created in the company a new discipline . . . in being more cost-conscious,” he said.Mr Schultz said the company was planning a further US marketing push in the autumn around the national launch of its Via instant coffee product, which he said had been
performing strongly in Seattle, New York and London, where it is available.The company has also recently opened the first of three new coffee shops in Seattle that will carry the name of their neighbourhoods rather than the Starbucks brand, which will include alcohol sales and live music aimed at attracting customers in the evening.Net income for its fiscal third quarter was $151.5m, or 20 cents per share, against a $6.7m loss a year ago.Revenues fell from $2.6bn to $2.4bn."
455;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-07-14T08:06:44Z;Confident Britvic eyes overseas expansion;;Britvic, the owner of Robinsons fruit squash and Drench juicy waters, is planning to expand internationally through licensing agreements and joint ventures as soft drink sales in its home market remain robust.Britvic also said its full-year results would beat expectations following a bumper third quarter that prompted it to release a trading update early.Its bullishness raises the prospect of sales in the current financial year topping £1bn for the first time in Britvic’s history. Its shares on Tuesday rose 9¼p to close at 306¾p.Most of Britvic’s sales are in the UK and Ireland, with just 3 per cent coming from other markets such as the Netherlands and Scandinavia. But Britvic has been exploring how it can enter new markets using licensing and franchising agreements as well as joint ventures. It could enter such markets early next year, according to Paul Moody, chief executive. “We’ve got brands that transfer well into international markets.”Britvic this year formed a licensing partnership for its children’s Fruit Shoot brand with Buffalo Rock, the US PepsiCo bottler, after running trials in the US states of Alabama, Georgia and Florida. It has sold Fruit Shoot in the Netherlands for five years and its Robinsons squash in Scandinavia for three years.Britvic’s success at managing its brands through the recession is one reason it is tipped as a possible takeover candidate for PepsiCo, which has licensed its Pepsi soft drinks brand to Britvic in the UK until 2023.The Pepsi brand has been performing well, with sales boosted by PepsiCo’s sponsorship of the Twenty20 World Cup cricket tournament, held last month in the UK. About 1.4m consumers entered a competition Britvic ran to coincide with the tournament.Britvic also benefited from its Robinsons sponsorship of Wimbledon. Instead of being “a damp and miserable affair”, Wimbledon had good weather and a local player, Andy Murray, who made it into the semi-finals and gave British consumers “a sense of involvement”, said Mr Moody.Britvic’s third-quarter sales revenue rose 5.9 per cent to £249.1m compared with a year earlier, with revenue in the year to date up 6.1 per cent. Britvic has been outperforming the UK soft drinks market, which has improved recently. UK take-home sales volumes rose 3.2 per cent in June.Analysts said they would raise estimates. Cazenove said it expected to increase its £108m profits forecast by 4 per cent.………………..Tried and trusted brands give smoothies and bottled water a hard timeSmoothies, energy drinks and bottled water have been dumped while colas and fruit squashes are back in fashion, writes Jenny Wiggins.The experience of soft drink brands has been no different from other brands during the recession: people have tended to abandon new products for ones they know and trust.Pepsi, Robinsons squash and the children’s drink Fruit Shoot are among Britvic’s best-selling brands this year.Like McDonald’s, which reinvented its food and drink menu ahead of the recession by adding salads and organic milk – leaving it well-positioned to capture consumers trading down from more expensive restaurants – Britvic has been making the right kind of changes to its drinks portfolio. These include removing artificial colours and flavours and introducing Pepsi Raw, a cola made with cane sugar and natural plant extracts.Cola has remained the UK’s leading soft drinks category (measured by take- home sales value), followed by pure juices, glucose drinks, juice drinks and squashes.The country’s top five brands are Coca-Cola, Lucozade, Robinsons, Tropicana and Pepsi.Britvic is now targeting growth in Gatorade, a sports drink and brand it has licensed from PepsiCo. It wants to increase its market share from about 7-8 per cent to overtake Powerade, which has a 20 per cent share, by 2011. Lucozade is market leader with 60 per cent.But it is struggling with V-water, PepsiCo’s vitamin water brand, which Britvic makes and distributes. V-water is less suited to a recession as it is high-priced in a relatively new category.

457;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-07-12T22:05:10Z;Swiss tax rules lure McDonald’s from UK;;McDonald’s is to leave London for Geneva, joining the growing ranks of US companies moving their European headquarters to take advantage of preferential intellectual property tax laws.The fast-food group, which will open its head office in the Swiss city in the autumn, said the move had been almost a year in the planning.The Swiss tax regime, particularly for intellectual property, has become increasingly attractive for foreign companies, particularly the regional European headquarters of US multinationals.Kraft, Procter & Gamble, Google, Electronic Arts and Yahoo have switched from the UK to Switzerland in recent years, while Informa, the UK publisher, is changing its tax domicile to the country.McDonald’s said its decision was not prompted by changes in the UK taxation of foreign profits from intellectual property rights made by Alastair Darling, the finance minister, this year. However, the company said the move “enables us to conduct the strategic management of key international intellectual property rights, including the licensing of those rights to our franchisees in Europe, from Switzerland”.McDonald’s has spread much of its operations around six or seven cities in Europe, but its headquarters has long been in London, where it opened its first outlet in 1974.The growing success of Switzerland, Luxembourg and Ireland at attracting multinationals is causing disquiet in European centres such as London, although the Swiss lifestyle and efficient transport have also been cited as contributing factors behind corporate decisions.Under the UK tax rules that came into force at the start of the month, McDonald’s would be paying tax on foreign profits relating to intellectual property twice over.The group, which said its UK business would remain unaffected, also said it expected its overall British annual tax rate to remain unchanged at about 30 per cent.Several senior members of McDonald’s Europe’s management team will relocate to Geneva, including including Denis Hennequin, president of McDonald’s operations in Europe.The issue of companies moving their main centre of operations outside the UK has dogged the UK Treasury.Mr Darling last year bowing to pressure and scrapped reforms to the taxation of foreign profits that threatened to provoke an exodus of companies from the UK.Since the start of 2008, WPP, Shire, Regus, Henderson, Charter, Beazley, Brit Insurance and UBM have all announced that they are moving their tax base out of the UK.
458;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-07-08T16:36:48Z;Recession spices up profits for growing Café de Coral;;While the world is shaken by the financial crisis, some sectors remain unaffected. The fast food industry is an oft-cited example.Hong Kong’s Café de Coral, the world’s biggest listed Chinese fast food chain – its popular beef curry with rice sells for just HK$31 (US$4) – on Wednesday said both turnover and profit had hit historic highs as budget-conscious consumers tightened their belts and opted for cheaper meals.In the 12 months to the end of March, the company’s net profit rose 5.15 per cent to HK$442m while revenue jumped 9.11 per cent to HK$4.67bn. Café de Coral increased its annual dividend for the 11th consecutive year.Sales were boosted by expansion after the company opened a record number of 60 outlets for its various brands in the period. It now has 580 restaurants and plans to have 1,000 by 2014.The success of Café de Coral mirrors that of McDonald’s, whose low-price menus continue to lure consumers. But Café de Coral is not without challenges. Hong Kong has more than 11,000 restaurants so competition is keen.“Despite our long-term optimism, one word of caution though is our immediate concern over the industry consolidation and business turmoil in the restaurant and catering sector both at home and abroad, which would undoubtedly call for our watchfulness and prudence,” said Michael Chan, chairman.Benefit in disguiseWith London down in the dumps and Paris with aspirations to take advantage of its old rival’s current weakness, the fall of sterling seems to be having some beneficial effects. It is not only helping British industry’s export competitiveness, but it is also making London a more affordable place for expatriate workers.The economic downturn, the decline in house rental prices and weak sterling has seen London plunge from being the world’s third most expensive city last year to number 16 in this year’s Mercer cost of living rankings published this week. Paris, on the other hand, has only dropped one place to 13 in the latest list. As a result, it could still make more economic sense for French financial institutions to keep sending expatriates and their families to London rather than repatriating them.Moscow still remains the most expensive city in Europe for expatriates, but it has nonetheless slipped from first place to third and been overtaken by Tokyo and Osaka. Given the weakening of most European currencies against the dollar, New York has joined the top 10 most expensive cities for expatriates, jumping from 22nd last year to number eight – Wall Street’s difficulties notwithstanding.But the cheapest is now Johannesburg, replacing Asuncion (in Paraguay) at the bottom of the rankings.Pension levellingTo paraphrase the old saying about IBM: nobody ever got fired for closing a defined benefit pension plan. The computer group’s proposal to close its UK plan to existing members, freezing their pension pot, marks another step in the gradual extinction of generous retirement schemes.IBM insists its review of retirement benefits is done on a country-by-country basis. But UK staff might have seen the writing on the wall last year, when “Big Blue” ceased accruals to its US defined benefit plan.Fujitsu International UK and Barclays have both taken similar steps. BP, one of the best-endowed pension plans in corporate Britain, has proposed closing its defined-benefit scheme to new members. The trend is not unique to multinationals, but global companies by definition have more comparative data on the world’s retirement plans – and according to that spreadsheet, Britain leads the way for all the wrong reasons.The UK’s defined benefit pensions are among the most costly for employers – adding 20 per cent in company contributions to the wage bill of staff in such schemes, as against 7 or 8 per cent for US staff with similar plans. British pensions are also indexed to inflation and pension increases are guaranteed.What’s a cash-conscious global company to do? The numbers are against the defined-benefit pension members. Only 5,000 of IBM UK’s 20,000 staff are part of the more generous scheme.Those in the alternative defined contribution scheme will get an enhanced deal as part of the proposal, so any negative feedback from beneficiaries of the defined-benefit plan is likely to be drowned out by colleagues.Levelling benefit anomalies down improves consistency and saves money. But in the race for global talent, global companies and their consultants must also apply their combined intelligence to coming up with better retirement solutions – not just cheaper ones – for everybody.world.view@ft.com
459;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-06-10T20:45:54Z;Wall St slips on disappointing US debt sale;;US stocks slipped on Wednesday afternoon after a disappointing auction of government debt triggered a slump that was then erased by some positive economic news from the Federal Reserve.Equities had been drifting during the day, but took a noticeable dip after the end of the auction, which failed to attract the kind of bids the market was hoping for, exacerbating fears that high bond yields would push up interest rates.They then recovered after the Fed said that there were signs the that the economic contraction in some areas of the US was moderating.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite both closed down 0.4 per cent at 939.15 and 1,853.08 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 8,739.02.“The economy is not falling quite so fast, but the big question is not how fast do we recover but how far do we recover. That is why stocks can’t break out of this range,” said Kim Caughey, investment analyst at Fort Pitt.Fears that rising interest rates would curb consumer spending took their toll on financial and consumer stocks.Morgan Stanley, which had been trading lower throughout the day after Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of rival Goldman Sachs, said the recession would be long and protracted, dropped further. Its shares closed down 5.6 per cent at $29.26. Goldman was 1.8 per cent lower at $146.68.Investors were particularly worried that mortgage rates would continue to rise on the back of higher bond yields. The recent climb in rates saw mortgage applications fall more than 7 per cent last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said on Wednesday.“Rising yields have been keeping a lid on stocks recently as falling bond prices attract investors away from equities,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo Advisers.Charles Zhang, managing partner of Zhang Financial, said inflation remained a serious long-term worry. “The US government will have to increase yields to make Treasury bonds attractive,” he said.Citigroup rose however as it got its long-awaited $58bn stock swap under way, the day after the board met Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in an effort to diffuse growing tensions between the two parties. The shares rose 2.1 per cent to $3.48.Big name consumer stocks also suffered, including McDonald’s, which dropped 1.2 per cent to $58.36 and Disney, which lost 0.9 per cent to $25.10.Even the home improvement retailers, which had performed well in the morning after Home Depot improved its full-year profit outlook on better profit margins, later slipped back. Home Depot finished 0.2 per cent up at $24.39 while rival Lowe’s dropped 0.4 per cent to $20.37.Brown-Forman was one of the few consumer stocks to hold onto its gains after it reported better results than expected.The company, which owns the Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort drinks brands, saw sales fall less than analysts had predicted and its shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $46.74.Earlier energy companies had risen on the price of oil, which briefly topped $71 for the first time since October.Despite losing some gains ExxonMobil hung on to gains of 1 per cent to $73.84, while ConocoPhillips rose 0.5 per cent to $45.76.Metal producers had initially fared well on rising raw materials prices, but later in the day, only steel manufacturers continued to hold their gains. AK Steel was 5.2 per cent up at $20.09 while US Steel gained 6.1 per cent to $40.13. Meanwhile Ameriprise became the latest in a long line of financial companies to announce that it would issue shares in order to raise further capital. The financial services company said it might use the money to make acquisitions, although it did not name specific targets. Its shares fell 7.3 per cent to $26.33.Elsewhere, shares in real estate broker CB Richard Ellis rose 13.6 per cent to $9.25 after the company said it would raise $400m by selling bonds and a further $100m by selling shares to Paulson & Co, the hedge fund. It said it may use the money to repay debt.
460;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-06-09T14:29:13Z;Indonesian franchisee to sue McDonald’s;;A McDonald’s franchisee in Indonesia is suing the American fast food chain for $105.5m for allegedly selling 97 outlets and their operations in the country in violation of the law and their agreements.Lawyers representing Bambang Rachmadi, who has been a franchisee since 1991, said he was seeking $5.5m in material losses and $100m in immaterial losses after the assets were sold for $20m to Rekso Nasional Food, a subsidiary of the Sosro Group, which makes Indonesia’s most popular soft drink, a bottled tea.The outlets had been owned by Bina Nusa Rama, of which Mr Rachmadi owned 10 per cent through another company, Rejeki Murni. International Development Services, affiliated to McDonald’s, which owned the rest.McDonald’s, which declines to confirm any details of the deal with Rekso Nasional Food, denies the allegations and says Mr Rachmadi was kept fully informed of the deal, which was concluded on June 3.A spokesperson for Rekso Nasional Food said that as far as it was aware the transaction was legal.Tri Adhyaksa, Mr Rachmadi’s lawyer, said his client’s shareholder rights in BNR were ignored and that Rekso Nasional Food could not become a franchisee without Mr Rachmadi’s permission, which had never been given.“McDonald’s has broken Indonesia’s company law, violated the franchise agreement and acted unethically,” he said. “We’ll explain in court why we are seeking the amount [of money] we are.”Hearings are expected to begin in August.Mr Rachmadi, who experienced financial losses when Bank IFI, of which he was the controlling shareholder, got into financial difficulties earlier this year, still has the McDonald’s franchise for 13 outlets through another company, Ramako Gerbangmas.McDonald’s said in a statement issued through BNR that “Mr Rachmadi was fully and properly informed of all matters to be decided by the shareholders of BNR.”“His rights as a shareholder were completely respected,” it continued. “He had the full opportunity to make himself heard and vote on those matters. Any allegations to the contrary are totally groundless and without merit.”Mr Rachmadi resigned as chief executive of BNR in May 2008.Mr Adhyaksa claimed that BNR should have sold shares in the operation to Rekso Nasional Food but not the assets themselves. “It clearly wanted to be unburdened by any debt,” he said.He said that over the past 14 years McDonald’s had made Rp500bn in franchise fees from BNR while Mr Rachmadi had not received a single rupiah in dividend payments over the same period.He added that Mr Rachmadi was critical of International Development Services’ management of the company, claiming that in 2007 BNR made a loss of some $11m while the Indonesian franchise of Kentucky Fried Chicken made a profit of a similar amount.
461;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-06-08T20:44:29Z;Wall Street recovers losses in late trade;;US stocks staged a late recovery on Monday to end roughly where they were at the end of the previous session after a day spent almost entirely in negative territory.The equities markets opened lower on worries that interest rates might rise later in the year and stall an economic recovery.“Bond yields have been on the rise and that spells weaker than average performance,” wrote analysts at Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch. “We found that stocks deliver below-average performance when interest rates rise dramatically.”Don Galante, senior vice-president of fixed income at MF Global, agreed, saying: “The risk is that such a rise could shut the economic recovery down.”But financial stocks, which were the only sector to perform well throughout the day, led a late reversal while the market waited to see which banks would be first to be allowed to repay money from the government’s troubled asset relief program.The Wall Street Journal reported JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs would be named on the initial list. But while JPMorgan gained 2.4 per cent to $35.39, Goldman gave up 0.4 per cent to $148.35. Citigroup rose ahead of an expected swap of preferred shares into common stock.The Financial Times reported over the weekend that the bank’s plan to raise $33bn in capital had been postponed after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation threatened to lower a crucial financial health rating as part of the regulator’s drive to replace Vikram Pandit, chief executive. Citigroup shares closed 1.2 per cent higher at $3.42.The paper also reported that Bank of New York Mellon and BlackRock were competing to buy Barclays Global Investors.BlackRock, which Reuters reported was the frontrunner with an offer of about $12bn, gained 3.4 per cent to $169.36, while BNY Mellon picked up 1.1 per cent to $28.54.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent down at 939.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, on which Travelers and Cisco made their first appearance, replacing Citigroup and General Motors, edged a fraction up to 8,764.49. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,842.40.Materials were the biggest drags on equities markets as the price of oil and metals dropped.Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, lost 1.2 per cent to $56.48, while Nucor, the steelmaker, dropped 1.6 per cent to $46.76.Multinationals felt the effect of the strengthening dollar. McDonald’s was a particularly heavy faller as the company warned that exchange rates could cost the company 20 cents per share for the year.The warning negated the impact of a stronger-than-expected rise in global sales for May and the company’s shares fell 1.9 per cent to $58.72.General Mills, which makes food brands such as Cheerios, gained 4 per cent to $54.22 after the company said 2009 earnings would be several cents better than forecast.Apple shares lost 0.6 per cent to $143.85 even though the company unveiled a new iPhone and a new Mac operating system at its annual developers conference.There had been early rumours that Steve Jobs, chief executive, might make an unexpectedly early return from ill health at the conference.However, the company said his return was not expected until the end of June.Meanwhile Palm, Apple’s latest competitor in the smartphone market, retreated 6.5 per cent to $12.16 in spite of reports that the company’s Pre phone had sold out at some stores during its launch over the weekend.Investors were concerned the new iPhone would reassert Apple’s position in the market.Verisign, which operates internet domain names, fell more than any other on the S&P after a court on Friday allowed an antitrust suit against the company which claims its pricing of the .com and .net domain names is artificially high.The company’s shares slumped 14.2 per cent to $19.90.
462;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-06-08T17:45:54Z;McDonald’s benefits from budget-conscious climate;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food chain, reported another strong month of sales in May, as its low-price menus continued to attract budget-conscious consumers in the US and Europe.The group’s global comparable sales rose 5.1 per cent year-on-year in May, supported by a 2.8 per cent increase in the US, and a 7.6 per cent increase in Europe. Comparable sales in Asia rose 6.4 per cent, in spite of weakness in China, where its western-style restaurants have lost out to cheaper, traditional competition.Before the recession hit the US last year, McDonald’s had already achieved a successful sales turnround after several years of slow or falling sales. But its business has strengthened further in the current economic climate, in which there has been robust growth in demand for low-cost fast food at a time when more expensive “family” restaurant chains such as Denny’s and Applebees have struggled.In the US, McDonald’s said sales had been boosted by the expansion of its McCafé espresso-based coffees as well as by demand for its regular burgers and french fries. The coffee programme, which is now being extended to regions in Europe, is part of an ongoing drive to increase morning and breakfast traffic at its more than 14,000 US restaurants.The low-cost McCafé programme is one of the factors behind a drive by coffee chain Starbucks to reinforce the value image of its more expensive cappuccinos and lattes with the most extensive marketing blitz in its history. Starbucks’ US comparable sales have been declining since the start of the downturn.In Europe, McDonald’s said sales growth had been supported by “everyday affordability initiatives”, as well as by efforts to extend sales into breakfast as well as lunch and evening. It said that it had seen “strong performance” in the UK, France, Germany and Russia.In spite of the strong sales growth, the company said that worldwide sales revenues for the month in dollar terms declined 0.4 per cent, due to the strengthening of the US currency, although overall sales were up 7 per cent.The company also warned investors that if the dollar continued at current levels, it would lead to a reduction in overall earnings of 8-9 cents in the second quarter compared with a year ago, and a 20 cent impact on earnings for the full year.McDonald’s shares were down more than 2 per cent at $58.52 at noon in New York on Monday.

It said that it had seen “strong performance” in the UK, France, Germany and Russia.In spite of the strong sales growth, the company said that worldwide sales revenues for the month in dollar terms declined 0.4 per cent, due to the strengthening of the US currency, although overall sales were up 7 per cent.The company also warned investors that if the dollar continued at current levels, it would lead to a reduction in overall earnings of 8-9 cents in the second quarter compared with a year ago, and a 20 cent impact on earnings for the full year.McDonald’s shares were down more than 2 per cent at $58.52 at noon in New York on Monday.
464;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s set to mug Starbucks in Europe;;McDonald’s is aiming to overtake Starbucks as Europe’s biggest coffee chain, with plans to open several hundred McCafé stores selling pastries and cappuccinos this year.While Starbucks – which has 1,300 stores in Europe – has been scaling back on its European expansion, McDonald’s has ambitious growth plans for its branded cafes on the continent.The fast food chain wants to expand its chain of McCafés, which operate within or next to regular McDonald’s restaurants, to 1,200 in Europe by the end of the year.McDonald’s has yet to open any McCafés in the UK, where about half of Starbucks’ European stores are based.“We can become the biggest seller of coffee in Europe,” Jerome Tafani, chief financial officer for McDonald’s Europe, said.He added that McCafés were attracting new customers by creating a “cosy” atmosphere at the group’s restaurants and targeting people looking for breakfast on their way to work.The chains emerged in Australia in the early 1990s and were introduced to Europe in Ireland in 2002. Nearly half of Germany’s 1,200 McDonald’s restaurants today have McCafés, while some 20 per cent of restaurants in Russia and Italy have them. The chain is opening them in France and Austria.McDonald’s has installed coffee machines from high-end manufacturers in its McCafés in an effort to win over sceptics. It is selling different blends of coffee supplied by Kraft in each market to suit local tastes.Cappuccinos are priced at €2 to €2.50 ($2.80 to $3.50) per cup.The growth of the McCafé chain adds to a resurgence of fortunes at McDonald’s, which has seen sales for its core hamburgers and fries rise on the back of renewed demand from cash-poor consumers in the recession.McDonald’s has launched an advertising campaign in the US promoting its cappuccinos and lattes in its restaurants and drive-throughs.The group claimed its strategy of opening McCafés in existing restaurants in Europe – at a cost of €60,000 to €85,000 per café – allowed it to recoup its investment more quickly than Starbucks, helping it break into difficult markets such as Italy.“Our business case is not the same as Starbucks,” Mr Tafani said.
465;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-05-24T17:12:27Z;Little luxuries console consumers;;When lipstick and other cosmetics were exempted from rationing during the second world war, it was hoped they would provide the public with an affordable boost to morale.Consumers have traditionally sought solace in life’s little low-cost treats during hard times. Lipstick, lingerie, sunglasses and watches are some of the usual “affordable luxuries” people have turned to in recessions. And each downturn throws up fresh examples. Cinema admissions have hit a five-year high, according to the UK’s Cinema Advertising Association. L’Oréal says sales of hair-colouring kits for use at home have risen 7 per cent since the start of the global financial crisis.“We’ve seen quite a few companies capitalise on this need to treat ourselves but not be extravagant,” says Jeremy Baker, affiliate professor at ESCP Europe business school. “Cut-price supermarket Lidl is selling lobster at an affordable price. Thornton’s chocolate sales are up 11 per cent since Christmas.”Likewise, McDonald’s has embarked on a $100m advertising campaign in the US to convince coffee drinkers that its McCafé range of cappuccinos, iced coffees and frappés are affordable luxuries.Meanwhile, with “staycationers” choosing to holiday at home more, Susan MacDonald, buying and merchandising director at Dobbies, an out-of-town garden centre chain, says bay trees, bamboos, Japanese acers, olives and tree ferns – plants that are “a bit special” but, at £30 ($48) a time, “affordable” – are proving particularly popular.Nevertheless, marketing experts say it has been much more difficult in this recession to promote a product as an affordable luxury. “Many of our 20th century marketing concepts simply don’t work the way they used to,” says Paco Underhill, consumer psychologist and author of Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping.John Quelch, marketing professor at Harvard Business School, thinks that, in this recession, the luxury half of the equation has become tainted. “The breadth, depth and length of this downturn has put the affordable luxury category under pressure as never before,” he says. “Lipsticks were always said to be immune from recession. Not this time. Buyers are trading down from luxury brands to mid-market price points as never before.”Mr Quelch suggests that consumers are becoming more discerning and dissociating themselves from the extravagance and conspicuous consumption of the boom years.“Instead, marketers need to emphasise the affordable, not the luxury. And the luxury component must be seen as a personal treat, not a function of ostentatious consumption,” he says.Some even suggest that, during this recession, we are witnessing the creation of a category. Seth Godin, a marketing trendspotter, calls this the “affordable premium” product, which, like a McDonald’s coffee, is deemed to be worth more than it costs.“In tough times, premium products can do very well because people care a lot about value,” says Mr Godin. “So people might buy a BMW because it’s worth the money but not a Bugatti Veyron.”Too many brands, he says, cannot make up their minds which category they represent.“There’s a flight to quality but marketers need to show why their products are better,” says Mr Underhill. “They might need to spin their products as being better tasting, organic, locally produced, fair trade.”He adds that the internet has helped drive the new emphasis on value by making it more difficult for brands to control pricing.“If you want to cheer yourself up buying a Coach handbag, you can go to Ebay and pay a fraction of the price you might in the stores,” he says. “And customers now have web-enabled mobile phones so they can do comparison shopping while they’re going from store to store.”
466;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s hopes to offer its own PhD;;McDonald’s hopes to offer its own PhD, throwing down the ultimate challenge to the popular wisdom that the high-street fast-food chain creates nothing but low-paid, low-quality “McJobs” to replace high-skilled work in old manufacturing industries.David Fairhurst, the group’s “chief people officer”, told the Financial Times: “One day I’d love to see us doing a PhD, I definitely think we should go as far as we can.”Mr Fairhurst said, however, that McDonald’s wanted initially to make sure it had perfected training in its growing range of other qualifications before embarking on a postgraduate degree.The company’s ambition is not as bizarre as it might sound to the average visitor to a McDonald’s restaurant.The company has developed a reputation over recent years for its training. It took a further step towards educational respectability last year when it became one of Britain’s first employers to win the power to award its own nationally recognised qualifications. McDonald’s has taken advantage of this to start offering courses in basic shift management that are equivalent to A-levels.These teach “the whole dynamics about customer interactions”, stretching even to the hardships of “dealing with aggressive customers” and “safety during the night-time shift”. They also deal with less dangerous but equally sensitive matters, such as how to approach and aid unserved customers wandering around at the front of the restaurant.Mr Fairhurst said its new awarding power had made it “a university in its own right”. About 2,500 people were currently signed up to the shift management course, he said.In a strange flip of burger fate, this included “a few hundred” university graduates, he said, who were complementing their three years in academia with the course’s highly practical training.But it does not stop there – Mr Fairhurst wants to award qualifications in “higher level management development” which are equivalent to university degrees.The CPO said McDonald’s had become an attractive employer both to graduates and other workers, in large part because of its training, with its status as an awarding body adding to the prestige of its qualifications. The company also offers a “flexibility” that suited young people studying at university, including “McTime” – a system that allows workers to change their shifts via their mobile phones.Mr Fairhurst rebutted the idea that a surge in job applications to McDonald’s – which he says has reached 30 for each available job at some branches – was mainly because of the recession.Aside from McDonald’s, eight employers and employer groups have won the right to award their own qualifications since last year. The government has encouraged them because it wants more workers to have nationally recognised certificates that increase their employability across the economy.
467;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-05-10T21:30:33Z;Ackman steps up Target seat battle;;"Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund investor, will on Monday step up his campaign to win seats on the board of Target, the discount retailer, in one of the largest and most expensive proxy battles in US corporate history.Unusually, the battle over one of America’s best-known store chains is focused on the quality and composition of the incumbent board, rather than management performance.At an open meeting for investors in New York, Mr Ackman will argue that a lack of relevant expertise among independent board members has contributed to Target’s underperforming its larger rival Wal-Mart during the current recession.“This is not a poorly managed company,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “This is really just about improving the board.”Mr Ackman, whose Pershing Square funds control 7.8 per cent of Target shares, is also highlighting the length of the incumbency of board members. Three of the four Target directors are up for re-election, having served a decade or more. Solomon TrujIllo, outgoing chief executive of Telstra, has been on Target’s board for 15 years.“Is he the single best person that should be renewed for another three years? But they put him up anyway because they’ve been friends for years and they don’t want to say, ‘It’s time for you to step off’,” Mr Ackman said.Target has about 1,700 stores across the US and is roughly three times the size by market capitalisation of Heinz, the food group at which Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, won a bitter proxy contest in 2006.Mr Ackman says he expects his contest to cost Pershing Square about $15m. Each time information has been sent out to shareholders it has cost $1.6m.Pershing Square is pressing shareholders to elect to Target’s board Mr Ackman and four others: Jim Donald, former Starbucks chief; Richard Vague, co-founder of First USA bank; Michael Ashner, a real estate executive; and Ron Gilson, an academic who specialises in corporate governance.Mr Ackman, who has waged shareholder campaigns at McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and at Ceridian, the payroll processing group, took a stake in Target two years ago. Last year the company rejected his proposals to restructure its real estate holdings.Target has told its shareholders it believes Pershing Square is attacking its board “in an effort to divert attention from [its] risky real estate agenda”."
468;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-04-30T21:58:54Z;Colgate-Palmolive;Profits rise on higher prices and lower costs;"Every guru has their own particular recipe for success. But most agree that a good start towards a dream job, deal or love is a winning smile. Hence perhaps the continued resilience of Colgate-Palmolive, polisher of the world’s grins.The maker of toothpaste and soap on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings which illustrate that point. While the strength of the dollar knocked overall sales – only a fifth of turnover is now taken at home – volumes were flat and profits higher than a year ago. Colgate achieved that through a combination of higher prices – for instance pushing through a rise of 16 per cent in Latin America, its largest market – and lower costs. Like fellow consumer goods heavyweight Procter & Gamble, also reporting results on Thursday, Colgate has been able to cut its advertising costs as the recession deepens.However, while P&G is struggling with consumers trading down, Colgate operates mainly in areas where private-label penetration is relatively low. Indeed, P&G pointed to central and eastern Europe as among the hardest hit areas. Colgate, meanwhile, is taking toothpaste market share and increasing volumes in Russia.In fact, the only real concern is the long-term effect of cutting advertising and promotion budgets. Investors should be wary of earnings today that come at the expense of future returns. Colgate maintains it will benefit from lower spending by competitors, greater on-shelf marketing and the fact that advertising dollars go much further this year thanks to the troubles of the media industry. But turning the screws now while competitors are struggling would be one way to raise future profits.Even so, Colgate’s dividend yield, at 2.8 per cent, is at its most generous since 1993. The group trades with the market on just 14 times forward earnings, its lowest valuation since 1990. That should bring a smile to the face of any investor looking for value.There was mixed news for consumer companies, as weak sales at rivals Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive subtracted from stronger than expected results at both Starbucks and Kellogg.Procter & Gamble, which makes consumer products from Head & Shoulders to Pringles crisps, reported better profits than analysts’ estimates and reaffirmed its full year profits outlook. But its shares fell as it warned that full-revenues might come in below expectations as the company foresaw another quarter of destocking by retailers.Colgate-Palmolive reported rising profits which were in line with Wall Street’s expectations. The company successfully raised its prices and cut its costs to report earnings of $0.97 a share, but its stock fell as sales remained weak.Starbucks also beat analysts’ expectations as efforts to slash costs compensated for an 8 per cent fall in revenue. The company has come under pressure for customers from cheaper retailers such as McDonald’s and Dunkin Donuts, but its shares rallied on Thursday as Howard Schultz, its chief executive, promised a marketing campaign focusing on value.Kellogg was another company involved in food to suffer falling sales during the first three months of the year, but its cereal division showed some strength, helping its profits rise.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

469;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;McDonald’s takes a knife to China expansion;;McDonald’s is cutting back its expansion plans in China as sales in the country fall, reflecting the slowdown in the export-focused economy.The world’s largest fast-food company, which has just opened its 1,000th store in China, said it now expected to open 150 new restaurants in the country this year, down from a planned 175, after a quarter in which weak sales there contrasted with robust demand in all of its major markets, except Germany.Jim Skinner, chief executive, said that the slowdown could affect as many as 35 sites and that “much of it is in the south, because a bunch of factories have been closed there”.Ralph Alvarez, chief operating officer, said that the company’s plans had been affected by slowing development “in areas where we were counting on more infrastructure growth, homes, roads . . . and that’s where some of the pull-back has happened.”During its first quarter, McDonald’s existing restaurants in China recorded a decline in sales as the company reduced lunch prices to stem the loss of customers to cheaper local alternatives.“In China, there are other convenient alternatives that are less expensive . . . obviously than McDonald’s,” Mr Alvarez said, noting that local alternatives were 35 to 40 per cent cheaper than western-style options.Mr Skinner said McDonald’s remained committed to expansion in China, despite the softening of demand there, noting that the country currently only accounted for about 2 per cent of the company’s operating income.Worldwide, McDonald’s low-cost food offerings continued to ride out the economic downturn, with a 4.3 per cent increase in global comparable sales.In the US, comparable sales increased by 4.7 per cent, while sales in Europe rose 3.2 per cent, boosted by strong performances in France, the UK and Russia.Mr Skinner said that April comparable sales were “trending at least as strong or better than first quarter sales in every area of the world”.McDonald’s has outperformed the rest of the fast-food business in the US, and has successfully attracted budget-conscious customers with its low-cost menu offerings. The NPD Group, a consumer research firm, has reported a 1 per cent decline in visits to US fast-food restaurants in the December to January period, following stable results in the prior three months.McDonald’s overall sales in dollar terms fell by almost 10 per cent to $5.08bn, due to the strengthening of the dollar affecting overseas earnings. Net earnings rose 3.5 per cent to $979.5m, or 87 cents per diluted share, including a 4 cent gain from the sale of its stake in Redbox, an automated kiosk company.The company said it expected lower food-cost inflation in the current year, as commodity prices ease.
470;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-04-14T14:59:57Z;Home-grown cuisine: Just what the doctor ordered;;Russia’s top doctor has prescribed a cure for people suffering from the economic crisis: eat less.An anti-crisis menu drafted by Dr Gennady Onishchenko, the chief sanitary officer, extols the benefits of eating modest portions of plain Russian fare to help trim bulging waistlines and spending on foreign produce.Russian food substitution will also help revive the national cuisine, neglected as expensive imports became more affordable in the pre-crisis consumer boom.Russia’s federal consumer protection service published the menu as a new opinion poll revealed that 50 per cent of Russians had begun economising on food.Natasha Zagvozdina, a consumer analyst at Renaissance Capital, says food retail, after rising between 10 and 14 per cent in real terms in recent years, could shrink by about 3 per cent in 2009.There is little room for Russians to cut overall food consumption – on average they eat 20 per cent less meat than central Europeans. But there will be a switch to domestically produced staples – just what the doctor ordered. “It is not catastrophic. There is no risk of hunger, nowhere near,” Ms Zagvozdina says. “But food consumers will vote with the money in their pockets.”The Kremlin imposed food price controls during last year’s presidential election campaign, but has refused to intervene in the market since the onset of the crisis, despite a 3.5 per cent increase in food inflation during the first two months of the year.But it has pledged to step up investment in agricultural production, continuing a policy that has helped reduce Russian dependence on imported food since the last crisis in 1998.Nonetheless, Russia’s annual food and agricultural import bill has risen 10-fold to more than $27bn in the past decade, as global food prices have soared. Food retailers say they are benefiting as consumers of luxury items switch to cheaper Russian brands, but admit to being baffled by shifting preferences.Food stores in central Moscow and other big cities are still stuffed with foreign goods and retailers are reluctant to give shelfspace to lower margin Russian goods.“We are in uncharted territory,” says Marina Kagan, at Wimm-Bill-Dann, Russia’s biggest dairy producer. “It is now fashionable even for rich Russians to talk about what everything costs,” she says.“You only have to look at Moscow’s half empty restaurants to see that people are being careful about spending.”With staying in the new going out, WBD’s sales of premium yoghurt and creamy puddings have overtaken those of Danone, the French dairy group, which opened its first Moscow store before WBD was even invented. WBD has also supplanted Nestlé as the leading baby food supplier in Russia in recent months.Food retailers say nostalgia for traditional Russian produce was driving a fashion for domestic produce even before the crisis.Grocery One, a retro-food emporium opposite Lenin’s tomb in Moscow’s Red Square, has enjoyed such success since opening a year ago that Mikhail Kusnirovich, a luxury retail tycoon, is planning a second outlet in the city.Lyudmila Galtseva, a buyer at the store, says that preference rather than price was driving shoppers to buy Russian-made foodstuffs at Grocery One. “Of course, everyone has tried Spanish jamon and buys it for special occasions. But our doktorskaya sausage is part of our heritage, it is in our genes,” she says.Foreign food suppliers say that Russians’ growing belief in the superiority of home-grown produce reflects a restoration of national pride.“They are constantly telling us that Russia is the world’s biggest country and its food is somehow more natural because motorways are further away from grain fields,” says a European trade representative in Moscow. But food is rarely 100 per cent Russian, he says, because manufacturers depend on foreign supplies of additives and preservatives.Dr Onishchenko advises Russians to cut down on fat and sugar by slicing sausage more thinly and avoiding fizzy drinks and junk food. He notes that obesity in Russia has grown to exceed European levels since 1994.But his advice on healthy eating will be difficult for the hard-up to follow. Pepsi and Coca Cola anticipate a rise in Russian sales this year as consumers switch from drinking more expensive juice.Meanwhile, McDonalds, the dominant fast food chain, where Big Mac hamburgers sell for just Rbs62 ($1.80), plans to invest $120m this year building 40 new outlets and remodelling part of its network.Opposition leaders have warned that high food prices could spark protests in the coming months.But sociologists say Russians are more likely to take to the bottle than the streets. Renaissance Capital expects 2009 to be a good year for Russian vodka producers, as consumers recoil from more expensive imported alcoholic beverages. A prolonged crisis could spur a revival of traditional Soviet samogon, a home-brewed moonshine.
471;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-04-08T22:31:24Z;Value of ethical stance remains in companies;;"In the worst global recession in decades, it would be understandable if food companies tried to dodge their ethical obligations.Instead, they are falling over themselves to prove just how socially aware and environmentally friendly they can be.Mars’s move to spend millions of dollars on making sure the cocoa that goes into its chocolate comes from farms that meet a range of “sustainable” conditions – including paying farmers a minimum wage, conserving water and running ecological pest management programmes – shows how corporate reputation is seen as more important than ever.Fiona Dawson, managing director of Mars UK, says: “Consumers would be unforgiving if we cut our quality at a time when we’re under economic pressure.” She adds that the issue of sustainable sourcing cannot be ignored by food companies because it is “here to stay”.Although sales of organic food have been dropping as people choose cheaper kinds of food, they are buying more food that has been
certified as sustainably sourced by one organisation or another than ever before.Peter Melchett, policy director for the Soil Association, a UK-based certification organisation for organic food, says: “People are not ditching their green or ethical concerns.”In the UK, sales of Fairtrade food were up 47 per cent in 2008 on a year earlier. Companies that have boosted their commitment to Fairtrade products include Starbucks, the coffee chain, as well as supermarket chains such as J Sainsbury and Waitrose and sugar producer Tate & Lyle.Sales of McDonald’s coffee rose 10 per cent after it started using beans certified by the Rainforest Alliance in 2007, while Unilever is spending €5m ($6.6m)
certifying all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in western Europe by 2010 and all Lipton tea sold globally by 2015.Tensie Whelan, the executive director of Rainforest Alliance, says the increased demand for certification marks comes as a new generation of corporate managers emerges.“The CEOs are younger,” she points out, adding that many were recognising that their businesses were operating with “outmoded business practices and globalisation is aggravating them”.Most food companies were taken by surprise when agricultural commodity prices soared in 2007 and 2008.As well as developing more sophisticated hedging programmes and hiring more risk managers, they are trying to ensure there will be enough farmers and fertile land to grow their crops. “We can’t make more land,” says Howard Shapiro, global director of plant science and external research at Mars."
472;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-03-11T19:40:57Z;Heavyweights suffer loss of influence on lopsided Dow;;The financial and economic crisis is wreaking havoc on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, still the most recognisable global equity benchmark for investors, in more ways than one.So far this year, the Dow, which comprises 30 blue-chip companies, has tumbled 20 per cent and is 51 per cent below its record high of October 2007.Of greater concern, three Dow members – General Motors, Bank of America and Citigroup – currently trade as penny stocks, a term that applies to shares under $5. Shares in Alcoa and General Electric are trading below $10.Unlike most equity benchmarks, the price of a company matters greatly for the Dow, as it is weighted according to a company’s share price and not, like most indices, according to total market capitalisation. That means a stock with a low price has much less influence on the Dow’s overall performance.The five lowest-priced Dow stocks have a combined weighting of about 2.75 per cent in the benchmark.“The Dow, given its price-weighted construction, would only drop by about 60 points should the stock prices of Citigroup, General Motors and Bank of America all simultaneously plunge to zero because they are all priced so low now,” says Jack Ablin, chief market strategist at Harris Private Bank.In contrast, Dow stocks with much higher share prices dominate the performance of the benchmark. At present, the top Dow stocks based on price and weighting are: IBM trading round $88.25 a share, ExxonMobil at $67.50, Chevron at $62 and McDonald’s at $51.25, while Johnson & Johnson and Wal-Mart trade places near $48 a share.These six companies carry a weight of more than 40 per cent in the performance of the Dow.“If you want to support the Dow, drive a long way and buy fast food,” says Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at BNYConvergEx.“It is the most watched benchmark but, at an intellectual level, the Dow is not a good indicator of where the economy is going.”Professional investors prefer the S&P 500, as it is a broader measure of stocks and the economy.Mr Ablin says: “It [the Dow] is a widely watched index but is more a reflection of IBM, Exxon and Chevron than GE, GM and Bank of America.”Dow Jones Indexes, which is responsible for the benchmark, says it still reflects the broad economy, even with such large companies carrying low weightings.“The Dow tracks the market over time and we look at it in terms of whether companies are representative of their industries,” says John Prestbo, executive director of Dow Jones Indexes. “GM and Citi still are.”He does not rule out taking action to change the Dow’s composition but insists that this would only be done in extreme circumstances.“At some point, if there were a nationalisation, some other government controls or bankruptcy filing, that would change the scope dramatically,” he says.Last September, AIG, the insurance company, was replaced by Kraft Foods after it was partially nationalised.
473;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-03-04T02:03:11Z;Cadbury wraps up Fairtrade agreement;;Cadbury is to become the first mass-market chocolate brand to adopt the Fairtrade certification mark, signalling the rising importance of ethical credentials to big business even as consumers become choosier in how they spend their money.The confectionery group will certify 300m of its Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate bars as well as its packaged cocoa, at a cost of £1.5m ($2.1m), by the end of summer. The company raised prices last year, partly to absorb the cost of the move to Fairtrade.Harriet Lamb, the chief executive of the Fairtrade Foundation, said Cadbury’s move, which represents £200m in retail sales, would “throw down the gauntlet” to other big chocolate manufacturers. “It’s an iconic British brand …This does really set the pace for the mainstream industry.”Peter Melchett, policy director for the Soil Association, a certification organisation for organic food, said the move showed the recession was not causing consumers to abandon ethical concerns. “It’s surprising how continually committed people are,” he said.Although Fairtrade sales have been running at record highs, rising 47 per cent last year to £700m, most sales to date have come from specialist Fairtrade companies, such as Divine Chocolate or Traidcraft, or from supermarket chains’ own-label coffee, tea and sugar.Tate & Lyle is among the few household brand names to have already adopted the mark. The company is switching all its retail sugar to Fairtrade by the end of the year. Starbucks, the coffee chain, is also shifting its coffee purchases to Fairtrade this year, a move it claims will make it the biggest buyer of Fairtrade coffee.Todd Stitzer, Cadbury’s chief executive, said on Tuesday he was not trying to “pull the rug out” from smaller Fairtrade companies. “If there are only small players in Fairtrade, it’s sort of self-defeating …If big businesses get behind it, you can have a much greater impact on agricultural societies.”The move will heighten debate on what certification systems are most appropriate, with some food companies having already adopted the US-based Rainforest Alliance mark, including Unilever, which asked the group to certify all its tea farms in 2007, and McDonald’s, which started using the group’s certified coffee beans the same year.Unilever said on Tuesday it had chosen Rainforest Alliance as a certification mark because it covered a broader range of standards than Fairtrade, including worker protection and environmental sustainability.“There is a potential competitive benefit to it because consumers are increasingly looking behind the brands to see how their products are brought to their tables,” Unilever said.Fairtrade said it was the only certification mark to pay a guaranteed minimum price to farmers. Cadbury will pay an extra $150 a tonne for Fairtrade cocoa to ensure farmers receive a minimum price, which is $1,600 a tonne. It buys nearly two-thirds of its cocoa from Ghana.Ms Lamb said: “If times are tough for us, they’re desperate for small farmers …they really cannot get access to credit right now.”
474;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Takeaway truths;;For consumers caught in a new age of austerity we seem to be ordering in a great many pizzas – and burgers and buckets of fried chicken. In the early days of the downturn, some imagined Britons would return to the kitchen – or even to The Good Life, the self-sufficiency sitcom fantasy of a recession 30 years ago – as cash-strapped families saved money. But more striking than any revival in home cooking, has been the rise in home delivery.Domino’s Pizza, the UK’s biggest pizza delivery service, said this week that pre-tax profit rose 25 per cent last year. KFC is proliferating thousands of extra jobs. Last month McDonald’s reported global comparable sales growth and an increase in operating income for 2008. Its comparable sales rose in January too. Fast food has staying power.Gourmets will shudder – but quickly realise that the drive-through puts pressure on menu prices and makes it easier to get restaurant tables. From a business rather than culinary perspective, there are two reasons to welcome the achievements of the fast food chains. They are adding to their workforce when other sectors are shedding jobs. Their successes reflect real upgrades in the product and their customer service. Ordering a takeaway today is no longer invariably a matter of waiting hours for a soggy slice of margherita and some limp garlic bread.There is no point being too precious about the lure of the bargain bucket. If a worker is spending longer hours in the office it is no wonder he or she might prefer the quick fix of saturated fat to the time and work involved in preparing a home-made meal. Recessions are not good for waistlines or arteries.The advance of fast food, moreover, tells us how much we have come to prize convenience. Downturn dining favours ease over effort. Taking trouble over food has fewer adherents than in earlier hard times. Making frugal delights such as pea puree pancakes or beetroot pudding may still go on – but only among those for whom it is a chosen not a compulsory activity.
475;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-02-17T20:01:59Z;Cash-strapped Britons turn to takeaways;UK fills up on fried chicken and pizza as recession bites;"Britons are filling up on buckets of fried chicken and takeaway pizza as the recession deepens, turning their backs on the fashionable restaurants and gourmet food that boomed as incomes peaked.The shift has taken some people by surprise. In the early days of doom and gloom, some predicted that a period of austerity would force people to return to leaner, more basic diets. It would be like war-time rationing all over again, they enthused, and – just as happened 70 years ago – the nation would wind up healthier for it.Instead, fast food is in the ascendancy, as are the companies that sell it. Domino’s Pizza’s profits in the UK grew by 25 per cent in the past year; sales at Kentucky Fried Chicken are up 14 per this year; McDonald’s says its UK stores had their best performance last year.As well as its possible effect on the nation’s waistlines, this clutch of companies could also change the face of the high street. Domino’s says it will open at least 50 new stores next year, while KFC said this week it would open up to 300 in the next five years and create 9,000 jobs. Subway, the purveyor of long sandwiches, is also raring to expand. It wants to open another 600 stores by 2010, and says it will create 7,000 jobs.The growing popularity of fast food has been driven by economics, as people trim their budgets and stay at home more in the face of rising unemployment in the UK.Staying in may have become the new going out but, according to Chris Moore, Domino’s chief executive, people still want the convenience of not having to cook.“We’ve seen a lot of people who would go to restaurants three, four times a week, and they are now spending more time at home,” he says. “But with all the drudgery and bad news out there, they say: ‘Stuff it, I am going to treat myself to a pizza and not wash up’.”A third of the 2.7m households Domino’s delivered to during the last year were new customers. Accustomed to eating in restaurants, these people spend more than an average customer would, helping boost Domino’s sales.Martin Shuker, KFC’s chief executive, agrees that the chain’s cheap prices are helping win custom. “We do offer good value, so you can buy a bargain bucket and feed a family of four for a tenner, [which is] definitely appealing in these difficult economic times,” he said.The effect has ravaged the traditional restaurant sector: 503 restaurants went bust in 2008, according to PwC, a 32 per cent rise on the previous year.David Haslam, chair of Britain’s National Obesity Forum, understands fast food’s growing appeal. “It’s cheaper and easier and simpler and less stressful,” he says.But he is concerned that the trend could derail attempts to improve the nation’s diet. “It is a worry, because presumably it coincides with a reduction of cooking in the home and healthy eating.”He says the fast food industry should be aware that as its popularity grows, so does its responsibility. “It is dealing with more of the population who are paying it much more money, so it can invest that in better standards and improving the quality of the food it produces.”While supermarkets say people are also cooking more from scratch, there is some indication that fresher food is falling out of favour. Sales of fresh fruit and vegetables rose by 3 per cent last year, according to data provider Nielsen, less than the growth of the food market as a whole. Organic food sales have declined.Sales of tinned goods, meanwhile, rose 8.2 per cent and frozen food sales rose 5.6 per cent after several years of stagnation.Tesco says comfort-eating is clearly on the rise. Over the past 12 weeks, its sales of syrup sponge jumped 62 per cent, éclairs 50 per cent, apple pie 57 per cent and raspberry cheesecake 45 per cent."
476;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-02-04T20:55:57Z;US company earnings hit by FX turbulence;;US companies increasingly cite currency fluctuations among the reasons for slumping sales and profits as volatile foreign exchange markets hit corporate America with fourth-quarter earnings season in full swing.In recent years, US businesses have become steadily more exposed to foreign exchange risk as they draw more business from beyond America.Standard & Poor’s estimates that companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index made almost 50 per cent of their sales outside the US by the end of 2007, up from 30 per cent in 2001.The list of companies that have reported the pinch of currency risk in recent weeks is long and distinguished.Procter & Gamble, often thought of as a recession-resistant company, cut its full-year profit forecast last week as unfavourable foreign exchange movements reduced net sales by 5 per cent and the dollar appreciated versus the euro, sterling and Canadian dollar.Mattel’s fourth-quarter net sales were down 11 per cent from last year and included an unfavourable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of 5 percentage points.At Starbucks, international total net revenues fell 8 per cent compared with the same period last year, primarily as a result of the stronger dollar relative to sterling and the Canadian dollar.McDonald’s, Kimberly-Clark and Wal-Mart also lowered earnings guidance in December because of currency fluctuations.As a result of this greater impact of currency swings, companies are starting to put greater emphasis on trying to hedge their foreign exchange exposure, according to a recent survey from JPMorgan.US companies estimated that 42 per cent of their forecast foreign income was hedged in December, up from less than 7 per cent in April, the survey of clients found.A variety of instruments, including simple forward contracts, are used to hedge currency risk. Other instruments are futures, options and collars – a protective options strategy.The JPMorgan survey also estimated that G7 currencies would fluctuate by an annualised 20 per cent this quarter, double the average since 2000, emphasising the growing need to hedge against potentially adverse currency movements.However, even those that have actively hedged in the past may have been caught out recently. “There have always been active hedgers and most companies have at least had an awareness of this,” said George Nunn, head of foreign exchange and rates structuring for the Americas at BNP Paribas.“In terms of risk management, the typical process is for companies to estimate future revenues and decide on the basis of that estimate how much they will hedge.”Because the recession meant that, in most cases, revenues had been over­estimated, Mr Nunn said, many companies found that they were overhedged “and so are being forced to unwind trades”.The process of corporate deleveraging was still not over, he said, and unwinding some of the overhedging was part of that process.“Company earnings are clearly going to get hurt as a result of this alongside other factors,” Mr Nunn added.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall in New York
477;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T19:16:24+0000;Free breakfasts on Denny’s menu;;Denny‘s, the family restaurant chain that is an icon of middle-America, on Tuesday caught the recessionary spirit of the times by giving away an estimated 2m free breakfasts to customers, as it strives to revitalise its flagging fortunes.Denny’s said it would serve its popular “Grand Slam” eggs, bacon, sausage and pancake breakfast for free between 6am and 2pm in what is believed to be one of the biggest promotions of its type ever.“Free works today far more than any other offer in this economy,” said Nelson Marchioli, its chief executive.Early-morning queues were reported outside locations from Dayton, Ohio, where customers braved sub-zero temperatures, to Fresno, California, where the franchisee posted a security guard at one restaurant to ensure orderly behaviour.Jeremy Kraus, manager of Denny’s in Colorado Springs, told the local television station in his crowded restaurant that “Christmas is normally our busiest day of the year. This surpasses that”.Denny’s, which has more than 1,500 full-service restaurants, has faced a decline in sales over the past two years as a result of the slowing economy, changing eating habits, and competition from McDonald’s and other fast food restaurants for its core breakfast business.Mr Marchioli said the free breakfast promotion was a way of “re-acquainting” people with Denny’s as a low-cost dining option. “People are having a tough time in this economy . . . they are jumping all the way to fast food, or back to the grocery store . . . we’re telling them they don’t have to do that.”He argued that the huge media response, with more than 100 stores attracting television reporters, had justified the expense.“I wish every marketing dollar I’d spent had been spent this wisely,” he said.The chain is also handing out coupons aimed at bringing customers back for future visits.Denny’s decision to give away a main meal is the most dramatic example so far of what has been an increasingly popular marketing strategy in the food service industry.In 2006, Starbucks, the coffee chain, launched an annual “free coffee break” in mid-March, giving away about half a million cups of coffee between 10am and noon. Its stores also gave out free coffee on election day, and recently offered free coffee to customers who volunteered to do at least four hours of community service.Caribou Coffee, Starbucks’ smaller rival, also launched a wave of free decaffeinated coffee last Friday.Since 2006, International House of Pancakes, one of Denny’s chief breakfast rivals, has started marking Shrove Tuesday, or Mardi Gras, by giving away pancakes, and suggesting customers make donations to a children’s charity.
478;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;US consumers seeking value options;;The frugal mood of the US consumer was underlined on Monday by quarterly results from McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, and Kimberly-Clark, maker of leading household brands including Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues.McDonald’s said that comparable sales at its low-cost US restaurants increased by 5 per cent during its fourth quarter, maintaining steady growth as other more upmarket rivals, from Starbucks to Denny’s, have been reporting consistently falling sales.In contrast, Kimberly-Clark reported a 10 per cent decline in sales of its leading Huggies nappies in North America, as well as in sales of its Viva and Scott paper towels.Its leading bathroom paper brands saw a 7 per cent fall in volumes, while Kleenex sales dropped 3 per cent.The company said the impact of the economic slowdown on its business had been “more anticipated”, with customers in the US and Europe choosing not to restock household supplies, and trading down to lower-cost alternative brands.Tom Falk, chief executive, said the company was looking at ways to lower prices on nappies and training pants, where it faces intense competition from store brand rivals.Kimberly-Clark’s overall sales fell 3.4 per cent to $4.6bn, in spite of price increases due to higher commodity costs, as the strength of the dollar added to pressure from falling sales volumes. Earnings dropped by 8.1 per cent to $419m, or $1.01 per diluted share.The strength of the dollar also hit McDonald’s net sales, which fell 3 per cent against a year ago to $5.56bn.Globally, McDonald’s saw comparable sales increase by 7.2 per cent, with a 7.6 per cent rise in Europe and 10 per cent in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa division.Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive, said “today’s market conditions play to our strengths” and highlighted growth in Europe in the UK, France and Russia.“Our model remains recession resistant,” Mr Skinner said.
479;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-01-26T22:37:49Z;Pfizer deal offsets Wall St earnings gloom;;Hefty declines in financial shares weighed on Wall Street on Monday as the sector’s volatile run continued, although a rare piece of dealmaking propped up the wider market during more choppy trading.Financials rallied as much as 4.3 per cent overall to lead a bullish morning session as US investors took some comfort that European banks had reassured over the need for possible capital raisings.But the relief was short-lived. A sharp afternoon sell-off left the sector 2.1 per cent lower, as fears over more heavy writedowns and uncertainty over the new administration’s plans to rescue the stricken sector returned to the fore.Citigroup and Bank of America advanced as much as 8.1 per cent and 11.9 per cent, respectively, only to stand 4 per cent and 3.9 per cent lower by the close. They finished at $3.33 and $6, respectively.“We’re going to continue to see that volatility,” said Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNYConvergEx.Regional banks were among the heaviest losers. A bearish note on Regions Financial from Richard Bove, influential analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, helped push the sector down 3.4 per cent overall.Shares in the southeast lender dropped 12 per cent to $4.10 after Mr Bove forecast it was likely to slash its dividend from 10 cents to a penny a share.American Express was another key loser among the bigger names, down 5 per cent to $15.20, but recovered 4.3 per cent in immediate after hours trade, when the credit card group disclosed a 79 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings.Heavy volatility has returned to Wall Street in recent sessions, due in large part to violent swings in financial stocks.Last week, the benchmark S&P 500 dived beneath a nadir reached last month, sparking concerns among technical analysts that another support level could be breached.The wider market finished off its highs on Monday, but still found positive territory as Pfizer’s deal to acquire Wyeth, a rival drugmaker, demonstrated that at least some deals could be struck during the recession and amid weak credit markets.The S&P finished up 0.6 per cent to 836.57, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5 per cent higher at 8,116.03 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.8 per cent stronger at 1,489.46.The S&P had earlier rallied as much as 2.5 per cent.Although news of the Pfizer-Wyeth tie-up had leaked, its confirmation was reassuring for the wider market – especially given that Dow Chemical said it did not have the funds to complete the immediate takeover of Rohm and Haas, whose shares tumbled 13.3 per cent to $57.10.Shares in Dow, which cited the global financial crisis and the collapse of its joint venture with Kuwait, lost 7.6 per cent to $13.24 as its target launched a lawsuit.Pfizer dropped 10.3 per cent to $15.65 while Wyeth closed down 0.8 per cent to $43.39 after a strong run last week, when talk of the deal began to circulate.Elsewhere, homebuilders stood 2.9 per cent higher overall after National Association of Realtors data showed that sales of existing homes rose last month from a record low.Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the jump in foreclosures – and subsequent drop in prices – had contributed in large part to the 6.5 per cent increase. Still, he noted after the figures were released: “The market wants to look on the bright side of risk…and this latest data will probably encourage the mild risk recovery seen so far.”The Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators also unexpectedly rose in December.The market’s gains came in spite of glum assessments of corporate prospects and a harsh round of job cuts. The most high-profile, Caterpillar, dropped 8.4 per cent to $32.67. Among the raft of other companies to unveil plans for hefty job losses, Home Depot climbed 4.7 per cent to $22.73 and Sprint Nextel added 1.2 per cent to $2.49. Both companies said the moves would bring sizeable cost savings.Elsewhere, McDonald’s – which along with Wal-Mart was one of only two stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to end 2008 in positive territory – added 0.7 per cent to $58.40 after the release of results that topped forecasts.
480;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-01-26T14:50:58Z;McDonald’s;;"Aside from the ever-present clown, the chief attraction of McDonald’s is its reliability. The flagship burger is so similar on each continent that prices of Big Macs are one way to estimate the purchasing power of currencies. Hungry, frugal or child-pestered customers know what they will get. Should investors feel the same way?On recent form, yes. McDonald’s belongs to the select club of companies whose shares ended 2008 higher than they started. And fourth quarter numbers released on Monday showed continued growth for the fast-food chain as the recession pushes more people through its doors. Since losing its way at the start of the decade, a bout of investment in clean stores and more appealing menus appears to have paid off. The global march of the golden arches continues apace, with plans to open 1,000 further stores this year.To an extent, that reliability is already reflected in shares that trade at 15 times prospective earnings compared with the broad US restaurant sector at about 12 times. But then expectations for 6 per cent earnings growth, in spite of the fluctuations of currencies, remain significantly better than peers. With agricultural prices moderating, it is hard to see what could go wrong. The fast-food market remains competitive, but a return to self-destructive price wars seems unlikely.Excitement, meanwhile, would require accelerating sales growth. High fixed costs mean that every 1 per cent lift to McDonald’s revenues adds twice the boost to earnings. A Deutsche Bank survey of stores suggests a 1 per cent lift to US sales this year is plausible. Success with selling speciality coffees could eventually perk up the top line but is not essential. The lesson from the long stagnation of Japan is that high-quality defensive names remain popular year after year. There is nothing wrong with more of the same.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

481;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-01-23T23:33:33Z;McDonald’s defies downturn;;McDonald’s is planning to this year create 12,000 jobs and open 240 new restaurants across Europe, it emerged on Friday, as the fast-food chain shows signs of being one of the few global companies to benefit from the financial crisis.In stark contrast to the multinational groups announcing record job cuts and losses, McDonald’s plans for expansion in Europe are its biggest in five years.“We’re certainly not slowing down,” said Denis Hennequin, president of McDonald’s Europe as he outlined to the Financial Times his plans to hire 50 people at each of the 240 new restaurants, mostly in Spain, France, Italy, Russia, and Poland.Not since 2003, when McDonald’s revamped its global business strategy to focus on making money from sales at existing restaurants, rather than simply by adding new ones, has it added so many jobs or opened so many restaurants in Europe.The chain’s low-priced menus are attracting a customer base that was already expanding as a result of improved store designs and new menu choices. Company executives argue that food price inflation has made its fast food “a better deal than necessarily eating at home”.McDonald’s has been one of a handful of leading US companies to thrive globally amid the prevailing consumer gloom – together with Wal-Mart it was the only member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average to see its share price go up last year, by 7 per cent.When the fast-food group reports fourth-quarter results on Monday, analysts expect company profits will rise some 10 per cent.Mr Hennequin claimed there were “no signs of weakening” in the group’s European business – where comparable store sales rose 7.8 per cent in November – but acknowledged consumers, particularly in Germany and Spain, were favouring the cheapest menu items.Sales have also been healthy in the US, up 4.5 per cent in November, while table-service restaurants Denny’s and Ruby Tuesday reported sharp falls in customer traffic and sales. In Asia, sales rose 13.2 per cent.The fast-food group also planned to add about 400 new McCafes to the 800 it already has in Europe this year. Most of the jobs McDonald’s is adding in Europe will be part-time and will include restaurant managers, assistant managers, swing managers, hostesses and crew.
482;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-01-23T20:11:56Z;Recession Britain: All washed up;;The Reebok Stadium in Bolton stands as a fitting symbol of the UK’s recession. Bolton Wanderers football team is still there but Reebok is looking to desert.Adidas, the sportswear brand’s German owner, announced this week that the company founded in the Lancashire town in 1895 intended to pull out, leaving three floors vacant at the stadium. Built at a cost of £35m in 1997, its sweeping curves expressed hope in a bright new leisure-driven economy after the devastation of the region’s heavy industry in the 1980s and early 1990s.What is bad in Bolton is bad across the country. Official figures on Friday revealed that the recession is deep, persistent and much worse than the Treasury’s forecasts from November. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates that national output has fallen 2.7 per cent since its peak in April 2008 – worse already than in the 1990s recession. The European Commission predicts that the annual rate of growth for 2009 will be a negative 2.8 per cent, the worst performance in any year since national accounts were first compiled after the second world war.So far, the overriding feature of the recession has been that everyone is in it together. North, south, east and west, unemployment is rising fast. Whether at international banks in the City or car plants in Solihull, sales and credit are hard to come by.Across the north of England, foreign investors wooed after old industries collapsed are pulling back in turn. Nissan is shedding 1,200 jobs at its car plant in Sunderland, the most productive in Europe. At Grattan, a mail-order company in Bradford, Germany’s Otto Group, a retail and services company, is cutting at least one-third of its more than 3,000 staff as it consolidates warehousing back home.The recession is also sweeping through Hammonds Direct, a Bradford-based property law firm with more than 200 staff, which called in the receivers this week saying it had lost 80 per cent of its business.Similar closures are common up and down the country and the gloom has sent sterling tumbling on currency markets amid growing fears about Britain’s economic health. Politicians, meanwhile, have been ratcheting up the rhetoric.David Cameron raised the spectre of Britain’s humiliating 1976 bail-out by the International Monetary Fund, warning: “If we continue on Labour’s path of fiscal irresponsibility, at some point – and it could be very soon – the money will simply run out.”The Conservative leader noted that government borrowing was likely to be higher by any comparison in 2009 or 2010 than when Denis Healey, then chancellor, had to go “cap in hand” to Washington.Jim Rogers, chairman of Singapore-based Rogers Holdings and co-founder of the Quantum Fund with George Soros, went one step further when he told the Financial Times: “It’s simple, the UK has nothing to sell.”So is Britain or its government going bust? Nonsense, says Gordon Brown, who criticised Mr Cameron for displaying “ridiculous behaviour on behalf of the opposition” and accused Mr Rogers of being a speculator talking his own book. But the prime minister cannot be so definitive on Britain having no possibility of defaulting. After all, the country has form.As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have documented in their history of sovereign defaults, England’s monarchs regularly refused to pay their debts. Edward III defaulted on debt to Italian lenders in 1340 after a failed invasion of France that set off the 100 years war. Henry VIII seized the Roman Catholic Church’s lands. “While not strictly a bond default, such seizures, often accompanied by executions, qualify as reneging on financial obligations,” professors Reinhart and Rogoff observe drily.England defaulted in 1672 in the “Stop of the Exchequer” and, in the last century, Britain in effect defaulted in 1932 in a “voluntary” reduction on the interest it paid on war loans. Then came the IMF rescue in 1976. Could it happen again?There is no doubt that the economic climate is deteriorating. This week, the government’s second banking support package focused attention on how weak banks are and how difficult and slow it will be to get credit flowing freely though the economy again.Justine Robinson, who runs Hayfield Robinson, an estate agent and surveyor in Bradford, says government attempts to get banks lending again have yet to have an impact. One client, a security company, could not obtain a mortgage to buy a unit he was leasing, while another was set to move out as the bank called in his £25,000 overdraft.The town’s own £320m makeover has been delayed. Westfield, the Australian developer, insists that a planned shopping mall, office and apartment complex will go ahead when the economy bounces back but at the moment it is a gash in the centre of the city.Neil Franklin, who works for an employment agency in Bradford, says there is little chance of a new start for many there who lose their jobs. He found just one client work this week, at McDonald’s, the burger chain. “It’s one of the few places still hiring.”Unemployment is already at 9 per cent in Bradford and is thought likely to approach the politically dangerous level of 3m across the country by the end of the year from just below 2m now.The public finances are dire, with the deficit according to the Commission reaching 9.6 per cent of national income next year. All week, sterling has been hammered in financial markets, falling 5.7 per cent against the currencies of Britain’s main trading partners.But if Britain were to go bust or were even forced to go to the IMF, things would have to become considerably worse than anyone is so far expecting.Public sector debt, the most important measure of a government’s ability to finance itself, stood at 50 per cent of national income in 2008, on the Commission’s definition. This is low: 10 percentage points below the European Union average and 15 percentage points lower than rock-solid Germany. Even with a much nastier recession than elsewhere in Europe, the Commission expects British government debt to rise only to the EU average.Credit ratings agencies have been at pains to to reaffirm the country’s triple-A status. Moody’s Investors Service insisted on Thursday that Britain was not about to be downgraded, saying “the UK has enough vitality as an economy to rebound” and “the government has enough room to cut spending when the crisis abates and, even more, to raise taxes to keep debt dynamics under control over time”.Investors agree. Yields on government bonds remain at historic lows – even if the spread between gilts and German bunds has risen a touch in recent weeks. There have yet been no problems in financing the government in recent bond auctions – unlike Germany – and the fall in sterling makes the values more attractive to many foreign investors.Most UK economists have also been irritated by Mr Rogers’ suggestion that rats should be leaving Britain’s sinking ship. Ross Walker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, was so riled he joined a colleague in writing an open letter to Mr Rogers accusing him of lacking rigour. “As with most developed economies, manufacturing is shrinking as a share of [gross domestic product] but – even in the UK – is still larger than the financial intermediation sector,” he wrote. Britain remains the world’s sixth largest manufacturing power.There still remains a big question hanging over the banks and the degree to which the taxpayer is on the hook for losses from the recapitalisation and funding and the insurance of catastrophic losses announced on Monday.With RBS, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group having balance sheets worth over £4,000bn in total and stuffed with foreign assets and liabilities, the potential for enormous losses exists, raising the possibility that the UK could travel down the same terrible route as Iceland in the event of a run of foreign finance from British banks. That is one of the main reasons for the government guarantees offered for bank funding.Detailed estimates from Goldman Sachs this week of the likely cost to taxpayers suggest, however, that losses are likely to be bad but manageable – contained below 8 per cent of national income.Moody’s agrees. It says that as the banking guarantees and insurance are implemented, “the risk of a fiscal loss will increase substantially, which would add to the already considerable increase in debt/GDP projected over the next two years”.But it reasons that the likelihood of loss “depends entirely on the ability of the UK economy to recover from its current depressed state” and says the government is justified in taking such a calculated risk.So rather than a sudden bust, recourse to the IMF and a collapse in sterling, the most plausible outlook in these highly uncertain times is that a deep and nasty recession eventually ends and a new economy emerges for the next decade.But that will feel like no new dawn. The overhang of debt is likely, in contrast to the past decade, to result in lower growth, persistently higher unemployment, lower house prices, extremely tight public expenditure, higher taxes, higher borrowing costs and a slower rise in prosperity. It is not much to look forward to.
483;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-01-12T13:59:15Z;US stocks fall on dismal jobs numbers;;A week marked by bleak corporate developments from a host of sector bellwethers drew to a close with more selling pressure on Wall Street on Friday after data that showed that the US economy last year shed the most jobs since 1945 further underscored the depth of the recession.The market opened broadly flat as the bleak non-farm payrolls data from the Labor Department showing that 524,000 jobs were lost in December were no worse than traders’ biggest fears and broadly in line with the figures economists forecast in a Bloomberg poll.“About as dreadful as feared,” wrote Alan Ruskin of RBS Global Banking & Markets.But a sell-off soon after the open took the market beneath the level at which it started the year. By mid-afternoon in New York the benchmark S&P 500 index was down 1.4 per cent at 896.86, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1 per cent weaker at 8,652.94 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.9 per cent lower at 1,585.88.The energy sector led the declines, down 2.1 per cent overall after Chevronwarned it expected “significantly lower” fourth-quarter earnings, which heightened concerns that even the biggest oil companies are being hurt by the recession. The shares were off 0.7 per cent at $73.71.Homebuilders were one of the worst performing subsectors, down 10.1 per cent after a worse-than-expected quarterly loss from KB Home. The shares dropped 1.9 per cent to $14.29.Consumer stocks also did badly on a profit warning from leather goods group Coach, which shed 11.5 per cent to $18.50.They were the latest in a series of glum corporate outlooks this week, which included sweeping layoffs and lower earnings guidance from a range of blue chips, such as Intel, Wal-Mart and Alcoa.Friday’s declines left the S&P 500 on course for a loss of 4 per cent in the first full trading week of 2009, the Dow for a fall of 4.5 per cent and the Nasdaq for a decline of 3 per cent.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge and which last week fell to its lowest level since September, leapt 8.1 per cent over the week.Technology, which had performed well of late as investors snapped up cash- rich names, came under pressure from lower revenue and margin guidance from Intel, off 6.9 per cent for the week at $14.21.In materials, Alcoa, which kicks off the fourth quarter results season on Monday, shed 9.7 per cent to $10.99 on plans for its third production cut in as many months to cope with the recession. Media stocks also came under pressure on a profit warning from Time Warner, down 4.1 per cent at $10.25.Towards the end of the week, the consumer staples sector did badly following a profit warning from Wal-Mart, which heightened concerns that the year-long recession could hurt even those groups previously regarded as relatively immune.Shares in the world’s biggest retailer were among the few to enjoy a double-digit increase last year, up 18 per cent, as investors hoped that the group could continue to find strong growth from cost-conscious consumers eking out cheaper alternatives. However, they shed 9 per cent to $51.91 this week.Wal-Mart was not the only retailer to disclose downbeat December sales figures this week. Investors were also concerned by the scale of heavy discounting over the vital festive period that prompted several retailers to lower earnings guidance.Yet there were some bright spots. Sears and Gamestop, among the few to forecast fourth-quarter earnings ahead of Wall Street’s existing expectations, were up 13.4 per cent at $46.94 and 11.1 per cent at $26.43, respectively.McDonald’s – the only other Dow stock to find positive territory in 2008 – lost 5.6 per cent to $60.36, while Johnson & Johnson dipped 2.8 per cent to $59.12 after Citigroup warned the coming year “looks more challenging than we realised”.
484;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-01-08T22:12:50Z;Consumer staples drag down Wall St;;The consumer staples sector was the worst performing on Wall Street on Thursday after a profit warning from Wal-Mart heightened concerns that the year-long recession could hurt even those groups previously regarded as relatively immune.Shares in the world’s biggest retailer were among the few to enjoy a double-digit increase last year, up 18 per cent as investors hoped the group could continue to find strong growth from cost-conscious consumers eking out cheaper alternatives.But its shares were the biggest losers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday, down 7.5 per cent to $51.38 after the group cut its fourth-quarter earnings forecast. That wiped out all of the stock’s growth since late November.McDonald’s – the only other Dow stock to find positive territory in 2008 – fell 1.2 per cent to $60.52, while cosmetics group Avon Products shed 4.6 per cent to $23.10.Wal-Mart’s profit warning came after disappointing December sales, one of several downbeat retail figures disclosed on Thursday.However, hopes of quick approval in Washington of Barack Obama’s economic stimulus package helped the major indices finish mixed following sharp declines in the previous session.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 909.73 points, the Dow down 0.3 per cent at 8,742.46 and the Nasdaq Composite Index up 1.1 per cent at 1,617.01.The material sector was one of the better performing. Alcoa, which came under selling pressure earlier in the week after disclosing plans for the third production cut in as many months, recovered 4.3 per cent to $11.36 ahead of fourth quarter results due on Monday.Solar stocks rallied after the president-elect proposed to double production of alternative energy as part of the recovery plan. First Solar added 4.6 per cent to $155.36 while smaller peer Suntech Power jumped 6.3 per cent to $12.75.The telecoms sector also held up well after Qwest, up 12.9 per cent to $4.04, reassured investors over fourth- quarter results.The warning from Wal-Mart was the latest in a series of glum corporate developments from a diverse range of blue chips this week.In the previous session, the S&P wiped out nearly all of the new-year advance after lower financial guidance from the likes of Time Warner and Intel. Yet despite the retail gloom on Thursday there were some bright spots and the index finished up 0.8 per cent overall.Sears and Gamestop bounced 23.3 per cent to $49.98 and 13.1 per cent to $25.58, respectively, as they were among the few to forecast fourth-quarter earnings ahead of Wall Street’s existing expectations. Investors took particularly kindly to Sears’ projected cash balance of about $1.3bn by the end of the fiscal year.Yet several retail stocks came under pressure. In addition to the poor sales over the vital festive period, investors were also concerned by the scale of heavy discounting that prompted several to lower earnings guidance.Macy’s fell 2.6 per cent to $11.02 after the group cut full-year earnings forecasts and disclosed plans to close 11 stores following a 4 per cent fall.The technology sector also did poorly, down 1 per cent overall.Sun Microsystems lost 4.9 per cent to $4.84 after Goldman Sachs added the stock its Americas Sell List.Banks were among the worst performing stocks in the previous session and some came under some additional pressure on mounting fears that bad loans would lead to the need for more dividend cuts and rights issues. Sanford C. Bernstein analysts led by Kevin St. Pierre warned the rate of losses on loans would increase to 3.5 per cent by 2010, “above levels seen during the Great Depression”.Meanwhile, analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, wrote: “Current capital levels, which should be considered inadequate in even the best of times, pose an even greater risk entering 2009, a year that will remain challenging for financials.”Among several names, they were cautious about Wells Fargo – now the biggest US bank by market capitalisation – which eased 0.6 per cent to $25.72.Still, an agreement by Citigroup, up 0.1 per cent at $7.16, to support legislation aimed at reducing home loan foreclosures helped the wider market, while the financial sector faded only 0.2 per cent overall.The S&P’s gains came even though the state of the labour market remained a key investor concern.Economists forecast that today’s closely-watched non-farm payrolls report will show the highest rate of job losses since demobilisation after World War Two.
485;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2009-01-08T00:28:32Z;Burger chain beefs up training recipe;;McDonald’s, one of the first organisations other than exam bodies to be allowed to award its own qualifications – dubbed McA-levels – plans to follow this up by offering apprenticeships to all employees at the burger chain.The move would make it “UK’s largest apprenticeship provider”, said the restaurant group.Up to 6,000 of McDonald’s 72,000 UK employees would be offered apprenticeships this year “providing staff with the opportunity to gain a valuable, nationally recognised qualification that is equivalent to five GCSEs grade A* to C”, it said.The food franchise would be subject to Ofsted inspections, like any other educational establishment, and would be required to meet the same standards and criteria as any other provider, such as schools and further education colleges, said McDonald’s.It was among several businesses given the right last year to develop and award their own vocational equivalents to A-levels. Other companies included Network Rail and Flybe, the budget airline. McDonald’s said it already offered a diploma in shift management which was equivalent to an A-level.Its apprenticeship scheme would also “provide young people with transferable skills and a valuable qualification they can use across the hospitality sector, the UK’s second largest employer”, it said.David Fairhurst, chief people officer of McDonald’s UK, said: “In these challenging economic times, it is more important than ever for employers to invest in their staff.“With the service and hospitality sector now one of the biggest employers in the UK economy – over 1.9m people are employed by the hospitality and tourism sector alone – it’s vital that we and others in the industry invest in skills and training now to ensure the sector is ready to shine when the UK emerges from the downturn.”Following the completion of an 80-restaurant trial, McDonald’s plans to offer all employees at its 1,200 UK restaurants the opportunity to gain a Level 2 apprenticeship in multi-skilled hospitality.
486;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:00+0000;Appetite for a cheaper option grows;;"SK Chui sat at his favourite spot at the Central outlet of Fairwood, one of Hong Kong’s biggest Chinese fast food chains, to enjoy his Hainanese chicken rice and tea, which last Saturday at lunchtime together cost HK$35 ($4.50).Mr Chui is a frequent diner at Fairwood and its local rivals Café de Coral and Maxim’s MX. He also goes to McDonald’s and KFC once in a while. The lunch at Fairwood was Mr Chui’s fifth meal at a fast food restaurant this week.“The food isn’t particularly great here but it’s cheap and clean. With HK$35, this is pretty good,” says Mr Chui, a travel agent.Thanks to loyal customers such as Mr Chui, fast food restaurants around the world are defying the global financial crisis with growing revenues. Their low cost meals have benefited from increased traffic as people cut their spending.At McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food chain, global comparable sales in November, or turnovers at restaurants that have been open for at least 13 months, rose 7.7 per cent, led by a 13.2 per cent increase in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, its highest growth this year.“Last year was a record year for us,” says Tim Fenton, president of McDonald’s in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa.“This year is an extremely good year for us, with all the turmoil going on.“We are structured in a way with our business model that we do well in good times, and we do well in harder times, as long as we stick to our foundation.” McDonald’s is not alone. Same-store sales at Fairwood, which has 40 restaurants in Hong Kong and three in China serving local food such as beef curry and barbecue pork, rose about
4 to 5 per cent in October and November from a year ago.CK Ng, executive director at Fairwood, says the financial crisis is the principal reason for the chain’s performance, and the group is well positioned in the downturn.“In some fancy restaurants you don’t need to make reservations anymore. Consumers have traded down. They now go to cheaper places,” says Mr Ng, who estimates about one in 10 customers are new patrons who have given up expensive meals and opted for Fairwood.“You now see more people in business suits in Fairwood. Some fund managers tell me they eat at our restaurants too,” says Mr Ng.While retail in general is hard hit by sinking consumer confidence and lower spending, Mr Ng says fast food has been able to escape the turbulence because people have to fill their stomachs, no matter what."
487;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-12-31T22:08:31Z;US stocks suffer worst year since Great Depression;;"The worst annual performance for Wall Street stocks since the Great Depression ended with a modest rally on the final day of trading as the Federal Reserve pushed ahead with its plan to buy mortgage-backed securities.The central bank’s plan to buy up to $500bn of mortgage bonds by the middle of 2009 helped spur a 1.4 per cent gain on the day for the S&P, which finished 2008 at 903.25.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index added 1.3 per cent to 8,776.39 and 1.7 per cent to 1,577.03, respectively. Volumes were thin as many traders remained away from their desks ahead of the New Year holiday.For the year, the S&P 500 dropped 38.5 per cent, marking its worst run since a marginally higher drop of 38.6 per cent in 1937. The Dow lost 33.8 per cent, its worst annual decline since the index fell 52.7 per cent in 1931.“It was beyond most people’s comprehension that such a thing could happen,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “No one thought the short-term could be this destructive.”The financial sector was the worst performing, down 57 per cent overall, in a year in which several institutions ended up part-owned by the state to prevent a collapse of the system.Some equity was all but wiped out, such as that of Lehman Brothers, whose collapse in September sent shockwaves throughout financial markets across the globe.Shares in other banks that survived without a forced sale or bankruptcy nevertheless sustained losses of epic proportions.Citigroup, which told employees on Wednesday that its chief executive and other executives would forgo 2008 bonuses, finished the year down 77.2 per cent at $6.71. Bank of America sank 67 per cent to $14.08.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, among several institutions to become bank holding companies, were off 60.8 per cent and 69.8 for the year, respectively.As fears over the future of the nation’s financial institutions mounted, so too did concerns of a deep and long-lasting global recession.The material and energy sectors sank 47.1 per cent and 35.9 per cent respectively in a year of extraordinary highs and lows that ultimately saw the worst annual performance for commodity markets since modern records began.Alcoa was among the hardest hit, down 69.2 per cent at $11.26. ExxonMobil was the best performing energy stock – but still lost 16 per cent.Towards the end of the year, the fate of the car industry – vital to the US economy – weighed heavily on investor concerns. Other than AIG, the insurer bailed out by the US government, General Motors was the worst performer on the Dow, off 87.4 per cent for the year.Shares in GM dropped 15.8 per cent to $3.20 on Wednesday after participation in a debt swap by GMAC, the motor group’s financing arm, fell short of its target.Traditionally defensive sectors failed to provide much of a safe haven. Consumer staples, health care and utilities were the best performing sectors, yet still lost 17.7 per cent, 24.5 per cent and 31.6 per cent, respectively.Merck, the pharmaceuticals group, lost 47.7 per cent over the year.Other well known blue chips also endured huge falls as fears grew that companies could find difficulty securing financing and earnings would be hit by plummeting demand. Boeing and Microsoft tumbled 51.7 per cent and 46.2 per cent respectively over the year.Despite the carnage across much of the market, some stand out names enjoyed double digit growth. Wal-Mart was one of two stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to find positive territory, up 18 per cent at $56.06. The other, McDonald’s, rose 5.6 per cent over the year to $62.19.Yet the year’s best performers were merger and acquisition targets, such as Wrigley, acquired by Mars; Anheuser-Busch, purchased by InBev; and UST, bought by Altria.The S&P advanced 20 per cent from an 11 year low hit in November in a so-called ‘Santa-Claus rally’ towards the end of the year.Volatility soared to record levels in 2009. The closely-watched Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, twice jumped above 80 towards the end of the year, nearly double previous highs."
488;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-12-11T16:48:20Z;Christmas shopping: Picking the pitch of the festive ringing tills;;Christmas has come early for consumers, with high street retailers holding sales in November and December in an attempt to encourage consumers to spend.But the measures are not expected to be hugely successful, with retail analysts forecasting the worst Christmas sales figures on the high street for years. Quite how badly retailers have been affected will not be known until after the Christmas period – so spread betters can have a flutter now on how the high street will fare.They can either take a bet on retailers that will do well, or try to predict who will lose market share – or combine the two in a pair trade.Joshua Raymond at City Index says spread betters are very well placed to profit from falling retail sales. “Spread betters can certainly profit from this. A key advantage of spread betting is the ability to profit from a falling market – and the retail sector has fallen 70 per cent in the last 18 months alone,” he says.One trend that is expected to continue is that of shoppers trading down – buying similar products but at cheaper shops. “Discounters and those with clear value messages will resonate well with shoppers and are likely to gain market share at the expense of their peers,” says Rahul Sharma, a director at Martin Currie.This was most recently seen after Tesco announced its third quarter results at the beginning of December. The shares rose after the supermarket said its sales had risen slightly due in part to a focus on discounted goods.Mr Sharma points out that Asda’s owner, Wal-mart, thrived during the last recession in America, and is already doing so again both in the UK and the US.He believes that Morrisons is well positioned because of its no-nonsense value image, as is TK Maxx. McDonald’s could also be a good bet for a company that may benefit from trading down, says Mr Sharma. It has been offering healthier foods such as salads, as well as trying to make its branches more appealing as cappuccino destinations – meaning it could grab market share from companies such as Starbucks.Retailers perceived as being expensive or offering superfluous products are likely to suffer.The shares of luxury retailers have fallen by 62 per cent over the past year, compared with a drop of 29.4 per cent from budget retailers, according to recent figures from DigitalLook.com, a financial information website for private investors.This compares with a drop in the FTSE 100 of 36.1 per cent, at the beginning of December, meaning that budget retailers actually outperformed the stock market.Morrison shares have fallen just over 20 per cent in the past year and Sainsbury’s has fallen more than 35 per cent.High-end food retailers have fared much worse – Marks and Spencer has seen a 60 per cent drop, while Whole Foods has fallen nearly 80 per cent.Mr Sharma suggests going short in luxury brand companies such as PPR, which owns Gucci, or LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy and whose shares have fallen nearly 50 per cent over the past year.Of course, just because a company is in the budget space does not mean it is necessarily a good buy. Andy Yates, director of DigitalLook.com, points out: “The Woolworths saga shows that for a company successfully to exploit the budget end of the market, it still needs a compelling business model, excellent execution and first class financial controls.”Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, says that traders could even sell retail stocks now with the hope of buying them back cheaper in the New Year.But he warns: “Going short on retail stocks at this time of year would be a risky strategy considering that historically they perform very well in December. It might be worth waiting for the New Year to see whether their downward trend is still in place before shorting retailers.”He adds that in three of the past four years, the retail sector has rallied an average of 5.1 per cent in December – so it is normally not the best month to take a short position in a retail share.Gary Thomson, head of sales trading at CMC Markets, argues: “Individual stocks have been sold off so hard that the likes of WH Smith, Tesco, M&S and Morrisons are all trading well below analysts’ forecast prices. So unless there are horrific surprises here post-Christmas, a rebound could be in order.”This means that there may be more opportunities for traders to bet on a rise in retail stocks than a fall, at least over the short term.Tim Hughes at IG Index says: “The question of how to profit lies in exactly what to short. At these valuations, the risk is that even over a miserable trading season, many retailers may manage to beat expectations – simply because those expectations are so low.”He suggests betters use common sense to decide on pair trades. If they think shoppers are likely to trade down, they could go long on Morrisons and short M&S. And if they think the illiquidity in the housing market will encourage people to do DIY on their homes, they could go long on Kingfisher.Mr Raymond says it will not just be luxury brands that are hit. He thinks consumers will refrain from big buys – which could include electrical goods such as tele­visions. Consequently, he thinks DSG, the second biggest electronic retailer in Europe, will suffer.He recommends Game Group, which he thinks will profit from consumers opting to stay at home rather than spend money going out.“Games consoles also prove to be a popular Christmas gift and we may see an increase in demand, as consumers cut back from other luxuries,” he says.
489;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-12-08T22:40:48Z;Strong growth continues at McDonald’s;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast-food chain, reported continued strong growth in the US in November, as its low-cost meals drew in value-conscious customers.However, the strong dollar weighed on the company’s overseas revenues.Comparable sales at McDonald’s restaurants in the US increased by 4.5 per cent during the month, which the company attributed to the demand for its breakfast menu and chicken offerings, as well as “everyday value throughout the menu”.Globally, sales at its restaurants increased 7.7 per cent on a comparable basis, with France, the UK and Russia leading a 7.8 per cent gain in Europe.Yet, European growth slowed from the 10.8 per cent rise seen in November last year. The company also cited the impact of “compelling value” on customer demand in the region.In the Asia-Pacific region, comparable restaurant sales were up 13.2 per cent, with the company highlighting strong sales in Japan and Australia.But the strength of the dollar meant that overall sales at McDonald’s more than 31,000 restaurants around the world – of which over 75 per cent are operated by its franchise holders – rose only 1.9 per cent.The weaker euro and pound meant that European region revenues fell by 7.2 per cent compared with the same period last year, although they would have increased by almost 10 per cent against last year on a constant currency basis.Europe accounts for about 40 per cent of the company’s annual sales.In the US, fast-food restaurants such as McDonald’s and its rival Burger King have seen robust sales in spite of the growing economic pressures, in contrast to a steep decline in the number of Americans going to more expensive, waiter-served “family” restaurants.Ruby Tuesday, for example, which operates over 700 company-owned restaurants in the US, reported a 10.8 per cent decrease in quarterly same store sales last month.Denny’s, which has over 1,500 restaurants, had a 2.4 per cent decline in comparable restaurant sales in its most recent quarter.At the start of this month, McDonald’s adjusted its popular “dollar menu” – which accounts for about 14 per cent of its US sales – amid concerns among some of its franchise holders about the impact this year of higher commodity prices.The changes have included replacing its former $1 double cheeseburger with a new “McDouble Burger” that has one, rather than two slices of cheese on two beef patties.In explaining the changes to its customers on its website, McDonald’s argued that “a slice of cheese will still cost you more at the grocery store than it will at McDonald’s”. It told customers: “We’re doing our very best to continue to satisfy your tastes and wallets.”
490;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
491;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-12-08T22:14:54Z;Wall St rallies on Obama infrastructure plans;;"Hard-hit industrial and commodity stocks were among the most prized in a bullish session on Wall Street that lifted the market to its highest level in nearly a month.Plans for the biggest infrastructure investment in the US for half a century helped Caterpillar and Alcoa, which rose 10.9 per cent at $42.42 and 17.6 per cent at $9.58, respectively.In addition to the spending proposals of US president-elect Barack Obama, which would see new government projects such as roads, bridges and school buildings, sentiment was also helped as Washington edged closer to a deal to bail out the ailing American car industry.General Motors and Ford leapt 20.8 per cent to $4.93 and 24.3 per cent to $3.38, respectively, on hopes of imminent aid.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 3.8 per cent at 909.70 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just shy of the psychologically significant 9,000 level, up 3.5 per cent at 8,934.18 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 4.1 per cent to 1,571.74 points.“The sketchy plans were broad enough in scope to help send equity values skyrocketing,” said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers, of the market’s reaction to the stimulus proposals.The materials sector led the advance, up 7.7 per cent overall. Dow Chemical jumped 7.2 per cent to $20.37 after the group disclosed plans to cut 5,000 full-time jobs in a move expected to save $700m in annual operating costs by 2010.There was mixed news in the media sector. The Tribune Company, publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But Gannett, publisher of USA Today among other titles, gained 2.7 per cent to $9.16.Energy stocks were other big winners as US crude prices rebounded from their sharpest weekly retreat since 1991.Leading the gains, Chesapeake Energy soared 24.4 per cent to $14.08 after Aubrey McClendon, chief executive, sought to quash rumours that it could have liquidity difficulties. Joseph Allman, JPMorgan analyst, welcomed the update and upgraded his recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “overweight”.Devon Energy was helped by a note from Jefferies, which upgraded its recommendation from “hold” to “buy” and set a $100 price target. “Devon is well positioned to pursue opportunistic acquisitions in a tight credit and depressed commodity price environment,” the analysts said. The shares rose 6.6 per cent to $65.32.However, profit warnings from 3M and Illinois Tool Works limited gains among industrials.The former was one of the day’s key losers, down 4.1 per cent at $57.38 in spite of a move to shed 1,800 jobs. However, Illinois finished the session up 1.4 per cent at $32.84. Homebuilders extended some of last week’s spectacular gains, up 3.2 per cent overall.McDonald’s, off 2.9 per cent to $60.92, was among the main losers in the consumer sector, in spite of a reasonable like-for-like November sales performance. Oppenheimer cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast due to the earnings risks presented by the strengthening dollar.In financials, MetLife lost 2.4 per cent to $30.03 after the insurer forecast profit for the fourth-quarter and next year below analyst predictions.The decline came even after the company became the latest in the sector – after Prudential Financial and Hartford Financial last week – to state that it was well capitalised.NYSE Euronext was among the strong gains in exchanges, up 22.5 per cent to $26.21, after reports over the weekend that it had been in talks with Deutsche Börse about a potential tie-up.The talks ended without an agreement.The US economic stimulus package is likely to include additional spending on internet broadband infrastructure and the technology sector stood 5.2 per cent higher
overall.Yahoo gained 4.6 per cent to $12.20 on renewed hopes that the company could reach a long-awaited deal with Microsoft, which was up 5.7 per cent at $21.01.Apple gained 6.1 per cent to $99.72 on reports that Wal-Mart would sell its iPhone for as little as $99. Shares in the retailer, among several defensive stocks to come under pressure, lost 1.1 per cent to $57.56."
492;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-11-19T03:30:54Z;Temples dedicated to the art of spending;;"The ideal city as posited in contemporary culture is all about consumption. Whether it is through shopping, hotels, culture or dining, it is the acts of consuming that define its image.A spate of mega-malls opening around the world in recent weeks appears to be an attempt to concentrate consumption, to harness its power in a single building which becomes a generator, a simulacrum for the city.London was bombarded by hype around the opening of the new £1.7bn ($2.6bn) Westfield shopping centre which now squats on the land occupied exactly a century ago by the Franco-British exhibition – staged to celebrate the Entente Cordiale of 1904 – and the 1908 Olympics.The same day saw the opening of the world’s biggest shopping centre, the Dubai Mall that features an Olympic-size skating rink in competition with the nearby Emirates Mall and its famous ski slope.Even continental Europe, once a bastion against the dominance of themed indoor shopping experiences, has succumbed to the mall. Radical architect Daniel Libeskind, one of the intellectual big-hitters in the field, has just opened the Westside mall in Bern, Switzerland, a building clad in the architect’s characteristic jagged metal.China’s malls dwarf those of Europe, and even those in North America which dominated for most of the mall’s half-century history.How did the mall take over the world?Its genesis lies, strangely enough, in central Europe. Victor Gruen, the architect credited with the invention of the shopping centre, conceived it as a mildly socialist utopia, blending community child- and healthcare, walkable public space and civic architecture and infrastructure.He lived long enough for the mall to become everything he had sought to avoid, a privatised space of hypercapitalism.The mall became successful because it pleased both customer and chain. It was a model suited to suburban development, dependent on the car. It was an internally generated environment created within a cheap tin box on cheap, out-of-town land.Its shops were easy to service, its interiors easy to update, security was tightly controlled and surveillance was heavy. It gave the illusion of public space, with none of the inconvenience, vandalism, crime, dirt, chaos and protest.It avoided the problems of the planning process; in this contained world, neighbours wouldn’t object to new development and each retailer was, in their way, equal: the same shop fronts, the same scale, the same possibilities for expansion.Malls, like cities, thrive on economy of scale but, unlike cities, they promise control and homogeneity. I am always astonished by the excitement that greets the opening of a big mall that will contain exactly the same chains that can be found in an airport, on Oxford Street or a cloned high street, places that people would otherwise go out of their way to avoid.Walter Benjamin, in his elegiac series of texts and notes about the arcades of Paris saw in this typology the most perfect expression of the city as a receptacle for desire and consumption but, by the time he was writing, between the wars, the arcades had already faded into the shabby, faded passages we see today.The ecstasy of consumption is fickle.The Parisian arcades though were, unlike malls, urban infill. Their glass roofs allowed light penetration deep into urban blocks, the dark hearts of which were useless for anything except courtyards.These were spaces carved out of the core of the city, crystalline pedestrian avenues creating new connections through the urban fabric, the diametric opposite of the out-of-town retail shed.Their layout, the mock street of small shops and often artisans, evoked the bazaar rather than the main street and it is here that contemporary malls fail.Where consumption has become globalised, interest disappears. The sameness of the big labels reduces risk for the retailer as it reduces interest for the public. We know what to expect, whether it is Westside or Westfield. The range of goods is as limited as the architectural expression.What makes a bazaar, a street market or a soukh fascinating is precisely the local variation, the sense of discovery that is lacking in the mall.Beyond that, there is the humanity, the haggling, the interaction with craftsman or trader, so that consumption becomes an act of civic and social engagement.The mall, by contrast, is Marx’s alienation personified. Yet there seems little doubt that it is the future. While Libeskind has done his Swiss Mall, Foreign Office Architects have designed another in Istanbul, home of the haggle and the bazaar.Intriguingly though, Foster and Partners, in their shopping centre for Abu Dhabi, have sought a return to the dark intimacy of the soukh.The mall has come to represent international capital, a more complete and adaptable symbol than Coca-Cola or McDonald’s.It embodies the pronouncements of politicians who tautologically implore us to forget the recession and go shopping – with what, exactly?At the same time, town centres continue to founder without the subsidies given to local retailers in, say France, where the butcher and baker are sacrosanct. What is needed is a supplement to the mall, an architecture that allows a more chaotic trade, a more genuinely urban set of transactions.If the mall is valued for bringing the glamour of western consumption to the rest of the world, then the west needs spaces to allow a re-engagement with the chaos and life of the marketplace, not the organic farmers or craft markets of the Anglo-Saxon world, but the hectic self-organisation of Lagos or Cairo, places that make the city live.Architects must be able to propose a framework in which to do this. That would be an architecture suited to a recession.I look forward to it."
493;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-11-17T22:01:41Z;Wall St falls on financial sector layoffs;;The biggest round of US job cuts for 15 years helped push Wall Street stocks lower on Monday as fears heightened over the scale of the difficulties facing financial institutions.Financials were among the biggest losers, down 6 per cent overall. Citigroup shed 6.6 per cent to $8.89 after unveiling plans to cut 52,000 jobs, which, according to consultants Challenger Gray & Christmas, was the biggest job cut announcement since the 60,000 by IBM in 1993.The bleak news, coupled with mounting signs of global recession, overshadowed any developments at the G20 meeting.Still, the market pared early losses as investors hunted for bargains in the energy, material and industrial sectors and briefly entered positive territory.Jeffrey Kleintop, strategist at LPL Financial, said there was a “tug of war” between poor economic developments and some signs of improvement in credit markets.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished down 2.6 per cent at 850.75 points after a sharp sell-off into the close, near the session’s lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.6 per cent at 8,273.58 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 2.3 per cent at 1,482.05.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, edged 4.2 per cent higher to 69.10, which continued to indicate elevated signs of distress.Elsewhere in financials, Bank of America slid 8.5 per cent to $15.03 after the group said it would increase its stake in China Construction Bank from 10.75 per cent to 19.1 per cent.Investors brushed aside a better-than-expected reading on industrial production – output rose 1.3 per cent last month, according to the Federal Reserve – as downward revisions to prior figures offset the rare positive news.RDQ Economics said the data were in any case primarily a result of “post-hurricane rebounds” and Bank of New York Mellon called the increase a “dead-cat bounce”.Official confirmation that the Japanese economy had entered recession increased concerns that the global downturn was spreading.Construction groups came under pressure after separate data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed manufacturing in New York contracted in November at the fastest pace since records began in 2001. Caterpillar lost 3.4 per cent to $35.70.General Motors jumped 5.7 per cent to $3.18 on mounting hopes Washington would grant aid to the car industry, although Ford eased 4.4 per cent to $1.72.In earnings news, Lowe’s and Target became the latest retailers to disclose sharp falls in third-quarter profit.Yet the figures were not quite as dire as analysts feared and shares in the former rose 4.2 per cent to $18.99.Target lost 4.1 per cent to $31.68 after management warned that the discounter’s gross margin performance might not be repeated in the fourth quarter.Also in the consumer sector, McDonald’s edged 0.9 per cent lower to $55.61 even after UBS upgraded its recommendation on the fast food group from “neutral” to “buy”. The bank said it was encouraged by the group’s “ongoing strong global trends amid a deteriorating global consumer environment”.In technology, Dell fell 3.4 per cent to $10.52 after Merrill Lynch downgraded its recommendation on the computer maker from “buy” to “neutral” ahead of results due this week, owing to lower than expected demand.Walt Disney lost 6.4 per cent to $19.74 after Soleil Securities cut its recommendation on the theme-park operator and media group from “buy” to “hold”.United Parcel Service was up 0.3 per cent at $53.28 even after the delivery group declined to forecast its peak day for holiday shipping, breaking with a long-standing practice in the industry. An uncertain economy made prediction too difficult, it said.Alcohol, tobacco and casino stocks received a boost after Merrill Lynch issued a bullish outlook on the so-called vice sectors.“Consumers do not kick their habits in tough economic times,” said Merrill.Still, brewer Molson Coors shed 2 per cent to $41.71.Energy was one of several sectors to find positive territory earlier in the session, but finished down 1.6 per cent overall as crude oil settled just above $55 a barrel.
494;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-11-10T22:32:55Z;Financials lead Wall St declines;;Wall Street stocks failed to cling onto early gains on Monday as China’s near $600bn economic stimulus package did little to assuage fears for the growth prospects of some of the biggest names in corporate America.The bankruptcy of a well-known retailer, concerns over the fate of shareholders in the nation’s automakers and drastic losses at AIG and Freddie Mac sent many stocks to multi-year lows.Financials led the declines, down 4.4 per cent overall. Goldman Sachs hit a five-year low, down 8.5 per cent to $71.21, after analysts at Barclays became the latest to forecast a fourth-quarter loss, citing in part its exposure to private equity.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 1.3 per cent at 919.21 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent at 8,870.54 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.9 per cent at 1,616.74.The market had risen as much as 2.3 per cent on the hope that the Chinese plan could lessen an expected global slump. Hard-hit construction, material and energy stocks were given a particular boost. New projects such as railways and airports as well as rebuilding earthquake-hit areas seemed likely to form a key plank of the Chinese government’s plan and the move sparked hopes of a floor in commodity prices.Also helping the market earlier, the Federal Reserve unveiled a revised $150bn rescue plan for AIG.The shares jumped 8.1 per cent to $2.28 in spite of third quarter figures from the struggling insurer that showed a net loss of $24.5bn .Stocks retreated as familiar concerns returned to the fore. Among the biggest, General Motors shed 23 per cent to $3.36 after Deutsche Bank set a price target of zero for the shares and recommended clients sell them.The bank said that while necessary for its survival, a government bail-out would do little to help shareholders. “Even if GM succeeds in averting a bankruptcy, we believe that the company’s future path is likely to be bankruptcy-like,” Deutsche analysts wrote, adding that “equity shareholders are unlikely to get anything”.Barclays also downgraded its recommendation on the stock and cut its price target from $4 to $1.Ford lost 4.5 per cent to $1.93 in spite of further signs that the pair, along with privately-held Chrysler, would secure government assistance. Credit Suisse called Ford’s cash burn “eye-popping” and also lowered its price target from $4 to $1.Best Buy rallied as much as 7.3 per cent on hopes the bankruptcy of smaller rival Circuit City would provide an opportunity for the electronics retailer to expand.Best Buy had previously said it could take over stores that struggling rivals closed. Yet the shares closed down 1.5 per cent to $25.21.Other retailers came under pressure after Barclays Capital issued a bearish outlook on a series of department stores after last week’s October sales figures.“We remain especially concerned about declining access to consumer credit and higher finance charges for consumer credit card balances,” the bank said in a report.Macy’s tumbled 9.3 per cent to $9.94 after Barclays cut its price target on the stock from $18 to $15.Starbucks fell 3.3 per cent to $10.20 and a further 2.8 per cent in after-hours trade, when the coffee chain disclosed fourth quarter profit slumped 97 per cent, hurt by the cost of closing underperforming stores.Earlier, UBS trimmed its forecasts and said that “new smoothies did not seem to drive significant sales”.Defensive names were among the biggest winners. Among them, upbeat like-for-like sales figures from McDonald’s lifted the burger chain 1.8 per cent to $56.48, and gave the fast food sector a boost.Delivery stocks United Parcel Service and Fedex rose after rival Deutsche Post unveiled plans to scrap domestic express services in the US.UPS and Fedex climbed 3.2 per cent to $53.60 and 2.7 per cent to $66.29 respectively, as the move is expected to allow the dominant US duo to take yet more market share.Dish Network slid 14.7 per cent to $13.24 after the satellite television group said quarterly profits dropped more than half. DIRECTV Group, its larger rival with which communications group AT&T has struck a deal to replace Dish in providing bundled deals, gained 1.1 per cent to $22.17.
495;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-11-05T20:28:41Z;Let’s meet when it’s over;;"It is here. The recession that many hoped would never come, or prayed they would not have to deal with, has arrived. Others can carry on debating how and why it has happened. Business leaders will want to know what they need to do now.The usual cycle of responses to a huge shock or upset – denial, anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance – is of limited use. Cut straight to acceptance, and then action. But what kind?In downturns, it is extraordinary how quickly managers rediscover business virtues that appeared to have been forgotten in the good times. Today the cry is “preserve cash”. Cut unnecessary entertaining. End business class travel and five-star accommodation. Get out of the taxi and back on the bus.But few businesses shrink their way to success. So, even now, smart companies will be trying to plot a path back to profitability.In a new paper for the Boston Consulting Group, David Rhodes, Daniel Stelter and Shubh Saumya argue that well-run companies can be ready to make big, recession-combating structural changes only four to six weeks after beginning their analysis of the situation.Managers need to start by considering the worst-case scenarios. “Even for many still-healthy companies, a drop in sales of around 20 per cent is sufficient to turn profits into huge losses and to send cash flow deep into the red,” they write.Once the top team has grasped the possible severity of the situation, there are four priorities: “To protect the financial fundamentals, to identify ways to protect the existing business, to manage for the long term and optimise the relative valuation of the company.”If you do not already have one, produce a weekly report on your cash position, BCG says. To protect the existing business, consider your pricing points. In the 1930s companies innovated around cheaper product ranges. The McDonald’s $1 menu or Danone’s Eco-Pack yoghurt in France are current examples of this. General Electric first developed its financing business in the Depression, helping customers purchase refrigerators with credit.For the long term, BCG echoes the advice offered by Intel’s Andy Grove. Downturns are the best time to invest in research and development and product innovation, he used to say. Boldness now will help create new products that are ready for the market when it starts to recover.With asset prices so low, acquisitions should also be possible, at least for those companies with relatively healthy balance sheets. “It’s time to go shopping,” Caroline Firstbrook, Accenture’s European head of strategy consulting, told a recent “dealing with the downturn” seminar in London.Getting some of these core challenges right – pricing, products and M&A – is essential. But perhaps companies also need to grasp something more fundamental about the way the rules for business will change during and after this recession. Umair Haque, director of the Havas Media Lab, a consultancy, recently wrote a provocative article for Business Week magazine which declared that “traditional recession strategies are doomed to fail this time”.He argued that conventional business models – big industrial beasts pushing out more and more product – are doomed. He had Starbucks in his sights: “Starbucks tried to grow by selling us more junk we don’t need – music, mugs and mouse pads,” he wrote.“What do we need in the 21st century – not just as brain-dead consumers, but as global citizens?” Mr Haque continued. “We need opportunities to grow and amplify our capabilities. For Starbucks that might mean, instead of hawking mugs and chocolates, training baristas to teach classes in coffee-making, letting communities use Starbucks as a venue for local government, or, at the limit, training local suppliers from developing countries as baristas in developed ones. How cool would that be? Very.” (But how profitable? It is not quite so clear.)That critique may sound a little too flaky to business leaders who want quick wins now, simply to survive. For more practical ideas consider Adrian Slywotzky and Richard Wise’s sensibly titled book How to Grow When Markets Don’tThe authors have some simple suggestions that might just work. They ask a basic but important question: are all your customers really the same? On closer inspection you may have different customer segments lurking there that need to be served (and charged) differently. This offers the possibility of boosting revenues.Do you have any special (and lucrative) customer relationships? Perhaps you are adopting specific approaches with these customers that could be copied and profitably introduced elsewhere. And are you really charging the right price for some of your valuable goods and services? Maybe there is concealed value in a bundle of services that are currently being offered at one price. Budget airlines have found a large number of ways to charge more for goods and services which customers used to enjoy for free. It can be done.Finally, there is you, the boss. What about your own personal recession-beating strategy? Times like these will place enormous pressure on business leaders. Physical and mental health are valuable assets. You will need to be at your fittest if your leadership is not to suffer.Peter Shaw and Steve Wigzell, executive coaches at the Praesta consultancy, have written a guide for senior managers leading teams through tough trading conditions. Leaders should understand how closely their behaviour will be scrutinised. “As a leader, be conscious that everything about you gives a message to your organisation; not only your words, but your posture, facial expression, tone of voice and appearance,” they write.“The perception of your mood will spread like wildfire and will often become distorted through gossip. When one CEO asked his chairman what was the single most important thing he should be doing, the reply was: ‘Smile’.”Smiling will not be enough to steer your business through the next few months. And as the Praesta coaches point out, when you are highly visible to others keeping up a cheerful act is exhausting.The businesses that do make it through to calmer, post-downturn times will have basic balance sheet strength. They will stem all unnecessary outflows of cash. They will price their goods and services keenly, but also imaginatively. And they will continue to plan for the future, remembering that all downturns come to an end.Simple, really. What is everyone getting so worried about?"
496;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-10-29T01:32:33Z;Ackman to hit out at Target;;William Ackman, the activist investor, is launching a public campaign against the management of Target, as the “cheap chic” US discount retailer faces slowing consumer demand and an expected tough holiday season.Mr Ackman is to hold a public presentation in New York on Wednesday at which he is expected to lay out proposals for restructuring Target’s real estate holdings.His Pershing Square Capital Management group, which took almost 10 per cent of the retailer in December last year, said he would discuss “a potential transaction that …will build long-term value for Target Corporation and all of its stakeholders”.Target’s shares have fallen over 30 per cent since mid-September, while its sales have been trailing Wal-Mart, its main rival, reflecting its greater focus on discretionary fashion and home items.Target launched a strike on Mr Ackman’s proposals, by saying on Tuesday it had “serious concerns” with “various ideas for an alternative ownership structure” for its real estate proposed by Mr Ackman since May.The retailer, which operates almost 1,700 stores across the US, said it had evaluated the proposals with outside advisors.“Our analysis raised serious concerns on a number of important issues, which we have raised with Pershing Square,” it said in a statement.Mr Ackman is expected to propose that Target take steps to monetise its real estate assets.The retailer, in common with Wal-Mart, owns the majority of the land on which its stores and distribution centres stand, with less than 6 per cent of its properties currently under lease.He has previously conducted activist campaigns at McDonald’s, the fast food chain, and Wendy‘s, now part of Nelson Peltz’s Triarc group.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive officer, said Target “has a strong record of engagement and open dialogue with shareholders over many years”.The retailer had previously held discussions with Mr Ackman before its decision to sell half of its credit card portfolio for $3.6bn to JP Morgan Chase in May. In November last year, it announced a $10bn three-year share buy-back.In a statement, Pershing Square praised Target’s “thoughtful and constructive approach with shareholders”, which it said had been instrumental in its developing a potential transaction.Carol Levenson, retail analyst at Gimme Credit, a research firm, expressed surprise at the move in a note to clients, pointing to the potential risk borrowing against real estate assets could pose to Target’s high credit ratings.She argued that “fighting off activist shareholders would be a huge distraction for management at this crucial time of a very difficult year”.
497;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-10-28T04:06:48Z;Time to begin the bargain hunt;;I have some good news and some bad news for investors. First the bad news: I think the economic and psychological damage inflicted by the global financial crisis has been so severe that both the US and world economies are likely to be weak for a number of years, making it hard to imagine either corporate earnings or the multiples investors are willing to place on those earnings going up for quite some time.Thus, in spite of the devastation visited on equity markets over the past year, I would be shocked to see a sustained comeback in overall share prices over the next two to three years.Now for the good news. Based on the number of cheap stocks I am seeing – they are everywhere – I have never been more bullish in my investment career.With fear running rampant, some of the best businesses are priced today as if their earnings will never rise again, and many lesser businesses are priced as if they might go out of business entirely. While I profess no great insight into calling the bottom of the market, I have never felt greater certainty that with patience and perseverance I will be well rewarded by the stocks I own at current prices.Far more esteemed investors share my bullish views on stocks. Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett recently wrote: “Equities will almost certainly out­perform cash over the next decade, probably by a substantial degree. Today, my money and my mouth both say equities.”In a recent interview with the newsletter I co-edit, Value Investor Insight, pre-eminent value investor Seth Klarman of the Baupost Group made a compelling case for the increased value added from fundamental stock-picking in today’s market environment.“You could argue that for the past 10 or even 20 years, equities haven’t been allowed to get cheap,” he said. “When it appeared the market was really going down – in 1987, 1998, 2000 – the government tended to intervene to prop it up. One of the pernicious problems of doing that when things are about to get cheap is that it creates the illusion that there isn’t much downside risk, and also prevents the necessary creative destruction that happens when an asset gets incredibly cheap.“In the past 15 months we’re starting to see stocks trade at whatever price. There’s a much higher probability that fundamental value investors in this type of period will be able to add value with specific stock selection.”I think Mr Klarman is right and that there are a great number of exciting ideas to choose from. The most interesting opportunities fall into three broad categories, appropriate for investors with risk profiles from the most conservative to the most aggressive.For conservative investors, the stocks of some of the greatest businesses, with strong balance sheets and dominant competitive positions, are trading at their cheapest levels in years – due primarily to the overall market decline and weak economic conditions rather than any company-specific issues. In this category, funds I co-manage own Berkshire Hathaway, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, but the list of the best beaten-up blue chips today would also include Altria, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft.On average, these eight stocks have held up relatively well, falling just more than 25 per cent from their 52-week highs versus a more than 40 per cent drop for the S&P 500. But given the high quality of their businesses, these stocks should trade at closer to 18-20 times next year’s earnings estimates rather than the 12 times at which they trade as a group. And they pay an average dividend yield of 2.8 per cent.Berkshire Hathaway is our favourite blue-chip stock, in large part because we believe it benefits from the credit crunch. Its operating businesses will be negatively affected by the recession, but this should be more than offset over time by the investment opportunities Mr Buffett is taking advantage of to put Berkshire’s enormous cash hoard to work.So far this year, he has invested more than $50bn and he still has tens of billions of dollars of buying power remaining. It is likely his future deals will be struck on even more favourable terms, as those who need capital get more desperate. We estimate that Berkshire Hathaway is trading at least 30 per cent below its intrinsic value – and the few times in the past when we have seen the discount this large, the stock has risen quickly.Berkshire is a great example of letting someone else find bargains for you in this tumultuous time. We have also recently added a position in Leucadia National, a diversified company similar to Berkshire Hathaway that we have long admired but never owned because the stock was never cheap enough – until now.Leucadia is run by two of the savviest investors on the planet, Ian Cumming and Joe Steinberg, and its stock has outperformed Berkshire’s over the past 20 years. Leucadia shares have historically traded at about two times book value but, after a recent 60 per cent decline, can now be bought at less than book.For more adventurous investors looking to buy great companies in the most out-of-favour sectors such as financials and retailers, I recommend American Express and Target. Both stocks are down 50-60 per cent over the past year and trade near 11-year and five-year lows, respectively.Amex, which recently reported better-than-expected earnings, will no doubt suffer significant losses in its credit card business and will be hurt by weak consumer spending for some time, but one does not often have the chance to buy one of the world’s great businesses with excellent long-term growth opportunities at less than 10 times earnings.Target is a similarly superior business facing significant macro headwinds, which have crushed the stock to below 10 times this year’s earnings estimates (which the company recently reaffirmed). In September, Target’s same-store sales were down 3 per cent, yet total sales were up 2.5 per cent, a respectable showing given the environment.Target remains healthily profitable and is taking advantage of its weak share price to buy back stock –4 per cent of its outstanding shares per quarter over the past three quarters – which is exactly what we as investors would hope to see.More aggressive investors would be well served to search for bargains in the energy sector. Speculative excess had crept into prices of energy stocks as oil prices reached as high as $147 a barrel this summer, but now that excess of optimism appears to have been replaced by an excess of fear, as concerns over weak demand have caused energy prices to fall sharply.At the same time, leveraged, momentum-driven investors who were big holders of energy shares have panicked (or are being forced to sell due to margin calls), leading to a more dramatic decline in stock prices.Particularly attractive today, we believe, are natural gas processing and pipeline companies, which have limited commodity-price risk and pay out nearly all of their earnings in hefty dividends. Investors can buy them via publicly traded master limited partnerships such as Crosstex Energy and Atlas Pipeline Partners.Atlas, for example, at a recent $20.30, is priced to yield 16.5 per cent and we consider the dividend payout to be safe. We also see considerable upside in exploration and production company Contango Oil & Gas, which is more of a direct bet on natural gas prices. Recently trading at about $40, we believe the stock price already discounts much lower natural gas prices than today’s level.Last but not least, we consider two companies recently involved in corporate transactions, Wendy’s/Arby’s Group and EchoStar Corporation, to be trading at well below half their respective intrinsic values. Following its recent merger with Triarc Companies, Wendy’s is now being run by Nelson Peltz and his team, top operators and capital allocators who engineered a remarkable turnround at Arby’s and are a good bet to do the same with Wendy’s.EchoStar was spun out of satellite TV company Echo­Star Communications at the beginning of this year and is a collection of satellite technology and set-top box businesses run by legendary founder Charles Ergen. Today’s stock price is so depressed that it nearly equals the company’s cash and investments, meaning an investor is paying almost nothing for the company’s ample assets and cash flows.Successfully navigating today’s market takes a strong stomach, a realistically long investment horizon and a very discerning eye. Regardless of your tolerance for risk, however, the opportunities are out there.• Funds managed by Mr Tilson own Berkshire Hathaway, McDonald’s, Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola, Amex, Target, Crosstex Energy, Atlas Pipeline Partners, Leucadia National, Wendy’s and EchoStar Corporation.The writer is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight and co-founded the Value Investing Congress.

498;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-10-22T20:44:49Z;Wall St plunges on grim corporate outlook;;A fresh batch of grim earnings pushed US stocks to a new five-year low as concerns grew over the difficulties facing corporate America in the wake of banking sector turmoil.Company results – and, more importantly, their gloomy outlooks – across a wide range of sectors reinforced fears of a global, as well as domestic, recession. Energy and materials, down 10.4 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively, led the market slump.Down as much as 8.3 per cent at one point, the S&P 500 closed 6.1 per cent lower at 896.78, below the level reached earlier in the month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.7 per cent to 8,519.21 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost 4.8 per cent to 1,615.75.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index – known as Wall Street’s fear gauge – shot up 30.5 per cent to 69.32, which indicated signs of heightened stress. Andrew Wilkinson, market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said that traders had donned “tin helmets” as options for the index expired.AT&T and Boeing slid 7.6 per cent to $23.78 and 7.5 per cent to $42.91, respectively, after both were among several blue chip stocks to disclose worse-than-expected quarterly figures.Pharmaceuticals were hit after Merck also disclosed glum figures and downgraded its outlook. The Dow Component fell 6.5 per cent to $28.01 even after it unveiled plans to axe 12 per cent of its workforce, a move investors would normally welcome.Traditionally defensive stocks such as McDonald’s failed to escape the declines. Shares in the world’s largest restaurant group, which managed an increase in third-quarter profit, held on to gains for much of the day but closed down 1.7 per cent to $54.18. The consumer staples sector slid the least of all, but still finished 3.8 per cent lower.Energy was the biggest drag on the market, hurt by oil’s slide below $70 as well as negative earnings, and slumped 10.4 per cent overall. ConocoPhillips lost 9.1 per cent to $49.06 after the group disappointed with exploration and production forecasts as well as a reluctance to buy back its shares.Baker Hughes, down 22.1 per cent to $30.35, was one of the biggest drags on the S&P after the oilfield services group warned of a “less certain” outlook as energy prices continue to fall.“Markets are being dominated by the fears and nerves that have been dominating for the last few weeks,” said Ian Griffiths, dealer at CMC Markets. “Growth is the main fear as earnings season gets into full swing.”Materials were another big laggard, down 8.3 per cent overall, hurt by BHP Billiton’s production figures.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, whose disappointing figures helped push the market sharply lower in the previous session, tumbled another 17.8 per cent to $26.92.All 10 main economic sectors were firmly in the red, although some technology groups managed to find positive territory.Apple added 5.9 per cent to $96.87, after sales of the iPhone powered a surge in quarterly profit. Yahoo advanced 2.7 per cent to $12.39 on plans to cut at least 10 per cent of its staff after quarterly profit fell sharply.Broadcom jumped 6.5 per cent to $14.70 on the back of better-than-expected results from the mobile phone chipmaker. Texas Instruments, under pressure in the previous session, recovered as much as 2.6 per cent but closed down 3.4 per cent at $16.28.SanDisk sank 31.6 per cent to $10.09 after Samsung Electronics dropped its $5.9bn unsolicited bid for the memory card manufacturer.Amazon fell 0.5 per cent to $49.99, having lost as much as 4.6 per cent on concerns that results due after the bell would echo a glum update from Ebay.Financials held up relatively well for much of the session as money market rates for interbank lending eased further, but sold off sharply towards the close, down 7 per cent. Insurers sustained particularly heavy losses.Still, Wells Fargo lost 4.1 per cent to $31.30 after Wachovia posted a $23.9bn third-quarter loss, the biggest of any US lender during the credit crisis. Shares in the bank, being acquired by Wells Fargo, fell 6.2 per cent to $5.71.
499;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-10-22T18:49:31Z;McDonald’s says no fast food sales slowdown;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food chain, said on Wednesday that consumer demand for burgers and fries was proving resilient to economic weakness both in the US and internationally as it reported strong third-quarter results.Jim Skinner, chief executive, said McDonald’s was proving “recession resistant”, with sales growth continuing both in the US and in European markets that were beginning to see slower consumer spending.Globally, McDonald’s comparable store sales increased by 7.1 per cent during the quarter at its more than 30,000 locations, and the company said growth was continuing into October.As consumer spending slows in the US, self-service fast food restaurants have outperformed more expensive waiter-service “family restaurants” such as Applebee’s and Denny’s, whose customers have chosen to eat more at home. French restaurant and cafe owners have also been hit by growing bankruptcies this year.Ralph Alvarez, chief operating officer, said that in the US McDonald’s had apparently benefited as rising grocery prices narrowed the difference between its offerings and eating at home. “We believe [the price of] food at home has grown so much higher that it makes our category a better deal than…eating at home.”Mr Alvarez also said that the drop in US fuel prices was likely to benefit the company by easing some of the current pressures on its customers discretionary spending.Comparable sales in the US were up 4.7 per cent during the quarter – the highest increase this year – while comparable sales in Europe were up 8.2 per cent.During a call with analysts, company executives stressed its continued commitment to value-focused dollar menu offerings which are seen as an important factor in attracting customers.Mr Alvarez said the company was likely to tweak the dollar menu following discussions with its franchise partners, who have found the dollar menu increasingly difficult to maintain amid rising food costs.“We know how important it is to maintain the value relationship with our customers today,” he said.Mr Alvarez said that the turmoil in the credit markets had also had no significant impact on its drive to refranchise restaurants in the UK and Germany.“Those deals are on plan …It takes a little bit longer to get the credit and it is a little more expensive, as you would expect, but the access is there,” he said. Overall revenues were up 6.2 per cent at $6.27bn during the quarter. Earnings rose 11 per cent to $1.19bn, or $1.05 per diluted share, beating Wall Street’s expectations.
500;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-09-09T21:53:44Z;S&P 500 plunges in worst day this year;;American International Group led the fall-out from deepening uncertainty over Lehman Brothers’ ability to strengthen its balance sheet, amid fears it too could struggle to raise fresh capital if so required.The world’s biggest insurer, which has heavy exposure to the mortgage markets, suffered more than $12bn in writedowns and credit losses in the last quarter. The shares dropped 19.3 per cent to $18.37.The financial sector dragged the S&P 500 to its biggest loss for the year as concerns grew over asset sales ahead of banks’ third-quarter earnings season.Washington Mutual – also exposed to the mortgage market – sank 19.9 per cent to $3.30, a day after the bank was put under special regulatory supervision and ousted its chief executive. Excluding Lehman, it was the biggest laggard on the S&P 500.Wachovia, among the biggest gainers in the previous session, tumbled 14.5 per cent to $16.24 on Tuesday after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “underperform” and its price target from $18 to $16, due in part to expected higher credit losses.Goldman Sachs slid 4.8 per cent to $161.67 after analysts at Ladenburg Thalmann cut their profit forecast.Visa which along with Chinatrust Financial will replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the Dow Jones Financial Services Titans index, lost 3.7 per cent at $67.49.The wider market reversed Monday’s gains as initial relief faded over the government bail-out of the mortgage guarantors.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index – a measure of investor anxiety of future volatility – reached its highest level since the credit facility for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was announced and oil reached its peak in mid-July.By the close, the S&P 500 had fallen 3.4 per cent to 1,224.51, within sight of the closing low for the year hit in mid-July, led by an overall financial sector decline of 6.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4 per cent to 11,230.73. The Nasdaq was 2.6 per cent lower at 2,209.81.A steeper-than-expected drop in pending home sales also weighed on sentiment, prompting growing worries of a worsening housing slump.The National Association of Realtors index of pending home resales fell 3.2 per cent in July after rising 5.8 per cent the previous month.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse downgraded four homebuilders – Toll Brothers, Pulte Homes, DR Horton and KB Home – from “outperform” to “neutral”. The shares fell 8.4 per cent to $24.26, 8.9 per cent to $14.77, 9.1 per cent to $12.83 and 9 per cent to $21.42, respectively.Another fall in oil prices hit the energy sector as US crude fell more than $3 a barrel after Opec’s meeting in Vienna.The declines were led by Massey Energy, Noble Energy, Valero Energy and National Oilwell Varco, which fell 19.4 per cent at $38.90, 12 per cent at $57.14, 11.8 per cent at $30.51 and 11.5 per cent at $52.92.Material companies also suffered, hit by wider commodity price declines. Nucor and US Steel dropped 9.7 per cent at $42.15, and 13 per cent at $93.69, respectively. AK Steel dropped 16.2 per cent to $33.72 after hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners, its largest shareholder, offloaded 3.1m shares.Amid the gloom, there was the odd bright spot. Oil’s continued retreat afforded at least some comfort to consumer stocks. Sears and Fortune Brands, for example, put on 0.9 per cent to $92.72 and 0.7 per cent to $61.65, respectively.McDonald’s rose 1.2 per cent at $63.19 after a positive August sales update from the fast-food chain.Hewlett-Packard edged up 0.6 per cent to $46.01 after Sanford C. Bernstein raised its recommendation on the world’s largest PC manufacturer from “market perform” to “outperform”.However, that failed to lift technology stocks more generally – which have been badly hit in recent sessions – into positive territory. Dell fell 4.3 per cent to $19.30 even after it emerged that founder Michael Dell bought $100m of stock in the computer manufacturer last week.Meanwhile, UAL, parent of United Airlines, continued to suffer losses after a false report surfaced on the internet on Tuesday that the carrier had returned to bankruptcy. Its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $10.60.
501;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Financials lead Wall Street down;;Financial stocks led US equity markets down for a second session on Wednesday while some mixed results and an uptick in the oil price also weighed on investor sentiment.In the financial sector, another round of analyst downgrades took their toll. Citigroup cut its full-year 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates for JPMorgan, among others, while Merrill Lynch downgraded the shares of Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.JPMorgan shares fell 2.7 per cent to $36.91, Lehman dropped 4 per cent to $15.57, while Goldman gave up 1.4 per cent to $164.90 and Morgan dropped 5.5 per cent to $40.15.On Wednesday, the financial sector slid 3 per cent with Bank of America and Citigroup coming under selling pressure. The pair lost 7.2 per cent to $28.86 and 3.9 per cent to $17.81 respectively.“We continue to believe that investors are significantly underestimating both the scope and the extent of the credit bubble and the consequences of its subsequent deflation,” said Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch.“The problems in the financial sector appear to us to be far from over, and we are sceptical that trying to bottom-fish will prove to be profitable.”Observers suggested that the sector might remain under pressure in the short term after the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed a rule limiting certain types of short-selling in a handful of stocks to expire on Tuesday.In earnings news, Deere, the maker of farm equipment, said third-quarter profits rose 7.1 per cent to $575.2m thanks to strong demand for tractors and combines.But the results missed analysts estimates and the shares fell 3.2 per cent to $67.10. The news dragged on peers. Caterpillar dipped 2.8 per cent to $69.83, Boeing fell 2.5 per cent to $64.26 and the industrial sector as a whole declined 0.8 per cent.There was better news from the technology sector.Applied Materials, the maker of semiconductor machinery, projected that orders would increase between 5-10 per cent in the fourth quarter. That was better than expected and the shares rose 4.7 per cent to $19.33.Meanwhile, Nvidia, the maker of computer graphics chips, jumped 10.7 per cent to $12.26 after the company said it would buy back an additional $1bn of shares, bringing the projected total repurchase to about 44 per cent of all outstanding shares.Equity markets pared early losses but by the close, seven of the 10 leading industry groups were still in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent to 1,285.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.9 per cent to 11,532.96, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1 per cent to 2,428.62.Consumer-facing stocks were in focus as oil prices ticked more than $3 a barrel higher, a number of retailers reported disappointing results and new data showed weak retail sales in July.Liz Claiborne, the women’s apparel retailer, was among the biggest fallers after it reported a substantial second-quarter loss and lowered its full year forecast. The shares slid 11.6 per cent to $13.18.Retailers and the broader consumer discretionary sector also took some direction from a Commerce Department report on July retail sales. The survey showed that sales fell 0.1 per cent last month. That is the first headline dip in five months and will be seen as evidence that the impact of the stimulus cheques is waning.McDonald’s fell 1.8 per cent to $62.78 and Wal-Mart Stores lost 1.9 per cent to $57.88 while the consumer discretionary and staples sectors gave up 1.6 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively.Energy and material stocks were among the few consistent gainers throughout the day. Energy added 3.4 per cent, snapping a four-day losing streak, and materials climbed 2.4 per cent as heavily sold coal and metals stocks rebounded.Peabody Energy and Massey Energy rose 8.3 per cent to $58.85 and 7.8 per cent to $61 respectively while US Steel and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 6.2 per cent to $137.92 and 5.8 per cent to $88.50 respectively.Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&P Equity Research, upgraded the energy sector to “overweight” arguing that “from a technical perspective, S&P believes the correction in oil prices from the recent high of $147 to below $115 is largely over.”
502;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-08-10T15:54:30Z;Brands act local to woo 1bn Chinese;;"In preparing to host the Olympic Games, the Chinese have had to embrace western standards to meet the promises made to the International Olympic Committee. Many factories have now been shuttered, to reduce pollution and improve air quality in Beijing. Legions of Chinese soldiers have cleared infestations of algae from the coastal locations of yachting races. Beijing taxi drivers have been ordered not to spit, in deference to visiting tourists.The deadline of the Games gave government officials an action-forcing event to accelerate the modernisation of Chinese society. World-class architectural design and construction standards have guided the building of Olympic venues. Airports, highways and other infrastructure have been upgraded, not only in Beijing but in all the cities where Olympic events will be held. The Olympics have long been seen as China’s global coming-out party. Chinese pride and ambition demand that they be the best ever, no matter what the cost, and that Chinese athletes win more medals than those from any other country.Three months ago, China’s investment looked to be at risk. The litany of criticisms andpratfalls seemed endless: Chinese government policy toward Tibet and Darfur; human rights concerns, from restrictions on journalists to arbitrary land expropriations; lead paint in Mattel toys; and rampant corruption despite the occasional execution. The word “boycott” was in the air, and the Olympic torch was attacked repeatedly, from Paris to San Francisco, on its progress around the globe.All that is now a distant memory, as it should be. The IOC remained stalwart. The sponsors, from Coca-Cola (above) to Adidas, hung tough. And, once the torch arrived in China, there was no more nonsense. Because it is and should be all about the athletes. So what if the Chinese government wants to show off how far the country has come in 30 years? It is, to say the least, one of the greatest economic turnrounds in human history.But when the athletes have gone home, and the polluting power plants come back on line, what will remain beyond the memories and good impressions?The answer is: brands. The year 2008 will not merely be the year of the Olympics. It will be the year of brands. Not only “Brand China” is being promoted on the world stage, but the commercial brands that are Olympic sponsors are driving home their advantage in the domestic Chinese market.The Chinese are already in love with brands. How can you stand out in a nation of 1.3bn with high population mobility? Young Chinese are known by the brands they can afford and the brands they display. Via fashion accessories, mobile phones and now cars, brand choices are stratifying a hitherto communist society. The billions of daily purchases of trusted brand names are an increasing part of the social glue that holds Chinese society together.From Coca-Cola to McDonald’s, from Visa to Samsung, a record 63 companies have paid the IOC more money than ever for their category exclusive sponsorship rights. And given the size and growth of the Chinese economy, plus the undercurrent of concern about China in the west, these sponsors have allocated more of their global Olympics budgets than ever to marketing their brands in the host nation.The Chinese are being subjected to a deluge of advertising by western multinationals seeking to expand their geographic reach beyond the big cities to the outlying provinces. Olympics-related advertising by these companies could exceed $6bn. Most of this advertising is not directly promoting brand features and attributes. Rather, it aims to wrap the western brand in the cloak of Chinese nationalism.From Volkswagen’s “honk for China” campaign to Pepsi’s limited edition of red-coloured cans accompanying the slogan “Go red for China”, western brands are taking the “act local” mantra to a new extreme. Few of them are implementing a unified global campaign for this Olympics. Instead, they are typically running two campaigns – one for China and another for the rest of the world.The same applies to Chinese companies such as Lenovo and Haier, which are seeking to make the most of their Olympics sponsorship to enhance their global stature.Lenovo, which acquired IBM’s personal computer business three years ago, has invested about $100m as the first Chinese company to become a global sponsor of the Olympics. Through doing so, Lenovo expects to increase its brand reputation and market share in China as much as in the rest of the world.But where will this vast consumption of brands lead? Choice is good. Engaging with brands is fun. Media diversity, fuelled by advertising, is welcome. But one cannot help wondering whether too many Chinese are consumers first and citizens second. The passion for consumption, enjoying the material fruits of a growing economy, risks becoming the convenient narcotic that postpones rather than advances political freedom.The writer is senior associate dean at Harvard Business School and co-author of Greater Good: How Good Marketing Makes For Better Democracy"
503;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-08-08T20:41:00Z;US stocks rally as oil prices fall;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Friday, and made their first consecutive weekly gains since May, after a dip in oil prices offset weak results and a dividend cut from Fannie Mae, the embattled mortgage agency.Crude oil fell more than $4 a barrel to a three-month low on Friday, taking its tally for the week to a 5.7 per cent decline.Oil-sensitive stocks rallied strongly on the news. General Motors advanced 2.9 per cent to $10.03 and Ford rose 7.6 per cent to $5.23. Retailers Macy’s and JC Penney climbed 9.5 per cent to $20.73 and 6.6 per cent to $35.75 respectively. An index of airline stocks added 8.2 per cent and the consumer staples and discretionary sectors advanced 2.3 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively.McDonald’s added to the positive momentum. The restaurant company posted July sales that rose significantly more than analysts estimated thanks to a strong performance in Europe. The shares climbed 6.2 per cent to $65.67 and a 43-year high.The industrial sector also made some notable headway, climbing 3.3 per cent. UPS rallied 3.8 per cent to $65.65 while General Electric rose 3.8 per cent to $29.64.Financials were in focus after Fannie Mae, the biggest US mortgage-finance agency, reported a wider- than-expected loss of $2.3bn – its fourth quarterly loss in a row. Earlier in the week, fellow government-sponsored entity Freddie Mac reported a loss that was three times wider than analysts anticipated, prompting concerns that the company would have to raise fresh capital.Fannie fell 9.1 per cent to $9.05 while Freddie rose 0.2 per cent to $5.90 on Friday. The pair are down 23.4 per cent and 26.1 per cent over the week.Separately, MBIA, the beleaguered bond insurer, posted a $1.7bn profit in second-quarter net income thanks to an accounting change. MBIA shares, which have lost more than 90 per cent of their value in the last year, added 3.5 per cent to $8.57. Ambac Financial Group, a peer that reported a $5.2bn gain on accounting changes on Wednesday, fell 5.7 per cent to $4.33.The financial sector focused on the positive and rose 3.5 per cent, turning weekly losses into a 1 per cent gain.Nine of the 10 leading industry groups closed ahead, helping the benchmark S&P 500 index climb 2.4 per cent to 1,296.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.7 per cent to 11,734.32 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.5 per cent to 2,414.1.Over the week, the S&P 500 climbed 2.9 per cent for its biggest gain since April. A rapid decline in oil prices, a swathe of earnings reports that were for the most part positive and a decision by the Federal Reserve to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 per cent, all played a part. The Dow rose 3.6 per cent over the week while the Nasdaq gained 4.4 per cent.The sector rallied 6 per cent over the week, after Cisco reported some solid earnings and analysts upgraded some key semiconductor companies.Cisco rose 10.3 per cent to $24.25 during the week, while Intel added 8.4 per cent to $24.23 and Sun Microsystems rallied 9.8 per cent to $10.25.Over the week consumer discretionary and staples stocks were also solid performers, making gains of 7.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively as the headwinds of rising commodity prices abated.Materials and energy stocks were the laggards over the week, falling 2 per cent and 4 per cent as commodity prices slipped back. The two sectors, which were the best performers in the first half of the year, are among the worst performers in the second half to date.The Olympics kicked off on Friday and that could be a positive for Nike, the athletic goods company.According to Bloomberg data, during the last six summer games, Nike shares have gained an average of 8.7 per cent. Nike shares rose 3.5 per cent to $62.95 on Friday.
504;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Le Big Mac;;Hamburger aficionados in Europe are still lovin’ the Golden Arches. A healthy appetite in the region for McDonald’s burgers helped the fast food chain increase global like-for-like sales by 6.1 per cent in the second quarter. Europe, McDonald’s largest region by revenues, is easily outpacing the more sluggish US.Will the old world keep gorging at such a rate? Overseas earnings have flattered headline figures as the dollar has weakened. Currency effects accounted for $0.07 of the second quarter’s $1.04 earnings per share. In a bid to keep up momentum, the company is set to spend $800m, a third more than last year, sprucing up existing outlets in Europe and opening new ones.An economic slowdown in Europe presents a possible headwind. But in this regard, McDonald’s experience in the US is, thus far, reassuring. Certainly, McDonald’s is having to work harder at home. Comparable sales dipped into negative territory in March, but recovered in the second quarter helped by new product launches. Value-for-money choices, like the Dollar Menu, and McDonald’s expansive network mean cost-conscious consumers have a nearby option to eat out.McDonald’s is supporting the top line by absorbing some of the impact of more expensive commodities. The chain’s prices in the US rose 4.2 per cent in the second quarter, less than the industry-wide cost of eating out. That food and paper expenses increased only slightly year-on-year in company-operated outlets gives some credence to McDonald’s claim that it can use its bulk in negotiating with suppliers. Cost pressures, though, remain strong. The company now expects prices of beef, chicken and cheese to increase much faster than previously thought. In such a stagflationary environment, McDonald’s can only hope more people on both sides of the Atlantic resort to comfort eating.Post and read comments on this LexLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

505;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-07-23T22:17:47Z;McDonald’s gets lift from overseas business;;McDonald’s posted strong second-quarter profit growth on Wednesday, but said that sharp spikes in the price of beef, chicken and cheese would force it to re-evaluate its pricing strategies.The world’s largest restaurant group said its strongest growth came outside the US market, with global same-store sales rising 6.15 per cent compared with 3.4 per cent in the US. Revenue rose 4 per cent to $6.08bn, beating analysts’ estimate of $5.92bn, according to Thomson Financial.The company said it expected beef prices to rise 9 per cent this year, while cheese prices could rise 21 per cent in the US – well above earlier projections of 14 per cent. Ralph Alvarez, McDonald’s chief operating officer, said the group would likely make changes to its popular Dollar Menu by next year. “We’ve got to make sure we’re pricing smart, not just pricing low,” he said on a conference call.UBS analysts said McDonald’s contained rising food costs “far better than peers”, and Deutsche Bank said its margins had increased 60 basis points. In June, the Financial Times reported that McDonald’s had hired the consultancy group Revenue Management Solutions to advise the company on increasing prices at UK stores. The fall of the dollar rewarded overseas growth, boosting the dollar value of each European sale.“We’re operating from a position of strength with double-digit operating income growth in Europe and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa and solid quarterly results in the US,” chief executive Jim Skinner said in a statement.The restaurant company reported second quarter earnings in continuing operations of $1.19bn, or 94 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $711m, or 60 cents a share. Analysts had expected per share earnings of 86 cents. Accounting for earnings from the sale of the company’s state in Pret A Manger, earnings were $1.04 cents a share.Revenue rose 4 per cent to $6.08bn, beating analysts’ estimate of $5.92bn, according to Thomson Financial.The company also reported growth of 3.8 per cent in June US same-store sales, as some analysts remain concerned about the long-term effect of falling consumer spending.
506;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-07-23T21:39:09Z;Wall Street advances as oil prices drop;;US stocks advanced for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices dropped sharply and lawmakers moved closer to a deal on legislation to backstop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Crude oil prices fell back for a second day, slipping below $125 a barrel and helping to offset some mixed earnings reports from consumer-oriented companies.In the consumer discretionary sector, Whirlpool shares added 12.5 per cent to $76.69 after the appliance maker said second-quarter profits had fallen less than expected. The sector advanced 2 per cent.In the consumer staples sector, Costco Wholesale said earnings would be “well below” Wall Street expectations as it had absorbed some recent hikes in energy prices to attract customers. Costco fell 11.9 per cent to $63.43. Wal-Mart Stores slid 1.6 per cent to $58.09 while Kroger lost 2.3 per cent to $28.18.There was some better news from PepsiCo and McDonald’s, which both beat analyst estimates for their quarterly results.PepsiCo rose 2.3 per cent to $67.72 but McDonald’s slipped 0.8 per cent to $59.66. The sector rose 0.5 per cent.In industrials, Boeing, the aerospace group and CH Robinson, the logistics provider, both undershot Wall Street expectations while Norfolk Southern, the railway company, outperformed.Boeing and CH Robinson fell 3.7 per cent to $66.72 and 15.6 per cent to $49.56, respectively. Norfolk, however, added 6.5 per cent to $69.96, helping the industrial sector advance 1.1 per cent.Seven of the 10 leading industry groups closed in the black, nudging the benchmark S&P 500 up 0.4 per cent at 1,282.12 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent higher at 11,632.38 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent ahead at 2,325.88 points.On Tuesday, stocks overturned early losses to surge in late trading after oil fell back and the new chief executive of Wachovia announced a turnround plan, prompting a powerful rally in banks.Financials climbed for a second session on Wednesdsay as lawmakers prepared to vote on a bill that would authorise the Treasury secretary to inject capital into the two government-sponsored entities if needed with only limited restrictions as part of a broader package to address the housing crisis.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, said: “The power of [the] blank cheque is huge in terms of restoring confidence in the major players of the mortgage market – Fannie and Freddie. Just having that there is psychologically very important to the market.”Fannie Mae climbed 11.9 per cent to $15 and Freddie Mac added 11.3 per cent to $10.80. The financial sector added as much as 4.6 per cent before paring gains to 1.9 per cent.Amid the positive sentiment, investors could not overlook poor results from Washington Mutual. The largest US savings and loans company, said it had lost $3.33bn in the second quarter, significantly more than forecast.Washington Mutual shares, which have lost about 88 per cent of their value in the past year, slumped 20.1 per cent to $4.65.The technology sector was also in focus. Overnight, Yahoo said second-quarter profits dropped 18 per cent to $131.2m on higher development costs and declining advertising spending.The company also reduced its full-year revenue forecast and the shares dropped 4.7 per cent to $20.39.EMC, the maker of storage-computers, was the leading sector gainer, however, surging 13.7per cent to $14.17 after it posted estimate-beating second-quarter profits and boosted its 2008 sales target. The technology sector advanced 1.4 per cent.Telecom stocks were the best performers on Wednesday. AT&T, the telephone carrier, said second-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent to $3.77bn, helping the shares to advance 3.9 per cent to $33.06 and the sector to add 3.4 per cent - its biggest one day gain since late January.As oil prices dropped, energy stocks were again a weak spot in spite of some solid earnings from ConocoPhillips. The third-largest US oil producer posted a record $5.44bn second-quarter profit thanks to soaring gas and oil prices. Still, investors were not satisfied and the shares fell 2.9 per cent to $81.83. The sector dipped 3.8 per cent
507;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-07-07T23:43:03Z;Staff want more than just their pay packet;;A couple of decades ago, workplace responsibility for many companies went little further than paying adequate salaries and adhering to corporate health and safety policies. Today, this responsibility has expanded to encompass issues such as fostering ethnic and gender diversity, creating opportunities for flexible working, promoting healthy eating and delivering training programmes to help workers continue to develop both professionally and personally.The health of workers is a growing area of focus for companies. At Foyle Foods, a health and wellbeing programme as well as improvements in health and safety procedures have not only fulfilled the company’s responsibilities to its workforce. It has delivered business benefits too, including a £100,000 ($197,000) reduction from the previous year in its employers’ liability insurance premium.In addition, accidents and near accidents have been cut by more than 43 per cent and, by providing health screening and medicals as well as health and lifestyle advice to employees and their families, the company has seen an 84 per cent fall in absenteeism as a result of illness.For EDF Energy, health is also high on the agenda. The company has introduced a number of programmes to tackle psychological ill health among its employees. Starting with a stress audit in 1996, what followed has been a series of referral processes, workshops and treatments programmes, with rehabilitation taking place in the workplace wherever possible.Benefits include a 14 per cent reduction of psychological ill health – whether caused by work or external factors – in three years, as well as a saving to the company of about £228,000 in improved productivity.Training and development is increasingly seen as one of the most important responsibilities of an employer towards its employees. In Wales, for example, Wiltan, a components manufacturer has a Skills for Life training programme, with an emphasis on the development that takes place beyond the workplace, extending the company’s responsibility into the local community.Tony Hawkhead, chief executive of Groundwork, the non-profit focused on regeneration, says that fostering skills in the communities in which they operate helps companies hire more staff locally, something particularly important for retailers and supermarkets.“For any company that needs people to arrive on time and work in shifts, the first question is, can people come to work reliably – and then can they be reliable workers,” he says. “If you can train local people, they are more likely to get to work on time every day simply because of their proximity.”Moreover, says Mr Hawkhead, investing in the community in this way gives companies another advantage. “There’s an incredible loyalty shown to companies that are committed to the community,” he says. “And the people who work for you are prepared to go that extra mile.”For Npower, the UK’s largest electricity supplier, the challenge has been to help employees keep up to speed as the company moves from heavily industrial operations towards being an organisation where service-based roles are increasingly important.Interestingly, successes and failures in this area can be seen within the same company. BAA Heathrow hit the headlines recently when insufficient staff training was among the factors blamed when tens of thousands of bags failed to travel with their owners and hundreds of flights were cancelled after the opening of Terminal 5 in March this year.However, when it comes to the retail side of airport operations, the company has successfully addressed a skills deficit. In 2004, after discovering that retailers at Heathrow were reporting difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff with the right skills, the company established its Retail Academy, serving the retail community at Heathrow.The programme appears to have paid off. In a recent survey, the company found that all employers polled valued the academy’s qualification programme, while 88 per cent belief that the programme meets their organisational needs.While BAA may have to work hard to counter the negative press it received during the opening of Terminal 5, McDonald’s has also had to take steps to improve its image since the term “McJob” entered popular parlance, even making it into the Oxford English dictionary as “an unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects”.The fast food chain responded by launching a number of programmes with an emphasis on expanding staff skills. Part of facilitating staff development has been to promote the kind of flexible working arrangements that give employees the time to embark on learning programmes and gain qualifications.And providing opportunities for personal development and flexible working helps companies recruit and retain the best staff, says Jack Constantinides, vice-president HR business partner for Monster for Europe West and Prague. He believes such programmes help staff feel more valued.“People are looking for more from their job than just a chunky pay package – including job satisfaction, career prospects, training, benefits and crucially work-life balance,” he says.The McDonald’s experience certainly seems to demonstrate the benefits of meeting employee expectations in these areas. Since putting its talent strategy in place, staff turnover has hit an all-time low, crew turnover has fallen by more than 20 per cent in the past two years and there has been a 33 per cent reduction in the number of new starters leaving within 90 days of joining the company.
508;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-07-02T16:44:32Z;Seoul struggles to defuse US beef protests;;South Korea’s prime minister on Wednesday attempted to allay public fears by buying 12kg of US sirloin steak. The well-publicised gesture took place as protests against US beef imports intensified to include Catholic priests, Buddhist monks and carworkers at Hyundai.The furore about US beef shipments that has hamstrung the new conservative government shows few signs of abating even after a deal between Seoul and Washington that led to US meat flying off the shelves this week.Han Seung-soo, the prime minister, and his family would eat the steak at his official residence, said a spokesman. “The prime minister’s office bought the meat to alleviate public worries about US beef,” he said.American beef is much cheaper than its domestically produced equivalent. The prime minister paid Won260,000 ($260, €158, £126), a fraction of the Won800,000 the same quantity of Korean meat would cost.Mr Han’s action mirrors that of John Gummer, the British agriculture minister who, with his four-year-old daughter, tucked into hamburgers in 1990 at the onset of the BSE, or “mad cow” disease, crisis.The 200kg of US beef that went on sale in Korea this week had been snapped up quickly, vendors reported.“My boss texted me this morning, saying: ‘Hey, let’s eat it while it’s cheap’,” said Kim Hak-hyun, a 41-year-old marketing employee buying beef in Seoul on Wednesday. “No one has died from eating American beef. Why should we be afraid?” he told Yonhap news.Restaurants, however, including the McDonald’s fast-food chain, loudly advertise that they serve only Korean or Australian beef, and big supermarkets have yet to stock US meat.South Korea, once the third-largest importer of US beef, refused imports when BSE broke out in the US in 2003. The Korean government announced in April it would allow all American beef, which had been cleared by the World Organisation for Animal Health, back into the country. Public outrage last month led Seoul to seek Washington’s agreement to restrict beef to that from cattle younger than 30 months, reckoned to be lower risk.The scale of protests has diminished but demonstrations are increasingly violent. In the last week, central Seoul became a riot zone as demonstrators attacked police with slingshots and clubs and police buses with iron pipes and hammers.A Catholic organisation joined the rallies as 10 priests began a hunger strike. They insisted protest should be peaceful. Buddhists plan protests tomorrow. At Hyundai Motor, 45,000 workers walked out for two hours on Wednesday. Hyundai said the strike could cost it Won30bn. “Let’s begin a march to oppose mad cows,” said the union website.

Goldman analysts said share prices were relatively inexpensive while high oil prices might boost earnings.The sector has massively outperformed the broader S&P 500, adding 8.3 per cent compared with a 7.3 per cent decline. ExxonMobil, Conoco-Phillips and Hess added 2.6 per cent to $89.07, 3.3 per cent to $95.24 and 2.9 per cent to $127.47 respectively.Those gains helped markets skim past news of record losses at Lehman Brothers and comments from Fed officials that higher interest rates might be needed to curb inflation.The KBW banking index set new multi-year lows, while the S&P 500 index of financials fell 2.3 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,361.77 points; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent at 12,280.32 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,459.46 points.On Friday the Dow Jones suffered its biggest one-day fall since February 2007 as equity markets were hit by surging oil prices and a jump in the unemployment rate that pointed to continued recession-like conditions in the US economy.Some analysts argued that this was an over-reaction and stocks seesawed between gains and losses in afternoon trading.There were bright spots. McDonald’s rose 4.1 per cent to $59.31 after the fast-food chain said it had made gains in May same-store sales due to strong international demand. That did not stop the wider sector from falling 0.1 per cent.New data that showed a surprise rise in pending home sales in April helped improve sentiment. According to the National Association of Realtors, the index of pending home re-sales rose 6.3 per cent to 88.2, the highest level in six months. That too had a limited impact and an index of homebuilding stocks slipped 0.9 per cent.Energy and materials stocks were leading gainers, up 2.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Alcoa rose 7.5 per cent to $42.17 after Barron’s said the aluminium producer could rise markedly in value to $60 a share if it were to become a takeover target, citing a Citigroup analyst. Monsanto rose 2 per cent to $138.45 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 2.2 per cent to $118.26.Banking sector travails curbed those gains. Lehman, the smallest of the leading investment banks, said it lost $2.8bn in the second quarter and that it would raise $6bn in new capital.Fitch, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Lehman, while its peer Moody’s lowered its ratings outlook for the brokerage. Lehman, which has lost more than half its value in the past year, fell 8.7 per cent to $29.48, striking a 52-week lows before recovering slightly. The news hit the financial sector, which is reeling from the protracted fall-out from the subprime mortgage crisis.Merrill Lynch fell 3.2 per cent to $37.76, JPMorgan lost 6.4 per cent to $37.51 and
Citigroup slid 2.3 per cent to $19.60. A UBS note suggesting Washington Mutual would suffer $21.7bn in mortgage losses through 2011 crushed the banks’ share price, while earnings downgrades for Fifth Third Bancorp and KeyCorp weighed on their stocks.WaMu slipped 17 per cent to $6.25, Fifth Third Bancorp edged up 0.2 per cent to $16.78 and KeyCorp fell 3.8 per cent to $16.65.In the past few weeks analysts have slashed earnings estimates for the financials sector with the result that according to Thomson Reuters the consensus estimate is for a 45 per cent decline in the second quarter.Technology shares slipped in spite of a positive note on the sector from Lehman.Apple led the fallers, off 2.2 per cent to $181.61 as investors took profits after the company unveiled a new and cheaper iPhone. Google slipped 1.6 per cent to $557.87 while Intel fell 1.8 per cent to $22.49.According to Thomson Reuters, tech is expected to achieve the second-highest earnings growth rate among leading industry sectors in the second quarter of 2008."
510;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;‘Mr Spud’ who built a fortune on frozen fries;;For better or worse, J.R. Simplot is credited with giving the world the deep-frozen French fry, providing lift-off for the fast-food industry and profoundly changing our eating habits. After researching ways to freeze potatoes without turning them to mush, the uneducated potato farmer became the biggest supplier to burgeoning outlets such as McDonald’s, Wendy’s and Burger King in the 1950s and 1960s. By investing his earnings in the 1980s in the early development of another type of chip, the microchips used to store memory in personal computers, he died a multibillionaire and, reputedly, the biggest private landowner in the US. Not bad for a man who left school at the age of 14 and started off in business by shooting wild horses to fatten up pigs.In his native Idaho, famed for the quality of its potatoes, “Jack” Simplot, who has died at the age of 99, was known as “Mr Spud”. That was on the vanity number plate of the otherwise unostentatious Lincoln sedan he drove until forced by age to downgrade to a golf cart. “Jack Simplot was to the potato what Henry Ford was to the automobile,” one Idaho newspaper eulogised.In addition to the first commercially produced frozen fries (the sales were aided by the spread of freezers and deep-freeze compartments), he launched the packeted instant mashed potato. The second world war did him no harm although he was already a millionaire when the US got involved. J.R. Simplot Co’s large potato-dehydrating plant near Caldwell, Idaho, won him a contract in 1942 to supply troops with dehydrated potatoes and dried onions. By the war’s end, Simplot had supplied 33m pounds of potatoes, at least a third of the troops’ intake of spuds.John Richard Simplot was born on January 4 1909 in a log cabin in Dubuque, Iowa, but his family moved west when he was two to start a homestead farm in Declo, Idaho, the state where Jack would spend the rest of his life and become its richest citizen. At 14, after his father forced him to milk the cows rather than attend a basketball game, he quit school and left home with four $20 gold coins, a gift from his mother.Blending the intuition of a good card player with a prodigious business brain, he grew potatoes on 40 acres of rented land, bought several hundred skinny hogs at $1 apiece and went out regularly to the desert to shoot horses in wild herds. He “jerked the hides off ’em”, sold each hide for $2 and boiled the meat with potato scraps to feed the pigs. When pork prices rose the next year, as he had foreseen, he sold his stock for $7,800. “That was like a million in those days,” he said years later. He could then focus on his first love: potatoes.At 19, after flipping a silver dollar with an alcoholic partner, Simplot found himself with a $250 new-fangled electric potato-sorter and, by 1940, had bought or built more than 30 potato ware- houses. The Great Depression af­ter 1929 made his potatoes almost as valuable as gold. Later, as a shrewd businessman and, in his own words a “dumb country far­mer” at heart, he saw the problems US farmers faced from the wartime shortage of fertilisers, so he built his own fertiliser plant, a line of business he expanded. He also saw the potential of frozen and canned foods, later moving into cattle farming, cattle feed and the purchase of timber land. In the late 1940s he bought one of his researchers – the chemist, Ray Dunlap – a state-of-the-art freezer to see if he could find a formula for freezing and reheating potatoes. In 1947 Dunlap presented a chopped-up spud that, frozen then reheated, the fussy Simplot could have sworn was freshly cooked. His company began churning out frozen French fries but they were slow to catch on and it was not until 1967, over a handshake, that Simplot made a breakthrough deal with Ray Kroc, the man intent on building McDonald’s into a national chain. For the next 40 years his company provided about half McDonald’s fries and Simplot sat on its board for the rest of his life.Like all risk-taking businessmen, he had failures, including a silver mine in Idaho and efforts to grow coconuts in Latin America. But he knew how to cut his losses. Even aged 71, his acumen shone through when he put $1m – a 40 per cent stake – into Micron Technology, a fledgling Idaho company, later an im­portant producer of D-Ram computer chips. The stake was worth $250m (£128m) when he died, part of his estimated $3.6bn fortune. To ens­ure Micron got off the ground, he reputedly lobbied his friend, President Ronald Reagan, to impose tariffs on foreign microchips.Simplot’s political clout may have come in handy. In the mid-1970s he was barred from commodities trading for six years after allegedly trying to manipulate potato futures and got away with making an undisclosed settlement and paying a $50,000 fine. In 1977 he and his company were separately fined after pleading “no contest” to federal charges of claiming false tax deductions and failing to report more than $1m in corporate income. In both cases, Simplot insisted: “I’ve never done anything wrong that I know of.”Despite his wealth, Simplot was anything but spendthrift. He preferred McDonald’s to fancy restaurants. According to friends, he wore the same pair of glasses for 30 years and would spend longer than anyone looking for his golf ball in the rough. His name was in the phone book in Boise, he usually answered it himself and he had a tendency to leave his car unlocked with the keys inside. He put his longevity down to not drinking or smoking.Simplot loved to ski, mostly at Idaho’s Sun Valley resort, where he was photographed with celebrities including Ernest Hemingway, and gave up only when his knees did, at the age of 89. In the words of the adventurer, Lowell Thomas: “As he goes banging down the Sawtooth Mountains on skis, you hear him singing and laughing a half-mile away.” He hunted ducks into his 90s and was seen at the age of 94, whooping with joy again, aboard his brand new WaveRunner jet ski.A lifelong atheist, he described religion as “hocus pocus” and once told Esquire magazine: “I got no religion in me …you’re dead, that’s the end of you.”Simplot retired as chairman in 1994. He is survived by his second wife, Esther Becker Simplot, and two sons and a daughter from his first marriage.
511;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-06-06T02:49:59Z;Uefa awaits sponsorship bonanza;;As European football fans prepare to descend on Austria and Switzerland for the start of Euro 2008 on Saturday, tournament sponsors will have one eye elsewhere – on the worldwide television audience.Uefa, European football’s governing body, can look forward to the tournament already content that it will be a financial success.Sponsors and broadcasters, mesmerised by the global fixation with the “beautiful game”, are providing revenues to Uefa of an expected €1.3bn ($2bn, £1bn) – nearly 35 per cent more than the €853m Uefa raised from the 2004 tournament in Portugal.The value of television and new media rights has risen more than 40 per cent and the amount sponsors such as Adidas, Canon, Carlsberg, Castrol, Mastercard, McDonald’s and JVC are forking out for the right to have their products linked to the 31-game tournament has risen by more than 50 per cent since Portugal 2004.James Leipnik of Canon said Euro 2008 represented “an excellent opportunity to reach a worldwide audience and associate Canon with the positive emotions of world class football”.Buoyed by the increasing commercial value of its annual Champions League tournament, Uefa adopted a more aggressive approach to television rights sales and conducted direct sales to broadcasters outside Europe. Seeking domestic broadcast competition, it awarded selling rights to SportFive, a marketing agency based in Hamburg, having previously sold television rights through the European Broadcasting Union.Its global television rights deals have been made with broadcasters such as PCCW in Asia, ESPN in North America and al-Jazeera in the Middle East and North Africa. With a wider audience bringing in more revenue, sponsors have been prepared to pay more.Broadcasters are obliged to provide simultaneous coverage on the internet, and highlights will be made available on mobile phones.Given that the championships will for the first time be screened in China and India, Phillippe le Floc’h, Uefa’s marketing and media rights director, is wary of estimating just how broad that TV audience will be.He recognises that interest in China may be tempered by the failure of England to qualify for the finals – English clubs attract many fans in China – and by 3am broadcasts for live matches.“We will have more countries watching it this time, over 200, in much more depth and with more ways for people to watch,” he said.After struggling to spur interest in the tournament even in Europe during the 1980s and early 1990s, Uefa has got its act together, says Mr Le Floc’h. “We are really where we should be.”Though cumulatively the 19 days of the Beijing Olympics will attract by far the biggest television audience of the year, Uefa can safely assume that as in 2004 the final of the European Championships will pull in the biggest single viewership in the world. Four years ago the final in Lisbon was watched by 279m people.Uefa will consider widening the format for future championships beyond the 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. The growth of football in eastern Europe opens up the prospect of a tournament comprising 20 or 24 teams, rather than the 16 taking part this time.But Drew Barrand of the Sport Industry Group, a consultancy, says Uefa has got this wrong before, changing the Champions League to include more teams and finding it did not work.“They would like to be able to expand the Euros, provided it doesn’t detract from the proposition for sponsors and fans,” he said.Mr le Floc’h hinted that an expanded format was likely. “There is so much audience fragmentation and the media is fighting for audience share,” he said. “But sport is one of the few things that can integrate communities together, and properties like us deliver certainties to broadcasters as far as audiences are concerned.”
512;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-05-08T20:36:56Z;Wall Street higher on retail sales;;US stocks posted modest gains on Thursday as investors responded to solid sales figures from Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, and encouraging data on retail sales and jobless claims.Leading market indices moved from positive to negative within a fairly narrow range, before closing higher.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 index was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,397.68 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher at 2,451.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 12,866.78.Analysts were looking for leading retail chains to report a 2.5 per cent gain in same-store sales in April. If stores hit the forecasts, it would mark the biggest monthly rise in same-store sales since November.Target said April same-store sales rose 3.1 per cent, missing forecasts for a rise of 4.5 per cent. The company said sales were weakest in regions getting hit the hardest by the housing market collapse. Its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $52.34.Costco reported an 8 per cent sales gain for the period, topping a forecast of a 6.1 per cent rise. But this figure was boosted by petrol sales, and shares in the company were down 1.2 per cent at $71.20.McDonald’s reported a 5 per cent rise in same-store global sales as the company cited menu variety and longer hours as drivers of growth. Shares in the fast-food chain gained 0.7 per cent to $59.77.In economic news, initial jobless claims fell to 365,000 last week, down from a revised 383,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said.Economists had expected the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time to come in at 375,000.Wholesale inventories, a measure of lag in demand relative to expectations, slipped 0.1 per cent in March, down from a revised 0.9 per cent increase in February, according to the Commerce Department. Economists had expected inventories to climb by 0.5 per cent.Stocks had fallen their largest amount in a month during the previous session after record high oil prices hurt consumer and transport stocks and financials tumbled on speculation that new regulations will force them to disclose further losses.Oil futures were steady near record highs. US crude rose 3 cents after closing at a record settlement of $123.53 a barrel.In other corporate developments, News Corp’s chief operating officer, Peter Chernin, told investors the company was not in talks with Microsoft or Yahoo about a combination involving its MySpace online unit. News Corp shares rose 2.5 per cent to $19.68.Investors were bracing themselves for what were expected to be a poor set of earnings from American International Group, due after the closing bell. The world’s largest insurer is set to post a second consecutive quarterly loss due to its exposure to the subprime mortgage market. AIG shares were down 2.1 per cent at $44.15.On the upside, shoe retailer Crocs reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue late on Wednesday and said that second quarter and full-year 2008 profit were on target to meet previous forecasts, despite slowing US retail trends. Shares in Crocs soared 14.5 per cent to $11.40.Unilever shares were up 5.8 per cent at $34.35 after the company reported a better-than-forecast 34 per cent rise in quarterly net income.Toyota said late on Wednesday that profit in the January-to-March period tumbled 28 per cent due to the rising yen and weak North American sales. Toyota’s US traded shares were 4 per cent lower at $100.56.Mortgage companies’ shares were also weaker. Fannie Mae fell 4.9 per cent to $27.63 while Freddie Mac was 2.2 per cent lower at $25.43.Best Buy shares fell 3.2 per cent to $42.05 after the company said it would form a joint venture with Carphone Warehouse to establish a consumer electronics retail presence in Europe.Among other movers, Metal, mining and oil services stocks rose. Dow components Alcoa, Chevron and ExxonMobil all gained.Shares in Fortress Investment Group, the publicly traded alternative investment business, slid by 6.3 per cent to $13.65 on the New York Stock Exchange after it reported a $69m loss in the first quarter.
513;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-04-28T18:52:59Z;How to do guilt-free business with Beijing;;China has a habit of making western companies wriggle. There was Google – slogan: “Don’t be evil” – squirming over its decision to self-censor its Chinese website.There was Rupert Murdoch telling this newspaper last year that he had dropped the BBC from his Star TV service for purely commercial reasons, when anyone with an uncensored internet connection could read his 1994 admission that he had done it to please the Chinese government.Even before they start, this year’s Beijing Olympics are demanding more corporate agility than a gymnast’s triple somersault. Neville Isdell, Coca-Cola’s chief executive, protested on this page this month that its sponsorship of the games did not mean it had abandoned the people of Darfur.With the Olympic torch under assault, backers of the games are facing protests over China’s repression of dissent, as well as its role in Tibet and Sudan. For the games’ sponsors – who also include General Electric, McDonald’s and Johnson & Johnson – it could be a sticky summer.But companies need to think beyond the Olympics. China is too big a market for business to ignore – and the hope that hosting the Olympics would turn it into a more liberal place looks like being confounded.China did announce on Friday that it would meet representatives of the Dalai Lama, which indicates that it is not impervious to pressure. But Amnesty International reports that the imminence of the Olympics is making life harder for the government’s domestic opponents, not easier. Yang Chunlin, a land rights activist, was last month imprisoned for five years for spearheading a petition under the slogan: “We don’t want the Olympics, we want human rights.”Many companies involved in China regard the antipathy towards them as unfair, and it often is, although by no means always. As an illiberal China looks like being with us for some time, it is worth thinking about what companies should and should not do there – or anywhere else with a poor human rights record.The first point is that the absence of human rights is always and everywhere a government failure. In a democratic society, with uncorrupt judges and a free press, companies need do no more than obey the law. When they pollute, or treat local communities badly, a lively civil society can campaign for the law to be changed. Companies that prefer to pre-empt that can do so.It is where democratic government fails, or has never existed, that corporate life becomes especially complicated. How should companies behave in these places? The simplest policy is to stay away, but that rarely benefits the locals and since business began it has gone where the money is. More important is to know where to draw the line, to decide what the company will and will not do.It is not as if companies have not been thinking about this. There is a pile of reports on the subject, some business-led, some backed by the United Nations. There is the work of the Business Leaders Initiative on Human Rights, supported by companies such as ABB, Gap and Novartis. There is the International Business Leaders Forum, backed by Prince Charles. There are the UN’s “Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights”, the UN Global Compact and a report by John Ruggie, the UN secretary-general’s special representative on business and human rights.What all the reports attempt to do, rightly, is distinguish between doing business and doing the regime’s dirty business. The latter they call “complicity”, defined by the UN Global Compact as companies either authorising or ignoring human rights abuses committed by their own subsidiaries or providing assistance to others who damage human rights. “The participation of the company need not actually cause the abuse. Rather the company’s assistance or encouragement has to be to a degree that, without such participation, the abuses most probably would not have occurred to the same extent or in the same way.”Selling Coke in China may damage teeth and waistlines but does not amount to complicity in human rights abuse. What about censoring websites or satellite broadcasting services? The Chinese government would not have allowed the services with their unfettered content, so the companies involved did not make things worse – but they did associate themselves with a repressive regime’s censorship, thereby damaging their own reputations as unbiased, reliable information providers.Yahoo, which helped identify the online activities of two Chinese dissidents, for which they were jailed and for which the company last year apologised, provides an instance of complicity. The line is not always as clear as this, but it is always worth asking: if I do this, am I one day going to find myself claiming I didn’t?Send your comments to michael.skapinker@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/skapinker
514;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Royal couturier hired in ‘McJob’ rebranding;;McDonald’s has hired Princess Diana’s couturier to design staff uniforms as the latest step in the burger chain’s attempt to redefine the “McJob” and rebrand itself as a modern purveyor of balanced meals.Bruce Oldfield, who designs dresses for Hollywood actresses as well as European aristocracy, has turned his hand to the outfits worn in McDonald’s UK restaurants.“We’ve been providing evidence now for two years that McJob is something people can be proud of,” said David Fairhurst, chief people officer for northern Europe at the company. “This is another step in McDonald’s’ makeover in the UK. A key component of that is to give employees a designer makeover in a way that perhaps some of the cheapest airlines, for example, have missed.”In fact, the woman manager’s outfit in particular is reminiscent of an air stewardess, while the standard staff uniform injects a splash of beige to the previously monochrome polo shirt.“People think you could have the girls running around in bikinis and the boys running around in boiler suits,” said Mr Oldfield. “It doesn’t work like that. It’s quite subtle.”McDonald’s said it was investing £2.5m ($5m) in the new uniform – which, to use the proper palette, employs “a combination of mocha, caramel and black” – and would withstand the rigours of the working environment for about 18 months. The new outfits will be rolled out across the country’s 1,200 McDonald’s restaurants early in the summer.Mr Oldfield said he was surprised that his association with McDonald’s had raised eyebrows: “I find it quite odd the whole sort of snob thing. I find it quite old fashioned.”While McDonald’s in the US has turned to designers in the past in a bid for cooler styles, Mr Fairhurst said such an “appeal to young people with informality and trendiness” was not the way to go. “Actually, what we’ve found in terms of pride and confidence is that our young people like to be dressed up and feel smart,” he said.As well as adding healthier options to its menus and sprucing up stores in the UK, McDonald’s has made a concerted effort to change its image as an employer.The word McJob entered the US lexicon in the 1980s as shorthand for dead-end work, whether in burger-flipping or elsewhere. The company has sought to emphasise that it offers management training and career prospects to staff and has even written to dictionary publishers asking them to change their definition.
515;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-04-20T20:51:51Z;Market trends: Strong names beat the market;;Branding is becoming ever more important as companies face an increasingly global and competitive marketplace.Millward Brown Optimor’s third annual ranking of the world’s top 100 most powerful brands is based partly on WPP’s Brandz database, which covers more than 50,000 of them. It found that the world’s top 100 brands have a total value of about $1,900bn, equivalent to the GDP of Italy.“Brand is becoming more and more important,” says Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor. “Technology brands have done very well this year, Google and Apple are in the top 10. For the second year running Google is the world’s most valuable brand.“Some of the world’s most successful companies are successful because they built their brand along with the business,” she adds. “Orange is a good example of that. They invested in the brand before they even had a business.”But Millward Brown Optimor has also been measuring the effects of brand on stock market performance – an area where little research has been done. It has created a “Brandz” portfolio incorporating all the brands in its top 100 survey that it was possible to invest in.The brands had to be public limited companies with liquid stock. The portfolio returns were measured in US dollars so the results are subject to currency effects.The Brandz portfolio is benchmarked against the S&P 500 as this exchange mirrors its composition most closely – large and small caps, industry and inter­national exposure.“We didn’t use the FTSE, as eight of the world’s top brands are in the US so it would be skewed by currency effects,” says Malte Nuhn, senior consultant at Millward Brown Optimor.Not all companies received equal investment at the onset of the portfolio. There was a higher investment in companies with stronger brands and those whose branded businesses were a larger part of the group.Millward Brown also isolated the stronger brands into a separate portfolio – those that have a brand contribution above 30 per cent (in the rankings the brand contributions are indexed but in fact they are percentages). This “Strong Brands” portfolio incorporates around two-thirds of the world’s top 100 brands.On April 3, the S&P had risen 3 per cent over 12 months, the Brandz Top 100 portfolio was up 15 per cent and the strong brands portfolio was up 22 per cent.On December 31 last year the S&P was up 11 per cent, the Brandz Top 100 portfolio was up 25 per cent and the strong brands portfolio was up 34 per cent.The Millward Brown study showed that products and companies with strong brand value enjoyed markedly stronger returns in good times and also during the recent market downturn.Hayes Roth, chief marketing officer of Landor Associates, the consultancy, says: “There is remarkable consistency between strong brand value and stock performance.”“Brand power can be significantly linked to stock market strength, adding on average – and depending on category – more than 25 per cent market value to an organisation.”Ms Seddon believes that the drivers behind this outperformance include the fact that strong brands can more readily increase their revenues and market share. This is because people are more attracted to the products and are more likely to be loyal to them.“You also may have the possibility of achieving a price premium,” adds Mr Nuhn. “Apple’s products sell for roughly 20 per cent more than equivalents from rivals, which will affect margins.”But there are plenty of examples of strong brands hitting nasty bumps in the road.“Look at Starbucks. You can do a world class job of building brands and do every­thing right but when you rapidly expand your global footprint it is hard to maintain what made the brand great in the first place. They over-extended themselves,” says Mr Roth.“McDonald’s suffered with the Americanisation of the world but they went back and reinvented themselves and they have moved up the list,” he adds.Studies have shown that a strong brand affects not only demand but also the supply chain. For example, if you have a strong brand such as Goldman Sachs or Microsoft it is easier to attract top graduates from business schools.“You can pay them less and they will stay longer, you can get better terms with suppliers. If you have a strong brand and invest in new products or markets you can get somebody else to take your investment risk,” says Ms Seddon.There are no global brand funds to date, although Millward Brown Optimor says its study has generated a lot of interest from the fund management community who have mooted the idea of creating a global brand fund where they would use the data as a basis for stock picking.Mr Roth says: “Look at the Optimor study. If you had picked the top five you would have done OK. Of the top 100 brands there is a lot of jockeying up and down because there are other things that affect performance.”“But strong brands will see you through and leave you in a far better place. A global brand fund would be a long-haul investment, it ought to look like a blue chip fund. It would be terrific to see. There is certainly a lot of interest.”
516;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-04-20T20:51:51Z;Ten-year trends: Rise of machines and mobile technology;;"The level of loyalty or “bonding” (the key metric that helps determine the brand contribution) of the current top 100 most powerful brands is more than twice that of the average brand. This is the same as we saw 10 years ago, showing that the relationship consumers have with brands is as important as ever.The brand with the highest bonding this year is also the most valuable – Google with 45 per cent. In 1998, this honour went to Gillette (48 per cent) which still has one of the highest bonding scores, showing the power and endurance of a strong, well-managed relationship with consumers. But it also illustrates the shift from grocery and personal care brands to technology.Looking at the top 20 bonded brands across 20 countries and comparing the findings of 10 years ago we can see this distinct shift in consumer priorities.The number of technology brands has more than doubled, including the shift of telecommunications brands to wireless. In 1998, mobile phone penetration rates in many western countries were less than 50 per cent and computers were still a significant investment for a family.Today in most western markets mobile phone penetration is in excess of 100 per cent and a new laptop can be purchased for little more than a couple of days’ average pay – if it is not actually given away as an incentive for some other purchase. In emerging markets there are millions of potential consumers with the desire, the need and the income for technology.Ten years ago most consumers had not even heard of Google, today’s number one, or BlackBerry, this year’s fastest riser and top new entrant. Now it is common to see BlackBerry users accessing the internet and searching with Google on the move in many parts of the world. It is therefore not a surprise to see technology brands are worth 52 per cent more on average than other brands in the top 100.We seem to be more health conscious – the bottled water segment of the soft drinks market has boomed over the last decade. However it will be interesting to see how much the growing concern about the environmental impact of bottled water affects the category.Health takes second place to convenience for some – we have seen an increase for fast food brands – but legislative pressure on advertising and labelling and self-regulation on health issues is likely to spread, affecting much of what we might like to eat and drink. This may eventually change our attitude to and relationship with key brands.There are fewer financial services brands represented among the top bonded brands than 10 years ago and even those financial brands in the top 100 have lost a quarter of their bonding. The negative press on the sub-prime lending crisis and on financial probity may exacerbate this. A look across the Brandz data shows that consumers are nearly half as likely to tell others about financial services than almost any other type of brand, but that they are more likely to listen out for information about them. The implication is that consumers are primed to watch for negative finance stories.Our analysis shows that one of the main barriers to bonding with financial services brands is a lack of trust, in both developed and emerging markets.We have learnt that the top brands’ success comes from four key areas:•Strong business basics•Clarity of brand associations•Projected leadership•A great product experienceMost of the brands in the rankings have strong business basics, usually backed by a strong corporate culture. GE, IBM and McDonald’s (with its latest initiative to provide recognised academic qualifications for its staff) are all good examples.The second crucial element is that the brand stands for something. The most successful brands are very clear about what they offer the consumer.Gillette is “the best a man can get”; L’ Oreal is “because you’re worth it” and “for everything else there’s Mastercard”.These are the convenient handles consumers need to choose between brands.The third criterion is whether a brand acts like a leader in its category. A brand needs to demonstrate leadership in a relevant way. Perhaps there is something in the innovation or product style or how the brand interfaces with the customer that sets it apart and drives perceptions. Nokia, Porsche and, of course, Google have these qualities in spades.Finally, a strong brand needs to deliver on its promise through a consistently good experience – preferably a great one. BMW’s driving experience, BlackBerry’s ubiquitous convenience for mobile professionals and Zara’s delivery of tailored fashion at affordable prices all get users talking.As Hayes Roth, chief marketing officer at leading branding and design business Landor Associates, observes: “In the end, all the fine promises and business and marketing acumen come down to one simple question: does my actual experience with the brand meet or exceed my expectations?”“It is no coincidence that virtually all of the Brandz top 20 most valuable brands invest heavily in providing consistently superior product, service and retail brand design as the most tangible and compelling expression of a positive brand experience.”Innovation and revitalisation allied to a clear brand promise, delivering a great experience backed up by a sound and ethical corporation – that is the route to continued financial success."
517;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-04-20T20:51:50Z;Sector analysis: Asia and technology leading the way;;"The key trends in this year’s Brandz Top 100 rankings – the strength of leading technology and mobile communications brands, the power of innovation, the rise of Asian and especially Chinese brands – all emerge in this detailed look at 16 business categories.This year, insurance companies have been given their own category rather than being lumped in with other financial institutions. Some additional research in laundry care (fabric detergent and fabric softener/conditioner) and deodorants has covered some of the brands in the category. Spirits is an entirely new category and gives fresh insight into the performance of companies such as Diageo, which owns five of the Top 10 brands.The following is an edited version of the Brandz sectoral findings, with additional comments for the fastest-growing categories, and the two new ones, from Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor, Peter Walshe, director of the Brandz programme at MBO, and Anna Chen, associate director.Apparel• There is an increased link between sport and lifestyle, leading to a smaller distinction between sports and regular apparel brands – many consumers are wearing more sportswear, but not participating in more sports activities.• The sporting goods industry has benefited from global sporting events such as the World Cup and the forthcoming Beijing Olympics, which have placed the industry in the limelight. In China, rising disposable incomes and interest in western sporting events have created an opportunity for western sports brands.• Retailers are placing more focus on online channels as more and more consumers turn to e-retailing.Brand highlights: Ralph Lauren is seeking better control over its products to maintain its prestigious brand image, and has seen strong demand for its “collection” products.Esprit is the one brand from this category to feature in the overall list of top 20 risers. It has not deviated from its original aim, says Ms Chen – focusing on affordable, casual clothing that is not overly trendy and thus likely to fall out of fashion quickly. Esprit is also a relatively rare example of a global mass market brand, says Ms Seddon – while others such as Zara and H&M are still becoming global.Beer• In the west, smoking bans, shrinking core markets and a widening choice of alternative alcoholic beverages have conspired to stunt the growth of the beer market, although the 2006 World Cup and a spate of unusually hot weather have softened the blow.• Companies are increasing their focus on emerging markets.• Domestic beers in developed markets face stagnant volumes while imported premium brands see strong growth.• In the US, a preference for imported premium beers and for healthier options has boosted the “luxury imported light” category,with sales almost twice those of imported regular beers.• There has been consolidation in the brewing industry as companies seek to secure brands and national positions as well as broaden global footprints.Brand highlights: Skol’s results come from long-term brand renovation work and significant outreach to young men. The Stella Artois brand grew beyond the UK, with good results in North America and eastern Europe. For Beck’s, innovative products such as Beck’s Green Lemon have helped refresh the brand image and attract interest.Cars• The strong brands benefit from cool new designs, fuel efficient and green models in an environment where gas prices are rising.• Recent business conditions have been characterised by increases in crude oil and raw materials prices, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and structural changes in demand.• Development was influenced by dynamic growth in the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, whereas the traditional car markets (US, Japan and western Europe) recorded zero or negative growth.Brand highlights: Porsche capitalised on the success of the previous fiscal year in the Middle East, Latin America and southern and eastern Europe. Fiat’s revenues reached a record high, due to the success of the Punto, Panda, Bravo and light commercial vehicles.Coffee• The global coffee market has experienced slow but positive sales growth, leading to good results for most brands.• A big characteristic is innovation and movement towards quality/premium products.• Fair trade sales have significantly increased.• Nestlé and Kraft dominate instant coffees and the whole category as a result.• Consumers are turning to ground coffee and/or stopping consumption of instant coffee.Brand highlights: Nespresso has capitalised on the success of the previous fiscal year in the Middle East, Latin America and southern and eastern Europe. The brand is leading the “premium” trend because it is positioned as almost a luxury coffee – sold only at top department stores and its own “boutiques”. So the product can be sold at a relatively high price.Fast Food• Consumers are returning to fast-food restaurants as efforts to revamp the industry’s image through healthier and better quality offerings pay off.• Growth in the number of outlets is forecast to slow down as operators focus on maximising sales from existing stores with later hours and increased menu variety.• Asia offers great opportunity for fast food operators to expand. Western fast-food brands hold an aspirational status and are regarded as a treat.• Coffee houses have reached a level of maturity in leading markets, which means that profits are substantial but not as large as early 2000.• Competition is also increasing as major retailers have or are developing their own-brand coffee shops.Brand highlights: The category was the fastest overall riser in the previous year’s rankings and is still doing well. McDonald’s and Burger King remain the sector’s “Yin and Yang” in terms of strategy, as Ms Seddon puts it, yet have both recorded big rises in brand value. Meanwhile KFC’s “new fast food” positioning in China has strengthened the brand’s No 1 position, far outstripping McDonald’s.Apart from Wendy’s, the one brand whose value declined, by 25.2 per cent, was Starbucks. This partly reflects the decline in the “business value” element of the calculation and the fact that the brand has fallen from its peak position.But MBO’s experts point out that Starbucks’ “brand contribution” is still rising and the brand remains fundamentally strong.Howard Schultz, the chairman and founder who this year returned to the post of chief executive, is given credit by Ms Seddon for realising early that the company, in its dash for growth, may be losing something essential to the brand – the “smell of fresh coffee in the stores”.Financial Institutions• Many US and British banks have been affected by the subprime crisis.• Chinese banks have had two big years but it is hard to tell how much of their performance is due to better management and how much to the exceptionally favourable economic conditions.• To maintain a competitive edge, banks need to both provide a service that clients perceive as being personalized and focus on a specific area rather than a wide range of functions.• Leading banks and financial services companies are making proactive attempts to be more “green”.Brand highlights: The impact of last summer’s credit squeeze can be seen in the declines or small rises in brand value for Citi, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, whereas Goldman Sachs, up 45 per cent, is benefiting from taking a contrarian line to its rivals. “They saw the credit crunch coming and actually bet against the subprime mortgage market,” says Ms Seddon.Citi’s 10 per cent decline in brand value has allowed Bank of America to claim top spot. Mr Walshe notes that 10 years ago, Bank of America hardly registered as a brand, but that acquisitions, rebranding and “shouting about what it is and where it stands in the marketplace”, have made a big impact.The inexorable rise of the Chinese banks is also charted by the Brandz rankings, with ICBC, China Construction Bank and Bank of China all achieving big rises in brand value. Standard Chartered Bank benefits from its presence in Asia. The increases would have been greater if MBO had not adjusted for the so-called “Shanghai bubble” on stock markets last year, which would have given an inflated overall view of the banks’ brand value.Insurance• Leading insurance companies are positioning themselves for a future that requires significant changes in the way they do business (unprecedented volatility, a changing customer base and exacting regulators).• New markets will help drive profits, as developed economies see slower growth in demand for insurance.• Insurers collectively spent $2bn last year on advertising, surpassing the beer, entertainment and soft drink industries.Brand highlights: The Aviva brand (a new entry) is not used in the UK, where it trades as Norwich Union. Net income increased 26 per cent with special help from the UK and the Netherlands, acquisitions and rapidly growing organic start-ups.Axa’s net income rose significantly, including the acquisition of Winterthur, the former insurance arm of Credit Suisse. Axa wants to address eroded confidence in the sector.Luxury• The global value of the market is around $400bn and it is tipped to grow to $2,000bn by 2010.• There are emerging consumers for “New Luxury” items, products and services that deliver higher levels of quality, taste, and aspiration than conventional ones.• Luxury brands prefer to use standard advertising and marketing formats as they have concerns that interruptive formats have a negative impact on their brand.• There is pressure even for luxury brands to be environmentally responsible. A report by WWF, the conservation organisation, criticised the luxury products industry as being “slow to recognise their responsibilities and opportunities”.• Recently luxury brands have been entering the leisure/construction industries, exporting lifestyle brands to hotels and apartments.Brand highlights: The solid rises in brand value, from an already high base, attest to the importance of innovation – and making a splash about it. “It’s about constantly coming up with something new and creating a buzz around the brands, and all these brands are very good at that,” says Ms Seddon. Consistent application of brand management principles has resulted in very similar brand value increases across the LVMH brands – Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and Hennessy. Yet LVMH is a true “house of brands”, says Ms Seddon – each is managed separately and synergies are not exploited because this could have a long-term impact on the share price and the success of the brand. “It’s the opposite of some of the car companies, who make the same chassis for all their cars and just stick different top pieces on it,” she says. “There is no same car under different labels here. The employees stay within one brand, they don’t jump from one to another, so they live the principles of the brand.”Elsewhere, Gucci has branched away from the conservative approach typical of brands in this category through the creation of a strong online corporate identity, allowing it to stand out among competitors.Mobile Operators• Mobile phones are ubiquitous, so network operators are focused on getting customers to spend more.• The biggest influence on the growth of the market has been the advent of 3G technology, which enables facilities such as video calling and game downloads.• The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector has led to price pressure.• As markets approach saturation point, providers are focusing on strengthening existing customer relationships. At the European level, competition is increasing because of the introduction of Europe-wide services.Brand highlights: Vodafone, Movistar and Orange are expanding globally from bases in smaller markets, while China Mobile has built a very strong brand in one huge market. “It’s a premium-priced brand, unlike its competitors, and it is not just big,” says Ms Seddon. “It is also very much being developed, positioned and marketed as a brand, as opposed to just a product or service.”O2, now part of Telefónica, is maintaining its brand personality, standing for solidity, globalisation and innovation while reinventing itself through marketing efforts such as sponsoring the England rugby team.MTS is the first Russian company to reach the BrandZ Top 100, coming in at 89th.Motor Fuel• Brands are globalising, as is shown by the expansion not only of the BP brand, but also the recent appearance of the Lukoil brand in retail petrol in the US and other markets.• Companies are trying to manage the difficult balancing act of promoting a “green” agenda and sustainability in a credible manner.• The strategic focus for the companies remains on upstream and refining activities – brand-building is at the bottom of the agenda.Brand highlights: PetroChina’s consolidated turnover increased 24.8 per cent and consolidated net profit rose 6.6 per cent.Personal Care• In all areas of the personal care market, products offering additional properties to simply cleaning have been booming (for example, skin-firming for face, whitening for teeth or curl-enhancing for hair).• As manufacturers have extended their offerings, brands have shifted consumer perceptions so that these products are now viewed as beauty products and not simply as toiletries.• A big trend in the sector is the rise of spa-influenced products, which command price premiums.Brand highlights: The sector has some very strong brands that continue to grow, says Mr Walshe. The biggest riser is Nivea. Innovation underlies the strength of the top brands, he says – but this may not necessarily be in the products themselves. “There’s a feeling of communications innovation, which gives you a sense of dynamism about the brand and why, therefore, it’s worth buying it and being seen to use it.”A further point is that brands with a “premium feel” to them, if not actually luxury brands, are doing well. Lancôme and Shiseido, which has expanded beyond Japan, are examples.Unlike in other categories, no strong indigenous brands have yet developed in emerging Asian markets, attesting to the international brands’ marketing and distribution clout and their recognisability.In deodorants, Axe is now the number one deodorant in the US, with strong double-digit growth. The “Axe effect” – giving men the edge in the dating game – underpins all the brand’s campaigns. Branding and marketing is very similar for Lynx, as the Unilever product is called in the UK, Ireland and Australia.Dove associated its deodorant with positive skincare credentials, and positioned it more as a beauty product than a functional one, which helped to increase penetration and achieve a double-digit increase in turnover.Retailing• The race to capture the green moral high ground has gone into overdrive.• Grocery retailers are moving into non-traditional business areas such as digital media services, marking a new position as providers of lifestyle products.• There has been significant growth in online retailing as consumers seek more convenient ways to shop. Many retailers have enhanced multi-channel offers to give a more flexible service.• In line with the trend towards healthy eating, retailers are increasingly displaying nutrition labels on products.Brand highlights: At Amazon, increased product offerings and new initiatives not only improved financial performance but also helped to refresh the brand with consumers.“There is one internet retail success story and this is it,” says Ms Seddon. “It’s about focusing on ease of use and involving the consumer.”They reach out to you by saying: “What books do you want to buy this week? We think you might be interested in this.” At Tesco, meanwhile, the introduction of more healthy foods boosted sales. Wider product choice and a flexible delivery system led to a 30 per cent increase in Tesco.com revenues as consumers seek more convenient ways to shop.At Home Depot in the US, the slowdown in the home improvement market resulted in a decrease of comparable store sales of 4.6 per cent; increasing labour and store costs also reduced profitability.Soft Drinks• The sector is struggling to sustain growth as an unhealthy image drives down consumption of soft drinks, while juices and water are claiming market share. Unsurprisingly, the low-calorie category is faring best.• The sector is dominated by a handful of superbrands and strong promotional support will ensure that the sector continues to grow, even if it is at a slower rate.• Events such as the football World Cup provided good opportunities for marketing, while the sector continues to embrace the web to reach a youthful audience, particularly in the form of websites for music downloading or video uploading.• The inclusion of bottling has boosted business value for all brands.Spirits• The European beverage sector is trading at a higher relative valuation than for more than a decade.• The US market continues to deliver growth in the premium segments.• Emerging markets are increasingly important to profitability and have shown accelerating sales.• Growth in the spirits market is coming from “premiumisation”. Many brands are trying to innovate and extend brands upwards.• Brands have faced greater advertising restrictions, especially around the issue of linking sex to alcohol and responsibility among younger drinkers.Brand highlights: The most valuable spirits brand, Hennessy, is not on the list as it is in the luxury category. Innovations include new flavours to add pizzazz to he big base brands, according to Ms Seddon. Bacardi is a good example with additional flavours to complement the core white rum.Elsewhere, Smirnoff relaunched its Smirnoff Black Label at the premium end of the market and emphasised its copper-pot distillation method.Johnnie Walker has harnessed tremendous growth as a result of price increases, additional investment, a focus on premiumisation and success in Latin America and Asia.Jack Daniels has been boosting market share through a super-premium offer recently redirected at younger drinkers, with a strong bias towards males.Technology• This is a rapidly evolving market driven by technological advancements available at a cheaper price. At the same time, the industry is experiencing a new wave, led by Apple, of sophisticated premium-priced products that command higher margins for design, functionality and trendiness.• The majority of brands have minimal product differentiation and are jostling for a position in the market.• Microsoft is still king in the software category.• The mobile handset category is still growing fast, especially in the Latin American and Asian markets as mobile phones become more affordable.• Apple’s iPhone is having a powerful impact.• After several years of moving at a healthy pace, the search engine industry seems to be sailing off in new directions.• There has been a recent surge of selling and buying of web businesses in which lofty sums are being paid.• The internet has become a principal medium for community, communication, and entertainment – three areas that have collided and are impacting each other’s growth.Brand highlights: Google, leading the Top 100 ranking again, continues to expand its business into different areas: it acquired Double- Click, a vibrant advertising business for banners, videos, and other so-called display ads, and launched an open operating system for mobile phones (free to use), called Android, promising “better, cheaper” mobile phones.BlackBerry and Apple had the biggest rises in brand value for the Top 100.Two other strong performers in the category were: IBM (up 64.8 per cent) which benefited from continued growth in emerging markets, improved cost competitiveness and utilisation levels, and ongoing productivity initiatives. And Siemens, up 61 per cent, had strong financial results throughout the year, powered by multiple acquisitions and strategic alliances. This year, however, has brought a shock €900m ($1,400bn) profit warning that it blamed on a contract cancellation, project delays and capacity issues.Nokia benefited from big year-on-year increases in sales in Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Two company acquisitions during 2007 and four in 2006 have improved process integration and quality, resulting in greater customer loyalty and profitability.According to Mr Walshe, Nokia’s relationship with its customers, already strong 10 years ago, has become even closer. The company’s 38.9 per cent rise in brand value reflects a resurgence after rivals stole a march on it in the clamshell phone market.But Mr Walshe says that “the relationship people have got with the Nokia brand is putting the company in a strong position, so if it ever got out of synch with the product cycle, as can sometimes happen with technology companies, it would be better placed to recover than others”.Bottled Water• While bottled water is thriving as a healthy alternative to carbonated soft drinks, a rise in the environmental consciousness of consumers has put the industry in the spotlight.• Commoditisation and a lack of brand and product differentiation have caused the ”brand contribution” to drop across the category.• Still water has continued to outsell sparkling, with flavoured variants from the big brands thriving.Brand highlights: Perrier has revived its exclusive image, and with its distinctive green bottle, is one of the most recognisable bottled water brands.Volvic, the top brand in the UK, is continuing its positioning as a water for the younger consumer with its “Volcanicity” campaign."
518;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Holding firm as downturn looms;;The past year was, like the years immediately preceding it, a good time to build a brand. Strong economic growth around the world and rising income in countries such as India and China provided fertile conditions for many companies to boost the value of their products.The world’s top 100 brands increased in value by 21 per cent to a total of $1,940bn. They were buoyed not only by strong growth in many countries and industries but by a willingness to invest heavily in the brands that distinguish their products.The boom in luxury goods and services over the past 10 years has given this trend an impetus. Brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton have expanded globally, taking advantage of demand not only in Japan but now in China, India and Russia.By the year-end, however, problems had appeared. Neither Bear Stearns or Northern Rock had been in the top 100 but both lost huge amounts of value amid the credit crunch. Weakening economic growth – and a possible recession – in the US also took a less dramatic toll on brands such as Starbucks and Wal-Mart.So, in 2008, many brands will face a tougher climate. Those in the Brandz Top 100 Most Powerful Brands ranking must hope that Nigel Hollis, chief global analyst for Millward Brown, the consultancy that compiles the rankings, is right that they are in a comparatively strong position.“Strong brands are far better positioned than others to ride out recessions. The ones that perform best are those that invest during downturns because, as the recessions ends, they come out stronger,” he says.The downturn will test that proposition, which is a tenet of advertising and marketing companies such as WPP Group, the parent of Millward Brown.Brands have long been a mainstay of consumer companies. “A vodka salesman may have a good reputation but his successor generally does just as well if the label on the bottle is Smirnoff,” says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of Intangible Business, a UK consultancy.But the early 21st century has been notable for the new brands industries that have sprung up. The clearest examples are in communications, with brands such as Research in Motion’s BlackBerry – the fastest growing brand this year – coming to the fore.Six of the top 10 most valuable global brands (seven if you include General Electric) are in the technology or telecoms industries. Both Nokia and Apple, which now produces the iPhone, rose enough places in the rankings this year to enter the top 10.The number one place in the rankings was taken once again by Google, which retained its two-spot edge over its rival Microsoft. “Google has delivered something that speaks to people in the modern age, the ability to get information quickly and easily,” says Mr Hollis.Apple, the second fastest growing brand of the year, still thrives under the leadership of Steve Jobs, its co-founder. Mr Jobs has shown how a brand can be built with superior technology, smart design, strong advertising and strong customer service at its own-name stores.Yet the growth of mobile telephony, which has been such a strong influence on brand value, already shows signs of waning. Some markets have reached full penetration and the economic uncertainty is having a direct impact on phone sales.Brands in technology and telecoms could now face a period of competition with each other. That has already been the experience of consumer goods comp­anies – and restaurants such as Starbucks, which dropped 21 places this year as American consumers became jaded.Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ founder, has now taken over as chief executive to revive its fortunes. He could take note of the rise of McDonald’s, which went through a similar downturn but has been reviving and entered the top 10 at number eight.Retailers and makers of packaged goods continue to tussle for the consumer’s loyalty. Retailers such as Tesco in the UK and Whole Foods Market in the US not only control their shelf space zealously but also sell white label versions of branded goods.US retailers had a tough year, with Wal-Mart and Home Depot both falling in the rankings, but Tesco continued to rise. Coca-Cola retained its fourth position in the rankings, while the brands Tide and Ariel were counted in the rankings for the first time.Financial services companies – and particularly banks and investment banks – were already facing tough conditions in 2007. Merrill Lynch, which was badly affected by the sub-prime credit crisis, dropped 24 places, losing 16 per cent of its brand value.“It has been a very scary year from a brand perspective because we have seen a couple of names – Northern Rock and Bear Stearns – disappear. That is pretty rare and it shows how vulnerable banks are to their reputations being impaired,” says Mr Forbes.The outlook is less troubled for brands in Asia – and in particular what Millward Brown calls “modern” rather than “traditional” Asia – mainland China rather than Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong – from where brands have emerged in the past.This year, there are four mainland Chinese companies in the top 100 – China Mobile and three Chinese banks. They have joined seven traditional Asian brands, including Standard Chartered Bank and Toyota, but have already overtaken them in value.Wally Olins, chairman of Saffron brand consultants, argues that India and China are only tapping the surface of their ability to create global brands. He cites the development by the Indian company Tata of the Nano – the “one lakh” small car – as a sign of things to come.“India and China are going to emerge very powerfully and are moving to become global. We will see examples of big brands that come from places we did not consider at all seriously before.”Mr Hollis, however, has doubts about how fast this will occur, and how many Asian brands will succeed on the global stage. “It is incredibly hard for a brand that has been a success in one country to make an impact outside. It happens only rarely,” he says.Recognising this, Asian companies are showing interest in acquiring western brands to which they can apply their manufacturing expertise, such as Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s personal computer business.The uncertain economic climate could make this easier for Asian companies, particularly if a sharp US downturn does not derail growth in China and India. But it could also inhibit them from expanding out of domestic markets and entering softer US and European economies.Indeed, 2008 is likely to be a challenging year for many brands that have become used to expanding rapidly. It could be a particular test for the newer brands that have established themselves in consumers’ minds in a relatively short period.These rising stars have not yet been through a downturn and had to cope with hard choices about how much to continue to invest in marketing and branding. The advice of branding experts is to stick the course but we shall see whether they have the nerve.
519;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-04-17T13:46:34Z;Consumers: Shoppers need a nudge to buy green;;Andy Redfern, co-founder of the website Ethical Superstore.com, has no illusions about consumers who claim to be green.“We had a rush last year on solar iPod charges and most of them were going to Glastonbury,” he says.Even if people who buy things with an environmentally friendly claim do so for selfish purposes, there is no doubt that people are buying more of them.Mr Redfern started his website, which offers some 3,500 products ranging from “eco kettles” to the BBC book, It’s Not Easy Being Green, two years ago. Today, 2,000 people make purchases every week, helping the website bring in some £2.2m ($4.3m) in annual sales.But Mr Redfern admits that only about half of his shoppers are environmental advocates. The other half are just looking for a place to buy a particular gadget.David Hall, an international campaign director for The Climate Group, a non-profit climate change pressure group, says consumers are perfectly willing to buy environmentally-friendly products, as long as they do not have to expend too much money or “energy”. “Consumers will do the right thing if you make it a no-brainer for them.”Mr Hall cites the example of British supermarket chain Tesco, which increased the number of energy-efficient light bulbs it sells by halving the price. “We’re not yet at a stage where consumers are inspired to be green, but if you make it easy for them they will take the first step.”Food retailers have taken the lead on responding to consumer demands for ethically-sourced products – most supermarkets now offer extensive organic and Fair Trade ranges, while food manufacturers have rushed to outdo one another in eliminating artificial additives and processed fats.Food retailers and manufacturers have had good reason to take the lead. An intensifying focus on childhood obesity has resulted in pressure from governments and special interest groups on the food companies to address some of the causes.As well as cutting back on sugar, salt and transfats, food retailers have realised they can improve their image by selling ethically-sourced products.In the UK last year, the fast food chain McDonald’s switched to coffee certified by the Rainforest Alliance (an organisation that certifies products that are made or grown sustainably).Unilever, the world’s biggest purchaser of black tea and the owner of the PG Tips and Lipton brands, has asked the Rainforest Alliance to certify its tea farms.Household product manufacturers have been slower to adapt, perhaps because they have experienced less scrutiny. Although most big companies have cut back on packaging and have begun measuring carbon emissions, they have not come up with a lot of new ideas for natural cleaning products.Teresa Fabian, an assistant director in the sustainability team at PwC, says that companies are not innovative enough. A survey of 2,000 UK consumers by PwC in February found that 45 per cent cited price as the main reason for not buying more green non-food products and services, 17 per cent cited lack of availability.Smaller household product manufacturers have been more innovative than multinationals. Ecover, a small company that makes ecological cleaning products and claims its washing up liquid is 20 times “less toxic” than conventional liquids, now produces 26 types of environmentally-friendly household products.The company was an early mover, producing its first phosphate-free washing powder in 1984, but now says it is seeing more competition. “Two years ago, we were probably the only [ecological] choice on the shelf,” says Clare Allman, the group’s UK marketing director. “Now other brands are coming in.”Still, many consumers appear reluctant to give up buying their favourite products: the PwC survey showed 29 per cent thought companies should stop making environmentally-damaging products but only 3 per cent thought retailers should stop selling them.The pay-off for companies that take an early lead with more sustainable products is that they are likely to be well positioned for the future. As Ms Fabian points out, sustainable business models are quickly becoming a necessity, not a choice.As the cost of raw materials – from oil to wheat to water – soars amid rising global demand, companies will need to consider for closely how they source raw materials for their products.“[Supply issues] are going to impact all business people, regardless of the green consumer,” Ms Fabian says. “We have finite natural resources and we’re consuming them at an unsustainable rate.”
520;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-04-17T13:41:52Z;Rostislav Ordovsky-Tanaevsky Blanco: Opening the gate to unlimited opportunities;;When Rostislav Ordovsky-Tanaevsky Blanco came to Moscow from Venezuela to start a restaurant chain in the Soviet Union’s dying days, doing business seemed, in some ways, a lot easier than now.“Back then the law was very easy, very simple and very basic,” says Mr Ordovsky-Tanaevsky, whose Russian grandparents fled Russia during the Bolshevik revolution. For new foreign joint ventures, “all the existing laws did not apply”. Instead, a single three-page law governed their activity.Less simple was dealing with constant suspicion from the KGB, which thought the Russian-Venezuelan must be a CIA agent and interrogated his friends. Finding a business partner was also difficult because foreign businesses then had to team up with the state. Mr Ordovsky-Tanaevsky eventually obtained permission to set up shop with the Orwellian-named Ministry for Daily Services of the Population. But once he had found a partner, he says, “you open the gate for unlimited opportunities”.Now, 18 years after opening his first restaurant, a tapas bar next to Red Square, Mr Ordovsky-Tanaevsky has one of Russia’s biggest dining businesses with 400 restaurants, growing fast thanks to Russia’s consumer spending boom. His Rosinter chain, which includes brands such as TGI Friday’s and an Italian restaurant chain, Il Patio, survived the KGB suspicions of the early 1990s, the attentions of mafia groups in the mid-1990s, and the 1998 financial crisis to float on the Russian stock market last summer in a IPO that raised $100m.Since then, the value of the venture has soared from about $380m to $580m. Even though the level of bureaucracy – and corruption – has climbed since Soviet days with at least 70 permits now required to open a single restaurant, Russia’s new-found stability means “we have sustainable growth easily for the next five years”. First visiting the Soviet Union in 1984, to attend a film festival in Tashkent, Mr Ordovsky-Tanaevsky says he was struck by three things: “One was I couldn’t find a place to eat, second I couldn’t find a place to buy a roll of film. Third, I found out I had a lot of family I never knew,” he says. “So that was the start of these long adventures.”Mr Ordovsky-Tanaevsky went back to Venezuela and spent two years in talks with Burger King on developing a franchise in Moscow before the group pulled out, leaving him on his own to set up his tapas bar, one of Russia’s first foreign restaurants, in June 1990, just months after McDonald’s opened in Moscow. Before then, he had managed to persuade Kodak to let him represent it in Russia.Appetite for foreign restaurants taking dollar payments was still limited. “I found a lot of opportunities but there was no market for more than one Swiss restaurant or one Spanish restaurant at a time,” he says. “There was only a small group of people who could afford these places.”But as market reforms kicked in and incomes began to climb “by 1996 we started to feel …more people could afford to eat out …so we started building the chains which are the core of our business today”.The first was Rostik’s – a fast-food chicken joint which in 2006 teamed up with Yum! Brands to operate the KFC fast-food franchise.Another change was the KGB’s waning power. By the mid-1990s, mafia groups began to move in. But due to close ties Mr Ordovsky-Tanaevsky says he had forged with the interior ministry by providing it with Kodak equipment, most mafia quickly went away. Yet while household incomes grew “we all got blinded by the big growth and did not see that the government was getting bankrupted”.When the rouble devaluation and debt default of 1998 hit, Mr Ordovsky-Tanaevsky felt the impact hard. “There were many …mornings that I woke up without knowing if at the end of the day I would still have a business,” he says. While many of his expatriate staff left, Mr Ordovsky-Tanaevsky staved off bankruptcy by renegotiating $15m in debt to banks and more than $30m to Kodak.Vladimir Putin’s arrival as president ushered in a new era of growth and stability, he says.“Regardless of any criticism we can make, there is one very clear and positive thing he did. He took the country back under control. We can argue that he has gone too far or not. But definitely we have a country now because of Putin.”
521;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-04-17T01:25:09Z;British consumers worry more about economy;;Concern over the environment has tailed off in the past year, while fears over the economy have rocketed up the consumer agenda.Polling data from Ipsos Mori show that environmental concerns reached a pinnacle in January 2007, when 19 per cent of people named the environment as one of the biggest issues facing Britain today, compared with just a few per cent several years earlier. But by January 2008, that figure had fallen to 8 per cent.Meanwhile, 23 per cent of people rated the economy a top concern in March, up from 20 per cent in January – double the number who did so for most of 2007.Jenny Dawkins, head of corporate responsibility research at Ipsos Mori, said environmental concerns peaked 15 months ago amid a welter of publicity around climate change. “It was not long after the Stern report and Al Gore’s film, and there was unprecedented media interest in the topic,” she said. Fears of an economic slowdown were instrumental in pushing the environment down the agenda.But Ms Dawkins warned the poll should not be interpreted as suggesting that people had lost interest in the climate. “For people to mention it as an issue unprompted is pretty strong – it’s a tough benchmark to make.” This means that even if people are no longer rating the environment as one of the most important issues facing the country, they may still harbour strong feelings about it.“Just because it’s getting a lower priority now does not mean people are not looking for companies to take responsibility for environmental issues. Our research shows they still have high expectations that companies should do more,” she said.Ms Dawkins added: “It would be dangerous for companies to think they can back down on their green initiatives now, because there is already a lot of scepticism among consumers about their green claims – so if they do [abandon their green initiatives], that will damage people’s confidence in them even further.”Andrew Perkins, a director at Ernst & Young, agreed, saying businesses such as retailer Marks and Spencer that trumpeted their green credentials would look foolish if they dropped them at the first sign of trouble.M&S said it was “absolutely committed” to its five-year plan to become carbon-neutral and cut waste. “[Being green] has been integral to the way we operate for a long time, before it became a hot issue,” it said.B&Q, the DIY chain, said it was also committed to its green targets: “It is a tough climate for businesses and consumers, but being sustainable needn’t cost the earth.” McDonald’s cited the positive response to its use of organic milk and Costa Coffee said it would carry on investing in environmentally sound practices because “it gives us credibility and strengthens the brand”.Unilever last year asked the Rainforest Alliance, which certifies companies’ water conservation, soil management practices and labour conditions, to audit its tea suppliers. The Rainforest Alliance also certifies coffee sold by McDonald’s, Starbucks and Kraft.But Ms Dawkins warned such companies could be vulnerable to a slowdown: “There has been an upturn in ethical purchasing, but it has been driven by the middle [classes] – and they are the people who will feel the economic pinch before the very high incomes, so ethical purchasing may tail off.”
522;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-03-19T21:23:04Z;Starbucks in drive to improve ‘experience’;;Howard Schultz, chief executive officer of Starbucks, on Wednesday announced a series of moves aimed at improving what he calls “the coffee experience” in its US stores, as part of his drive to revitalise the world’s largest coffee chain.The initiatives - ranging from new lower-height expresso machines to plans for the company’s first loyalty programme - are part of a strategic shakeup at Starbucks by Mr Schultz, who resumed the post of CEO in January amid investor concerns over slowing US growth.New initiatives in the US stores will include the introduction of a new blend of coffee named after the company’s first store at Pike Place, Seattle, and the rapid roll out of the new low-level Mastrena machines - which allowing greater eye-contact with customers.The new machines will be introduced into 30 percent of its more than 7,000 US stores by the end of the year, and into three-quarters of its stores by the end of 2010.The company also said it had acquired the Coffee Equipment Company, a small Seattle based company that makes innovative single-cup grinding and brewing machines for filter coffee, which will be introduced in selected stores.Starbucks also announced its first rewards programme for regular US customers who use its stored-value cards. From April, registered card holders will receive free customised extra ingredients such as flavourings and cream.It also launched its first online social-networking community called “MyStarbucksidea.com”. The site is aimed at offering customers a forum for proposing and voting on new ideas for the chain that will be incorporated into its stores.In an effort to strengthen its ethical credentials, Starbucks is also to expand an existing partnership with Conservation International, a non-profit group, to protect tropical forests by providing incentives to farmers not to clear forest for land.The moves are a response to growing competition from similar chains such as Caribou Coffee and Peet’s, while fast food outlets such as McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts have also started expanding their lower-cost expresso coffee offerings.In other areas, Mr Schultz said it will also will expand into drinks and foods that are focused on health and wellness and explore new energy drinks as it pushes to improve its financial performance.He also described opportunities for expanding the company’s sales of packaged coffee and drinks through supermarkets and other outlets as a potential billion dollar business for the company.The company has made a series of changes in top management, and cut back US store opening plans. It also closed all its US stores last month for three hours for a staff training session, as part of efforts to improve store service.
523;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-03-10T20:45:54Z;US stocks slump amid risk aversion;;Wall Street stocks slumped on Monday, amid heightened volatility, as risk aversion sent equities spinning to their lowest levels in 19 months.Financials were sold on growing evidence that credit market turmoil is causing margin calls at investment firms. Among the biggest fallers was Bear Stearns whose shares sank to their lowest level in five years on rumours – which it denied – that the bank was facing liquidity troubles.Energy-sensitive sectors including industrials and transport laboured as crude oil prices hit a record level of $107.90 a barrel and traders took profits in the materials sector as metals prices cooled.The S&P 500 closed 1.6 per cent lower at 1,273.38, leaving the index foundering at its lowest level since August 2006. The S&P stood on the cusp of a bear market, having fallen 18.6 per cent since its October peak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 11,740.15 in spite of good day for McDonald’s which posted strong February sales figures. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2 per cent to 2,169.34. The renewed market skittishness drove the CBOE Vix index, Wall Street’s so-called fear barometer, 6.9 per cent higher to 29.38, its highest in more than a month.Economic fears once again weighed on the market after Friday’s dismal jobs report increased the odds that the US could experience a recession. Although a weak employment market raised the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates again, this prospect – and the announcement of an extra $200bn in one-month bank funds – failed to quell market unease.Fed intervention could come sooner than next week, according to Goldman Sachs, which told clients it “could not rule out an inter-meeting [rate] cut”.Banking stocks beat a retreat after Morgan Stanley cut its 2008 earnings estimates on a range of large-cap banks, citing weaker financial markets.Citigroup‘s shares fell below $20 for the first time in 10 years, ending the session down 5.8 per cent at $19.69. Bank of America lost 3.9 pe r cent to $35.31.Lehman Brothers fell 7.3 per cent to $42.98 in spite of announcing plans to lay off 5 per cent of its workforce.Bear Stearns fell as much as 14 per cent, the lowest since 2003, as rumours that the bank faced a liquidity shortfall rattled the market. Alan Greenberg, chairman of the executive committee, told CNBC the rumours were “totally ridiculous”. The shares closed down 11.1 per cent at $62.30.“The entire brokerage sector is getting crushed. It’s not a pretty place to be,” said Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.JPMorgan warned late last week that a “systemic credit crunch” could cost US banks $325bn in capital due to a sharp deterioration in the mortgage market.Others were even more bearish: “An enormous wave of defaults, foreclosures and auctions is just beginning to hit the US. We believe it will get so bad that large-scale federal government intervention is likely,” said Whitney Tilson, managing partner of T2 Partners.Mortgage lender Thornburg Mortgage fell 60.3 per cent to $0.70 after it failed to meet $610m in margin calls last week.Meanwhile, another mortgage firm Countrywide Financial sank to a new low of $4.36, down 14 per cent, following reports that the company was one of several lenders facing a fraud investigation by the FBI.A Barron’s report that Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage agency, could face a bail-out prompted its shares to drop 13 per cent to $19.81. Bear Stearns’ analysts said the report lacked a “complete or balanced picture” of Fannie’s finances. Another big faller was Ambac Financial, the troubled bond insurer, which gave up 23.3 per cent to $7.29 following its dilutive share sale last week.McDonald’s rose 2.9 per cent to $53.80 after it announced an 11.7 per cent increase in global same-store sales in February.Goldman Sachs upgraded department store operators JC Penney, down 1.4 per cent at $40.42, and Nordstrom, up 0.2 per cent at $32.81, from “neutral” to “buy”.Wal-Mart slipped 2.1 per cent to $48.885 after Goldman removed the company from a conviction buy list.
524;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-03-05T00:57:12Z;Gene modified crop spurs investor revolt;;A group of socially con­cer­ned US investors has launched a public campaign calling on food companies not to use a controversial new genetically engineered sugar beet crop that is to be planted for the first time this spring.The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) is calling on consumers to write to 63 companies, including Heinz, Campbell’s Soup, General Mills and Kraft, asking them to say they will not use a new sugar beet strain developed by Monsanto.The ICCR is a coalition of more than 300 faith-based institutional investors that has been in the vanguard of successful efforts to make companies more responsive to a range of social and environmental concerns.Its members have filed shareholder resolutions calling on the McDonald’s and Wendy’s restaurants chains and Safeway supermarkets to label products that contain genetically engineered ingredients.In a break with its usual focus on shareholder resolutions, it has launched a web-site, www.dontplantGMObeets.org, that calls on consumers to send letters to the management of the food companies that are the focus of its campaign. The letter cites survey claims that 50 per cent of US consumers would prefer not to buy GM products, and calls on the companies “to publicly oppose the spring 2008 planting of genetically modified sugar beets”.The “Roundup Ready” sugar beet in question was approved for planting by the US Department of Agriculture in March 2005. It has been genetically engineered to make it resistant to Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide.In January, four activist groups opposed to GM crops, including the Sierra Club, the largest US environmental group, filed a lawsuit in California calling on the agriculture department to review its approval of the beets.A similar lawsuit led a federal judge to issue a nationwide ban last year against further planting of Monsanto’s Roundup Ready alfalfa, pending a further environmental review by the federal government.Leslie Lowe, of the ICCR, said that leading food companies, including McDonald’s, Camp­bell’s Soup, General Mills and Anheuser Busch, had already chosen not to use a variety of genetically engineered ingredients. “This is a front-burner brand, reputation and consumer confidence issue [for the companies],” she said.

526;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Sarkozy and Kerviel chase a French-American dream;;"This week has been a bonfire of French vanities. The Société Générale scandal has left the credibility of one of France’s most respected banks, its highly regarded chairman, Daniel Bouton, a classic product of the business elite, and the French capitalist system as a whole in ashes.This seems, at least, the prevailing impression outside France. How could a country that has always denounced the brutal excesses of Wall Street capitalism have fallen prey to what it likes to call le capitalisme sauvage? After all, even with its new arch-liberal president, Nicolas Sarkozy, France has always boasted an enlightened, state-led system of economic and social management – the antithesis of free-market, Anglo-Saxon capitalism.Mr Sarkozy, predictably, called this week for Mr Bouton’s head, but the SocGen board ignored him and reaffirmed confidence in its chairman. So did the bank’s employees. So much for so-called political cronyism at the top of leading French blue-chip companies. Even more interesting is the way the rogue trader – Jérôme Kerviel – is turning into something of a popular hero, or rather anti-hero, as the man who nearly broke one of the country’s biggest banks.All this suggests that the events at SocGen reflect a deeper phenomenon. For all the fear and loathing of capitalism in France and its criticisms of the US system, the country is not only becoming more American but has always embraced the American dream.There are more avenues honouring American presidents in Paris than anywhere else in Europe. The French have always been the first to embrace American trends in continental Europe – be it television soap operas, hamburgers or Starbucks cafés. France has become McDonald’s’ fastest-growing market. The French are also quick to decorate American celebrities with the Légion d’Honneur in spite of all the rhetoric of protecting francophone culture.As for the business establishment, it has always been fatally attracted to the American system for all its pretence of upholding a socially and state-managed model. In the 1980s, an upstart charismatic businessman, Bernard Tapie, made great waves by preaching modern US-style entrepreneurship, built up a corporate empire that turned out to be a house of cards, became a government minister, ended up in jail, and has since become a popular television and stage actor. The French still love him.Mr Tapie was something of an exception in his time. But that did not stop the old-style French corporate whiz-kids embracing the American dream. None more so than Jean-Marie Messier, the self-styled French Master of the Universe. He was a graduate of the elite École Nationale d’Administration, a rising star at Lazard in Paris, used and abused his extensive business and political contacts to behave like Napoleon and take on the world with Vivendi Universal. The company nearly collapsed; the French establishment forced Mr Messier out; but he has since bounced back with his own financial boutique. And the man in the street still has a certain admiration for this unusually bright and engaging maverick.Although much more low-key, Mr Bouton is by no means the caricature of the stuffy French banker. He may not be as flashy as Mr Messier, but has the same establishment pedigree – ENA, chef de cabinet of former prime minister Alain Juppé, etcetera – and has displayed a similar Wall Street penchant for dealmaking. In 1999, when SocGen’s fortunes were at a low and the bank was vulnerable, he had no hesitation in adopting what many in France might have considered at the time a pretty risky strategy.He decided to invest in eastern Europe, intensified SocGen’s push in derivatives and put pressure on traders to take risks and be more aggressive. In short, the stuff of Wall Street. Until the rogue trading scandal exploded this month, this strategy had paid off handsomely. SocGen became one of the world’s most profitable banks. Its independence was safe from the appetites of its main French rival, BNP Paribas, and foreign competitors.The young rogue trader has now put all this at risk. But the paradox is that, though he is the cause of the crisis at SocGen, he is not being branded as France’s new public enemy number one. Far from it. He is simply the manifestation of what the French consider the new Masters of the Universe. There is a romantic element. Here is someone who has come up from the back door and sought to prove he was not just good, but better than his privileged colleagues with smart degrees.The difference with his Wall Street counterparts is that he did not seem to be doing this simply for personal gain – he told investigators he wanted to earn a large but not outrageous bonus – but for recognition. This may explain why he is attracting, unusually, some popular sympathy. Mr Kerviel may have simply been chasing the American dream à la française – something that no one has done better than Mr Sarkozy.Forget for a moment Mr Sarkozy’s protectionist talk. Here is a partially Jewish immigrant, who failed to get into ENA, fought his way up the political ladder and, through unflinching ambition, has made it to the peak of the French system. He would like to go down in history as the French John F. Kennedy – private life and all. Like SocGen’s rogue trader, he is taking some risky positions that could blow up in his face.

Each year, thousands of McDonald’s managers from around the world travel to the 80-acre campus at the company’s headquarters outside Chicago to attend lectures and tutorials on leadership and how to run a business.The training programmes, which are recognised by the American Council on Education as college-level coursework and can be credited towards a degree at other universities, are translated into as many as 28 languages.Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive, recently strengthened the company’s global education programme by creating the McDonald’s Leadership Institute to provide finance and strategy training for its senior directors.In the UK, McDonald’s provides six months of restaurant-based training for its full-time restaurant workers (which it calls “crewpeople”) and offers optional online training at Ourlounge.co.uk that gives employees a chance to get a GCSE qualification in maths or English.It also trains 3,000 managers a year at its Management Training Centre in north London, and several thousand others at regional training centres.McDonald’s is trying to get its training courses accredited throughout Europe.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 1.5 per cent to 12,383.89 while the Nasdaq Composite rallied strongly to close up 1 per cent at 2,349.91 after it briefly turned negative in afternoon trade.Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said equities were showing tentative signs of stabilising. “Three out of the last four days we have finished up near the highs of the day, that’s a real turn from the way the market has behaved.”A factor that may decide if stocks can find a footing this week will be the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate policy. Since the Fed made an emergency 75 basis point rate cut last week investors have been divided over whether the central bank will cut rates 25bp or 50bp when its meeting concludes on Wednesday.The futures market has priced in an 86 per cent chance the Fed will take the more dovish approach – to lower the Fed funds rate to 3 per cent.“Anything less than 25bp would probably risk a significant negative reaction in the financial markets,” said Maury Harris, an economist at UBS Investment Research.In spite of the rally investors were still awaiting a clear signal about whether equities have become oversold or if recent upticks were merely the product of a fleeting bear-market rally.Given fears the economy is entering a recession, this week’s data on the state of the labour and housing markets are important.New home sales fell 4.7 per cent to a 604,000 annual rate in December, the lowest reading in 12 years, compared with expectations of about 650,000.The homebuilder sector pared early losses to extend last week’s 28 per cent rally as traders bet that rate cuts would help the sector. The S&P homebuilder index climbed 6.4 per cent to 426.29, with Lennar up 9 per cent at $18.50.“The stock market apparently believes the worst is over,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. “[But] we think the downside for activity and prices remains considerable. To repeat, there is no sign of a bottom in any of these data.”Confidence in the health of the US consumer took another dent on Monday after McDonald’s reported flat December same-store sales owing to a softening in consumer spending. The stock fell 5.6 per cent to $51.07 while rival Wendy’s gave up 5.3 per cent to $23.92. Also in the consumer sector, Sears Holdings rose 1.3 per cent to $100.28 after its chief executive left. Financial companies en­joyed the best of the gains, with Lehman Brothers rising 4.8 per cent to $60.63 and JPMorgan up 4.4 per cent at $45.57.After the close American Express said fourth quarter profit fell 10 per cent, in line with estimates, after it took a charge to cover bad loans. The shares closed up 4.3 per cent at $47.40 but fell 2.8 per cent after hours.The telecoms sector came under early pressure before rebounding after Verizon Communications reported weakness in its fixed line business. Quarterly earnings rose 3.9 per cent, in line with expectations and the shares closed up 0.9 per cent at $38.11. Corning, gained 3.3 per cent to $23.10 after it raised fourth-quarter profit 11 per cent amid heavy demand for glass used in flat-screen TVs and computers. Gains in the transport sector were limited after YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell to a $735.8m loss – far worse than expected. The shares fell 14.7 per cent to $16.08.Alliance Data Systems’ $6.76bn buy-out by Blackstone was put into doubt. Shares in the credit card services provider plunged 35.2 per cent to $42.48 while Blackstone slipped 1.1 per cent to $19.15.
529;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;‘Elite’ trust business above all, study says;;Business leaders heading to Davos for their annual dose of alpine networking might not realise it but their standing among global decision-makers is remarkably good.Some of the world’s biggest companies are reeling from the aftershocks of the credit crunch and some once-feted chief executives such as Merrill Lynch’s Stan O’Neal and Citigroup’s Chuck Prince have been ousted after their companies suffered multi-billion-dollar write-offs.But when Edelman, the public relations company, asked 3,100 representatives of the “opinion elite” – college-educated, wealthy, well-informed individuals in 18 countries – which institution they trusted, their answer was: business.The study, to be presented at the World Economic Forum that opens on Wednesday in Davos, found that business beat government and the media in the trust scales.Only non-governmental organisations scored a comparable level of trust.Edelman’s “Trust Barometer” found that leaders of the future were even more trusting of business than their older counterparts. Respondents between the ages of 25 and 34 showed higher trust in business than the 35-64 cohort in nine of the 12 countries polled for this category, including the US, China, Japan and the UK.Robert Bloom, a former US chief executive of Publicis, the advertising group, and author of the business strategy book The Inside Advantage, regards this “trust ­premium” as crucial for companies. “Trust is a very powerful emotional lever on customers,” he says.The Edelman study confirms this view: most of those polled said they would not buy products and services from a company they distrusted and, conversely, would take their custom to one they trusted.But Edelman unearthed some disturbing trends for US companies. Despite being highly trusted on their home turf, US blue chip companies such as the oil group Exxon Mobil and McDonald’s, the restaurant chain, found little sympathy among Europe’s educated elites.Exxon, for example, is trusted by nearly half of US respondents but only one in four British, French and German opinion-makers.Even more worrying for corporate bosses is their poor reputation as communicators among western elites. Fewer than one in four Americans and only one in three Europeans said they regarded a chief executive as a “credible” spokesperson for the company – an indication that the Enron-era scandals and more recent examples of huge payoffs for ousted executives still weigh on the public’s mind.“There is an issue of pay and performance and of rewarding perceived failure,” says Richard Edelman, the PR firm’s chief executive. “In addition, I am not sure that chief executives are getting out there and tackling important issues such as the environment.”But, in their battle to regain public trust, chief executives will have to fight some unexpected enemies. When young US opinion leaders were asked to choose the most credible source for corporate information, a surprising 55 per cent mentioned Wikipedia. The free online encyclopedia, written by users with minimal editing, came out above traditional outlets such as television and radio, and even above much-trumpeted “new media” such as blogs and social networking sites. Only articles in business publications scored more highly.For Mr Edelman, Wikipedia’s status as a fount of knowledge on corporate matters is a function of the democratisation of modern media. “Wikipedia, just like Google, represents the vox populi,” he says.
530;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-01-07T23:22:11Z;US coffee wars;;Better latte than never. Starbucks’ decision to re-appoint chairman and coffee pioneer Howard Schultz as its chief executive will not solve its problems overnight. But with the battle over specialty coffee rapidly escalating in the US, and its shares off almost 50 per cent in a year, Starbucks is taking the same route as Dell, Yahoo and others of turning to its founder to sort out the mess.The change comes as McDonald’s is turning up the heat by launching coffee bars at nearly 14,000 US locations. Admittedly, the fast food giant, better known for cheeseburgers than cappuccinos, may be biting off more than it can chew. But with McDonald’s tapping the high-margin coffee business for new growth, Starbucks cannot ignore the threat.McDonald’s has trounced competitors on its established turf with popular new menu items. But it will have to do more than poach a few Starbucks customers to justify an aggressive move into speciality coffees. McDonald’s has to convince its own customers to trade up – many of whom head for the Golden Arches for value meals, not for fancy coffee. With the US economy slowing, those customers are more likely to downgrade to even cheaper items.At the other end of the scale, few coffee aficionados rely on McDonald’s for their morning fix. Higher-end coffee drinkers will remain tough to recruit unless they decide that their usual Starbucks latte is too expensive.Starbucks brought some of this on itself, by becoming so ubiquitous that it naturally rubbed up against fast food chains. Mr Schultz’s appointment, alongside a pledge to slow growth in the US, is a clear acknowledgement of its missteps. Starbucks built up its customers’ coffee loyalty over decades, while McDonald’s seems convinced it can do so far more quickly. As Starbucks’ retrenchment shows, companies that deviate from their strengths often come to regret it.Post and read comments on this Lex
531;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2008-01-07T22:16:38Z;Wall St higher in volatile session;;Wall Street stocks ended a volatile session mostly higher on Monday as cautious traders tentatively took steps to stem the worst start to a year for US equities since 1932.In a reversal of last year’s market leadership healthcare, utilities and consumer staples companies spurred gains as investors fearing a recession sought defensive stocks.Energy and mining companies were sold as commodity prices retreated while technology shares fell for a seventh consecutive session as confidence ebbed away on fears of slowing growth.Although investors found pockets of strength in biotechnology and telecommunication, investment banks retreated on fears of further writedowns in the sectorInvestors also became nervous after Washington confirmed a naval incident involving Iranian vessels.The S&P 500 fluctuated throughout the session but closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,416.18. The gains were far from convincing with almost half of the index’s members closing to the downside.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,827.49, stemming a fall of 3.5 per cent in the first three days of this year, its worst start in 76 years.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent lower at 2,499.46, having twice fallen as much as 1.3 per cent in the session before rebounding. Shares in computer hardware companies trailed.Traders kept a close eye on support levels in the futures market. The March S&P 500 contract was at 1,424, just shy of its contract low of 1,418 set in November.“The stock market is starting off 2008 in a fairly challenged state with earnings estimates under scrutiny, credit conditions still very unstable and recession fears pretty much everywhere,” Tobias Levkovitch, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, said.The fourth-quarter earnings season starts this week with US corporate profits expected to fall 9.8 per cent, according to Thomson Financial, marking a second consecutive quarter of negative earnings growth.Average earnings fell 4.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2007, the first year-on-year decline since the start of 2002, as writedowns at financial companies and losses in the homebuilder sector dragged profits into negative territory.Expectations for this year are much improved but Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said Wall Street projections for 15.1 per cent earnings growth in 2008 were “wildly optimistic”.Alcoa will on Wednesday become the first Dow component to report fourth-quarter results. Its shares fell 5.1 per cent to $33.11 after analysts cut earnings estimates, citing lower aluminium prices. The SPDR exchange-traded fund for the materials sector fell 1.2 per cent to $40.29.The technology sector was in focus as the Consumer Electronics Show got under way in Las Vegas. Tech outperformed last year but the sector fell sharply last week after Intel was downgraded by JPMorgan. IBM fell 1.1 per cent to $100.05 after UBS downgraded the shares from “buy” to “neutral” citing exposure to the financial services sector.UBS analyst Ben Reitzes also cut his price target on the stock from $133 to $113. Dell shed 3.8 per cent to $21.26 after the same analyst slashed his price target from $29 to $25.Also in the technology sector, CNET Networks slipped 1.4 per cent to $8.44 after a consortium of investment funds led by Jana Partners said it was looking to take over the online media company’s board.Healthcare companies made ground after Morgan Stanley upgraded the shares of Eli Lilly. It rose 5.3 per cent to $54.55. The S&P pharmaceuticals index gained 0.8 per cent to 373.32 points.The biotechnology sector gained after Celgene’s 2008 earnings guidance pleased investors. Celgene added 1.7 per cent to $50.49. Biogen Idec rose 7.2 per cent to $59.22 after its 2007 profit forecast beat estimates.A report that McDonald’s was to launch coffee bars at 14,000 US restaurants spurred a 1.7 per cent gain to $58.03.Starbucks gained 1.5 per cent to $18.38 in spite of the threat to its position. The shares have fallen 10 per cent this month.Investment banking stocks were weak amid fears of further writedowns as earnings season approaches.A broader index of financial companies rose with Sallie Mae leading the way, up 7 per cent at $17.83.
532;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-12-10T21:58:38Z;Wall St at highest level in a month;;Wall Street stocks hit their highest level in a month on Monday as investors bet that Tuesday’s Federal Reserve meeting would deliver another interest rate cut and help ease the current credit squeeze.Financial stocks were the main focus after UBS revealed a large writedown and capital-raising while MBIA, the bond insurer, also unveiled details of a capital injection.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,515.96 points, its highest level since November 6. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 13,727.03 and the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.5 per cent to 2,718.95.Investors anticipate at least a quarter-percentage point reduction in the 4.5 per cent Fed Funds rate when the Federal Open Market Committee meets.A larger reduction in the discount rate, currently at 5 per cent, is a possibility, analysts say, to boost bank lending amid elevated money market rates.News of a $10bn writedown at UBS, which may cause the Swiss firm to report a full-year net loss, meant investor attention was directed at the US banking sector, amid fears of more subprime-related losses.However a broad range of financial stocks made strong gains after traders were cheered by UBS’s ability to raise fresh capital. Investors in Singapore and the Middle East agreed to buy SFr13bn ($11.5bn) in convertible bonds.Citigroup, 1.3 per cent higher at $34.77, set an example for the sector last month when it bolstered its capital reserves through a $7.5bn capital injection from Abu Dhabi’s investment arm.Lehman Brothers, up 3.4 per cent at $65.65, reports its fourth-quarter results on Thursday, while Goldman Sachs, up 2.9 per cent at $224.21 and Morgan Stanley, 5.2 per cent higher at $54.37, are among the banks releasing quarterly and full-year earnings next week.Bank of America served a reminder of the problems facing major US banks after its Columbia Management unit closed a $12bn money fund amid losses on complex asset-backed securities. The shares rose 2.8 per cent to $46.64.Trading in shares of MBIA was halted briefly before the municipal bond insurer announced a $1bn capital infusion by Warburg Pincus, the private equity firm, including the sale of $500m in common stock at $31.The stock climbed 13.2 per cent to $33.95 when trading resumed, in spite of a warning that the company saw a “significantly greater” mark-to-market loss in the fourth quarter. The capital raising may help MBIA avoid a damaging cut to its triple-A credit rating.Ambac Financial, a rival monoline insurer, jumped 9.6 per cent to $29.42 while MGIC Investment, the mortgage insurer, gained 11.3 per cent to $29.99.McDonald’s cheered the market after same-store sales rose 8.2 per cent last month, more than expected, helped by particularly strong results from its European and Asian operations. The fast food chain’s shares rose 2.9 per cent to $61.90 and are up 40 per cent this year.Circuit City Stores gained 3.6 per cent to $8.04 after an analyst upgraded the shares, predicting a store reorganisation could save the troubled electronics retailer at least $50m a year.But in the biotechnology sector Celgenefell 14.3 per cent to $49.18 after some analysts were disappointed by results from trials of a blood cancer drug.Volatility, as measured by the CBOE Vix index, dipped again on Monday but remains at historically elevated levels. Large share price swings have unsettled retail investors but laid fertile ground for program traders.The Hennessee Hedge Fund index, a measure of hedge fund performance, declined only 1.6 per cent in November, compared to a 4.4 per cent fall on the S&P 500. E. Lee Hennessee, managing principal of Hennessee Group, said: “The increase in equity volatility has provided good opportunities for long/short equity strategies this year.”In economic news, pending home sales rose 0.6 per cent in October, according to a National Association of Realtors’ index. The rise follows an upwardly revised 1.4 per cent increase in September. However the latest reading is still 18.4 per cent below that of a year ago.The S&P homebuilder index put on 4.5 per cent to 399.94. DR Horton gained 6.5 per cent to $14.76.
533;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-11-19T07:18:30Z;NACG: Gritty consulting on oil-rich sands;;Working in the Alberta oil sands region – second only to Saudi Arabia for the size of its reserves – can take its toll on any company. Tough, constantly changing operating conditions stretch employees and managers of the mining companies and contractors who are working there to the limit.At the heart of the region, 300 miles north of Edmonton, is Fort McMurray. “It’s mind-boggling what is going on there and it really is a boom town,” says Eric Tinker. “You see it everywhere – from never being able to get a hotel room, to the prices you’re paying at McDonald’s, to just the traffic jam on a little two-line highway.”Mr Tinker is a US-based principal at Celerant Consulting, and headed a changing cast from the UK-founded, global firm that collectively worked in the region for more than a year. Their task was to shape up the Canadian mining contractor North American Construction Group (NACG) for its US parent company’s debut in an environment that is just as tough, albeit in a different way – Wall Street.Welcome to the world of extreme consulting. “Just the sheer physical challenges made this a very exciting opportunity for us,” says Mr Tinker. “We’ve done plenty of projects in multiple locations, some of them very challenging, but this one took that to a more extreme level.”Just getting consultants to the client was a logistical problem in itself. “We had flights, then more flights, and then drives,” says Mr Tinker. Choosing team members who could cope with the physical rigours of the job, and rotating the team for the various tasks involved, was a further challenge.Celerant was engaged in late 2005 by NACG’s owners, a mainly US consortium of private equity investors who had bought the company two years earlier. Family owned for the preceeding 50 years, it had huge reserves of expertise, a strong, long-standing relationship with customers and a robust fleet of equipment, much of it built on massive lines.But there was a raw, highly individualistic entrepreneurial culture and an operational attitude that could be summed up as “dig first, measure later”. Celerant’s task was to transform the company’s operational practices so that it would be ready for the scrutiny of public investors and regulators – the owners were planning an initial public offering.The task was right up Celerant’s street as the consultancy focuses on operational transition, getting down to the nitty-gritty at all levels in a company and straightening out kinks in the linkages between top and bottom. At NACG, a programme called Cobra – Changing Organisational Behaviours, Results and Attitudes – was specifically designed with the client and speaks for itself.Even so, there was initial scepticism within NACG – especially at middle and lower management levels – about whether Celerant had bitten off more than it could chew.But Mr Tinker says there was strong support from top management, including Rod Ruston, NACG’s president.By securing some early wins, bringing key NACG employees into project teams, and working to show individuals how they fitted into the big picture, the Celerant team (which reached 17 at its peak) began to show it could turn things round.One particular challenge, says Mr Tinker, was that the engagement was really a portfolio of many different projects, each with their own start and stop dates. So the start-up elements of Celerant’s approach had to be repeated, working with different client employees in a particular location. “Once you get the project rolling and people are used to their roles, things start to smooth out a bit,” he says.Celerant’s initial contact was with the private-equity owners but as the project went on the management team came more to the fore. Interaction with the owners came mainly via board meetings and other conversations, says Mr Tinker.The consultants were aware that an IPO was in the offing, even though they did not have details of the timing, so there was pressure on them and on the management team as a result of the ownership structure. But, as Mr Tinker notes: “We structure all our projects so there is a sense of urgency to deliver the results.”The vindication of the project was the IPO in November last year of NACG’s parent company, North American Energy Partners, on the New York Stock Exchange.The project produced annualised cost savings of US$32m at NACG – exceeding the US$22.5m in the original business case and based on improved productivity and better equipment utilisation. But Mr Tinker also points to the way it helped develop or enhance leadership at all levels in the company, and arm managers at all levels with the data to run the company more professionally.“Celerant gave us an unbiased assessment of our needs, then provided the drive to stay on focus and get the job done,” says Mr Ruston.
534;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-10-29T21:13:27Z;Wall St higher on rate cut hopes;;Wall Street shares were higher on Monday as traders focused on expectations of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve this week.Energy stocks surged as crude oil futures hit $93 for the first time. Materials stocks also attracted buyers, buoyed by rising commodity prices. Some positive earnings news also cheered the market.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,540.98, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent at 2,817.44 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also up 0.5 per cent at 13,870.26. However the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks was flat at 821.72.A two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which starts on Tuesday, was at the front of investors’ minds on Monday.Interest rate futures fully priced in a one-quarter-percentage point cut in the Fed Funds rate to 4.50 per cent on Wednesday, with a small chance of a reduction to 4.25 per cent.“We do not think the Fed will risk disappointing the markets at this week’s FOMC. Although inflation concerns linger, these will likely have to take a backseat to more immediate concerns,” analysts at Credit Suisse said.Chastened by concerns about the health of the US economy, investors have continued to buy large-cap stocks which generate a large proportion of their sales overseas. McDonald’s, up 1.2 per cent at $59.18, and IBM up 0.9 per cent at $114.80, were among the biggest risers on the Dow on Monday.“Large-cap companies with higher international exposure and secular growth drivers should continue to lead [earnings per share] growth and outperform,” analysts at UBS Investment Research said.But Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, had some cautionary words.“In theory, this [strategy] takes advantage of faster economic growth outside the US, with additional translation gains from a weaker dollar,” he said. “Yet, the ‘bite’ of higher interest rates in Europe and a strong currency may be causing leading indicators to roll over across the pond, increasing the potential for 2008 earnings misses.”In earnings news, third-quarter profit at Verizon Communications declined compared with a year ago, but beat expectations. Revenues increased 5.8 per cent to $23.8bn. The stock gained 0.9 per cent at $45.99.Humana, the health insurer, reported a 90 per cent jump in quarterly earnings to $302.4m and boosted its 2007 and 2008 earnings guidance.

536;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-10-17T04:38:45Z;Food groups shape up for action;;"The food industry is battling to avert tighter regulation as the government’s crackdown on obesity trains an ever brighter spotlight on its activities.In its attempt to strike a balance between defending its products and appeasing the healthy-eating lobby, the industry has come a long way since early 2005 when Sir John Sunderland, the chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, declared: “There is no such thing as a good or a bad food, only a good or bad diet.”With evidence mounting that the problem of obesity is worsening rather than improving, the industry has become more circumspect in its comments – and more audacious in its actions.Although food groups still maintain that people must take responsibility for their own diets and health, they now acknowledge they can help them do that.Nestlé, the manufacturer of Kit Kats, has cut back the amount of sugar used by 12 per cent and reduced it by a third in the Tip Top dessert topping widely served to children.Mars has promised to stop marketing confectionery to consumers younger than 12 by the end of the year, raising its current threshold from six-year-olds. Unilever has emulated the move and plans to advertise only “healthier” foods to under-11s by the end of next year.McDonald’s is lowering the amount of trans-fat it uses in cooking fried foods to about 2 per cent, from 10 per cent; PepsiCo, which owns the Walkers crisp brand, has created wholegrain snacks called SunBites; and Cadbury’s offers a broader range of portion sizes in chocolate.The Food and Drink Federation, which represents the industry, said: “We’ve made a massive contribution here in the UK. We’re widely recognised for leading the world on …reformulating products, extending consumer choice [in products low in fat and sugar], and …improved nutritional labelling.”But obesity experts say the industry will need to take more radical action if it is to avoid regulation.Neville Rigby, the director of policy at the International Obesity Task Force, said: “The industry has not got the message yet that, across the board, they have to make big changes.”He says that while some companies are voluntarily adapting to the new climate, others are dragging their feet.The industry is unlikely to meet the government’s 2010 voluntary salt reduction targets, he maintains, although some companies claim already to have met them for specific products.Mr Rigby believes governments should consider following the lead of Denmark, which has placed a near-ban on trans-fats.Consumer organisations have called on the European Commission to implement a mandatory nutritional labelling system after the Food Standard Agency’s preference for a “traffic light” system was ignored by many companies. Instead, they went ahead and implemented guideline daily amounts (GDAs).Jim Murray, the director of BEUC, the European consumers’ organisation, says GDAs are too complicated and there is a need for something simpler. The FSA has asked independent researchers to evaluate the different systems.Health campaigners also say that while food companies could do more, so too could governments.Kurt Widhalm, the president of the European Childhood Obesity Group, wants to see more government-backed programmes. He proposes a European Academy for the Prevention of Obesity be established to finance research into the condition."
537;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-10-16T05:16:06Z;BBC to invest in iPlayer despite cost-cutting;;Cost-cutting will not constrain the BBC’s digital ambitions, the broadcaster indicated on Monday as it unveiled plans to extend the reach of its iPlayer online video service.“I strongly believe, as does Mark [Thompson, BBC director-general] and the rest of the board, that we do not intend to beggar the digital future,” said Ashley Highfield, BBC’s director of future media and technology.His comments came ahead of Mr Thompson’s meeting with the BBC Trust on Wednesday to outline cost-cutting plans that could affect up to 2,800 jobs at the corporation.“If we do not invest in this future, if we instead draw up the wagons around our existing services, the BBC will rapidly cease to be relevant to our audiences and will lose its power to be a force for good in British national life,” Mr Thompson wrote in the Sunday Times this weekend.The Trust faced “a difficult judgment” striking the right balance between investment in quality content and new digital services, Mr Thompson added, saying the BBC must “free some fresh investment” for digital distribution initiatives.The iPlayer, which allows viewers to catch up on programmes online up to a week after they have been aired, has caused concern among commercial rivals, whose complaints forced the BBC to rein back its original proposals when it began a trial of the software in April, excluding most book readings and classical music.On Monday Mr Highfield unveiled plans to make versions of the iPlayer accessible to Apple Mac users, members of Facebook’s social network site and 7,500 wi-fi hotspots in Canary Wharf, Heathrow and McDonald’s branches around the country.A deal with The Cloud, a service provider operating the UK’s largest wi-fi network, will allow viewers to download episodes of Doctor Who or Strictly Come Dancing in BAA airports and branches of Coffee Republic to their laptops without paying internet connection fees.The BBC hopes wi-fi distribution – including a version of bbc.co.uk for mobile phones – will attract younger audiences, which the BBC often finds hard to reach.A separate agreement with Adobe Systems will enable the BBC to make iPlayer available as a streaming service for users of Macintosh and Linux operating systems by Christmas, but will stop short of replicating the download service currently available only to Microsoft Windows users.Mr Highfield, who also announced plans to link the iPlayer to online TV listings pages of newspapers and magazines, played down concerns of internet service providers about the strain the iPlayer could place on their networks. “The UK’s internet infrastructure is more than capable of coping with the demand,” he said.BBC dividedThe BBC is suffering from divided leadership, a House of Lords committee claimed on Monday as the government rejected its call for greater clarity about the relationship between the broadcaster’s management and the new BBC Trust.“When the BBC is under attack …there is an urgent need for a united response,” said Lord Fowler, chairman of the Lords communications committee.

539;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-10-03T07:26:02Z;McDonald’s: Le Big Mac at home in land of slow food;;France is probably not a country one would associate with a booming trade in Big Macs. After all, this is a nation known for its love of good food and wine. It is also here that a group of sheep farmers led by José Bové became overnight folk heroes after dismantling a McDonald’s in the south of France eight years ago.Such is the Gallic resentment of the US fast food chain that the country’s influential daily Le Monde once warned that McDonald’s “commercial hegemony threatens agriculture and [its] cultural hegemony insidiously ruins alimentary behaviour – sacred reflections of French identity”. Yet nationalist rhetoric has done little to stem the growth of McDo, as the Golden Arches are referred to in France.The country is now McDonald’s most profitable subsidiary in Europe, with 2006 sales hitting €2.7bn ($3.8bn). That is a 9.8 per cent increase from the year before and is nearly twice the sales growth seen in the US during the same period.Having opened 29 restaurants – or 4 per cent of the chain’s new outlets worldwide – last year, the group has 1,085 in France. Together, they accounted for 31.5 per cent of total operational profit made in Europe, ahead of the UK and Germany.For Jean-Pierre Petit, chief executive of McDonald’s France, its success in the land of simmering cassoulets and slow food can be attributed to a combination of social changes – such as the rise of the two-income family – shrewd branding and sheer luck. “Luck because we are in a market where there are relatively few other fast food chains,” he says.While the growing number of working parents has contributed to the need to eat in a hurry, Mr Petit says the group’s strategy of positioning itself as a casual diner rather than a fast food restaurant has been important.Under Denis Hennequin, Mr Petit’s predecessor who is now head of McDonald’s Europe, McDonald’s France established a design studio in Paris during the 1990s and started spending money creating more congenial and sophisticated environments in its restaurants.In place of the bright fluorescent lights and tacky bolted-down plastic yellow and white furniture that have become ubiquitous fixtures in the US, visitors to McDonald’s in France find low lampshades, wooden tables, upholstered seating and (imitation) leather banquettes.Some have TV screens, internet connections and iPod stations. There is not a single Ronald McDonald in sight. In a company that made its fortunes from standardisation and cost cutting, Mr Hennequin’s strategy for McDonald’s France was revolutionary.But the gamble paid off and the result is that the typical French consumer spends €9.47 per visit, about twice that spent in the US.“French people want quick, affordable food but they also want to be able to sit down and eat a hot meal,” says Mr Petit. “At the moment, between expensive sit-down bistros where you will spend €20 on lunch and a cold sandwich from the boulangerie, there’s not a lot of choices in between,” he adds. “By creating a pleasant environment where customers can stay and enjoy a full meal, we are filling in that gap.”US executives were so taken with the result that some of them have begun to launch the US’s own redesign plan while Mr Hennequin was asked do the same in Europe.Other chains such as KFC have now moved to overhaul the interiors of its French outlets.The menu has also been fine-tuned to cater to local palates. While Big Macs and French fries remain standard fare, the group has added items such as the Croque McDo, its take on the croque monsieur grilled emmental cheese and ham sandwich, to its offerings. French fries are served with mayonnaise, espresso comes with a piece of chocolate and French pastries such as lemon tartelettes and flan are de rigueur at its Starbucks-like McCafés.But operating in France has not been without difficulties. In a country of a 35-hour work week, 20 per cent value-added tax and strict labour laws, McDonald’s France had its fair share of run-ins with labour unions. Workers at one McDonald’s in Paris went on strike for 112 days to protest against their working conditions.The need to show McDonald’s supports French farmers and workers became only more urgent following Mr Bové’s protest in 1999. The incident prompted the group to begin a large advertising campaign listing how many French cows, chickens, potatoes and heads of lettuce it used each year.It also started running an “open doors” programme where customers are invited to take tours of its kitchens and meet with suppliers.The campaign appears to be working.Today cash registers at McDonald’s France are ringing up 1m sales a day.
540;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
541;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-09-26T07:02:05Z;Wall Street dispatch: Corporates look to the longer-term;;For many non-financial companies, the summer credit squeeze might appear to have had little impact.“I guess its increased our cost of borrowing at the margin, but it’s not a big deal,” says a senior executive at a top pharmaceutical company.But the changed environment brings new challenges and opportunites for those who are running many company finance departments, even assuming the Federal Reserve has done enough to stave off a US recession,The companies most obviously affected are those which have been hit by the crisis of confidence among commercial paper investors. Lower-rated companies have seen the cost of borrowing in the commercial paper markets soar. This has prompted many to withdraw and fall back on bank debt, which is less convenient and more expensive.But commercial paper investors have loosened up in recent weeks, allowing companies to go back in. Morgan Stanley said last week that it had been tapping the commercial paper market to ensure it had liquidity.“If there are opportunities, we don’t want to have to say ‘no’ because we don’t have the cash,” says David Sidwell, chief financial officer.Assuming liquidity returns, it is unclear whether some companies will be reluctant to make as much use of the commercial paper market as they did previously.Certainly, some companies that have had financial scares in the past have subsequently been very careful about becoming overdependent on commercial paper.In the past few weeks, the differential between short-term commercial paper and longer-term debt has been so striking that many companies have been tapping into longer-term debt, says Tom Mercein, head of US debt capital markets at Credit Suisse.“As markets as a whole have become more volatile, the insurance policy implicit in [long-] term funding is more valuable,” he says, pointing out that August had the fifth highest investment grade bond issuance ever.At the same time, there are opportunities to buy back debt at attractive prices. Michael Corbat, head of Citigroup’s corporate bank, says that in these volatile times companies need to keep enough cash on hand to take advantage of new opportunities.But they should be wary of having too much cash on the balance sheet.“The market doesn’t give much benefit for that.”While companies appear to be cutting down on share buybacks to preserve liquidity, some well-funded groups are taking advantage of their low share prices. McDonald’s recently raised its dividend by 50 per cent as part of its plan to return $17bn to shareholders by 2009, a move rewarded by a strong reaction from the share price.Higher costs of borrowing and great share price volatility imply that companies may face a higher cost of capital.This in turn would affect their optimal capital structure, which would involve lower reliance on debt financing.However, the investor pressure on companies to have an efficient capital structure will not have disappeared. Activist hedge funds will still be prowling around looking for companies that are undergeared – even if private equity firms may be less aggressive.On the other hand, companies at the lower end of the investment-grade credit rating spectrum need to be more careful than before to ensure that their actions will not jeopardise their investment grade status.Investment banks will be hoping that the changed conditions will stimulate demand among investment grade companies for issues of hybrid securities that provide low-cost finance without damaging credit ratings.Mr Corbat says that in the new environment, companies will also be looking to less obvious sources of liquidity such as securitisation and tightening up on supply chain managment.According to a paper by Citigroup’s Financial Strategy Group, recent market events are likely to prompt a renewed emphasis on risk management.“Of particular importance are exposures to energy and commodity prices as well as exchange rates.“In addition, risk exposure may arise from the financial profile of key customers or suppliers.”The market turmoil also has strategic implications, particularly given the overhang of leveraged loan commitments, which is likely to mean a prolonged reduction in private equity activity.Companies that were considering a leveraged buy-out of all or part of their business may have to look elsewhere. Strategic buyers, who have frequently been outbid by private equity firms, will suddenly have a clearer run.This, combined with the weakness of the dollar, could make it a good time for European and Asian companies to buy US assets – if, of course, they are not scared off by the threat of a US recession.david.wighton@ft.com

Talks between the two sides were continuing on Monday.Other automotive stocks were also in focus.Ford was 3 per cent higher at $8.48. Alan Mulally, chief executive, said he expected North American operations to return to profitability by 2009.Technology was again the standout market sector after Dell announced plans to sell computers in China via a retail chain of electronics stores. The shares gained 0.4 per cent to $27.87. EMC climbed 7.8 per cent to $20.51 after upgrades from analysts.Apple, up 2.9 per cent to $148.28, and Google, 1.4 per cent firmer at $568.02, both hit fresh record highs on Monday.Microsoft also saw gains, up 1.5 per cent at $29.08, ahead of the launch the third instalment of its Halo computer game and amid reports it was in talks to buy a stake in Facebook, the social networking site.The Nasdaq 100 index of leading technology stocks on Monday outperformed other major indices, closing up 0.4 per cent at 2057.25.So far this year the index has risen 16.9 per cent, and remains on course for its best year since 2003 as investors look to favour large-cap hi-tech shares with international reach.“The credit crisis hasn’t gone away, so you would expect big caps to do well. Risk is being priced a bit more appropriately now,” said Brian Gendreau, investment strategist at ING Investment Management.Four sectors – technology, energy, industrials and materials – are driving upside in the market, Mr Gendreau said. “They account for all of the gains this year.”In the broader market large-cap companies with big international exposure outperformed the market on Monday.Coca-Cola was up 0.3 per cent at $56.70 while McDonaldsput on 0.3 per cent to $54.96.Energy stocks were among the weakest of the leading S&P 500 sectors on Monday as crude oil prices slipped in New York. US crude futures closed down 67 cents at $80.95 a barrel.But as oil remained near all-time highs, inflation fears persisted.“We have a lot of economic news coming out this week. Probably most of it will show that the economy is heading for [only] modest growth,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “That could be a problem for the market if oil prices remain high.”Existing home sales for August are released on Tuesday, while new home sales are due on Thursday, when August durable goods figures will also arrive.Personal consumption and income data for August and inflation data round out the week on Friday.“We expect weakness in new and existing home sales for August and continuing weakness in the S&P/Case Shiller home price indexes,” UBS Investment Research said in a note on Monday.The S&P 500 homebuilders index was lower again on Monday, down 5 per cent at 428.84.Financials and investment banking stocks also pulled the major indices lower.Citigroup shares closed 2 per cent lower at $46.59, Morgan Stanley shed 3.3 per cent to $62.29 and Lehman Brothers was 2.5 per cent lower at $61.13.

543;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-09-14T18:05:58Z;Energy leads way in choppy week for Wall St;;"Wall Street experienced another choppy week of trading and with stocks slightly firmer on Friday, the important benchmarks recorded one of their better weeks since the squeeze in the credit and money markets emerged in mid-July.That relative calm coupled with light trading volumes came before the Federal Reserve meeting and third-quarter earnings results from leading investment banks next week. The improved mood in stocks reflected hopes a policy easing next week would prevent financial market stresses infecting the broader economy, analysts say.A record low in the dollar against the euro and a record high in crude oil did not derail stocks this week. Sluggish retail sales data on Friday, on the heels of a weak employment report the previous week, have reinforced expectations that policy-makers will ease rates at least a quarter-percentage point on Tuesday.“A rate cut will certainly make the markets feel the Fed is with them,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.In choppy trade, the S&P 500 index closed up 0.02 per cent at 1,484.25; a rise of 2.1 per cent this week. The S&P has now rebounded more than 5 per cent from its mid-August low point of 1,406.70 when credit concerns intensified. That leaves the benchmark slightly more than 4 per cent below its record close of 1,553 from mid-July.“The rhetoric from Wall Street is for a rate cut – but if you watch what they have done, the leadership seen in stocks reflects expectations of a better economy, not a crisis,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Although energy stocks led the S&P’s major sectors higher, retailers and financials also rebounded smartly this week. Technology, which had done well in previous weeks, lagged behind in recent days.Homebuilders also underperformed. That group has now fallen more than two-thirds from its peak in 2005.The Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.04 per cent at 2,602.18; a gain of 1.4 per cent since Monday.The weak dollar helped boost the appeal of large multinational companies, such as those in the technology sector, and the Nasdaq 100 index was up 2.2 per cent this week, outpacing the Composite.Among big technology stocks, Apple rose 5.3 per cent to $138.81 as it announced the sale of 1m iPhones. UBS raised its price estimate to $182.The Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed up 0.1 per cent on Friday to 13,442.52; a gain of 2.5 per cent during the week.This was the Dow’s best week since a rise of 2.8 per cent for the week ending April 20.Several Dow stocks surged this week. McDonald’s rallied 12.6 per cent to $55.45 and set a record high of $55.51 on Friday. The fast food group announced a 50 per cent increase in its annual cash dividend to $1.50 a share after posting a 8.1 per cent rise in global same-store sales during August.Boeing gained 4.8 per cent to $99.35, as the aircraft maker said it had won a $1.1bn US Air Force deal.As oil entered record territory, Exxon Mobil rallied 3.4 per cent to $88.67.JPMorgan, a Dow banking stock, rose 4.6 per cent to $45.54 as investors continued to discriminate among financials. The S&P Financials sector was up 2.6 per cent this week, reversing some of the 5 per cent loss in the previous two weeks. The S&P Investment bank index rose 5.8 per cent; its best weekly performance since mid-April. It had largely repaired the damage of the previous two weeks.Among the brokerages, Lehman outperformed with a rise of 12.4 per cent to $59.50.Bear Stearns rallied 11.2 per cent to $117.19 and steadily accrued gains from Monday, when a filing revealed financier Joseph Lewis was the investment bank’s single largest shareholder after a stake-building that began two months ago.Attention will now focus on sector earnings. “The major investment banks, namely Lehman, Bear, and Goldman report and undoubtedly will help set the tone for stocks and help gauge why damage was done over the last few months,” said David Ader, bond strategist at RBS Greenwich
Capital.Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, plunged early this week to a low of $16.18 as fears about its ability to secure financing intensified.On Thursday, the bank secured $12bn in financing and the stock rose 14 per cent. It was rose a further 2.6 per cent to $19.42 on Friday."
544;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-09-13T20:42:57Z;Wall Street rally led by blue chips;;Wall Street stocks rose sharply higher on Thursday, buoyed by tentative signs of stability in money markets before next week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve.Stocks also held up in the face of a new record high for the price of oil, as benchmark West Texas Intermediate closed above $80 a barrel for the first time.The S&P 500 index rose 0.8 per cent to close at 1,483.95, outpacing the Nasdaq Composite’s gain of 0.4 per cent to 2,601.06.As stocks rallied, equity volatility, as measured by the Vix index, eased just 0.8 per cent.Financials were one of the best performing sectors in the S&P, while the top stock was Countrywide, up 13.9 per cent at $18.93, which more than reversed its losses earlier this week. The largest US mortage lender said it had arranged $12bn in additional secured borrowing capacity.Another sign that credit conditions were starting to stabilise was seen in the latest weekly data on the commercial paper market released by the Federal Reserve. Outstanding CP declined for a fifth successive week but the pace was much slower.“The decline is also the smallest since the CP tempest began last month,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.“The notion that the moderation might signal the worst of the crisis is over is corroborated by anecdotal evidence of buyers beginning to re-enter, albeit on a very, very tentative scale, the CP market.”Lehman Brothers continued its recent rebound before third-quarter results next week with a rise of 4.6 per cent to $59.68. The bank’s shares have rallied nearly 13 per cent this week.The economic calendar picks up on Friday when retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilisation reports arrive. The information will provide policymakers with their last pieces of data before they meet next week to discuss monetary policy.Investors expect at least a 25 basis point cut in the 5.25 per cent Fed Funds rate. But given the continued strains in global money markets facing financial institutions, some economists and investors are calling for at least a half-percentage point easing.The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the major benchmarks on Thursday with a rally of 1 per cent to 13,424.88. A number of Dow components were in the news, led by General Motors, up 10 per cent at $33.29, after the United Auto Workers union indicated a willingness to help cut healthcare costs.McDonald’s gained 6.1 per cent to $54.30 amd set a record high of $54.68 after it announced a 50 per cent increase in its annual cash dividend to $1.50 a share. The company said this week that global same-store sales rose 8.1 per cent in August. The stock has rallied more than 10 per cent since Monday.Citigroup said: “Positive global momentum combined with shareholder friendly initiatives position McDonald’s well in a challenging market environment,” as it maintained a $58 target on the stock.Microsoftraised its quarterly dividend by a cent and the stock was up 0.8 per cent at $29.16.Merck was another Dow stock on the rise, with a gain of 0.4 per cent to $49.86 after Bank of America upgraded the pharmaceutical giant to a ‘buy’ with a price target of $57.Shares in Exxon Mobil were 1.1 per cent higher at $88.62, boosted by record oil prices. Other stocks in the news included, Target, up 2.7 per cent at $64.42 after the retailer said it might sell $7bn in credit-card receivables. Analysts at Citigroup said: “It is a positive that Target is taking steps to determine if there is additional value that can be returned to shareholders.“Bill Ackman’s 9.6 per cent stake in the company could have prompted management to take action, in our view.”Qualcomm rose 3.4 per cent to $39.17 after a judge halted an import ban on mobile phones containing the company’s 3G handsets. It represents a legal victory in the chipmaker’s patent dispute with rival Broadcom, whose shares rose 1.4 per cent at $35.87.Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 4.2 per cent to $13.30 after it announced a collaboration with Ortho-McNeil, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, up 1 per cent at $63.11, for the treatment of various medical disorders.Biogen rose 1.1 per cent to $65.40, and reversed losses in early trade after UBS downgraded the biotech drug maker to “sell” and maintained a $58 price target.First Data closed a fraction firmer at $33.39. Investors focused on talk that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which engineered a $26bn buy-out of the credit card processor, could delay the sale of loans to fund that deal.The stock remained below the $34 a share buy-out price.
545;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Wall St rises in broad-based rally;;US stocks rose sharply on Tuesday, amid a broad-based rally that included a rebound in the battered financial sector.The S&P 500 index closed 1.4 per cent higher at 1,471.49, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.5 per cent to 2,597.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.4 per cent at 13,308.39.A record close in crude oil boosted energy stocks and the sector was one of the leading industry groups in the S&P. Higher oil prices failed to dent the broad market’s rise, but volumes were light, said traders. Stocks rallied before and after a speech on global imbalances by Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman.Mr Bernanke’s remarks did not address monetary policy. Ahead of the central bank’s policy meeting next week, investors remain unsure whether the 5.25 per cent Fed funds rate will be cut by either a quarter, or a half-percentage point.TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said: “So far, the Fed is having to base its rate call on moderate growth indicators, a jobs market that is slowing but not contracting, and an unprecedented and persistent financial market upset that has the capacity to turn a soft landing into a hard one”.Georges Yared, chief financial officer at Yared Research, said: “The equity market is fully expecting a 25 basis point cut, and ultimately the driver of further rate cuts rests on how the consumer reacts to tighter lending standards.”Money market rates remained at elevated levels and investors are watching how much commercial paper will be refinanced this week.Analysts at Citigroup said: “By our estimates, a staggering $700bn are coming due for refinancing this week alone.“As a result, this will likely further increase the strains in global money markets, with the dollar markets likely to bear the brunt.”Financial stocks have borne the brunt of the recent turmoil in markets, and showed signs of a modest rebound on Tuesday.Ahead of third-quarter earnings next week, the S&P investment bank index rose 0.7 per cent in volatile trading. It has risen about 9 per cent from its low in mid-August, but remains 20 per cent below its peak set in June.Of the brokers, Lehman Brothers led gains with a rise of 2.5 per cent to $55.18. Goldman Sachs trailed its rivals with a fall of 0.1 per cent to $183.50.Hans Mikkelsen, strategist at Banc of America Securities, said: “Analyst consensus EPS have been revised down significantly due to recent turmoil in financial markets.”Since June 15, consensus estimates for Bear Stearns’ third-quarter earnings have fallen 46 per cent, while Lehman’s have been cut by 17 per cent, Morgan Stanley’s by 13 per cent and Goldman’s by 1 per cent.Mr Mikkelsen said: “The word ‘consensus’ should be taken with a grain of salt, however, as there is substantial dispersion among analysts.”He said the range of estimates ranged from 9 per cent for Goldman to 28 per cent for Bear Stearns.Among the financials, Countrywide remained under pressure. The largest US mortgage lender fell 1.9 per cent to $16.88 after AllianceBernstein LP and Barclays Global Investors said in regulatory filings that they had reduced their stakes in the bank. Countrywide has fallen more than 40 per cent from a rally above $29 a share last month when Bank of America injected $2bn into the lender.Homebuilder stocks were one of the few sectors under pressure on Tuesday. The S&P homebuilder index fell 0.2 per cent and the sector has now fallen some 66 per cent from its peak in July 2005.There was further bad news on the housing front on Tuesday, which put pressure on homebuilder stocks.In its latest monthly report, the National Association of Realtors cut its home sales forecast for the seventh month in a row and said the median sales price for existing homes should fall by 1.7 per cent this year, after predicting a decline of 1.2 per cent last month.McDonald’s rose 3.2 per cent to $51.76 after the fast food group said that its global same-store sales rose 8.1 per cent in August.Wal-Mart gained 1.6 per cent to $42.94, after the retailer reduced its reported second-quarter profit by $153m as it took a charge from selling its German retail operations. Boeing rose 2.2 per cent to $97.44 after winning a $1.1bn US Air Force contract. That also helped boost the Dow.The only Dow stock to close lower on Tuesday was Disney, off 0.2 per cent at $33.49.Meanwhile, Bristol Myers-Squibb closed up 0.8 per cent at $28.23 and ImClone Systems surged 18.38 per cent to $44.90 after a trial of their Erbitux drug in combination with chemotherapy recorded a higher survival rate in lung cancer patients.
546;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-08-08T20:48:57Z;Wall St rallies in volatile trading;;Another dramatic day of Wall Street trading left US stocks higher on Wednesday as investors focused on the homebuilding, financial and technology sectors.The S&P 500 finished 1.4 per cent higher at 1,498.48, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 2 per cent to 2,612.98. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.1 per cent at 13,657.77. The Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 2.8 per cent, returning to positive territory for the year to date.In early trading, investors pushed stocks higher, taking heart from strong quarterly earnings from Cisco Systems and Tuesday’s policy outlook statement from the US Federal Reserve.“The sectors that got hit hardest on the correction are the ones up the most today,” noted analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.During the afternoon financial stocks traded in a volatile manner, paring earlier gains before closing up. Shares in Goldman Sachs hit a high of $198.50, dropped to $188.76 and closed up 1.1 per cent at $193.30.Bear Stearns sold $2.25bn of five-year notes on Tuesday in an early sign that credit fears are abating. Merrill Lynch and Citigroup were also expected to sell debt on Wednesday. The S&P investment bank index ended the day 2.9 per cent higher, with Bear Stearns up 3.6 per cent to $121.12, while Lehman Brothers had risen 6.7 per cent to $64.78.“The credit markets are open for business today,” said Tony Crescenzi, strategist at Miller Tabak & Co.In the afternoon shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell back after Mr Bush said the mortgage lenders should reform their business models before being able to lift their investment portfolio limits. Investors have been hopeful that the companies will soon start buying mortgages and help support that market. Fannie Mae ended 3.6 per cent higher at $66.75 while Freddie Mac was up 1.6 per cent at $62.64.Good quarterly results from Cisco led technology stocks higher. Shares in the tech bellwether rose 6.7 per cent to $31.68 and set a 52-week high of $32.25 earlier in the day. The company reported higher earnings than expected after the closing bell on Tuesday on the back of better quarterly sales.Stocks had closed Tuesday’s session higher as investors appeared to conclude that the Fed was not overly concerned about the turmoil in the US credit market. However, some analysts still struck a cautionary note.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index reversed a fall to 19.93 and closed 0.5 per cent lower at 21.45. As concerns over financial stocks have intensified in recent weeks, Vix has surged and earlier this week reached 26.47, its highest level since April 2003. This move eclipsed a high of 24 set in June 2006 when stocks suffered a bout of weakness.The recent sharp rise in volatility reflects the fact that investors are seeking protection against weaker stock prices. But some analysts and investors say the movement of the Vix could also be suggesting stocks are worth buying.“Since 1990, there have been six other periods where the Vix had such a large move over the course of such a short period of time, and in each of those six periods, the S&P 500 has been higher one, three, and six months later,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said: “History has shown that volatility spikes are more consistent with market bottoms than market tops.”For long-term equity investors, the prospects look bright said analysts at Banc of America Securities.“For investors whose equity allocation is below normal, we believe the recent sell-off presents a very good opportunity to increase exposure, especially when the recent sharp rise in options premia is taken into consideration.“Many investors are desperately seeking safety, trying to purchase insurance against a significant market decline, and that has shifted the balance in favour of patient investors who are willing to own equities with reasonable return expectations.”The bullish mood for stocks extended to the home building sector. Toll Brothers warned that fiscal third-quarter revenue had dropped 21 per cent, but the decline was less than analysts had feared. The stock was up 6 per cent at $24.33, while the S&P homebuilders index was 6.9 per cent higher.Sprint Nextel, the telecommunications company, reported lower quarterly profits on Wednesday, but beat analysts’ average forecasts as it added new subscribers. Its shares were down 2.2 per cent at $19.77.Tyco Electronics reported a steep loss due to costs of a class-action settlement and its separation from Tyco International. Tyco shares were down 0.3 per cent at $34.74.McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast-food chain, reported a strong 6.5 per cent rise in its global sales in July, helped by the addition of a new breakfast menu. The markets pushed McDonald’s up 1.1 per cent to $50.29.American International Group, the insurer, was scheduled to release second-quarter results after the market close. The stock finished 1.4 per cent higher at $66.48.
547;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-07-23T20:38:32Z;US stocks rally on earnings, deals;;US stocks rallied on Monday as a raft of better-than-expected second-quarter company earnings reports and fresh mergers activity helped investors shrug off Friday’s sell-off.Pharmaceuticals led the upbeat earnings line-up. Merck said second-quarter net income rose 12 per cent, sending the Dow component 6.8 per cent higher to $52.33 at the close of trading in New York.Schering-Plough more than doubled its quarterly profit, but the stock fell back 0.6 per cent to $31.30 despite rising earlier in the session.Halliburton, the oil services firm, reported a 19 per cent rise in quarterly profit, which sent its share price up 3.2 per cent to $37.74.The steep rise came after the spin-off of its engineering firm KBR earlier this year.The Houston-based company earned $1.53bn, or $1.62 a share, up from $591m, or 55 cents a share, in the same period last year.In deals news, the oil drilling sector grabbed the spotlight as Transocean and GlobalSantaFe agreed to merge. The companies have a combined market capitalisation of $48bn. Transocean was up 5.5 per cent at $115.96, while GlobalSantaFe had jumped 4.8 per cent to $78.33 by the close. If the transaction goes through, it would create the second largest company in the sector behind Schlumberger.Many are betting that the world’s supply of cheap crude oil is running out and energy companies will be reliant on new and more expensive methods to produce and transport energy.Hewlett-Packard agreed to acquire Opsware in a deal worth $1.6bn, according to a company statement.The move, one among several recent business technology buy-outs by HP, is intended to help automate the company’s data centre.HP shares fell 0.2 per cent to $48.43 while Opsware shares soared 36.19 per cent to $14.00.Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity house, said it would buy United Rentals for $6.6bn, including debt. The stock was up 1.9 per cent at $32.98.But analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that financial stocks, and specifically brokerage stocks, continued to trade poorly. “Even after generally positive earnings news, investors want nothing to do with the group,” they said.Toymaker Hasbro also bucked the buoyant mood. Second-quarter profit fell 82 per cent, as a charge of $36.5m linked to warrants purchased from Lucasfilm outweighed the effect of a licensing deal for Spider-Man 3 toys and sales of Transformer toys. Its shares fell 5.4 per cent to $30.80.Nonetheless, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,541.52 at the close in New York, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.1 per cent firmer at 2,690.58The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent higher at 13,943.42.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.81, or 0.58 per cent, to 841.25.“We still have a very positive supply demand ratio with a lot of money on the sidelines that wants in at the moment,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.“The fact is that investors are in a ‘glass half full’ mood and are generally prepared to look beyond problems such as the subprime mortgage market debacle and wider geopolitical risks.”He added that most agreed that the market continued to display largely sound fundamentals, describing the prevailing mood as one of cautious optimism rather than of irrational exuberance.In other news, VeraSun Energy agreed to pay $725m for three ethanol plants with annual production capacity of 300 million gallons a year. Shares were 4.9 per cent higher at $14.4.Shares of Tellabs rose 3 per cent to $12.20 after media reports that the communications equipment company is entertaining a $7bn takeover offer from Nokia Siemens Networks.Shares in Netflix, which was scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell on Monday, tumbled 12 per cent to $17.27 after the video rental company cut prices over the weekend on two of its subscription plans by $1.American Express and Texas Instruments were due to report their latest earnings after the closing bell in New York on Monday.The latest quarterly earnings from McDonald’s, AT&T, UPS and Amazon are due on Tuesday.Boeing and Apple results are due later this week.
548;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-07-16T21:09:31Z;Dow rallies, S&P and Nasdaq down;;Wall Street was mixed on Monday as investors trimmed the market’s early gains and adopted a cautious outlook before this week’s earnings reports.With the exception of blue-chips, stocks turned lower by mid-afternoon. Further weakness in the subprime mortgage derivatives market hurt financial, homebuilding and real estate stocks.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,549.52.Earlier in the day, the broad barometer had set a new intra-day record of 1,555.90 before the rally lapsed. Among the main S&P sectors, telecoms and industrial stocks were firmer, while energy, materials and utilities were in negative territory.The slide in the S&P on Monday was accompanied by a rise in equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Vix index, up 2.9 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.4 per cent at 2,697.33 after the benchmark had risen on Monday morning to its highest level since February 2001.Leading the bullish charge on Monday were bluechips. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained in record territory, up 0.3 per cent at 13,950.98. The Dow also set an intra-day record high of 13,989.11. The Dow’s gain for the year of 11.9 per cent now outpaces the Nasdaq’s climb of 11.7 per cent in 2007.Many of the Dow’s 30 components have a strong international presence and the buoyant global economy and weak dollar are expected to boost their quarterly bottom lines.“Companies with higher international exposure are likely to show better earnings growth, which will result in better performance for their stocks,” analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said.The second-quarter reporting season kicks into higher gear on Tuesday, and this week many high-profile companies in the banking, pharmaceuticals and technology sectors will report.Companies whose quarterly results are due on Tuesday include Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Yahoo, Intel and Merrill Lynch.Among groups reporting on Wednesday are Dow constituents United Technologies, which hit a record high of $76.98 on Monday, JPMorgan and Pfizer. Wells Fargo and Ebay are also due on Wednesday.Google, Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola, Dow Jones, Bank of New York and Bank of America are due to report on Thursday, along with two Dow stocks, IBM – which reached a five- year high of $110.04 on Monday – and Honeywell.Citigroup and Caterpillar, which set a record high of $86.49 on Monday, complete this week’s blue-chip earnings line-up on Friday.With many banks reporting this week, investors are likely to focus on any evidence that problems in the mortgage market are hurting profits.“Continued weakness in mortgage banking, deteriorating credit quality, and a challenging yield curve for most of the quarter make negative earnings surprises more likely than results materially above expectations,” strategists at Barclays Capital said.The S&P financials sector reversed an early rally on Monday and moved back into negative territory for the year to date as mortgage worries flared again.As earnings beckon, technology stocks could extend their strong gains this year. Earlier on Monday, both Apple and Google set record highs on Monday of $139.98 and $558.58 respectively. Analysts at Bespoke noted that technology led other sectors in terms of international sales as a percentage of total sales.“It could be a good quarter for large-cap tech, which explains the performance recently in stocks like Intel and Cisco,” said Bespoke.Citigroup said 2008 consensus earnings estimates for Intel were low and that the chipmaker will “accelerate its current low level of stock buy-back activity”.The bank raised its price target for Intel from $27 to $31. The stock closed 0.1 per cent lower at $25.95 and is up over 28 per cent so far this year.Cisco closed steady at $29.89 on Monday, after setting a 52-week high of $30 in early trade.In deal news on Monday, IHOP, the restaurant chain operator, said it would buy Applebee’s for about $1.9bn, or $25.50 a share. Applebee’s rose 2.2 per cent to $24.91, while IHOP surged 8.9 per cent to $61.24.Verizon rose 2.4 per cent at $42.76 after the Financial Times’ Alphaville blog reported that Vodafone of the UK had considered a $160bn takeover of the US telecoms group.Vodafone said it had no plans for such a deal.In earnings news, Eaton, the diversified manufacturer, rose 2.8 per cent to $100.87. The company raised its earnings guidance after its second-quarter profit fell 3 per cent, which beat estimates.Mattel rose 2.5 per cent to $27.20 after after the toymaker reported a 15 per cent increase in second quarter profits.McDonald’s rallied 0.4 per cent to $52.10, after the fast food group said same-store sales rose 8.4 per cent during June.Shares in Whole Foods were 1.6 per cent lower at $39.84, after a report that the Securities and Exchange Commission will conduct an informal inquiry into online postings made by John Mackey, the company’s chief executive.Later this week investors will also focus on what Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, says in testimony on the economy and monetary policy. Mr Bernanke speaks before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, and then the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.“We expect a rather dull discussion of the economy and policy outlook,” said economists at Lehman Brothers. “Bernanke will likely face tough questioning on regulation of the mortgage industry and may give an update on the Fed’s communication strategy.”The Fed chairman may also seek to reassure the markets that problems in the subprime mortgage market are likely to remain contained, traders said.“Subprime and wider concerns over credit will not go away, however,” said Ciaran O’Hagan, head of fixed income strategy at Societe Generale. “The Jekyll and Hyde approach of the market to risk persists with emerging market, equities and FX carry trades doing very well, while credit has yet to recover much.“Economic reports due this week include the June producer price index and industrial production on Tuesday. Housing starts and consumer prices for June are due on Wednesday. Leading indicators and the Philadelphia Fed survey arrive on Thursday, followed by the Fed meeting minutes from last month.
549;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Ackman takes 9.6% stake in Target;;Bill Ackman, the activist investor, has taken a 9.6 per cent share in Target, the US discount retailer, and says he will push for changes at a company whose shares have risen more than 45 per cent in the past 12 months.Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Investment fund has given no details of objectives, but Wall Street analysts expect him to focus on capital structure rather than the company’s much-applauded operating performance.In a regulatory filing on Monday, Pershing Square said it believed Target’s stock “is undervalued and [we] intend to discuss with management ways in which this …can be corrected”.The filing also said Target, led by Bob Ulrich, its chief executive, had “the strongest operating management in the retail industry”. Mr Ulrich was recently named CEO of the year by Chief Executive magazine.The retailer serves more prosperous middle-class customers than the bigger Wal-Mart and has set standards for its effective marketing and creation of “cheap chic” private label brands by designers including Isaac Mizrahi and Michael Graves.Target would not comment directly on Pershing Square’s stake but said the company welcomed “a dialogue on company strategy and performance with any member of our investor base and the financial community”.Wall Street analysts expect Mr Ackman’s discussions with the retailer to focus on its lucrative credit card portfolio and property holdings. Target, which operates 1,500 stores across the US and had sales last year of $57.8bn, owns about 85 per cent of its real estate.Other top US retailers – including Macy’s and Kohl’s – have sold their credit card businesses but Target says the business is integral to its effort to build relationships with its customers.In an unusual development, Pershing Square also said it would donate a third of any after-tax profits resulting from its investment in Target to its charitable foundation, set up last year, which funds inner-city development and human rights work.Mr Ackman has previously staged activist campaigns at McDonald’s and Wendy’s. Pershing Square’s stake in Target is valued at more than $5.6bn.
550;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;McDonald’s to power trucks with cooking oil;;The oils that sizzle McDonald’s fries and chicken nuggets will soon also stoke its trucks, as the fast food chain starts converting its cooking oil into biodiesel.McDonald’s plans to run its 155 UK delivery trucks on biodiesel made entirely from cooking oil collected from its restaurants by the end of the year.The fast-food group, which to date has been running trucks on 95 per cent diesel and 5 per cent biodiesel, will initially use a blend of 85 per cent biodiesel and 15 per cent rapeseed oil.The move is further evidence of the importance the group is attaching to overhauling its environmental image. A year ago, after a sustained campaign by Greenpeace, McDonald’s agreed to stop using soya from newly deforested land in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. This year, it started selling coffee certified by the Rainforest Alliance in its UK restaurants, a move that it says boosted sales by 10 per cent.The group had previously been lambasted over everything from its treatment of animals to its use of environmentally harmful refrigerants.Matthew Howe, manager of McDonald’s UK supply chain, said the cost of using biodiesel was expected to be the same as the restaurant group’s diesel costs in the long term. “In the short term, we think it will cost a little bit more,” he said, adding this extra cost could amount to “a couple of pennies a litre”.The company expects to convert an annual 6m litres of oil, comparable to the 6.1m litres of diesel used in its trucks last year.It will collect oil from 900 of its 1,200 UK outlets each week, take it to a separation tank in East Anglia, where food particles will be removed, and then on to a biodiesel conversion plant in Milton Keynes in central England.McDonald’s could not say whether the vehicles involved in moving the oil around the UK would be fuelled by biodiesel themselves, but the company said the net effect of the scheme would be a 78 per cent reduction in its carbon emissions.Francesca DeBiase, McDonald’s chief supply chain officer said the group’s European operation was an “early warning system” for the US.
551;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-06-20T18:56:07Z;DSG/Russia;;Adventurers have sought their fortunes in the mythical El Dorado since the 16th century. On Wednesday, UK retailer DSG International decided its own quest was too risky, terminating its option to buy into Russian electrical retail group Eldorado.Yet the profits to be made in Russia by outsiders have largely proved real, rather than illusory, despite the dangers along the way. The consumer sector in particular has been booming, with real disposable incomes up an estimated 13 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter. The likes of Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Procter & Gamble say they are going great guns. Confectionery group Mars believes Russia has contributed about a third of its organic growth in recent years.The increasingly bellicose pronouncements of President Vladimir Putin suggest risks are rising too, especially in the “strategic” areas of energy and natural resources, where government control is being reasserted. Shell and BP have run into highly publicised problems (though it is worth remembering that BP, for example, has already recovered its original Russian investment through dividends).Although not politically sensitive, retailing can also be tricky territory for new entrants. Some of the most globally minded retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Tesco, have yet to make a decisive move into Russia and others are just dabbling. The two biggest problems for foreign entrants, corruption and bureaucracy, can meld rather unpleasantly when it comes to finding and building retail sites.The DSG board decided it was not “appropriate” to proceed with its investment after it “learnt a great deal about both the company and the market in which it operates”. If that means rewards were not substantial enough to outweigh considerable risks, it was a sensible decision. But for most, the allure of massive profits will continue to be irresistible.
552;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-06-12T20:30:23Z;Record bond yields sink Wall Street;;"Wall Street slumped on Tuesday, as the 10-year bond yield reached its highest level in five years, and cast a bearish pall over equities.Rate-sensitive stocks, such as utilities, real estate investment trusts, home builders and some financials were on the defensive.Bearish sentiment was also reflected in lower transport stocks and a further pullback in the steel sector.Stocks largely tracked the change in bond yields on Tuesday. When yields showed signs of stabilising during the early afternoon, stocks turned higher. But, late on Tuesday, when yields rose to fresh highs, that ultimately sank stocks.The S&P 500 index closed 1.1 per cent lower at 1,492.99.Telecoms and utilities were the weakest main industry groups in the S&P.Concern has been growing among stock traders that higher yields would slow merger and acquisition activity as financing costs for deals increased. The past week has seen just $1.8bn in announced M&A deals, the lowest since November.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said: “Investors relying on mergers and acquisitions to boost prices are likely on edge wondering whether the decline is a result of rising interest rates or summer
doldrums.”Stephen Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investment Group, said: “Private equity could become more selective about new deals.”The rise in rates has also prompted investors to calculate whether equities still look attractive compared with fixed-income securities that now offer higher yields.Mr Wood said: “Fixed income has become more attractive, but stocks still look better. The prospect of stronger growth in the US has been behind the rise in yields.”David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “The stock/bond decision has become more finely balanced after the bond market shake-out.“Relative to bonds, equities offer reasonable but not compelling value.”Bond traders said the May retail sales report, due on Wednesday, and consumer prices data, released on Friday, would provide the market with some fundamental news to place the recent rise in yields in context.Mr Shairp said: “The equity pullback may have further to go, as markets come to terms with the carnage in the fixed-income markets and they have a chance to digest their gains since March.”On Tuesday, equity volatility rose. The Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index of S&P volatility gained 12.2 per cent to 16.50, but closed below last week’s peak of 17.09.Quarterly option contracts expire this week, and that could also spark sharp moves in the S&P index said analysts. Technology and blue chips both closed lower.A narrowing in second-quarter guidance from Texas Instruments, down 2.1 per cent at $35.04, hurt chip makers.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.9 per cent lower at 2,549.77.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1 per cent at 13,295.01. Of the Dow’s 30 stocks, 27 closed lower on Tuesday, led by a 2.6 per cent fall in AT&T to $39.08. The Dow Transportation Average lost 1.9 per cent, and closed at its lowest level since mid April.A bright spot among blue chips was a 1.2 per cent rise to $22.20 in Intel as it bucked the sell-off in other chip-makers. McDonald’s up 0.45 per cent at $51.48, and Alcoa, up 0.1 per cent at $39.34 were the other Dow stocks to close higher.In earnings news, Lehman Brothers reported net income rose 27 per cent over the past year to a record $1.3bn. The stock rose 0.5 per cent to $76,06, and pared an earlier rise to $78.19. The stock remains 2.6 per cent lower for the year and set a high for the year of $85.80 in early February.The bank said its diversified operations helped offset a 14 per cent fall in its fixed income revenues, from bonds, derivatives and credit products, due to ”continued weakness in the US residential mortgage business.”Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, said that while it boosted home loans by 15 per cent in May compared with a year earlier, its foreclosure rate had doubled. Shares rose 0.7 per cent to $38.10.Yahoo fell 1.1 per cent to $27.05 as its annual shareholder meeting was held.Starbucks rose 0.7 per cent to $27.74, rebounding from an earlier decline when Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its “conviction buy” list.Uniphase rose 3.5 per cent to $13.47 after a brokerage upgrade.Shares in Take-Two Interactive gained 2.1 per cent to $19.33 after JPMorgan upgraded the video game publisher to “outperform”.Dean Foods fell 4.3 per cent to $31.07 after it cut earnings estimates for the second quarter and the year because of higher milk prices.Shares in American Commercial Lines fell 9.1 per cent to $26.27 after the transportation company also cut its earnings outlook."
553;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-06-08T21:01:50Z;US stocks sink as yields soar;;Wall Street posted its worst weekly performance since early March as investors watched bond yields soar to their highest level in more than a year.Rate-sensitive stocks such as utilities, financials, home builders and real estate investment trusts were hit hardest by the 10-year bond yield testing last year’s high around 5.24 per cent, just shy of the Fed fund’s overnight rate.On Friday the S&P 500 rebounded after three days of declines, to close up 1.1 per cent at 1,507.67. The benchmark was 1.9 per cent lower this week, its second worst five-day performance this year.Expectations of S&P volatility rose this week, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index up by 16.6 per cent.Some analysts argue that bond yields have begun returning to normal levels after a period of being historically low.A point in favour of stocks is that the move higher by yields over the past month has reflected expectations of a stronger economy and the consequent erosion of rate-cut expectations for this year.“Current interest rate levels aren’t deeply problematic for the economic outlook,” said Steven Wieting, senior economist at Citigroup. “It is plain to see that market psychology has taken a hit, with equity investors, for one, increasingly uncertain as to where the bond market sell-off ultimately ends.Others are not so sanguine and believe a sustained rise in rates will hurt stocks.“Such is the classic end to a bull market,” Ciaran O’Hagan, head of strategy at SG Fixed Income said. “The first whack comes from rising interest rates. Company profits fall much later.”Another potential downside for stocks is the concern that an increase in the cost of financing could derail what has been an unprecedented period of merger and acquisition activity. This week, the S&P 400 index of medium-sized companies, which have benefited from buy-out deals, led the benchmarks lower with a decline of 2.5 per cent.“Higher borrowing costs will pressure corporations and lead to some reduction in earnings and result in a repricing of credit valuations,” Kevin Cronin, portfolio manager at Putnam Investments, said.Amid the decline in stocks this week, several technology shares attracted buyers who focused on growth candidates. Apple rose 5.1 per cent to $124.49, and set an all-time high of $127.61 as investors awaited the debut of its iPhone at the end of this month.Another tech bellwether, online retailer Amazon, rose 5.6 per cent to $72.38 this week and set a 52-week peak of $74.72. Meanwhile, Google gained 3 per cent to $515.49 on Friday after setting a record high of $526.50 this week.On Friday the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 per cent to close at 2,573.54. Since Monday, the technology-laden index has fallen 1.5 per cent.In results news, National Semiconductor on Friday reported better than expected fourth-quarter numbers. The chipmaker rallied 14.7 per cent to $29.58.Blue chips also rebounded on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 1.2 per cent to close at 13,424.39. For the week, the Dow had lost 1.8 per cent.Shares in McDonald’s rose 2.4 per cent to $51.41 yesterday after the restaurant chain posted an 8.7 per cent rise in global same-restaurant sales for May.Dow laggards this week included Pfizer, down 4.2 per cent at $26.52 amid legal woes. Alcoa was off 4.3 per cent at $39.66 as materials stocks were also hit by higher yields while DuPont lost 3.7 per cent to $51.13 after a downgrade.As retailers posted their May same-store sales this week, disappointing figures hurt JC Penney, down 4.5 per cent at $78.30. Meanwhile, Bed Bath & Beyond warned that its first-quarter earnings would be less than analysts’ estimates. The shares fell 7.1 per cent to $37.62.Among deal news this week, TD Ameritrade, said that Jana Partners and Steven Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors, two hedge funds, had accumulated a stake of about 8.4 per cent of its shares and wanted the online brokerage to pursue a merger with either Charles Schwab or E*Trade Financial. Ameritrade rose 4.6 per cent to $20.93, while Schwab fell 4.2 per cent to $21.73 and E*Trade gained 4.8 per cent to $25.21.Further talk of consolidation in the steel sector sent shares in US Steel up 8 per cent to $125.05 on Friday.Palm rose 10.8 per cent to $17.82 over the week after a private equity firm bought a 25 per cent stake in the personal organiser maker.Digene jumped 25.6 per cent to $56.25 this week after Qiagen said it would buy the diagnostic healthcare company for $1.6bn in cash and stock. Qiagen fell 5.2 per cent to $16.38.
554;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-05-18T17:25:40Z;Whitney Tilson: Not-to-be-missed tips for value hunters;;"My recent column detailing the 10 investment traps I’ve identified prompted several readers to ask if I have a comparable list of the opposite – types of opportunities that are likely to lead to good investment outcomes.I do, and happily it’s a bit longer than the list of traps. Given that the first step to successful investing is knowing which ponds to fish in, here are the 15 most common types of value opportunities I have been able to capitalise on in my investing career:● Out-of-favour blue chips. Even the greatest companies encounter problems or otherwise fall out of favour. We bought McDonald’s a few years ago when it fell below $13, believing in its assets and that it could return to its former glory through better management. The shares now trade above $50.● Turnrounds of broken businesses. It’s difficult to fix a truly broken business, but when it happens, the returns can be extraordinary. One of my best investments ever was CKE Restaurants, which engineered a spectacular turnround at Hardee’s due to its new Thickburger menu. The shares, as low as $3 in 2003, are now above $20.● Cyclicals at the bottom of the cycle. Success here usually involves correctly anticipating when a cyclical industry will rebound, though precision is not necessary as long as the company has a strong enough balance sheet to weather the tough times.● Distressed industries. Our buying auto-systems maker Lear last year below $20 when its prospects were considered most bleak is a successful example of buying a good company in a distressed industry. Its shares have more than doubled off their lows.● Overlooked small-caps. Among the 5,000 or so publicly traded US stocks that have no analyst coverage are fine businesses that are cheap because no one is paying attention to them or the stocks are thinly traded. A good example we’ve owned for years is Weyco Group, which makes Florsheim shoes.● Fallen growth angels. When high-growth companies slow down, growth and momentum junkies often sell indiscriminately, which can create great opportunities for value investors. Just be careful not to anchor on the stock’s previous price or earnings multiple, which are no longer relevant.● Growth at a reasonable price. These are also high-quality growth businesses, but the stocks haven’t fallen. They may not appear cheap on traditional valuation metrics, but can be excellent investments if the high growth can be maintained. Starbucks over the years has been a great example.● Piggybacking on activism. There are select opportunities to invest alongside experienced activist investors pushing for prudent change. One of our most profitable investments over the past two years, for example, was following Pershing Square and Trian Group into Wendy’s International, which has more than doubled.● Spin-offs. Many significant stock-price inefficiencies can occur when a company is spun off. A recent example we currently own is Mueller Water, which operates largely under Wall Street’s radar and is uniquely positioned to benefit from needed investment in US water-system infrastructure.● Post-bankruptcies. There are also many reasons why companies emerging from bankruptcy can be inefficiently priced, not the least of which is investors’ reticence to back a recent loser. We’ve almost tripled our money in less than two years owning shoe retailer Footstar, which came out of bankruptcy with a solid balance sheet and plan for reviving itself.● Let someone else do the investing. Certain public companies, including Berkshire Hathaway (which we own), Loews, Leucadia National, Alleghany and White Mountains Insurance are structured as investment vehicles for proven value investors. At a reasonable price, it can pay to let these investors do the heavy lifting for you.● Free/mispriced option. In these situations, one or more ongoing businesses justifies the current market price and an investor gets a valuable option – in the form of a new market opportunity or turnround of a floundering business – for almost nothing. In Wendy’s, we thought the value of its Tim Hortons restaurant franchise was worth the entire stock price two years ago, so we were getting the Wendy’s brand restaurant and franchising business for free.● Declining cash cow. At the right price – and if management wisely milks the business and allocates capital – the stock of a declining business can be a great investment. The shares of Deluxe, the leading check printer that many investors had abandoned, have tripled over the past year thanks to cost cutting under a new chief executive.● Oddball companies. Certain companies have revolutionary business models that are poorly understood, resulting in cheap stock prices. Classic examples are Southwest Airlines, Dell and Kinder Morgan.● Discount to the sum of the parts. Many companies lend themselves to valuing their different pieces and can be a great buy if the whole is trading at
a sufficient discount to the pieces. We own Tyco because we think the three companies that will emerge from it in the next few months are worth more than $40, versus today’s share price below $33.Whitney Tilson is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight and co-founded the Value Investing Congress. feedback@tilsonfunds.com"
555;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-05-15T22:22:21Z;Tech stocks weigh on Wall St;;Shares in Wall Street were mixed on Tuesday, as blue-chips vaulted further into record territory, while losses in technology weighed upon broader benchmarks.News that consumer price inflation moderated last month helped stocks avert a tough start when Wal-Mart and Home Depot disappointed investors with their first-quarter results ahead of the opening bell. The mood turned bullish, however, after the release of benign inflation data for April. Annual core inflation – which excludes food and energy prices – rose less than expected.“Investors are making an interest rate play as the fall in annual core inflation takes us closer to the Fed’s comfort zone and they could be in a position to cut rates later this year,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at Avalon Partners.The moderation in annual core inflation to 2.3 per cent in April from 2.5 per cent during March is seen providing the Federal Reserve with some flexibility should the economy slow further in coming months, economists said.“This report is definitely a positive surprise for us on the inflation front,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.But Treasury bond yields rose, suggesting the data did little to raise traders’ hopes of a near-term rate cut. The rise in yields in spite of continued weakness in the housing market helped clip the early gains seen in stocks said traders.The S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,501.19, still adrift of its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000. Materials and telecom stocks were the best performing groups within the index, while the technology sector was in negative territory, weighed down by a 1.1 per cent fall in the Philadelphia semiconductor stock index.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,525.29.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed in record territory on Tuesday and rose 0.3 per cent to 13,383.84. The blue-chip barometer established an all-time intraday high of 13,481.60 and set its 22nd record close for the year. The Dow managed to absorb disappointing results from two members, Wal-Mart and Home Depot.The world’s largest retailer said its first-quarter earnings rose 8.1 per cent, matching estimates, but investors were disappointed with Wal-Mart’s warning that second-quarter results would come in at or below forecasts. Its shares fell 0.5 per cent to $47.62.Meanwhile, Home Depot reported a 29.5 per cent decline in profit for the first quarter. The home improvement chain blamed variable weather and weakness in the housing market for failing to beat estimates. Its shares lost 1.8 per cent to close at $38.30.Shares in Agilent rose 5.2 per cent to $37.78, after it posted a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and said its revenue outlook indicated a strong second half to the fiscal year.Ingersoll Rand shares jumped 5.8 per cent to $49.29 after the machinery and heavy equipment maker said it was looking to sell some of its businesses.There was further selling in Amgen after Medicare and Medicaid Services said it may limit coverage of the drugmaker’s anaemia drugs, which a Food and Drug Administration panel recently said should have new labelling. Shares in Amgen were 3.7 per cent lower at $54.01 as it also received multiple brokerage downgrades.Johnson & Johnson, whose anaemia drugs was also in focus at the FDA last week. It fell 1.3 per cent to $61.82. The company was the worst laggard in the Dow.DaimlerChrysler reported that first-quarter profit rose in spite of a wider loss at its Chrysler group, which it agreed on Monday to sell to a private equity firm. Shares in the carmaker closed 0.8 per cent higher at $84.80. Other car makers were higher, with General Motors up 4.4 per cent at $31.97 after it was boosted by a brokerage upgrade. Ford rose 2.3 per cent to $8.91.In deal news, Beckman Coulter, the biomedical instrument maker, said it would not raise its $90-a-share bid for Biosite, the medical diagnostic company that has backed a $92.50-a-share offer from Inverness Medical Innovations .Shares in Biosite fell 3.1 per cent to $91.71. Beckman shares were up 2.3 per cent at $66.08, while Inverness slid 2.7 per cent to $39.89.
556;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-05-01T19:12:53Z;Customers want loyalty not perfection;;"With frustration verging on despair, marketing gurus and brand managers worldwide bemoan the erosion of customer loyalty. The global power of consumer brands is not what it used to be and marketers resent it. They think their customers fickle ingrates. In the pungent phrase of WPP’s Marian Salzman, an executive “trend spotter” at the world’s second largest advertising conglomerate, consumers today are “brand sluts” who are most loyal to instant gratification.This “consumer-as-slattern” attitude is a far cry from advertising grand master David Ogilvy’s marketing admonition that: “The consumer isn’t a moron. She’s your wife.” But look at a ty­pical block of network advertising in the US. You will see at least a quarter of the prime-time brand advertisements portray their target customers and prospects as idiots and nincompoops. These are meant to be “edgy” and “humorous”. Mega-brand fast food, breakfast cereal and telecommunications companies such as McDonald’s, Kellogg’s and Verizon in effect cast their own consumers as wimps and weasels even as chief marketing officers complain that brand loyalty is dead.In reality, the declared demise of brand loyalty is 180 degrees misunderstood. A review of the past decade reveals customers have not been cavalierly unfaithful to established brands; quite the opposite. Established brands have cheated on and betrayed their most loyal customers. They charge more and more for less and less; they chase after the youth market or the hot segment du jour; their “innovations” frequently add more complexity than value; and their willingness to apologise and compensate for errors or mistakes is nil. The more provocative marketing argument is that “brand inertia” far more than “brand loyalty” has kept so many customers for so many companies for so long.Consumers are neither sheep nor fools. They can sense when companies are consistently more loyal to investors, employees and regulators than to the people who buy their products and services. They behave accordingly. Customers are not being disloyal; they are being discriminating. The central marketing question confronting brand leaders therefore is not “how can we radically increase customer loyalty?” but “how can we radically increase our own loyalty to customers?”The distinction is enormous. It is analogous to companies that say they promote a culture of “employee loyalty” even as cutbacks and lay-offs surge during economic slowdowns and mergers. Top management demands loyalty from below while regretfully declining to reciprocate. Yet the moral authority and value of loyalty comes from the courage to hold fast during difficult times. It is the defiant unwillingness of enterprises to be loyal to their best customers that has produced the promiscuous consumer behaviour they deplore. The real sin here is that companies have wilfully confused “brand loyalty” with “customer retention”. Just as with sullen employees, that is the perfunctory loyalty of compliance, not of pride or passion.This challenge is not complex. Companies demonstrate loyalty to employees by investing in them, fairly compensating them, tapping their expertise and declining to throw them overboard when times get tough. Why should customers deserve any less?This is where traditional marketing and brand advertising fail. Often, it is not the brand attribute of flawless service but the real-world performance in rapidly recovering from a mistake that wins customer loyalty and return business. Examples are legion: airline reservationists who waive “change fees” for inadvertently misbooked flights or mobile telephone operators who politely and without complaint remove rightly disputed charges from the bill. These are less acts of “customer service” than demonstrations of loyalty to customers. “Brand value” comes not from promises of perfection but gracefully compensating for acknowledged weakness. At least one global luxury hotel chain and a British telecoms provider have conducted customer research revealing that their most persuasive “word of mouth” support comes more from individuals who have had an unpleasant problem happily resolved than those who simply enjoyed “good” or “excellent” service. The willingness and ability to see a difficult situation through to success despite cost and risk is what defines loyalty. Many companies already know this and invest accordingly.To be fair, financial pressures, increasing transparency and the demands of hydra-headed corporate social responsibility movements make it more difficult than ever for companies to balance “customer loyalty” with “loyalty to customers”. Consumers are far quicker to see a brand as a mask the company hides behind.However, this is where new technology creates new opportunities for reciprocal loyalty. Increasingly, cutting-edge companies such as Google and Apple – strong brands in their own right – create online spaces where customers can collaborate and interact around new features and technical problems. Established brands such as Procter & Gamble and the BBC have used digital media to listen to customer ideas and shape new products. Customers know that these organisations have invested millions of dollars, pounds and euros into taking them seriously. In this millennium, brand value comes from investing as much in valued customers as in valuable products and services.The writer is a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who explores the economics of innovation"
557;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;The Short View: Insignificant landmark;;Needed: one bucket of cold water. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the world’s best-known stock market benchmark, passed 13,000 for the first time early yesterday. It was a symptom of the air of optimism in Wall Street. But ultimately a landmark for the Dow signifies little or nothing.This column has addressed the Dow’s technical limitations before. It is weighted by share price, not market value, so the biggest companies do not have the biggest impact. A third of the 1,000 index points by which the Dow has increased since it passed 12,000 last October came from just four companies – Altria, Boeing, Honeywell and ExxonMobil.It is too heavily weighted towards industrials to be a barometer of corporate America. But with constituents such as Citigroup, Wal-Mart, Microsoft and McDonald’s, it is not a true industrial index either.It is not even a true benchmark for “mega-cap” large companies. These are under-performing but you need the Russell Top 50 index, up only 1.6 per cent this year, compared with a 4.2 per cent rise in the Dow, to tell you this.Its defenders point out that the Dow continues to be correlated closely with the S&P 500, by far the most important index in terms of the money linked to it. But that acknowledges the importance of the S&P, which needs to grow only 2.7 per cent to set its first record high since 2000 – a much more important event.Ironically, another Dow Jones benchmark set up at the same time as the Industrials may be more interesting. The 20-stock Transportation Average is also at a record high. It is up 14 per cent for the year – 10 percentage points better than the Industrials.Transport stocks are highly exposed to the global economy, and a joint high for Industrials and Transportation is traditionally viewed as a very bullish indicator. It at least suggests that if there is a risk at present, it is of overheating, not a slowdown. That, maybe, is of some interest.Video: John Authers on Dow’s new milestone
558;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Timing ‘crucial to earnings announcements’;;US companies wanting to manage market expectations and boost their share prices should release good earnings news as soon as possible but keep bad news under wraps until the last minute, says a study to be released on Monday.The findings offer an unprecedented insight into the release of price-sensitive information, showing that right timing can more than double the size of a share price rise or significantly curtail a fall.The issue is all the more important at a time when institutional investors and hedge funds are focused on short-term price movements.The study, by Reuters Estimates, aims to quantify the difference in the movements of share prices of companies that “pre-announced” their earnings and companies that choose to “surprise” the market on the scheduled release date.US companies have greater discretion than their counterparts in other countries on when to release earnings news.The study looked at S&P 500 companies between 2003 and 2006. It found that seven out of 10 companies that pre-announced good earnings experienced a price rise on the day after the announcement. Yet, only 55 per cent of companies that stuck to their schedule and surprised the market were rewarded with an increase in price.Pre-announcements led to an average share price rise of more than 5 per cent, nearly double the average rise caused by positive earnings surprises.Early last week, for example, the fast food chain McDonald’s saw its shares rise more than 4.5 per cent after pre-announcing to the market that its results, released on Friday, would be better than expected.“The message is: if you have good news, get it out and let the market know,” said Ashwani Kaul, senior research analyst at Reuters Estimates. However, profit warnings only served to darken the market’s mood.The average share price fall for companies that gave the market notice of their problems was 7.4 per cent, well above the 2 per cent average declines caused by negative earnings revealed on results day.
559;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-04-20T22:19:51Z;Dollar comes to rescue of Corporate America;;The weak dollar and strong overseas markets came to corporate America’s rescue on Friday with blue-chip companies such as industrial giants Honeywell and Caterpillar and the drugmaker Pfizer reaping the benefits of international exposure.Several companies, including the fast food chain McDonald’s and the recruitment agency Manpower, beat Wall Street analysts expectations as the strength of foreign markets more than offset the weakness of the US economy.Jim Owens, chief executive of the heavy construction equipment maker Caterpillar, summed up the past few months for many US companies when he said: “Exceptional growth outside North America helped us deliver good results in a tough quarter.”The string of strong earnings and positive predictions helped the stock market to move higher. The Dow Jones Industrial index, which hit a record high twice already this week, closed in on the landmark 13,000 level, ending the day at a record level for a third successive day, climbing 1.2 per cent to 12,961.98.The first quarter results highlighted US companies’ need to drive growth to counter the slowdown in the domestic economy.That task has been made easier by a sharp slide in the dollar over the past few months, which benefits US groups with earnings in foreign currencies but penalises companies, especially smaller ones, that rely on imports.The threat posed by a weak dollar, which this week briefly touched a 26-year low against the British pound, to America’s small- and medium-sized companies could fuel calls from protectionist measures by some of the 2008 presidential hopefuls.By contrast, Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, said it expected international sales to come in higher by nearly $1bn over the next two years due to ”primarily a strengthening of the euro relative to the dollar since our previous forecast in January.”The company predicted that the stronger euro would boost this year’s sales by $450m more than expected.Although the increase is small compared with Pfizer’s $47bn-$48bn forecast annual revenues, it will help offset the sudden loss of $1.2bn due to generic competition after a key patent expiry on a blockbuster hypertension drug.Meanwhile, Honeywell raised its sales forecast for the year by $700m to $33.5bn. David Anderson, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times some $300m of the improved sales would come from favourable currency movements. He said $150m of that had already been achieved in the first quarter of the year, helping Honeywell to beat analysts’ expectations. The company reported a 21 per cent rise in net income to $526m in the three months to March.At Caterpillar, a downturn in North America was partly countered by strong sales in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Overall, first quarter profits quarter fell $24m to $816m.
560;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s in new franchise move;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food chain, is to sell 1,600 restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean to a franchisee, in a transaction that it says will contribute to focusing management’s attention “on the markets with the greatest impact on our results”.The company said it expected to receive about $700m from the sale of the restaurants to Woods Staton, an entrepreneur who formerly led McDonald’s in Argentina, and that the money would be used for dividends and share repurchases. It said it would record a $1.6bn non-cash charge on its balance sheet from the transaction in its second quarter, due to currency losses and the difference between the restaurants’ book value and sale price.McDonald’s said it in October it hoped to sell 2,300 restaurants to franchisees, as part of a long-term plan to own less than 30 per cent of its restaurants in a given market.McDonald’s on Friday reported first quarter earnings per diluted share of 62 cents, up 38 per cent on a continuing operations basis against last year, when results included for the quarter included the Chipotle Mexican Grill chain, which was subsequently sold.Revenues rose 11 per cent to $5.4bn while income from contiuing operations rose 33 per cent to $762m, supported by a $20m exchange rate gain. Jim Skinner, chief executive, cited continued strong growth in the US, where the company has recorded 48 months of comparable store sales increases. He said he was also encouraged by growth in Europe.
561;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-04-19T19:41:48Z;McDonald’s/Wendy’s;;Big Macs and fries are not everyone’s choice for a balanced diet. But at least for investors, they have proven remarkably healthy in recent years. Since March 2003, shares in McDonald’s have almost quadrupled. They are now trading close to the all-time high of the late 1990s – in the middle of what turned out to be a misguidedly hasty expansion.As McDonald’s found, historic virtues such as quality, service and cleanliness are easier to erode than to bring back. Repairing the basics, though, and adding a stream of suitable menu extensions, remains a solid recipe for eating rivals’ lunch. McDonald’s comparable sales rose by more than 8 per cent worldwide in March, continuing a streak of positive surprises. Thanks to such additions as new chicken wraps and more premium coffee, McDonald’s coped well with the cold spring weather that left other US chains shivering. Even in Europe, where growth has long been anaemic, the fast-food chain is well on its way towards restoring the lustre of its golden arches.That leaves plenty of scope for more new offerings. McDonald’s experience in the competitive breakfast market is encouraging. Fast food as a category might gain share if and when US consumers tighten their purse strings. And, when it comes to healthy fast-food meals, McDonald’s restaurants are arguably still trailing rivals, notably Wendy’s, which blazed a trail. The problem for investors is that shares in both companies already command fairly full valuations – 18 times this year’s earnings in the case of McDonald’s and a whopping 26 times (admittedly depressed) 2007 consensus estimates for Wendy’s. Still, McDonald’s progress means it was right to resist activist investors’ demands for more dramatic restructuring. Meanwhile, at Wendy’s, any further signs of operating weakness could lead to a renewed activist onslaught this summer.
562;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-04-17T22:25:49Z;Expensive defensive stocks;;Compared with their bond market peers, investors in US equity markets remain notoriously optimistic in their economic outlook. Or so the conventional wisdom goes. Dig a little deeper, though, and the message is a lot less clear than the near doubling of the S&P 500 since its 2002 trough would suggest.For one thing, shares have lagged behind rapidly expanding earnings. That has left the market as a whole trading at just over 15 times underlying earnings on Standard & Poor’s bottom up estimates for 2007, leading some to conclude that even a few quarters of lacklustre growth need not spoil the party. But the aggregate hides as much as it reveals.Among the sectors commanding high price/earnings multiples, a revealingly large number are in areas that should do comparatively well during a downturn. Consumer staples, for example, trade at about 18 times earnings. This is roughly matched by such businesses as Anheuser-Busch or PepsiCo. Companies credited with earnings growth potential, such as Procter & Gamble or WM Wrigley, are a lot dearer still.Similarly, the slightly more cyclical consumer discretionary sector, which includes media companies and the likes of Target, McDonald’s and Nike, trades at about 20 times earnings. Healthcare, telecommunications and utilities are also valued more highly than the broader market, if less aggressively so. Among classic favourites in rising markets, by contrast, only information technology commands a premium rating.For the S&P 500 as a whole, all of this is offset by the low ratings of financials – the largest earnings contributor by far – and energy. Investors are certainly wise not to expect peak-level earnings in those industries to last forever. Unfortunately, in the process, they have also driven up relative valuations of more defensive sectors – including ones with fairly direct exposure to slowing consumer spending. The mundane headline valuation of the S&P 500 may offer far less protection than at first appears if and when peak profits begin to fall.
563;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-01-26T21:40:10Z;Wall Street down on higher rates, volatile oil;;"US stocks were not for the faint-hearted this week. Sentiment swung wildly as investors got to grips with mixed results and guidance from several companies, volatile oil prices and rising bond yields.The Vix index, a market measure of volatility, reflected this. It swung from a low of 9.87 to a peak of 11.60 on Friday, and rose 7 per cent for the week.After setting a six-year high during the week, the S&P 500 retreated on Friday to close at 1,422.18, down 0.1 per cent on the day and 0.6 per cent over the five days as Treasury yields reached their highest levels in five months.“Rising rates are an expression of economic strength,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. But he said such strength ran counter to the Federal Reserve’s “soft landing” scenario and had “upset” investors.A clear trend this month has been the desire of investors to snap up recent underperformers if their earnings exceeded expectations.Jack Caffrey, senior equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “People are afraid of missing out, and when they hear good news they want to boost their portfolios with stocks that promise out-performance.”The situation was illustrated this week when Ebay beat earnings and raised guidance for 2007. The online auctioneer rose 6.8 per cent to $31.65, having fallen
30 per cent during the previous 12 months.Better than expected earnings from Yahoo boosted its shares by 1.4 per cent to $28.04 this week. After tumbling 35 per cent in 2006, the stock has risen 10 per cent this month. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,435.49 on Friday, a loss of 0.65 per cent for the week. A drag on the Nasdaq was Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares fell 3.7 per cent on the week to $71.50, after earnings failed to beat estimates.Other technology companies moving higher amid better earnings and guidance this week included Sun MicroSystems, up 9.7 per cent to $6.33, RF Micro Devices, up 13 per cent to $7.85, and Citrix Systems, up 8 per cent at $31.10. Microsoft beat earnings estimates but fell 1.6 per cent to $30.60 after setting a multi-year high of $31.48 on Thursday.Advanced Micro Devices, slid 8.5 per cent to $16.22 after the chipmaker missed its earnings estimates. Sun also said it would use chips from Intel in its servers, a move that could erode maket share for AMD said analysts.In contrast, Texas Instruments rose 9.3 per cent to $31.02 as the chipmaker produced stellar earnings. Shares in Corning surged 9.7 per cent to $21.20 after the maker of glass and fibre optics products also beat estimates.Blackstone increased its offer for Equity Office to $54 from $48.50 a share as it countered a rival buy-out offer of $52 a share. Shares in Equity Office rose 5.2 per cent to $55.22 this week.Countrywide jumped 4.2 per cent, to $42 on Friday after the Financial Times reported that the mortgage lender was in talks with Bank Of America about a possible $30bn deal. BofA shares fell 0.7 per cent to $52.04 on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record close during the week, only to retreat. It fell 0.1 per cent to 12,487.02 on Friday, a loss of 0.6 per cent over the week.AT&T led Dow constituents reporting earnings this week. Better revenue growth sparked a 3.8 per cent rise to $36.40 and shares hit a multi-year high of $37.70 on Thursday.Caterpillar shares rose 2.5 per cent to $61.09 on Friday after it raised sales guidance for 2007.McDonald’s weighed on the Dow as its shares slid 4.2 per cent to $42.93. Its quarterly earnings met estimates that were recently upgraded and had sent the stock to a multi-year peak of $45.06 more than a week ago. Topping the Dow this week was General Motors, up 4.4 per cent to $32.93, although the stock fell from a peak of $33.30 after it announced a delay in filing its fourth-quarter earnings.The company reiterated that it expected to be profitable in the fourth quarter of 2006.In stark contrast, Ford announced an annual loss of $12.7bn, the largest in its
history. The shares rose 1.4 per cent to $8.42.Analysts at Gimme Credit said Ford had managed investor expectations well: “We all know this is just the first quarter in what will be a gruelling, physical game.”"

565;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-01-24T21:50:50Z;Wall Street rallies as tech profits cheer;;US stocks rallied on Wednesday after several technology companies announced solid earnings.Late in New York, the S&P 500 had gained 0.85 per cent to 1,440.13, a six-year high.The telecommunications and information technology sectors lead the way with gains of 2.8 and 1.8 per cent respectively.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 12,621.77, a record close. AT&T rose 4.3 per cent to $36.87 and led gains for blue chips.The group’s mobile unit, Cingular Wireless, reported a sharp rise in fourth-quarter profit due to a surge in new customers during the period. AT&T fourth-quarter figures are due on Thursday.McDonald’s was a drag on the Dow as its shares fell 1.5 per cent to $44.16 after earnings met recently upward revised estimates.The restaurant chain’s shares hit a 52-week high last week. Technology companies were in the spotlight as the quarterly earnings season continued, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4 per cent to 2,466.28.It is now up 2.10 per cent for the year and leads the Dow’s rise of 1.3 per cent and the S&P’s 1.5 per cent gain so far in 2007.Yahoo shares rallied 7.3 per cent to $28.94 after the internet group’s fourth-quarter net income beat estimates late on Tuesday. Analysts cheered news that Yahoo would roll out its Panama search technology earlier than anticipated.Yahoo shares have risen 13.6 per cent this year, repairing some of its 35 per cent slide in 2006.Another technology company on the up was Sun MicroSystems, 8.7 per cent higher at $6.15. The maker of server and data storage products reported its first quarterly profit since 2002.Shares in RF Micro Devices jumped 13.7 per cent to $7.82 after the maker of mobile phone chips beat earnings estimates.Citrix Systems rose 6 per cent to $31.65 after the network infrastructure soft­-ware maker’s fourth-quarter profit and sales beat previous estimates and it reiterated guidance for the first quarter.Shares in Corning surged 11 per cent to $20.90 as the maker of glass and fibre optic products beat estimates. In spite of lower guidance for first-quarter sales, the company said it intended to keep prices firm.Shares in Ebay were up 4.8 per cent at $30 ahead of the release of the online auction house’s results after the close of trade.Not all technology shares were in the green. Advanced Micro Devices slid 8.5 per cent to $16.03 after its latest earnings were negative.Further talk of steel industry consolidation boosted the SLX, an exchange-traded fund that invests in steel.It gained 2.5 per cent to $48.86 after touching a record of $48.87.Shares in General Dynamics fell 1.3 per cent to $79.85, after the defence contractor’s fourth-quarter earnings missed estimates.
566;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
567;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2007-01-17T22:19:33Z;US stocks slide as inflation and Intel weigh;;"Wall Street ceded ground on Wednesday, with technology and semiconductor shares under notable pressure.Intel set a bearish tone and sank 5.7 per cent to $21.04 after it warned gross margins would narrow in 2007, following its fourth-quarter results. That loss reduced its prior gain for the year by over 50 per cent.Shares in another tech titan, Cisco slumped 3.8 per cent to $26.98 after its second brokerage downgrade in two days.The Nasdaq Composite lead the major benchmarks lower and fell 0.7 per cent to 2,479.42. The Philadelphia semi-conductor index lost 0.8 per cent, led by Intel.Sentiment for technology faced a further test after the closing bell, when Apple reported its fiscal first quarter results. The company posted net income of $1.14 a share, well ahead of estimates that had called for 77 cents a share. In after-hours trade, shares in Apple were 4.3 per cent higher at $99, a record high, following a fall of 2.2 per cent to $94.95 in regular trade.The S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,430.62. The information technology sector within the index fell 1.3 per cent, but still held a gain of 2.5 per cent so far this year. Energy led the five industry groups that closed higher, but was 5.7 per cent lower for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a new intra-day record high of 12,614, but at the close was 0.04 per cent lower at 12,577.15, hurt by Intel.Moderating losses for the Dow was Procter & Gamble. Its shares rose 1 per cent to $65.36, and made a new record high, after it was upgraded by Goldman Sachs.The overall mood for stocks was doused yesterday after a rise in wholesale inflation. Consumer inflation for December is due Thursday, while testimony on the economy by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke will also capture investor attention.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader said the PPI data “further postpones the day when the Fed will be able to begin lowering interest rates and has damped spirits”.Some economists downplayed the PPI report and said investors should focus upon the consumer price index due on Thursday.“The PPI should be a second-tier indicator as it has little predictive power for the CPI,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “More and more of our economy is service-oriented, and even within the goods sector, there is a disconnect between wholesale and retail prices, most notably for autos.”Mills jumped 26.4 per cent to $22.46 after the real estate investment trust agreed to be acquired by a Canadian company for $1.35bn.JPMorgan generated record earnings and revenue during the fourth quarter and, after rising to $48.89, its shares closed up 0.1 cent at $48.43.Shares in AMR fell 3.6 per cent to $38.78, after the parent of American Airlines posted its first quarterly profit since 2000. With a fourth quarter gain of seven cents a share, the results confounded estimates of a 13 cent-a-share loss.Southwest Airlines said fourth-quarter income fell
19 per cent due to losses from fuel hedges, pushing its shares down 4 per cent to $15.90.Lennar rose 4.5 per cent to $51.95 after the homebuilder said it lost $1.24 a share in the fourth quarter. The company forecast lower profits in the first half of 2007, but said it was on course to meet or exceed last year’s earnings.McDonald’s rose 0.7 per cent to $44.86 after it said higher global store sales would boost fourth-quarter earnings."
568;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Retail revolution: are you being e-served?;;"At Apple Computer’s flagship store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, the post-Christmas retail rush was in full swing last Wednesday.Customers were lining up outside the glass cube entrance to file down the stairs into one of the hottest stores in the city. At the long “Genius Bar” that runs down one side of the store, 21 employees were providing customers with the technical advice that has set Apple’s retail concept apart from the competition.But on this particular day, 21 geniuses were still not enough. A customer clutching his computer who tried to register for a face-to-face advice session was told he’d have to wait three hours and walked away.The afternoon melée, at a retailer known for its “high touch” customer service, was an extreme illustration of one of the central challenges that extends beyond retail to customer service in general. How do you have enough experts available to serve customers, but not so many that their wages bankrupt operations?“Retailers are always trying to find a way to use fewer people to service and touch more customers,” says Jeff Smith, head of global retail practice at Accenture, the consultancy group.In 2007, a handful of leading retailers will try a new technological approach to the issue. If a sales representative is not available, shoppers will be offered a screen-based alternative – not just a static web page but a live video link from the store to an expert sales agent located either in another store or, more likely, in a call centre.“We think the potential is enormous, certainly in retail formats,” says Chris Sang, chief executive of ClairVista, one of two small US companies that have developed “remote support” systems. “There’s really a total consensus among all the retailers we speak to that this is a good solution.”Experticity, ClairVista’s Seattle-based competitor, already has its system being tested by a leading US office supply retailer and a European mobile phone network operator. Further deployments of LiveSupport are expected during the first quarter of 2007.ClairVista says its own Live Expert screens will be in use by a national consumer electronics retailer at the same time. Neither company would give details of customers because of confidentiality agreements.D.L. Baron, the founder and chief executive of Experticity, first had the idea of using the internet to provide live customer assistance in 2000 when he was standing in an airport queue.“I showed up at the airport and there were all those counters and only two agents working, and the whole idea of distributive labour force came to me,” he says. He realised that the airline probably had other service staff elsewhere in its network who could be linked to kiosks at the airport.Both systems involve more than just a video link. The screens can show content such as demonstration videos and product information. The latest version of LiveSupport lets customers access the system from home computers or mobile phones.ClairVista launched Live Expert in November 2005. The system uses large screens for a stronger impact, on the basis that this is where the battle to win over both customers and retailers will largely be fought.Both companies agree that the remote systems are particularly suited to the needs of “commodity” retailers, which are now trying to sell more sophisticated and expensive products and services that need to be explained to customers. Best Buy and Circuit City, for instance, have both followed Apple’s lead in creating teams of experts to provide a higher level of customer service.Remote support systems could make it easier for mass retailers such as Wal-Mart or Target to follow. As they try to sell higher-end electronics and add-ons, including customer warranty plans, such companies will also want to control staffing costs.As Mr Sang is aware, the aisles of US retailers are littered with aspiring technological solutions. ClairVista launched a line of DVD-dispensing kiosks at outlets including McDonald’s restaurants. “The challenge is getting something implemented,” he says.“This takes a strategic point of view. It’s not something that you stick in a corner and see how it works. And if you just take $7-per-hour inventory clerks and put them in front of the camera and call them an expert, then it is not going to work.”Mr Smith says most retailers are wary of “functional change”, preferring instead to look for “a point solution to a point problem that incrementally improves their operations”.That covers recent technological innovations, from self-service supermarket check-outs to bar-code readers that provide a commentary on a particular bottle of wine or a pharmacy kiosk that will check a customer’s identity and dispense repeat prescriptions.Remote support could provide that “point solution” if it increases sales. Experticity claims that, in pilot tests, it increased the overall value of a sale in more than 70 per cent of cases.But Mr Smith argues that systems such as remote support could be a chance for retailers to take a new look at the kind of expertise they are providing. It could be an opportunity “to create people who are more the agent of the customer than they are experts or stockers or cashiers”.Beyond retail, both Expert­icity and ClairVista see plenty of scope for using remote support systems to augment customer service - whether that is by linking doctors to new walk-in health clinics or checking in hotel guests.Mr Baron says Experticity was recently approached by a high-end fashion retailer that was interested in using the system to offer style advice.But surely customers always prefer to deal with a real person face-to-face? Not necessarily, says Mr Baron, though it is a key question for retailers.“We encountered doubt and scepticism,” he says. “Then we found out that
not only would customers engage with a screen, but they were delighted.“Putting enough knowledgeable people on the floor is really tough. So the person on the screen has access to a lot more de facto information. And the person on the screen, for some customers, is also a lot less threatening. They’re not going to follow you round the store trying to make a sale.”"
569;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-11-24T17:29:17Z;Whitney Tilson: Good reasons to lock in your gains and trim your holdings;;Since I began writing this column in late February, I have made 10 stock recommendations – eight longs and two shorts. All are in the money, with an average gain of 31 per cent, led by Lear Corp, the automotive components maker, which has almost doubled since I wrote in late March that its share sell-off had been way overdone.With all of the major stock indices up for the year – and in many cases, hitting multi-year highs – many investors are facing the dilemma of whether to lock in similar gains.There are no simple answers but here are four reasons we generally start to take profits.The first reason is straightforward – when a stock rises to our estimate of intrinsic value. Let us say we buy a stock at $10, thinking it is worth $18-$22, with a midpoint of $20 – a proverbial 50-cent dollar. Assuming no change in intrinsic value, we would likely start trimming the position at $18 and be out by $22. It is critical, however, not to anchor on the original estimate of intrinsic value. If unexpectedly good news is behind the stock reaching $18, for example, our estimate of value might have risen to $24-$28, in which case we likely won’t be selling yet.This is a major reason we still own a large position in McDonald’s, which we bought years ago as low as $12. We originally thought the shares were worth $25 or so but, when the price got there, our estimate of intrinsic value had risen to approximately $35. When it hit $35, we thought it was worth $50-$60, which is why we are still holding at almost $42 today.The second reason we sell is when we find a better investment. That may mean selling an 80-cent dollar to buy a 50-cent dollar, or selling a risky stock to buy an equally cheap safer one. The latter explains why we sold Lear after it had rallied into the high $20s. As I noted in my first column, Lear is in a terrible industry and, if US carmakers encounter further distress, Lear will be hit by a negative impact in ways that are hard to forecast. The stock may well double again, but we cannot rule out the possibility that it could also go bankrupt someday, as have many of its auto supplier peers. We took our profits in Lear and reinvested them in Berkshire Hathaway, which we believe is the safest company in the world and was equally cheap at the time (both stocks are up approximately 30 per cent since we swapped them).Our third reason for selling is if the story on a company materially changes. We agree with Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn when he says: “We never invent new reasons to continue with a position when the original reasons are no longer available.” This situation occurs more frequently in losing stocks, but also happens on occasion with our winners.A few years ago, after making big gains on the stock previously, we got back into shares of EVCI Career Colleges at about $6, thinking their intrinsic value was $10-$12. Then the company announced the most egregious compensation scheme, in which the top two executives would receive annual cash salaries and bonuses equal to 8 per cent of the company’s revenues, plus receive almost 5 per cent of shares outstanding in the form of stock options each year. This shattered two pillars of our investment thesis – the high integrity of management and a competent, independent board – so, after registering our feelings and getting no response, we sold immediately. You will not be surprised to learn that EVCI stock is now under 50 cents.Finally, we sometimes trim stocks to balance our portfolio. The margin of safety on a big winner typically goes down just as the rising price makes it a larger share of the portfolio, so we often take some profits in the position when that happens. We also do this if a particular sector takes up too much of our portfolio. After making great money on McDonald’s, CKE Restaurants, Jack in the Box and Yum Brands in 2003, we cut back because we did not want too much exposure to burger stocks.One final caution – do not fall into the trap of consistently selling your winners and buying more of your losers. While this can be the right thing to do, great investors typically have a gift for finding a few great stocks and having the conviction and courage to let them run. In a recent interview for Value Investor Insight, Akre Capital’s Chuck Akre told us that he first started buying Berkshire Hathaway at about $100 in the mid-1970s. He has made 1,000 times his money – and still holds the stock! Such situations happen rarely in an investment lifetime, so if you think you have found a “compounding machine”, as Akre calls it, think long and hard about ever selling.Whitney Tilson is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight and co-founded the Value Investing Congress.feedback@tilsonfunds.com
570;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-11-23T23:52:39Z;Tesco to bring its own suppliers to US;;Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket chain, is taking two of its favoured British food suppliers along on its bid to open a new chain of small-sized supermarkets in the western United States next year.Natures Way Foods, which produces prepared salads and lettuce for Tesco, and 2 Sisters Food Group, one of Britain’s leading poultry processors, are both planning to establish sites adjacent to Tesco’s planned distribution centre in southern California.The move is the latest surprise in Tesco’s bold US expansion strategy, which centres on an unprecedented bid to establish both a store network and a proprietary distribution system at the same time.Both suppliers are privately owned. Natures Way, headed by Robert Langmead, was initially set up in 1994 exclusively to serve rising demand from the retailer for lettuce and salad. It now supplies other customers, including McDonald’s.The company has not previously worked outside the UK, but has now set up a US subsidiary, Wild Rocket Foods, which is recruiting staff for its US operation.2 Sisters Food Group produces Buxted and Hermanns brand poultry, as well as own-label products for supermarkets including Tesco. In 2005, it acquired Rannoch Foods, a producer of prepared foods.The company is owned by Ranjit Singh and operates poultry processing plants in the UK and the Netherlands, with annual revenue of more than £350m ($671m).Tesco’s decision to rely on established relationships with British suppliers rather than new relationships in the US is believed to reflect both its desire to avoid unpleasant surprises and a belief in the industry that the prepared meals business in the UK and Europe delivers higher standard products than are currently seen in the US.Prepared meals – including salads and cooked chickens – are expected to be play a significant role in Tesco’s plans to open about 150 small neighbourhood market stores around Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix.It is not clear whether Tesco has taken a stake in the US operations of the two companies, which have both set up Delaware-based corporations. Both are seeking planning approval for facilities on land at a business park at Riverside, California that is adjacent to an 88 acre lot bought by Tesco earlier this year.Planning documents describe the site as “a Tesco food distribution and manufacturing campus”.However, their plans may be complicated by a legal challenge that is calling for additional environmental reviews of Tesco’s plans for its site, located in a business park in a former US Air Force base.Ray Johnson, a lawyer who has in the past challenged developments by Wal-Mart, the US retailer, is calling on the planning authorities to subject both suppliers’ projects to a potentially time consuming environmental impact study.
571;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Car hunger drives China’s drive-thru growth;;"Lunchtime at McDonald’s new ‘drive-thru’ restaurant in Shanghai and most of the cars rolling through are sleek, shiny models driven by busy professional types.But a few of the customers are less conventional. A couple of taxis turn up to buy spicy chicken wings with fries. And one man drives up on a motorbike.Cars have an aspirational quality in most developing countries, and in China some people want the perceived perks of membership even before they can afford to join the club.Just over a decade ago, owning a private car was still frowned upon in China, but the launch of McDonald’s drive-thrus is the latest phase in the rapid spread of US-style car culture.The fast-food group opened its first drive-thru in China just last year – 30 years after their introduction in the US – but was so impressed with the result that half its new restaurants in the country are to follow the format in a bet that rising car use will help it catch up with rival KFC, which has more than twice as many Chinese outlets.“We were amazed at how quickly people caught on,” says Jeffrey Schwartz, chief executive of McDonald’s in China.As with many other industries, China has become one of the driving forces in the car sector. Industry executives are congregating in Beijing this weekend for the country’s annual motor show to chart their assault on a market growing at 25 per cent a year.Levels of car ownership are still low at less than 2 per cent of the population. But the scale of the country means that China is likely to overtake Japan this year to become the second-biggest car market in the world. And executives see no signs of car sales slowing any time soon.The car boom is having an impact well beyond the carmakers’ bottom-lines. It also marks a dramatic shift in the way people are leading their lives in a country still associated in many minds with the bicycle.Twenty years ago, many city residents worked at a state-owned company and lived in a nearby flat provided by their employer. They would bike to work and rarely leave their immediate neighbourhood.Today, the centres of the many Chinese cities are still densely populated and cramped by bicycles and cars vying for space. But Beijing and Shanghai now have vast suburban areas filled with gated complexes of high-rise flats that look down on wide highways.Even though both cities are planning extensive metro networks, a car is becoming a necessity.“I used to come out to some of these neighbourhoods and look around and think – this place is just made for drive-thrus,” says Mr Schwartz.The spread of car ownership has prompted many spin-offs. At the magazine rack of most newsagents, around a quarter of the space is taken up by car magazines with titles such as Auto Society, the King of Cars and Modern Car. The magazines love to focus on the cars of famous movie stars and run lavish articles about long road trips celebrating the new-found freedom and independence of drivers.“For some Chinese, they feel that they are more in control of things if they are driving,” says Xie Xialing, a sociologist at Fudan University in Shanghai.Mr Xie is one of a number of Chinese who sees the car boom as a mirror image of the growing social divide in China. Drivers in China show little respect for each other or pedestrians, he says. “These Chinese drivers often behave as if they were incredibly superior.”Not everyone is convinced about prospects for drive-thrus. KFC has opened four outlets so equipped, but it says the market is not ready for an aggressive expansion. Retailers such as Carrefour and Wal-Mart say it is essential to find store locations near to public transport because few shoppers are willing or able to drive.But McDonald’s is making a further bet on China’s car culture. The government is constructing an enormous highway network modelled on Eisenhower’s interstate system from the 1950s; at 25,500 miles long, it is just over a half the size of that in the US. McDonald’s has signed a deal with Sinopec, the company that runs about 70 per cent of the country’s petrol stations, which gives the burger chain the right to put a restaurant in any of Sinopec’s 7,000 locations.Company executives admit this will be a long-term project. The idea of the road trip is still a new one. Outside the main east-coast cities, most new highways are often empty."
572;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-11-17T21:43:23Z;ISS presses for tougher line on boardroom votes;;US companies will come under renewed pressure to give shareholders more power on governance issues such as board independence and executive compensation under tougher voting guidelines from a leading investor advisory firm.The release of the guidelines by Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises 1,700 institutional investors on votes at annual shareholder meetings, is a sign of fund managers’ desire to have more say on corporate matters.This trend has been strengthened by a series of scandals, such as the controversy over options back-dating, that have prompted an increasing number of shareholders to move away from their traditional passive acceptance of management’s decisions.“We have seen a tectonic shift in power away from the corner office towards shareholders and directors,” said Martha Carter, ISS managing director of corporate governance.In the new guidelines, released yesterday, ISS urges shareholders to support the introduction of majority voting for directors and to pressure companies to force the resignation of directors that fail to win the support of the majority of shareholders.Corporate governance activists regard the change as crucial for the advancement of shareholder democracy, arguing that it allows investors to hold directors accountable for their performance. Some 100 US companies, including Wal-Mart and McDonald’s, have already announced they will elect directors by majority voting at their next annual meeting.However, the issue re-mains a top priority for investors, who tabled resolutions calling for the change in the voting rules at more than 150 companies during the last round of annual meetings, according to ISS.The advisory firm tightened its guidelines on directors’ performance, urging shareholders not to vote for directors of companies that significantly underperform their sector in both financial and share price terms for two years in a row.On another controversial issue – executive pay – ISS recommends that investors withhold their vote from the chief executive, or even the entire board, of companies with “egregious compensation problems”.Last year, the advisory firm urged investors to withdraw support only for directors sitting on the compensation committee.The tougher stance follows a string of shareholder protests at the pay of senior executives at companies such as Pfizer, AT&T, Merrill Lynch and Home Depot.In its list of bad compensation practices, ISS includes awarding executives change-in-control payments when their company is bought but they remain at the helm.The issue has become increasingly controversial due to the sharp rise in takeovers by private equity groups, which often retain companies’ top management.
573;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-11-08T15:27:00Z;Introduction: Playing the tune of shared success;;"The chairman of BMW’s supervisory board, Joachim Milberg, once declared: “Those who work alone can only accumulate, but those who collaborate intelligently can multiply.” The comment was in relation to the development of the company’s X3 sports utility vehicle, which was developed in collaboration with Magna Steyr/SFT.The goal of achieving a result that is greater than the sum of the individual parts, – the “multiplication effect” – has long been recognised in business, and creating win-win relationships with partners is a key driver. This reflects a recognition that business is no longer about competition at all costs, but that organisations are being forced to collaborate and partner with other companies to gain competitive advantage.The term collaboration covers a broad range of different ways organisations can work together. Work by Douglas Lambert at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University with organisations such as McDonalds, Xerox, Ryder, 3M and Whirlpool and their key partners, identified the following types of relationship: arms length relationships, through what are defined as type one, two and three collaborative partnerships; joint ventures; and vertical integration.Type one collaborative partnerships are where companies recognise each other as partners, and co-ordinate and plan activities on a limited basis. The partnership is short-term and involves one division or a limited number of functional areas in each business.Type two collaborative partnerships see partners moving beyond the co-ordination of activities to the integration of them. This relationship has a long-term horizon but is not expected to last for ever. In this case, multiple divisions and functions within each company are involved.Type three collaborative partnerships occur when the companies share significant levels of operational integration. Each organisation views the other as an extension of its own business, an end-date is not usually set and the relationship is seen as permanent.The requirements for maintaining these different types of collaborative relationships differ substantially in terms of planning, contract style, communications and operational controls. For example, it may not be possible to have a type three relationship with every partner, but selecting the appropriate type of collaborative relationship with a business partner is becoming a major source of competitive advantage.Collaboration can also take place between competitors, a form of alliance called “co-opetition”. This can occur when neither company is able to enter a market on its own. For example, beer makers Heineken and Guinness build breweries together in developing markets to produce both products. Carmakers Ford and Volkswagen co-developed and manufactured the original Ford Galaxy, Seat Alhambra and Volkswagen Sharan people carriers. The advantage to those involved in co-opetition is that a category or market can be developed at lower risk to each organisation.Maximising internal collaboration is also critically important. It is often thought that relationships within an organisation are stronger than the relationships with external actors. Conventional thinking says: “If we are all within the same company we should all collaborate together successfully.” But the reality is that internal relationships are often worse than external relationships. What is more, the internal relationships can be treated with contempt with functions trying to gain advantage over each other.In a survey of 500 organisations in the US, published in the International Journal of Logistics, interdepartmental relationships were shown to result in reduced cycle times, better in-stock performance, increased product availability, order-to-delivery time and customer improvements. Those organisations which collaborated well internally had performed better in terms of meeting customer needs, accommodating special customer requests and introducing new products. As a result, customers had a better perception of the organisations which, in turn, led to increased sales and margins.To create a win-win relationship there are two key dimensions that need to develop. The first is what I call “C3 behaviour’: a combination of co-operation, co-ordination and collaboration. C3 behaviour involves working together to achieve effective operations in harmony with the strategies and objectives of both parties.The second dimension is trust. Trust helps companies to integrate micro-level psychological processes and group dynamics with macro-level institutional arrangements. In other words, it entails dispositions, decisions, behaviours, social networks and institutions. Trust enables co-operative behaviour, promotes improved relationships, reduces harmful conflict and allows effective responses to crises.Managers need a new skill set to develop these ideas into collaborative relationships. In addition to technical ability and intelligence, organisations need to embrace the so-called “soft skills”. For example, when building a collaborative relationship, social skills, empathy and motivation are of high value.A survey by the Society of Human Resource Management illustrated the importance of emotional intelligence in achieving competitive advantage. The researchers analysed a series of top companies, selected for profitability, cycle times, volumes and other key performance measures. They found that the companies which had performed best had the following competences in managing their human assets: organisational belief and commitment to basic strategy; open communication and trust building with all internal and external stakeholders; an interest in building relationships inside and outside the organisation where they offered competitive advantage; collaboration, support and the sharing of resources; an environment where innovation, risk taking and learning were promoted; and a passion for competition and continual improvement.Foundations for success and failureI recently conducted a study of more than 60 collaborative relationships and identified a number of factors for success:• innovative commercial practices, tough but achievable incentives and meaningful gain share;• end-to-end, clearly visible performance objectives agreed by all supply chain players including the end-customers;• frequent, interactive, open communications across all levels of the customer/supplier interface especially on performance reviews and continuous improvement of products/services and business processes;• open, no blame culture aimed at customer and relationship satisfaction which depend on personal, trusting relationships;• joint planning and business systems supported by free-flow of information.In contrast, those relationships that were typified by failure exhibited the following types of behaviours and practices:• lack of stable customer funding arrangements, which prevented supplier investment planning;• insufficient investment, which generated long-term costs and prevented performance incentivisation;• lack of investment in good staff, which caused unnaturally high turnover and prevented personal relationship development and efficient business processes;• adversarial, bureaucratic commercial practices and attitudes, which increased costs, caused delays and reduced trust;• lack of culture-matching results in “us and them” attitudes, which resulted in a downward spiral of poor behaviour, reduced benefits and low performance.The key lessons of collaborationFor collaborative relationships to be successful, the following foundations need to be in place:• Both organisations need a common focus, that is a shared commitment to a basic strategy.• An agreed joint process is required. This is often a problem, because for organisations to can have little understanding of their own internal processes. So, agreeing on a joint one can be difficult.• Integration of internal applications is important to ensure good communication and data flow across the relationship.• Flexibility and responsiveness are critical for both organisations to create agility within the relationship.• Agreed joint performance measures. Both parties should be measuring the success of the relationship in a common way using the same metrics. Hard measures will need to be used but “soft” measures for gauging the success of the relationship in terms of levels of trust and personal relationships also need to be included. This point is important because surprisingly few organisations measure the soft relationship issues and continue to focus on hard performance measures which only reveal the symptoms of failure and not the causes. Instead, companies need to ask questions such as: how many business relationships do we have? Why are they important? Which ones are doing well and why? Which ones are not doing well and why? How do we identify hard targets for continuous relationship improvement?ConclusionWhen striving to create win-win relationships, it could be argued that the first question all organisations need to ask is: how will the company or internal function you want to collaborate with benefit from collaborating with you. Ultimately, if there is nothing in it for the other party there is no motivation for collaboration and, therefore, the “multiplication effect” will not occur.Richard Wilding is chair in supply chain risk management at the Cranfield School of Management and specialises in the creation of collaborative supply chain environments

574;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-10-24T17:26:34Z;Venezuela workers quarrel with Coke bottler;;A quarrel that has surfaced this week between Venezuelan workers and the local subsidiary of soft drinks bottler Coca-Cola Femsa might, at first sight, appear to be nothing more than a routine labour dispute.But, at least according to some economists, it just may be a taste of what is to come under President Hugo Chávez’s recipe for “21st-century socialism”.Since Monday, hundreds of unemployed ex-contractors have blocked delivery trucks from distributing the soft drink around Venezuela in demand of what they allege is $2.8m worth of severance arrears owed to more than 10,000 former workers. Coca-Cola alleges that the protest action is “illegal”.The former Coca-Cola employees, however, are being actively encouraged in their protest by a government-backed commission from the Venezuelan legislature, which is controlled 100 per cent by government allies.“The company should be expropriated,” said Iris Valera, a pro-government deputy who is supporting the labourers, adding that Coca-Cola’s four plants should be converted to produce a homespun Venezuelan brand soft drink.While rural properties and farms have long been the target of expropriations as part of a government-led “land reform” programme, it is only recently that the authorities have turned their attention to urban factories.Some analysts say it is evidence of the government’s overt intention to hand over control of privately-owned factories to the workers.Mr Chávez, who has been in power for eight years and who is running for re-election for a further six years in December, says “social enterprises”, or companies in which workers have control, is the preferred corporate model.José Guerra, an economist, predicted that the current dispute between government-backed ex-workers and Coca-Cola is an example of what might become a common event during a third Chávez government.“This is clearly part of a government plan to harass the private sector and it’s going to continue,” he said.A torrent of income from oil exports has allowed the economy to grow strongly during the past two years, largely as a result of a massive increase in government expenditure. However, unemployment remains stubbornly high.Mr Guerra added: “Because the economy is not generating a sufficient number of jobs, the government’s objective is to take over existing successful companies and oblige them to provide additional employment.”Venezuela is also in the process of establishing majority state control over oil production units previously operated by multinational oil companies.Furthermore, over the past year Venezuela’s tax collection agency, Seniat, has temporarily closed a number of local units of US-based multinationals, including McDonalds, IBM and Microsoft, for alleged tax irregularities.But it is not the first time that Coca-Cola – which last year sold 4bn 8oz bottles of the soft drink in Venezuela from 33 distribution centres – has faced problems from the Chávez government.In January 2003, during a protracted strike against the government by businesses, troops seized control of a bottling plant in the city of Valencia, west of Caracas, and distributed thousands of bottles free to the public.

The move, part of a global trend towards healthier eating, comes several months after Disney decided not to renew a 10-year global promotional contract with McDonald’s.Disney is also shaking up the food options available at its parks and resorts to encourage healthier eating. Soft drinks and other forms of fast food will continue to be available at the parks. However, the group said it would offer healthier alternatives as a “default option” for families buying meals for children.Beginning this month, children’s meals at Disney’s US parks will be served with low-fat milk, fruit juice or water while apple sauce or carrots will replace side dishes, such as French fries.The group aims to have eliminated added “trans” fats from food served at its parks by the end of 2007 and from its licensed and promotional products by the end of 2008.Tom Staggs, Disney’s chief financial officer, said the guidelines would affect about 40 per cent of the companies that have licensing contracts with the group.“About 60 per cent of [licensed] food products are consistent with these guidelines,” he said, adding the group would honour existing contracts with food partners.Healthy eating campaign groups welcomed the move.The Center for Science in the Public Interest called on Disney to “re-examine” the food advertising it accepts on its ABC television network but said its new position put the company in a “much more family-friendly position [than] its competitors, notably Nickelodeon, whose programming is filled with junk food ads”.

The company also reported an 8.4 per cent rise in system-wide sales, better than the 7 per cent gain in revenue forecast by analysts. Its shares rose 2.38 per cent, or 98 cents, to $42.23.PepsiCo said third quarter profit rose nearly 71 per cent, helped by strength in its international business, non-carbonated drinks and salty snacks. The beverage and snacks company also lifted its forecast for the year. In spite of this, PepsiCo shares fell 1.58 per cent to $62.85.The S&P 500 closed up 0.95 per cent, or 12.87 points, at 1,362.82. The Nasdaq composite was up 1.64 per cent, or 371.91 points, at 2,346.18 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a new record high of 11,948.26, up 0.81 per cent or 96.13 points for the day, the first time it has closed above the 11,900 barrier.The US trade gap rose to a record level in August. US imports outstripped exports by $69.9bn in August, according to the commerce department, up from the previous record of $68bn set in July.Alfred Goldman, of AG Edwards, said the upward movement of stocks was in spite of certain factors that may have been expected to have more of a negative impact recently. “This market has been ignoring several good excuses to go lower , such as North Korea’s nuclear test,” he said.He added that the Dow was up 10 per cent in the past two and half months, saying the market should be careful of going too far too fast.Early on Thursday, wholesale retailer Costco reported better-than-expected results and said it did not expect to restate results following a review of its stock option programme. Costco shares rose 7.65 per cent, or $3.83, to $53.90.Harley Davidson, the motorcycle maker, said its earnings climbed 18 per cent in the most recent quarter, beating Wall Street forecasts. Its shares climbed
2.7 per cent to $64.88.Shares in Systemax, the computer parts and hardware distributor, plunged after the company said it would delay reporting of its second quarter results because it needed more time to complete the process. Shares in the company were down 21.54 per cent, or $3.24, at $11.80."

579;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-08-24T18:01:55Z;McDonald’s loses senior executive;;"The surprise resignation of Mike Roberts, McDonald’s president and chief operating officer, does not appear to signal a shift in strategy at the world’s biggest hamburger chain, analysts said on Thursday.McDonald’s gave no reason for the departure, announced late Wednesday, and appointed Ralph Alvarez, president of McDonald’s North America, to the number two spot. As part of the management shuffle, Don Thompson was named president of McDonald’s USA.McDonald’s has seen a number of changes in its executive suite in recent years. In 2004, Jim Skinner replaced Charlie Bell as chief executive after he stepped down to focus on fighting cancer. Mr Bell had succeeded Jim Cantalupo, who died earlier that year.The company has won praise for swiftly naming replacements and thus reducing uncertainty in the financial markets. Mr Roberts, a 29-year veteran of the company, was instrumental in helping lead the turnround started four years ago, but analysts said with Mr Skinner at the helm, a shift in strategy was unlikely.Mr Roberts had been seen as a candidate to succeed Mr Skinner in the top job.“This change in management does not indicate a change in direction for the business or strategy, nor do we believe this represents a warning signal that there are issues with the progress of the US business, or the turnaround in the international European markets,” said Andrew Barish, analyst at Banc of Americas Securities, in a report.“The only inference that we could make, is that Matt Paull, CFO is likely the top candidate [down the road] for the CEO position. We do not believe Jim Skinner will retire any time soon; however the long-term succession plan appears to be taking shape.”Mr Alvarez takes on his new role at a time when sales at casual dining chains are under pressure. The rise in petrol prices and interest rates has forced many low- and middle-income consumers to cut back discretionary spending, including eating out.In a recent report, John Glass, analyst at CIBC World Markets, said this is a time of “unprecedented slowing sales in restaurants” and that “many executives liken this period to 1991 - the last great consumer recession”.In recent weeks, Starbucks, the world’s largest specialty coffee chain, and Burger King, the number two hamburger chain, have reported disappointing sales that sent their share prices lower. McDonald’s also said its July US same-store sales grew at the smallest rate in more than three years."
580;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-08-14T18:33:45Z;Importance of a poker face for investors;;"“Humans are hard-wired to be irrational when it comes to financial decisions. We must understand that, so we don’t become the sucker at the poker table.”Whitney Tilson’s observation that people make mistakes in managing their money should be no surprise to anybody who has been that sucker, fidgeting with a pair of threes as the card sharp across the table collects what was going to be your latte fund for the next three months.Mr Tilson, a fund manager, founder of T2 Partners, and an FTWealth columnist, is a proponent of behavioural finance, a school of investment thought that expands the fool-and-his-money theory to a bigger scale.Behavioural finance maintains that not only do individuals make mistakes with money, they do it in big enough numbers to drag markets with them. But those mistakes are predictable, so it is possible to use the theory to make money.This may not surprise anyone who paid $118 for shares in Yahoo in January 2000. Behavioural finance promises not simply chastisement for bad investment decisions but a way to avoid making more bad decisions and, more attractively, a way to profit from the bad investment decisions of others.“For the individual investor, there’s a big yield in terms of holding a mirror and he can see he has more blemishes than he thought,” said Terry Odean, a professor of finance at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. And there are plenty of blemishes. “They trade too frequently, the stocks they sell do better than the ones they bought, and they don’t diversify,” says Professor Odean.“People take more information than they need to make a decision,” says Chris Coplin, chief investment officer of the US behavioural finance team for JPMorgan. “They like the comfort factor it gives them. They need only five data items but they look for 50. People also suffer from the confirmation bias. They decide whether they like a stock and then look for evidence that confirms that view.”Mr Tilson says: “The biggest one I observe is overconfidence – 70 per cent of people believe they are in the top half of drivers. They invest in things they don’t understand but convince themselves they do.”These tics of investment behaviour translate into sizeable changes in the stock market. Robert Shiller, the Yale economics professor, believes that studying people’s tendencies towards overconfidence, confirmation biases and the like is essential to understanding the market. “The earliest articles I did were the excess volatility articles, which were very controversial,” he says. “It was saying that the volatility of markets showed that markets were not efficient.”Prof Shiller has also noticed other psychologically driven swings in securities prices. “Stocks underreact to earnings news and overreact later,” he says.Psychology also leads to other market effects such as momentum, where higher prices lead to more buying, which in turn leads to higher prices. The process also works in bear markets, aggravating swings in prices. This can lead to herding.The technology bubble of the 1990s provides good examples of cognitive flaws, including overconfidence, herd mentalities and stock price momentum.Behavioural finance has lessons for those who believe in the wisdom of crowds – the bigger the number of people making a decision, the less likely they are to err.“The wisdom of crowds makes sense when there’s a wide distribution of information or when everybody has an unbiased estimate,” says Prof Odean. “But what happens when people share a common decision bias? Why might they not make the same mistake?”Mr Tilson agrees: “Every study shows that investors follow the crowd. They say: ‘All these [other] people must know what they’re doing.’ People pile into whatever the hottest fund is and get massacred.” Prof Odean’s advice to avoiding such massacres is to buy low-cost diversified funds such as index funds.If individual investors are their own psychological worst enemy, the case becomes more serious for professional money managers, who are not immune from the same psychological errors. Mr Coplin says: “They can suffer the illusion of objectivity. Part of overconfidence comes from expertise. The more expertise you have, the more over-
confident you become.”Mr Tilson says: “My opinion is that 80 per cent of money managers are not suited to be professional money managers. The bulk of the money in this world is managed in a cover-your-ass fashion.”For institutional investment professionals, the way to make money from behavioural insights may seem pedestrian: screen for value stocks and make sure they are considered by fund managers.Mr Coplin’s selection method is quite straightforward: “Build a portfolio which has a measurable proportion of value stocks to force them[fund managers] to look at.”Mr Tilson also recommends value stocks: “For me it means buying a stock for less than it’s worth. Our largest positions today are Microsoft, McDonalds, Wal-Mart and Berkshire Hathaway. They’re four of the greatest companies in the world, and trade at a discount to the rest of the market. You need to go back quite a way to find them this cheap. As recently as a couple of months ago, large caps were trading at the cheapest level in 40 years.”Large-cap value stocks have been more resilient in the recent downturn, in spite of the fact that they have been out of fashion. Even though holding value stocks now is a contrarian position, acting on the insights of behavioural finance cannot be reduced to doing the opposite of what the herd is doing.A few funds are now explicitly billed as being based on behavioural finance, among them JPMorgan’s Intrepid Funds and Fuller Thaler funds.Mr Shiller thinks behavioural finance has limited marketing appeal. “There are few funds that are explicitly behavioural,” he said. “A behavioural finance fund is not a strong marketing strategy. The general person is not impressed with psychology or investment research.” But Prof Odean suspects some will try to call behavioural finance to their aid. “On the institutional side, nobody is willing to tell you how they make money and a lot of people are going to claim they [use behavioural finance] because it’s a good story,” he said."
581;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Burger King;;Indigestion can be a side-effect of buying an asset from private equity owners. Rarely, however, does it set in quite as swiftly as at Burger King. Following its inaugural results since its return as a listed company, the fast food chain saw its shares fall by as much as 19 per cent. While they later recovered almost half the loss, Burger King’s shares have been under pressure pretty much since its private equity owners sold off a minority stake in May.That raises some questions about the wisdom of the offering’s pricing. Burger King, moreover, still has a thing or two to learn about coping with the public limelight. Many analysts expected comparable store sales growth at its US and Canadian restaurants to be at least twice as fast as the two per cent reported for its fiscal fourth quarter. The shortfall says as much about expectations management as underlying performance.Profits look healthy, after stripping out a wide-range of special items. Average restaurant sales, moreover, have also edged upwards. That should further enhance its appeal to franchisees, while the remaining gap to the likes of Wendy’s and McDonald’s highlights Burger King’s growth potential.John Chidsey, the chain’s 9th chief executive in just over a decade, has sensible ideas on how to get there. Longer opening hours, lower-cost restaurants, upgrading the menu and pushing value meals should all improve Burger King’s competitive position and offer some protection against a US slowdown.While other fast food chains are hardly standing still, moreover, earnings should also benefit from paying down debt and lower tax charges. Plenty of execution risks remain, while rebuilding credibility will take time. But with Burger King’s shares now trading at a sizeable discount to fast-food peers on most measures, they are starting to look appetising.
582;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-08-01T21:12:00Z;Investors lose their appetite for Burger King;;Burger King, the second largest hamburger chain, on Tuesday said it had swung to a quarterly loss as its first results since going public in May were hit by one-off charges.The results sent its shares down more than 13 per cent in morning trade.But John Chidsey, who was appointed chief executive in April, highlighted the positive aspects of the quarter, saying the business continued to “deliver strong results” and the Value Menu introduced in the US in March was performing above expectations.“We believe this is especially relevant in today’s economy as consumers are being more cautious with their non-essential spending,” Mr Chidsey said. “We believe the company will benefit as consumers choose quick-service restaurants, like Burger King, rather than more expensive fast casual and casual dining restaurants.”“The Burger King brand is relevant again in pop culture,” he added.Last month the chain added the BK Stacker sandwich to its menu. It comes in three sizes: double, triple and quad, and includes two, three or four hamburgers with equal slices of cheese, up to eight slices of bacon and BK Stacker Sauce.The Quad Stacker adds up to 1,000 calories, 68 grams of fat and 30 grams of saturated fat – more fat than most adults should have in a day.The move is counter to the health and wellness trend under way in the food industry but shows that, in spite of the obesity epidemic, consumers still want the choice of a jumbo burger.In the fourth quarter, Burger King lost $9m, or 7 cents a share, compared with a profit of $2m, or 2 cents a share, a year ago. The results included a one-time management termination fee of $30m, related to the company’s initial public offering, and other restructuring charges.Revenue rose 6 per cent to $533m from $503m.Comparable sales rose 2 per cent in the US and 1.9 per cent worldwide. Last week, larger rival McDonald’s said its global comparable sales rose 5.5 per cent in the second quarter.Burger King shares closed down by more than 13 per cent at $13.24 in New York on Tuesday.
583;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-07-25T21:33:01Z;Disney fronts Kroger’s new health drive;;Kroger, the largest US traditional supermarket group, is going into partnership with Disney’s Mickey Mouse and the stars of Toy Story, Monsters Inc and The Incredibles, in the entertainment company’s most ambitious effort to date to realign itself with the cause of healthy eating.The retailer, which operates about 2,400 supermarkets across the US, is to introduce more than 100 Disney-branded products, starting this year with items that will include packaged fresh fruit, cheese, vegetable dips, and a range of snacks and staples such as peanut butter, pasta and granola bars made with more nutritional ingredients.Mickey Mouse himself will appear in the role of chef and farmer in store signs, and will give the thumbs up on nutritional labels. The products, branded as Disney Magic Selections, will largely have no trans fat content, with a goal of being entirely trans-fat free by the end of 2007.The deal is the most wide-ranging negotiated with a retailer’s private label food products by Disney.It also marks the first time Disney has extensively engaged in developing a line of branded goods, rather than licensing existing products to food companies. “We have been closely involved in the product development with them,” said Harry Dolman, who heads the food, health and beauty division of Disney Consumer Products.The range will be “affordably priced”, according to Mr Dolman, in contrast to previous initiatives targeting premium food products. “That nowadays is not such an interesting proposition to consumers,” he said.Disney, which this year ended a marketing agreement with McDonald’s, the fast-food restaurant, currently licenses packaged fruit and vegetables in Europe with Tesco, Carrefour and Metro.The initiatives come at a time when entertainment and food companies are facing growing public concern over the influence of their marketing on childhood obesity, and related litigation risks.Viacom and Kellogg’s are currently facing the threat of legal action over marketing to children, led by the Center for Science in the Public Interest.Earlier this month, Viacom’s Nickelodeon channel announced it would extend the licensing of Dora the Explorer, SpongeBob SquarePants and other characters to packaged apples, pears, cherries and organic edamame beans, following a deal last year to use the characters on spinach, baby carrots and clementines.
584;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-07-21T20:51:16Z;Wall Street lower as tech results disappoint;;Wall Street ended the week mixed after a hectic few days of earnings reports depressed the Nasdaq composite index but boosted the S&P 500.It was also a good week for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which on Wednesday had its second-best day since 2003. The rally, aided by earnings announcements, came after congressional testimony by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that was interpreted as signalling an end to future rate increases.Microsoft rose 7.1 per cent over the week to $23.87, thanks largely to its announcement of a huge $40bn share buyback. It reported a 24 per cent drop in quarterly earnings – still ahead of analyst estimates.Apple Computer leapt 19.8 per cent to $60.72 following the release of quarterly earnings on Wednesday that came in ahead of analyst estimates. Profits soared 48 per cent in the second quarter, boosted by a rebound in sales of Macintosh computers and continued strong sales of iPod music players.Motorola surged 9.1 per cent to $20.40 after it beat Wall Street estimates with a 48 per cent jump in second- quarter earnings thanks to record sales of handsets.But the picture elsewhere in the tech sector was far less encouraging. Yahoo reported a 78 per cent slump in second-quarter earnings, in line with analysts’ expectations. The sell-off in the stock was precipitated by a delay in the introduction of the company’s new advertising platform, pushing the stock down 19.3 per cent to $25.89.Dell tumbled 9.1 per cent to $19.91 after it said secondquarter results would fall short of forecasts due to aggressive pricing in the fiercely competitive PC market.Chipmakers had another bad week, with Advanced Micro Devices falling 15.5 per cent to $18.26. It reported a rise in quarterly profit, slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts, but its shares slumped as investors worried about falling revenues at AMD as it continued to cut margins to compete with Intel, whose shares fell 4.1 per cent to $17.15.Elsewhere, JPMorgan Chase gained 5.5 per cent to $43.15 after it announced a better-than-expected tripling in second-quarter profits thanks to strong performance in its investment banking and credit card businesses.Pfizer added 6.3 per cent to $23.83 after it reported a 10 per cent rise in quarterly profits from continuing operations.McDonald’s was another solid performer on the Dow. Early in the week, it announced that same-store sales in June rose 5.9 per cent, more than had been expected. The restaurant chain also reported prelim-inary quarterly earnings that were ahead of analyst forecasts, pushing shares up 5 per cent to $34.70.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent, or 8.84 points, for the day at 1,240.29, a gain for the week of 0.3 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent lower for the week, at 2,020.39, a loss for the day of 0.9 per cent, or 19.03 points. The Dow had fallen 0.6 per cent, or 59.72 points, to 10,868.38, up 1.2 per cent for the week.According to Thomson Financial, the blended growth rate for second-quarter earnings now stands at 13.6 per cent, up from 12.4 per cent last week, and 10.9 per cent when the quarter started. The blended growth rate is a composite figure derived from estimates and earnings already reported.“At this point it’s looking very solid for another quarter of double-digit earnings growth,” said John Butters of Thomson Financial.After upward price rises that forced crude up 10 per cent in the space of four weeks, oil fell back during the week, inflicting heavy losses on oil services companies. Halliburton shed 18.7 per cent to $30.04, while BJ Services sank 14.1 per cent to $30.06. The S&P Oil and Gas Equipment Index lost 12 per cent, its worst week in more than four years. However, it is still up 12.9 per cent year-to-date.Safeway stood out from the malaise in the retail sector. Shares leapt 12.5 per cent to $27.97 after the company beat Wall Street forecasts when it reported an 84 per cent gain in second-quarter profit, and raised its outlook for 2006.Medical device maker Baxter International added 9.6 per cent to $41.47 after it posted better than expected profits and raised its full year earnings estimate.
585;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-07-17T22:14:50Z;McDonald’s gains boost from menu expansion;;McDonald’s on Monday forecast higher-than-expected second quarter earnings as breakfast offerings and a Happy Meal promotion in the US helped drive strong global sales in June.The world’s largest fast-food chain said preliminary earnings were expected to be about 67 cents a share, including 10 cents of income from the sale of its 65 per cent stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill and two cents of expenses.Excluding one-time items, earnings would be about 59 cents a share, beating expectations of 56 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the same quarter a year ago, McDonald’s earned 42 cents a share, including a nine-cent charge.McDonald’s shares closed 5.1 per cent higher at $34.72 in New York.Global same-store sales – from restaurants open at least 13 months – rose a stronger-than-expected 5.9 per cent in June and 5.5 per cent for the quarter.McDonald’s has raised sales significantly in the past year by expanding its menu beyond burgers and fries. Sales in the US, the chain’s largest market, rose 5.2 per cent in June, and 4.2 per cent for the quarter.In Europe, same-store sales rose 4.5 per cent last month and 6.3 per cent for the quarter. David Palmer, analyst at UBS Investment Research, said the new, “bigger Big Mac”, launched in May, helped boost UK sales.
586;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-07-17T20:52:29Z;Wall St little changed after energy sell-off;;Wall Street traded nervously sideways yesterday as a sell-off in the energy sector dragged on markets that had bounced earlier in the day following stronger-than-expected economic data.Citigroup reported a 4 per cent rise in second-quarter profit on Monday. Although only slightly below analyst expectations, they pushed shares in the US’s largest bank down 2.5 per cent to $46.40, its lowest level in four months.Oil prices had their worst day in more than a month, knocking 2.2 per cent off Nymex crude futures. The S&P energy index fell more than 3 per cent. Halliburton fell 4.6 per cent to $35.25 and ConocoPhillips lost 3.4 per cent to $65.15.McDonald’s added 5.1 per cent to $34.72 after reporting a 5.9 per cent increase in same-store sales in June. The restaurant chain also said its second quarter earnings would beat analyst expectations.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent or 1.71 points at 1,234.49, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat, up 0.37 points at 2,037.72. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also flat, adding 8.01 points to 10,747.36.Industrial output in the US rose more than expected in June, according to the Federal Reserve. Capacity utilisation climbed to 82.4 per cent, its highest level since June 2000.“There was a little bit of back and forth but I don’t think much of anything is going to happen until the CPI numbers [tomorrow],” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards, who was nervous about the capacity utilisation index.“The capacity utilisation number is higher than I would have liked and higher than the Fed would have liked.”Toy maker Mattel reported a swing to profit in the second quarter thanks to sales of movie-themed toys. It leapt 10.8 per cent to $17.60, its best day since October 2002.Apple Computer rose 3.4 per cent to $52.37 following an article in the US publication Barron’s that suggested the stock could double on demand for Macintosh computers.Copper prices dipped, after pushing higher for five consecutive days last week. Freeport McMoran lost 5.2 per cent to $51.57, and Phelps Dodge tumbled 3.6 per cent to $76.95.Eaton, maker of electrical systems, reported earnings slightly above expectations. However, investors feared the results were largely the result of a slightly lower tax rate, and the shares fell 4.4 per cent to $65.06.IT services group Computer Sciences fell 3.9 per cent to $50.68, after Jefferies & Co lowered its rating on the stock from “hold” to “underperform”, citing slowing growth.WW Grainger, distributor of maintenance and repair supplies, sank 13.7 per cent to $63.00 in spite of a 15 per cent increase in second quarter profit. It lowered guidance for 2006 sales growth.
587;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-07-14T15:51:18Z;Mining for gems among the overlooked small caps;;"I have never believed that large-cap stocks are too well followed to be anything but efficiently priced. In fact, over the past two years I have added significantly
to my holdings in big, exceptional companies that the market seems to have lost interest in, such as Microsoft, Wal-Mart and McDonald’s.But that hasn’t stopped me looking for undiscovered small-cap gems – with market capitalisations well below $1bn – which is where I have made most of my money.Cannell Capital’s Carlo Cannell, one of the best small-cap investors in the business, describes his job this way: “We try to uncover promising turnrounds, dullards and assorted investment misfits in the underbrush neglected by the investment community.”Small-company stocks, like any asset class, can get picked over from time to time but there are fundamental reasons why diligently mining them with an eye for unrecognised value can get market-beating returns.One is the increased relative upside available when starting from a smaller market value. Motley Fool recently identified 325 stocks that provided annual shareholder returns of more than 20 per cent over the past 10 years and found 296 of them, or 91 per cent, were small-caps before they grew to greater prominence.More than 80 per cent of all companies traded on US exchanges lack consistent research coverage, defined as having no more than three sell-side analysts publishing earnings estimates. This increases an investor’s chance to develop an advantage.A few years ago, Weyco Group, which designs and markets shoes, acquired at an extremely low price the well-known Florsheim shoe brand, which promised to double earnings. With no analyst coverage, the stock scarcely budged on the news and I was able to visit management, understand the implications, and buy the stock. Sure enough, earnings have doubled, as has the stock. This highlights another advantage of investing in small companies: good access to management. Bill Gates won’t take my calls but the chief executive of Weyco will.Footstar, one of my favourite small-cap ideas, illustrates a fertile area for exploration: stocks that have recently emerged from bankruptcy. It is a discount footwear retailer operating licensed footwear departments in Kmart and Rite Aid stores and is best known for its Thom McAn brand. It has been through bankruptcy at least twice as a result of terrible strategic decisions and acquisitions.The business has historically been structured as a joint venture between Kmart and Footstar. The two disagreed about the future of the business, sued each other and then reached a settlement that allows Footstar to operate in Kmart stores for at least three years, paying a percentage of revenues as “rent”. Kmart can then terminate the relationship but only by purchasing Footstar’s inventory.The stock has recently traded around $4.65 and I think it is worth nearly twice this. It is relatively easy to value, as there are only a few simple components: Operating cash flow, which I estimate will be $60m over three years; Footstar’s inventory that Kmart must purchase at book value – which I estimate will be $54m – if it terminates the agreement at the end of 2008; and a company-owned office building that was appraised in October 2004 at $20m. Footstar also had net operating losses as of January 2005 of $164m. These would be attractive to any potential acquirer if Footstar winds down its business, so I value them at $40m.Add it up and I estimate Footstar’s value at the end of 2008 at $174m, about $8.50 per share.The potential rewards of small-cap investing do not come without risk. For every American Eagle Outfitters or Pool Corporation – which have returned about 50 per cent a year for the past 10 years – there are legions of small companies that die a painful death. The relative illiquidity of small-company shares – which often contributes to their being undervalued – also increases their volatility.But overall when it comes to investing, small can be beautiful.Whitney Tilson is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight

Initial reaction was that its brief statement left it more leeway to discontinue its campaign of tightening interest rates.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, said the post-decision rally was an expression of investor relief. “The market is breathing a sigh of relief that it’s over and we can now get on with our lives,” he said.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 2.2 per cent, or 26.87 points, at 1,272.87, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 3 per cent, or 62.54 points, at 2,174.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2 per cent, or 217.24 points, at 11,190.80. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies leapt 3.5 per cent.All the main indices jumped by between one and two percentage points in the aftermath of the Fed announcement.Energy stocks rose steeply, aided by strong crude prices, which reached $73 a barrel. Valero rose 4.3 per cent to a six-week high of $66.13, and Sunoco gained 5.3 per cent to $68.73.Duke Energy leapt 4.6 per cent to $29.69 after announcing on Wednesday that it would spin off its natural gas business to its shareholders. The move prompted Lehman Brothers to raise its rating on the stock from “equal weight” to “over weight”.Stronger copper and gold prices buoyed mining stocks. Freeport McMoran rose
10.2 per cent to $55.26, and Barrick Gold gained 5.3 per cent to $29.28.Healthcare provider Cigna rose 5 per cent to $96.26 after an announcement that the company’s stock buy-back programme would be increased by a further $500m.Open-source software maker Red Hat was a rare loser, plunging 6.4 per cent to $23.40, its lowest level since November. On Wednesday, the company reported earnings that came in below analysts’ forecasts, due to accounting charges and the acquisition of JBoss, another software maker.Micron Technology also disappointed with its fiscal third-quarter earnings, sending shares down 5.3 per cent to $15.12. Revenue came in below analysts' expectations.But there were gains elsewhere in the technology sector, with Jabil up 6.3 per cent to $25.74 after it announced it would buy back $200m worth of shares.

589;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-06-23T18:41:19Z;Hispanics attract fancy footwork by advertisers;;US soccer fans have traditionally been poorly served. But they have had a new way of keeping up with events at this year’s World Cup – provided they don’t mind the commentary being in Spanish.Verizon, the wireless provider, has been broadcasting video clips of goals and key moments from each game to subscribers to its new V-cast service, under a deal with Univision, the broadcaster that holds the Spanish language rights in the US.That the deal is with Univision, rather than ABC, which holds the US English language rights to the matches, is just one sign of the unprecedented level of attention US companies and marketers are paying to this year’s tournament – seen as a way of wooing increasingly affluent Hispanic consumers.“Our market is maturing at light speed, and you’ve got more Fortune 500 companies involved than ever before, because right now our market is the bright spot for our industry,” says Alex Lopez Negrete, whose agency produces Spanish language advertising for Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer. US multinationals Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch and McDonalds are among FIFA’s official global sponsors, but much of their marketing effort has been traditionally focused outside the US.But more leading US companies than ever have spent money this year on domestic TV advertising campaigns linked to the tournament, focused firmly on the Latino market that is expected to account for about 10 per cent of US consumer spending by 2010. Official figures estimate that Hispanic communities will make up nearly a quarter of the total US population by 2050.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has launched its first World Cup-related advertising campaign, with the catchline “Pasion por el futbol”, while Best Buy, the home electronics retailer, has launched a campaign focused on its TV products.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer that sponsors the US national football team, is also backing Univision’s match coverage, along with McNeil’s Tylenol and Allstate Insurance. But Home Depot is also facing off against a line of TV commercials from its main rival Lowes, which began supporting a national championship for amateur Hispanic teams in 2003.Some companies, such as Verizon, have also sought to use the World Cup to launch integrated marketing campaigns focused on the Hispanic community.Best Buy has also launched a bilingual online football competition with Impremedia, which publishes Spanish language newspapers and magazines. McDonald’s – which is only doing TV World Cup advertising in Spanish – is also pursuing a regionalised marketing strategy, with restaurants in New York and Los Angeles, which both have substantial Latino populations, featuring World Cup meals that include souvenir World Cup plastic cup and a dolce de leche sundae dessert.Wal-Mart has also launched football-themed marketing events at stores with significant Hispanic customers, with 155 stores participating in events that include setting up Astroturf football fields in the parking lots for bilingual coaching.For Wal-Mart, the World Cup effort ties into a broader move to deepen its relationship with its Hispanic customers through a programme of store-customisation.Lee Scott, its chief executive, said this year that sales at its stores with a dominant Hispanic customer base increased more than 9 per cent last year, against overall sales growth of about 3 per cent. “Right now, Hispanics have a greater affinity for Wal-Mart than any identifiable segment of the US population.”Univision, which holds World Cup rights up to 2014 under a $425m deal reached with Fifa last year, has been reporting strong audience viewing figures, with Nielsen National Television index reporting it as outperforming ABC and ESPN2 by more than 11 per cent. The company has made the potential of the rights a leading part of its pitch during its current auction.The first-round performance of the US team, meanwhile, remained largely an afterthought for most Americans.With the US already ejected, it’s just as well the marketing has had an Hispanic focus.Additional reporting by Elizabeth Rigby
590;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-06-20T13:07:35Z;McDonald’s to expand in China;;"McDonald’s is focusing on the fast-growing number of Chinese urban motorists as it continues its rapid mainland expansion, with plans to open several hundred new restaurants, most of them drive-throughs, over the next few years.The world’s largest fast food chain on Tuesday announced a partnership with Sinopec, the state-owned oil giant that operates petrol service stations across China, that will rapidly accelerate this strategy.The company has 760 restaurants in China, around 2.5 per cent of its world total, and expects to expand its presence to 1,000 stores by the 2008 Olympic Games, a growth rate of around 100 stores a year that is likely to be maintained for several years, executives said.Currently, only three of McDonald’s restaurants in China are drive-throughs, but the executives said more than half of the new stores opening in the near term would accommodate purchases from cars.The move to drastically increase its number of drive-throughs in China is a sign that eating habits in heavily populated cities are becoming more Americanised, in large part due to widespread car ownership and more mobile lifestyles, particularly among the younger generation.“The potential is enormous,” said Jeffrey Schwartz, chief executive officer of McDonald’s China. He said the alliance with Sinopec, which has some 30,000 petrol stations around China and adds around another 500 every year, would become a “powerful platform” for McDonald’s to build its business.For McDonald’s, which entered the China market in 1990 in Shenzhen, future success in the country will depend largely on whether it can find new locations that have adequate disposable income, along with steady pedestrian and car traffic.McDonald’s employees have been carefully evaluating possible new store sites in proven and emerging Chinese cities. Locations where drive-throughs will be set up include Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, as well as the interior cities of Wuhan and Chengdu.Executives did not detail exact targets for the number of new drive-throughs or overall store transaction rates.Drive-throughs in Asia are not nearly as widespread as in the US. But they are already present in some developed Asian economies; McDonald’s has more than 1,000 overall in Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan.Mr Schwartz says the three McDonald’s drive-throughs in mainland China – in the Pudong area of Shanghai and the Guangdong cities of Dongguan and Foshan – have performed surprisingly well in their first half-year of business, evidence of the “pent-up demand” that exists for fast-food services.By a large margin, McDonald’s in China still trails Yum Brands, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut. There are now more than 1,600 KFCs and 200 Pizza Huts in hundreds of cities in the country. China is now KFC’s top overseas market.Several other much smaller fast-food chains are looking to expand into China, including Jollibee of the Philippines and Burger King, which has plans for several stores in Shanghai this year.Mike Roberts, McDonald’s global president and chief operating officer, said the joint marketing alliance with Sinopec would become a long-term, “monumental” step. “The development of McDonald’s drive-through represents the next generation of McDonald’s restaurants in China,” Mr Roberts said.McDonald’s has invested much time and effort into tailoring its menu for China, where it employs 50,000 people. Around 95 per cent of McDonald’s food comes from local Chinese suppliers, helping it to keep costs low."
591;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-06-19T21:55:29Z;No salad on the menu, just 100 burgers each;;“You guys are insane! Totally unreal that you could actually eat 100 White Castle burgers and live to talk about it. Did you never see SuperSize Me?”This message, by an e-mailer called Jaimi, is one of many posted on the website of Globat.com, a California web hosting company.In one of the most unusual marketing initiatives to have been dreamed up in the fast food industry, Globat last month sponsored a family of three to drive 400 miles from their home in Texas to Missouri to participate in a burger-eating contest at White Castle – the oldest hamburger chain in the US.Once there, the family was not allowed to return home before each member had wolfed down 100 of White Castle’s signature “Slyders” each.It may seem odd that White Castle would be part of a brazen plug for burgers at a time when nutritionists and US policymakers are increasingly worried about the role of fast food in the country’s obesity epidemic.But, even as rival chain McDonald’s is in the midst of rolling out a healthy “Asian salad” of chicken and mandarin orange slices, White Castle has just marked its 85th anniversary as official sponsor of America’s National Hamburger Month.Several events are planned for this year to allow customers – known in White Castle vernacular as “cravers” – to “get involved in the brand”.Cravers are being encouraged to submit a recipe using 10 White Castle hamburgers for the chance to win a “Crave Case” of 30 burgers a week for a year.White Castle, which last week opened its 400th outlet, is bucking the trend towards healthier menu items that is pressuring the fast food industry.The reason is simple: its customers are not asking for change in large enough numbers.Company officials say customers remain happy with the simple burger, fried onion, pickle and buns that White Castle has served since it opened its doors to blue-collar factory workers in Kansas in 1921.Kim Bartley is vice-president of marketing at the company, still privately owned by a third generation of the founding Ingram family.She says: “We like to have a simple menu. There’s always a group of customers asking for healthier items but if you were to put certain things on the menu the demand just wouldn’t be there. Two to three customers a day asking for it simply isn’t enough.”White Castle’s customer base remains lower-income families, blue-collar workers and young men.Most of its menu items cost 99 cents each. An Asian salad at McDonald’s costs more than $4.However, the chain is not entirely immune from pressure to change.Ms Bartley says White Castle first started to investigate new products two years ago. But there is a “practical business issue”.“The ability to deliver fresh produce is just not part of our kitchen design. We’re still looking at salads, we’re just trying to problem-solve it at this point,” she says.White Castle is also feeling the heat from McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s as the larger chains promote their cheapest menu items – a direct threat to White Castle’s business model.“Whenever the big guys are discounting, that doesn’t help anybody,” Ms Bartley says.There is also a geographical problem.Most of White Castle’s outlets are in the US Midwest and New Jersey. Harsh winter conditions can make it hard for customers to reach many of White Castle’s outlets, which are still based at their original 1920s locations – often no longer in the most densely populated parts of town.Ms Bartley says the company is studying expanding into other, warmer parts of the US.Judging from the response to the Globat burger-eating contest from Tammy, one of the family members from Texas, that might be a better strategy to encourage business.Tammy’s web posting reveals that the burger-eating contest did not go as well as some had hoped.“I have to say that none of us will ever go back to White Castle,” she noted.“We made light of it and started trying different things on our burgers. On the way home Lola almost had to go to the hospital. She was hurting real bad. She is fine now.”
592;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

594;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-06-07T21:02:30Z;Disney branches out into fresh fruit;;Disney has begun licensing fresh fruit in European supermarkets as it tries to jump onto the healthy eating bandwagon and banish the memory of its association with McDonald’s.Shoppers at Tesco are already able to buy Disney satsumas and the company is looking to branch out into apples and bananas. The branding involves putting “collectible” stickers on the skin of the fruit, which can then be transferred into a sticker book.Disney has just started selling satsumas in Tesco, offering stickers of Winnie the Pooh on the fruit.Andy Mooney, chairman of Disney Consumer Products, said: “We are trying to develop ‘better for you’ [food] ranges for kids.”Disney works with a marketing and sourcing company that has a relationship with Tesco. The company liaises with Tesco’s produce buyers to find fruit that fits Tesco’s needs, and pays Disney a royalty to use its brand.Disney also licenses baby tomatoes at French retailer Champion, and plans to launch more fruit and vegetables shortly. It says mini bananas are on sale in Germany at retailer Metro and that it will launch several stone fruit items this month in the US in partnership with Imagination Farms.Disney has launched about 300 new food products in Europe over the past year as it extends the kinds of products it licenses.Its existing food products include pasta, pizza and beef burgers in the shape of Mickey Mouse. These are sold in Carrefour supermarkets in France and Metro supermarkets in Germany.It is now targeting healthy foods as it seeks to disassociate itself from products that can be linked to childhood obesity.Disney recently decided not to renew a 10-year global promotional contract with McDonald’s. The contract expires at the end of the year. Mr Mooney said Disney wanted to be associated with “healthier” areas of the food business.
595;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-05-25T17:16:24Z;Shareholder activists put a squeeze on Heinz;;"In the 1970s Heinz, maker of the world-famous ketchup, ran a TV advertisement showing someone waiting for the thick tomato sauce to ooze from an upturned bottle, as “Anticipation”, a chart hit by Carly Simon, played on the soundtrack.This week, anticipation was again in the air at Heinz as Bill Johnson, chairman and chief executive, finally heard – after a three-month wait – what shareholder activist Nelson Peltz proposed should be done to improve the company’s performance.Heinz may seem an unlikely target in the recent spate of shareholder activist attacks in the US, which have included fast food chains McDonald’s and Wendys’ – another recent Peltz target.The 137-year-old company has dominated sales of ketchup ever since founder Henry Heinz, a Pittsburgh grocer, produced it to spice up a dreary American diet of potatoes and meat. It also has some of the best-known food brands in the world, such as Ore-Ida frozen French fries, Heinz baked beans and Farley’s baby food in the UK and T.G.I. Friday’s, a restaurant chain. The New England Consulting Group estimates that Heinz has a “brand value” over the next decade of more than $20bn, partly thanks to its iconic ketchup.The importance of that value is not lost on Heinz. It recently made the nozzles of its restaurant trade ketchup bottles tamper-proof to stop café owners refilling them with cheaper rival products.But Mr Peltz, whose Trian Group owns 5.4 per cent of Heinz shares, says total shareholder returns have underperformed the sector since Mr Johnson took over from the colourful Irish chief executive, Tony O’Reilly, in 1998.Trian believes it can raise earnings per share by 65 per cent – by cutting sales, general and administrative expenses by $575m; reducing spending on product promotions by 3 per cent – and reinvest this in marketing and innovation. To back this up, it has proposed five nominees to Heinz’s 12-member board at the next annual meeting.Indeed, before Mr Peltz’s approach was made public in February, Heinz’s share price had fallen 31 per cent following Mr Johnson’s accession. Mr Peltz believes his proposals would more than double the current share price.The timing of Mr Peltz’s challenge illustrates how a management team engaged in a quiet restructuring can have its hand forced either to speed up its efforts or to communicate its plans more loudly to shareholders. Equally, it shows that shareholder activists must be careful when to strike.In the past five years, Heinz has been an erratic earnings performer, stuck in a middle tier of US food companies that does not have enough higher-margin products and a sufficiently lean cost base to deliver above-average performance.The way Mr Johnson sees it, Heinz has its best years ahead of it. The past five years of effort are about to bear fruit. Mr Peltz, by contrast, thinks very little has been achieved in that time.His proposal, entitled “Results Speak Louder Than Words”, accuses Mr Johnson and his management team of destroying shareholder value “through a series of ill-fated divestitures and acquisitions, failed corporate restructurings and poor capital allocation decisions”.In response to Mr Peltz’s proposal, Heinz says it generated record cash flow from operations in the past three fiscal years. It has disposed of a range of businesses – such as pet food, and Starkist and John West tuna – and is concentrating on three core businesses: ketchup and sauces, baby food and ready-made meals and snacks.Next week, the company plans to unveil a two-year strategy to build on the performance of its US business, where earnings have grown by 9-10 per cent a year for the past three years.Marketing and innovation are important elements. In the US, Heinz hopes to raise ketchup sales with bigger bottles (see below). The UK will soon see an unusual invention: baked bean-filled sandwiches that can be put in a conventional toaster.Asked if he was surprised by the challenge from Mr Peltz, Mr Johnson says: “I guess I’ve been around long enough that nothing ever totally surprises me any more. I was a bit surprised only to the extent that we were one-quarter away from having completed virtually everything we’d talked about doing. So if anything I applaud him on his timing.”Mr Johnson, the son of a National Football League coach, reveals a competitive streak as he discusses the turnround. In 2000, Heinz tried but failed to take
part in a wave of food industry consolidation. That prompted “a process of re-evaluating where this company ought to go”.“Fundamentally it comes down to taking good ideas and executing them. We’ve done a darned good job of doing that in the US and Australia and Canada and some of our emerging markets. And now we’re applying that to Europe,” he says.He concedes, however, that he could have “moved a little quicker in Europe”, which accounts for 39 per cent of group revenue – the largest proportion of any US food company.Indeed, there are signs that Heinz was slow in other ways. Mr Johnson is speaking at a new research and development centre in Pittsburgh – the former US headquarters of Marconi, the UK telecommunications group.When the centre opened last year, it was Heinz’s first integrated R&D facility in the US. The company had been relying for years on four separate, antiquated facilities – hardly an enticement to attract top R&D
talent.There were also issues with the culture in the US operation. Mr Johnson took radical action, overseeing the replacement of 85 per cent of the US management – moves that have been matched in Europe, where Heinz this month replaced its UK head.Mr Johnson insists that the time taken by the company was necessary to adapt to changes beyond its control, such as the growing power of retailers including Wal-Mart. That has required Heinz to shed marginal product lines and concentrate on best-sellers that retailers know will drive customer traffic.Mr Peltz’s proposals have received a largely muted response from Wall Street analysts – suggesting that Mr Johnson may yet have the benefit of the doubt, even as it has made him unpopular with one large shareholder.He says: “We’re going to have a great year in fiscal ’07. It’s amazing what happens when good results are posted and how short people’s memories are. Win a Superbowl and it’s all forgotten. When did England last win the World Cup? Let’s say it wins it this year: people will forget all about 1966. It’s just the way life is, and I know that from being a coach’s son because I saw it first hand.”Big ideas served with sauceHeinz may dominate the market for ketchup in the US with a 62 per cent share, but being the biggest is not necessarily the best if the overall ketchup market is scarcely growing.That is why Heinz has been spending a lot of time studying mothers.David Moran, chief executive of the US business, says that after decades of growth, ketchup sales have been flat to down 1 per cent in the past 18 months. This has sent Heinz researchers into overdrive. The company has a six-point plan to boost ketchup sales that can be boiled down to one concept: persuade mums to buy bigger bottles of the stuff.“There’s an insight that ketchup is the food that helps mum feed her children – it’s a tool to deliver other host foods.So if the mum starts to run low on ketchup she starts to use it more sparingly.So the more ketchup you put in the pantry the more they use,” he says.The plan is the closest thing to the supersizing trend familiar in fast food.“Moms don’t mind if a little ketchup is wasted, as long as the kids finish their meal,” a Heinz presentation explains.Mr Moran says Heinz will stop promoting smaller-sized bottles and encourage retailers to stock bigger sizes. It will work with 30,000 grocers to move the larger-sized bottles to higher shelves in retail outlets, demoting the smaller bottles to shelves lower down.How sure is Heinz that bigger is better? Mr Moran says: “We don’t make a move on ketchup without testing it until we’re blue in the face.”"
596;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-05-09T20:41:57Z;Wall Street flat as investors await Fed decision;;US stocks were flat on Tuesday as investors kept their powder dry ahead of Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee.Analyst upgrades on Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and General Motors were offset by falls in the tech sector after a surprise profit warning from Dell.At the close, the S&P 500 was flat, up 0.48 points at 1,325.14, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.3 per cent or 6.74 points at 2,338.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent, or 55.23 points, at 11,639.77.“The market’s less flat than it was [on Monday], and I don’t think we should expect more than that,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies and Co.“Historically, we don’t get much action before a Fed decision.”After the close of trade on Monday computer maker Dell said that its quarterly profits would fall short of its own forecasts, due to price cuts aimed at increasing market share and revenue. Dell, which had gained 2.9 per cent on Monday, tumbled 4.7 per cent to $25.20. Bank of America, UBS and Credit Suisse reduced their price targets for the stock.The car sector was the day’s best performer on the S&P 500, as General Motors bounced 9.6 per cent higher to $25.80 after a revision to its first-quarter results, which now exclude a charge related to retiree healthcare.The revision meant GM swung from loss to profit for the first quarter. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock from “sell” to “hold”. Ford also did well, adding 2.9 per cent to $7.17.Mortgage providers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae gained after ratings upgrades from Bank of America. Freddie Mac was raised from “neutral” to “buy”, helping the shares rise 1.2 per cent to $62.97.News of fresh accounting irregularities at Fannie Mae was overshadowed by BoA’s upgrade from “sell” to “neutral”. The stock rose 2.8 per cent to $51.52.Mining stocks were in focus as gold hit another 25-year high above $700 a troy ounce, while the dollar hit an 8-month low against the yen. Newmont, based in Denver, rose 4 per cent to $57.93, and Barrick added 2.7 per cent to $34.87.McDonald’s reported a 6 per cent rise in same store sales in April, ahead of analysts’ expectations, sending shares in the fast-food chain up 1.2 per cent to $35.83.Archer Daniels Midland gained 4.6 per cent to $45.22. The company, which is the largest producer of ethanol in the US, has seen its shares gain 13 per cent since Thursday and 50 per cent since February on the back of new regulations mandating the use of ethanol as a fuel additive, which came into force last week.The healthcare sector was one of the worst performers on the S&P 500, with United Healthcare falling 2.8 per cent to $43.80, and Cigna down 4.6 per cent to $88.73. Cigna has lost a third of its value since March.
597;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Europe boosts McDonald’s sales;;Stronger-than-expected performance in its three core European markets helped McDonald’s global sales rise 6.2 per cent in April compared to the same month last year.The restaurant chain said on Tuesday that comparable sales in restaurants open more than 13 months grew 9.3 per cent in Europe.McDonald’s European sales were boosted by a “limited-time offering” of premium beef and chicken sandwiches in Germany and France and the return of the Monopoly game in the UK.The chain last month announced a multi-million pound revamp of some of its 1,200 stores in the UK, where sales have been hit by concerns about the nutritional quality of McDonald’s food and the restaurants’ dowdy high street image.Sales of burgers, fries and salads have recovered in Europe in recent months as McDonald’s has instigated a sweeping “re-imaging” of 6,300 outlets there to encourage more customer traffic.“These results are above what we were expecting and represent the strongest result we have record of, about five years,” said Andrew Barish, analyst at Bank of America, of the improved sales in Europe.Spicy and premium chicken sandwiches were well-received in the US where sales rose 4.1 per cent in April and were up 6 per cent for the first four months of the year.The company also cited “market-leading breakfast business and more convenient hours” as factors behind “ongoing momentum” in its home market.In Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, comparable sales rose 6.5 per cent in April helped by initiatives to introduce menu items which relate to the local cuisines around the region.Across all McDonald’s restaurants, sales rose 5.5 per cent, or 7.3 per cent at constant exchange rates. McDonald’s share price rose 1.16 per cent to $35.8.
598;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-04-24T19:07:17Z;Developing a healthy financial appetite for burgers;;A few weeks ago I gave the keynote speech at the Capital Roundtable, organised by Burt Alimansky, a big conference on activist investing.It was a high-powered audience, with representatives of virtually all the most notorious activist hedge funds. To name a few: Tom Hudson of Pirate Capital, Eric Rosenfeld from Crescendo, who was speaking right after me, Bill Ackman from Pershing and Phil Goldstein from Opportunity. Carl Icahn was also represented.Then, the keynote speech to open the conference – me. I have spoken at many conferences but here was an audience – composed of lawyers and accountants as well as the hedge fund managers – where everyone would be saying “James who?” when I started speaking. I decided the only way to do this was to work really hard on making them laugh.I started with a screen shot of the November 2004 cover of New York magazine, which featured a hedge fund manager (from Pirate Capital) in a bathtub filled with money. I said: “I showed this to my wife to try to explain what it is I do for a living. She looked at it and said: ‘Does this mean you are going to start bathing regularly?’” OK, see, you chuckled a little. A tiny bit, maybe. You can use that joke, too, if you need to speak anywhere.I then focused on a topic I know very well – junk food. In particular, junky fast food. And what is it with these activists and value investors and their junk food?Let’s review the list for a second: Bill Ackman and then Nelson Pelz have both been activists in Wendy’s. Ackman has also tried to shake up McDonald’s.Pirate Capital is in CKE Restaurants (owner of Carl’s Jr, Hardees and others), while David Nierenberg is in Casa, a chain of Mexican restaurants out west. Recently even Heartland Value advisers, instead of filing their usual passive 13G filing, actually went semi-active with a 13D on Smith & Wollensky, one of my least favourite steak restaurants in New York (I like non-public company Les Halles). Jason Ader, a former restaurant analyst, has used his hedge fund Hayground to file a 13D on Denny’s (not quite active but I’m waiting, hopefully).And, lest we forget, Warren Buffett has been accumulating his stake (no pun intended) in Outback Steakhouse (I tried eating there with the kids. Never again).And just last week, Pirate Capital filed another 13D, on Chuck E. Cheese, perhaps the greatest restaurant known to mankind.First, let me state that I own all the stocks mentioned above except for Casa (which I used to own but sold after their earnings jumped), Smith & Wollensky and Outback Steakhouse, and I am in the process of peeling out of some Denny’s (although I think it’s a great chain).One of my favourite plays in the space now is CKE Restaurants. CKE has been a phenomenal turnround story in recent years. Ever since new management focused on the super high calorie burger – the “100% Angus™ beef Six Dollar Burger” – in their Carl’s Jr establishments (see the recent Paris Hilton commercial if you don’t know what I’m talking about), the company has been on fire from a cash flow and margins perspective.As of March 30, Pirate owned 9.5 per cent of the company, having bought as low as $13 and as high as $17. The stock is currently in the $16s. It is quite clear why Pirate is involved in this stock: it is cheap on all the ratios and management is turning the company round. It trades for just 7.6 times its enterprise value and 8.9 times operating cash flows.Now it has dealt with Carl Jr’s, the company is focusing on Hardees. According to its recent 10K filing, it seeks to “improve restaurant operations by streamlining the menu . . . remodel Hardee’s restaurants to the ‘Star Hardee’s format’ and ‘grow the lunch and dinner portion of Hardee’s business while maintaining Hardee’s already strong breakfast business’”.I think activists and value investors like fast food chains for a few simple reasons. First, it is an easy business to understand. (Don’t lie, you love a Big Mac and supersized fries. Don’t even try to deny it.)Second, the chains are sitting on valuable real estate that is probably on the balance sheet at cost even if they bought the plots 20 years ago. McDonald’s, for instance, is often thought of as more of a real estate company than a food chain.And third, the brands of the main restaurants, while not on the balance sheet, would probably cost tens of billions to replace.
599;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-04-13T21:14:31Z;Tech stocks lead Wall Street higher;;Technology stocks led Wall Street higher on Thursday as a flurry of positive corporate earnings helped stocks weather a rise in long-term interest rates.Stocks wobbled in early morning trade after the 10-year US Treasury bond yield broke through the psychologically significant 5 per cent for the first time in nearly four years, amid increasing investor concern about building inflationary pressures.Rising bond yields kept a lid on industrial blue chips, but tech stocks saw gains after sector bellwether Intel jumped 1.5 per cent to $81.98.Intel shares rose following some positive comments from Bank of America.“Negative perception has likely overshot reality,” said analyst Sumit Dhanda. “Despite the likely negative tone of Intel’s report, overall, we think investor sentiment is even more negative.”The Nasdaq Composite index ended the light pre-holiday session up 0.5 per cent at 2,326.11, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both edged up 0.1 per cent to 11,137.65 and 1,289.12, respectively.Expectations that Intel might cut its chip prices to expand market shares boosted shares in semiconductor equipment makers. Lam Research rose 4.6 per cent to $46.77 and Applied Materials gained 3.9 per cent to $18.10.Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices, delivered stronger than expected first-quarter earnings, but the stock tumbled 10.2 per cent to $31.80 after Sanford C. Bernstein downgraded the stock, citing among other things, concerns over AMD’s weak second-quarter guidance.Still in the technology sector, IBM rose 1.5 per cent to $81.98 after Lehman Brothers raised its price target on the stock from $90 to $92.Shares in SanDisk shot up 4.1 to $61.90 after Standard & Poor’s announced that the maker of flash-memory products will replace Chiron Corp in its benchmark index.Gains on the Dow were limited by General Electric, which fell after it reported earnings that failed to inspire investors. Profits at the giant conglomerate rose 14 per cent in the first quarter, in line with forecasts and the company also affirmed its 2006 guidance.But the stock, which has risen more than 1.5 per cent over the last two sessions, dropped 1.7 per cent to $33.89 as investors moved to lock in profits.“The lack of earnings upside may be modestly disappointing given recent positive preannouncements by Ill Tool Works, 3M, and Danaher,” said Deane Dray, analyst at Goldman Sachs. Goldman maintained its “outperform” rating on the stock, however, saying that it believes “the pendulum is swinging towards favouring GE’s long-cycle and services business mix.”Also on the Dow, McDonald’s retreated 1 per cent to $34.85 in spite of beating market expectations with its 6.6 per cent rise in March same-store sales.
600;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-04-13T16:40:49Z;McDonald’s sales beat estimates;;McDonald’s Corp. on Thursday said March sales at established hamburger restaurants rose more than expected but forecast a quarterly profit in line with Wall Street targets with a stronger U.S. dollar and several one-time charges weighing on earnings.Same-store sales, a key retail measure that tracks revenue at restaurants open at least 13 months, rose 5.3 percent in March, spurred by demand for a new coffee blend and other breakfast items in the United States and improved performance in France and Russia.Three Wall Street analysts had expected a rise of 2.3 percent to 4 percent, according to research notes.The world’s biggest restaurant company said it expects to report first-quarter earnings of about 49 cents a share, matching Wall Street’s average expectation, according to Reuters Estimates.Analysts said a stronger dollar and charges for closing 25 restaurants in the United Kingdom and acquiring some outlets from Brazilian franchisees trimmed first-quarter earnings by about 2 cents a share. When the U.S. currency is strong, earnings in foreign markets are worth less in dollar terms.Higher commodity-related costs may also have crimped profits, according to one McDonald’s investor.“There may continue to have been some pressure both from fuel and on paper costs,” said Janna Sampson, director of portfolio management at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, which owns about 900,000 McDonald’s shares.In the United States, same-store sales rose 6.6 percent, while Europe posted a rise of 1.6 percent, the company said.Analysts had forecast a rise of 3.4 percent to 4 percent in the United States and a drop of 1 percent to a rise of 5.4 percent in Europe.One analyst said McDonald’s new Premium Roast Coffee has been a “big hit,” even with consumers used to drinking Starbucks Corp.’s premium coffee.“It drives people to the stores,” said Carl Sibilski, managing director of Oyster Capital Management, in Chicago. “A lot of coffee drinkers that I typically saw with Dunkin’ Donuts or Starbucks cups, I started seeing them with McDonald’s coffee cups.”Sibilski said late-night sales had also helped boost U.S. same-store sales, though those transactions are less profitable because a restaurant needs to keep running during hours when sales are less frequent.In Europe, McDonald’s No. 2 market, the increase came despite bad weather and the shift of Easter and school-related holidays to April from March, McDonald’s said in a news release.In Asia, the Middle East and Africa, comparable sales for March were up 5 percent, the company said.McDonald’s shares were down 31 cents at $34.88 in morning trade Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.Additional reporting by Reuters in Chicago
601;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-04-07T13:03:47Z;Burger King names Chidsey chief executive;;Burger King named John Chidsey, 43, the company’s president and chief financial officer, as chief executive officer, effective immediately.Greg Brenneman, Burger King’s former chairman and CEO, was returning to his private equity firm, TurnWorks, to pursue business turnarounds, Burger King said.Burger King’s private equity owners hired Mr Brenneman in August 2004 to lead the company’s revival. He had earlier helped turn round Continental Airlines.The company said on Friday Mr Brenneman had accomplished eight consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth. He had agreed to continue to work with the board as a consultant during the transition.Brian Swette, a current independent director, would serve as non-executive chairman, the company said. In addition, Ben Wells, 52, senior vice president and treasurer, has been promoted to chief financial officer and treasurer.Burger King said in February it was planning to raise $400m through an initial public offering of stock.If completed, the flotation would seal a turnround of the company four years after Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs bought it for $1.5bn from Diageo, the UK spirits group.The transaction would rank as the largest IPO of a US restaurant company, ahead of a $339m offering from Dominos Pizza in July 2004. BurgerKing said in a regulatory filing that proceeds from the IPO will be used to repay debt.The IPO comes amid signs of heightened investor appetite for fast-food stock. The capitalisation of Wendys International, another burger chain, has risen about 50 per cent in the last year while McDonalds market value has risen 13 per cent in that period. The shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, spun off by McDonald’s, doubled their value on their debut day in late January.The board of Burger King said in a statement on Friday it was “extremely pleased” with the progress the company had made under Mr Brenneman.“We are confident that now is the right time to set in motion the next phase of the company’s development,” the statement said.
602;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:00:27+0000;A Venus for our time;;"For his bronze of model Kate Moss practising yoga, Marc Quinn worked with a contortionist first. She came to his east London studio and turned herself into a human knot, her head popping out between her thighs. ""We mainly photographed and measured her,"" Quinn says.Then it was Moss's turn. ""I already had a live cast of her body from a previous sculpture,"" says Quinn, who likes to work from body casts, which he describes as three-dimensional photographs.Quinn's most famous work, ""Alison Lapper Pregnant"", a controversial sculpture of a woman born without arms, was a body cast before it was carved in marble. The piece is currently atop a plinth in London's Trafalgar Square.Moss, who has recently faced a tabloid feeding frenzy amid allegations of cocaine abuse, was duly photographed. Quinn made some two-dimensional mock-ups, now hanging on the studio walls. Then, using the body cast, he moulded the model's form into the contortionist's position in clay. The piece was cast in plaster and sent to a foundry in Spain to be cast in bronze.Why Kate Moss? ""I was trying to make a contemporary 'Birth of Venus,'"" says Quinn. ""You have the 'Venus of Willendorf' from prehistoric times. You've got the Botticelli ones from the Renaissance."" The ""Venus of Willendorf"" is a sculpture of the sort of magnificently obese woman you can imagine suing McDonald's these days. I wonder whether Moss would appreciate the comparison.""She was the Kate Moss of the time obviously. She fulfilled the sexual appetite,"" Quinn observes.Why Kate Moss in particular though, I ask again? ""It was a gradual thing. I've done a couple of her before. I've always thought Kate was the archetypal figure. Because she's not an actress or anyone with a voice. She's actually just purely an image. Her reality is an image. And in fact all her troubles seem to be caused when her image and the real person collide,"" Quinn says. ""Then I connected that with the idea that if you have a perfect body you're a perfect person.""After the Kate Moss bronzes came back from the Spanish foundry, they were painted white and delivered to Quinn's studio a couple of weeks ago. It's an edition of three.The tabloid hubbub over Moss's cocaine sting had erupted between her sitting and the completion of the pieces. The headlines never stop coming. ""It turned out to be more pertinent than I ever imagined,"" Quinn says. ""And they all sold. The whole edition sold. They sold in one second. Kate Moss does sell product.""Bernard Arnault of LVMH, who had been thwarted in a move to buy Sotheby's, acquired Phillips, the staid London auction house, in 1999. He housed it in a pale building on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in New York, next to Bergdorf Goodman, and spent heavily in an attempt to shoulder his way into the company of Sotheby's and Christie's.There were spectacular events, with one auction being fronted by actress Sharon Stone. Simone de Pury and Daniella Luxembourg, two European veterans who joined the organisation in 2001, set out not just to rival the duopoly but to top them. But the venture kept shedding cash and in 2002 a disgruntled Arnault threw in his hand and quit the game.De Pury and Luxembourg were now in control. Exiled from the 57th Street building, they took Phillips to 450 West 15th Street on the edge of Chelsea. Their production values - the catalogues and so forth - looked as sleek as ever but few in the business gave the business much of a shout. Phillips de Pury & Company, as it now is, Luxembourg having quit the auction business, sells only contemporary art, design and photographs but has become a serious player in these fields.This week displays the company's nerve. The Armory Show, New York's principal art fair, began on Wednesday and finishes on Monday. Around 40,000 out-of-town dealers, collectors and enthusiasts are expected to attend. For Christie's and Sotheby's, it's business as usual.And Phillips? Well, there's a slew of parties and a sale exhibition of the designer Ettore Sottsass. There's also an auction fundraiser for Donald Judd's Chinati Foundation on Monday. The following morning sees the birth of yet another contemporary art auction.All this in the wake of the Armory and several piggy-backing fairs. Is this cheeky? Yes. Risky? That too.anthony.haden-guest@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/hadenguest"
603;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Lex: McDonald’s;;Part of the appeal of shareholder activism is that it forces companies to question their most cherished traditions. Occasionally, companies are right to hold out. Take McDonald’s, which has just reported another quarter of swift sales growth, with more signs of a revival even at its troubled European operations. This is all the more welcome after its recent tussles with activists.McDonald’s is an interesting example of how to deal with activists when management is broadly on the right path already. When Pershing Square Capital started knocking at its doors last autumn, McDonald’s had already made up much of the ground lost during its rapid expansion at the turn of the millennium.This was largely achieved by rediscovering its historic strengths. By contrast, radical corporate surgery, such as offloading its real estate holdings or company-owned restaurants, always looked unlikely to unleash hidden value. It also risked distracting the company from such missions as serving premium coffee, upgrading its menus and beefing up its health credentials. After all, upheavals at the top can be a dangerous thing, especially for a company that needs to send clear messages to a multitude of employees.Such considerations rarely figure prominently in the plans of shareholder activists, most of whom have little experience of running a large business. They tend to be value investors, with the added twist that they try to speed things up, rather than relying on companies themselves to live up to their potential. McDonald’s was able to make a convincing case that it was already doing that. It was, however, also lucky and not only in having a rather civilised interlocutor in Pershing. Over the past few months, any signs of operational troubles – say, a drop in chicken consumption because of avian flu concerns – could have easily derailed a winning strategy.
604;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-02-17T00:18:12Z;Burger King files its initial public offering;;Burger King on Thursday said it planned to raise as much as $400m through an initial public offering of stock.If completed, the flotation would seal a successful turnround of the company four years after Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs bought it for $1.5bn from Diageo, the UK spirits group.The transaction would rank as the largest IPO of a US restaurant company, ahead of a $339m offering from Domino’s Pizza in July 2004. Burger King said in a regulatory filing that proceeds from the IPO will be used to repay debt.The IPO comes amid signs of heightened investor appetite for fast-food stock. The capitalisation of Wendy’s International, another burger chain, has risen about 50 per cent in the last year while McDonald’s market value has risen 13 per cent in that period. The shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, spun off by McDonald’s, doubled their value on their debut day in late January.However, Burger King would become a public company amid increasing competitive pressures in the industry. Increased health consciousness among consumers has forced fast-food chains to expand menus beyond the traditional fare of hamburgers and fries.McDonald’s has been successful at luring more customers to its restaurants with new menu items such as premium chicken sandwiches and salads, at the expense of Wendy’s, which has struggled to boost sales.Burger King has also added new items including omelette sandwiches and steak burgers.Meanwhile, the potential of the sector was reflected in the interest from activist investors such as William Ackman and Norman Peltz, which have taken stakes in McDonald’s and Wendy’s respectively and put management teams under pressure to change.Burger King’s private equity owners have hired Greg Brenneman, the executive who helped turn round Continental Airlines, to lead the company’s revival.In the year to June 30, Burger King reported net profits of $47m on revenues of $1.94bn at its 11,104 restaurants. That compared with a net profit of $5m on revenues of $1.75bn the previous year.Sales at outlets open at least a year have risen in the last seven quarters and the company has $207m in cash and equivalents and $1.07bn in debt and capital lease obligations.The IPO is underwritten by JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
605;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-02-03T20:32:14Z;Wendy’s continues to see decline in sales;;Wendy’s International, the third-largest hamburger chain in the US, on Friday reported the fifth consecutive decrease in comparable-store sales amid tougher competition from larger rival McDonald’s. It also swung to a profit in the fourth-quarter thanks to real-estate sales.Increased competition from McDonald’s combined last year with a consumer fraud to bring about Wendy’s first sales decline in 18 years, chief executive Jack Schuessler said.Sales at stores open at least a year declined by 2.9 per cent last quarter, while McDonald’s achieved growth on 4.1 per cent. For the year, Wendy’s comparable store sales declined 3.7 per cent in the US, but rose at the Tim Horton’s coffee-and-doughnut chain it owns in Canada.At an investor conference on Monday, Wendy’s is expected to offer details of new marketing efforts aimed at boosting sales, alongside measures aimed to increase the efficiency of its outlets.The company reported net profits of $30m, or 25 cents per share, compared with a loss of $141.4m, or $1.25 per share in the previous year, when it took $220.8m in various charges related to goodwill writedowns and closures, as well as an accounting correction.The latest quarter’s results also included a $60.9m pre-tax benefit from a real-estate sale, alongside a $55.4m charge on the closure and impairment of other assets, as well as $47.4m in other charges and expenses.The results failed to meet average analyst forecasts of 47 cents per share. However, they were “roughly in line” with the estimates of Andrew Barish, analyst at Banc of America, who stripped the charges off Wendy’s profits to arrive at an operating income forecast of 47 cents per share.Mr Barrish said fourth-quarter operating income was 48 cents per share but cautioned that his “confidence remains low…as we have little visibility”.Revenues were virtually flat at $977.3m.In mid-afternoon trading in New York, Wendy’s shares were virtually unchanged at $58.38.
606;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald’s unfazed by boardroom activists;;The aggressive tactics of many shareholder activists generally does not endear them to the occupants of corporate boardrooms.Chapman Capital, a California activist hedge fund, sets the tone for its business with a massive set of shark’s jaws pictured on the home page of its website.But McDonald’s’ recent skirmish with activist William Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital, has left the fast food chain with surprisingly warm feelings for its former antagonist.Matt Paull, chief financial officer, says: “I have nothing personally against Bill, he’s a very smart, very passionate guy who is a thoughtful person.”Last month, Mr Ackman abandoned efforts to persuade McDonald’s to spin off 20 per cent of its 8,000 company-owned restaurants and refranchise 1,000 such units.The proposal was a scaled-back version of an earlier idea to spin off 65 per cent of such McOpCo units, borrow against the company’s multi-billion dollar property holdings and return the proceeds to shareholders.McDonald’s agreed to a fraction of Pershing’s proposal’s before the hedge fund backed off – which may explain Mr Paull’s quiet confidence.The company said it would convert 1,500 loss-making McOpCo units into “developmental licensees” – a type of franchise structure – and pledged to disclose more about the financial performance of McOpCo in a few weeks.Mr Ackman has claimed that he “got what we wanted”. Yet on closer inspection, the only new initiative that McDonald’s agreed to was to be more open about McOpCo’s finances.Mr Paull says the company’s plan to refranchise the 1,500 units was already part of a plan announced by Jim Cantalupo, former chief executive, three years ago.“We’ve been working on that for more than a year. It’s not new. And Bill knew we were working on it, and our big shareholders knew we were working on it,” Mr Paull told the FT from McDonald’s headquarters outside Chicago. “It was already in the plan, but because of some of the activist activity, we had to go public with our strategy a little sooner than we would have liked. He accelerated our publicising what we were doing.”The revelation is a sign that Mr Ackman’s timing might have been wrong. In November, when he presented his first proposal, McDonald’s was solidly profitable and had delivered 30 straight months of higher sales at its restaurants globally. A turnround in Europe, long its weakest link, was well underway.Mr Paull says: “If it had been three years ago when we were on the floor, it might have gone differently. What helped us was the fact that we made certain financial commitments three years ago and we delivered against those.”But he is careful not to sound triumphant: “I actually think having somebody like Bill question the way we do business is a healthy thing every couple of years.”Indeed, Mr Paull recognises that shareholder activism is something most large company managements will still have to deal with.“The Bill Ackmans of the world are still out there. The message has been sent that no company is safe – because Bill said several times this management team had done a good job, it was all about recasting the balance sheet and the capital structure. And if that’s true for McDonald’s then it’s true for everybody.”
607;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-01-25T22:12:03Z;Wall Street worried by housing weakness;;Concerns over the health of the US housing market weighed on Wall Street on Wednesday, offsetting modest early gains.News of a third consecutive month of falling sales of existing homes underlined concerns that the housing market has slowed, which could undermine consumer confidence and hurt the US economy.Those fears wiped an early gain of 50 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended off a fraction at 10,709.74.“The rally was derailed by poor housing data. It was much weaker than expected,” said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent to 1,264.68 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2 per cent to 2,260.65. The falls ended two days of modest gains.Energy stocks also fell sharply as the oil price weakened. ConocoPhillips lost 1.5 per cent to $63.54 in spite of surging fourth-quarter profits.All this took attention away from a couple of juicy takeovers.The battle for medical devices maker Guidant would appear to have been won by Boston Scientific as the pair agreed a deal worth $27bn. This meant defeat for Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare group that was also in the running.Shares in Guidant and Boston fell 2.1 per cent to $75.19 and 1.9 per cent to $23.54 respectively as the two-month battle ended. J&J slipped 1.4 per cent to $58.50 even though its loss was sweetened by the prospect of $705m from Guidant for breaking an earlier deal.Talk turned to whether J&J would pursue alternative targets, with St Jude Medical and ImClone the names in the frame.St Jude, which reported disappointing sales figures, fell 6.1 per cent to $50.03 and ImClone lost 2.5 per cent to $34.49.Investors also got a first chance to react to Tuesday’s late news that Walt Disney is to pay $7.4bn for Pixar, the studio behind the Toy Story films.Merrill Lynch was among those to welcome the deal. Analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said: “We view the Disney-Pixar combination as a near perfect strategic fit. Pixar’s family-oriented content meshes well with Disney’s brand.” Pixar rose 0.8 per cent to $58.02 and Disney fell 2.1 per cent to $25.44.Pharmaceutical group Bristol Myers Squibb rose 3 per cent to $21.97 in spite of news that its 2006 result would likely to be lower than expected. The company is fighting off generic treats to Pravachol, its cholesterol drug.McDonalds fell 1.9 per cent at $35.16 as shareholder activist Bill Ackman dropped his campaign for restructuring at the fast food group, a day after it reported a jump in earnings.CBRL Group, another restaurant operator, surged 22.1 per cent to $43.36 on news of a review that it is hoped will boost shareholder value.
608;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-01-24T23:09:27Z;Disney deal keeps Wall Street trading animated;;A glut of positive earnings and late confirmation of a $7.4bn deal between Walt Disney and Pixar helped Wall Street end higher on Tuesday.United Technologies, McDonald’s and Coach were among the companies reporting strong fourth-quarter figures, which helped the indices gain for a second consecutive day.Sentiment was aided by a further fall in the oil price, although the spectre of the sharp equity sell-off on Friday was never far away.Merrill Lynch raised its 2006 forecast for West Texas Intermediate by $5 a barrel to $57 a barrel and said geopolitical uncertainty would continue to keep the oil price high.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.2 per cent at 10,712.22, still a fraction short of the level at which it ended 2005.The S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to 1,266.86 while the Nasdaq Composite firmed 0.8 per cent to 2,265.26, as search engine Google recovered further from Friday’s sell-off. Google ended 3.6 per cent higher at $443.03.United Technologies was the among the biggest gainer on the Dow, up 3.6 per cent to $56.45, as the maker of Sikorsky helicopters reported solid earnings.Fast food group McDonald’s gained 0.4 per cent to $35.85 as profits were boosted by a strong US performance.Coach, the luxury goods group, rose 8.8 per cent on the S&P 500 to $34.89 after a sharp rise in earnings, while on Nasdaq, Vitesse SemiConductorjumped 23.4 per cent to $2.74 after well-received quarterly figures.However, Du Pont and Johnson & Johnson offered reminders of why the market is nervous about corporate earnings at the moment. DuPont, the chemical group that warned on profits earlier this month, delivered more bad news as it admitted earnings in the first quarter would also be lower. DuPont fell 0.7 per cent to $39.26.Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare group, slipped 3 per cent to $59.36 after an unexpected fall in revenues. J&J is trying to boost its revenues by buying Guidant, the medical devices maker, although its current proposal trails a higher offer of $27bn from smaller rival Boston Scientific.Still with mergers and acquisitions, Walt Disney firmed up 1.8 per cent to $25.99 on talk the entertainment group was close to a deal for animation studio Pixar, the maker of the Toy Story films. A $7.4bn takeover was confirmed after the market closed. Pixar slipped 1.2 per cent to $57.57.Elsewhere, shares in Lexmark surged 11.3 per cent to $51.08 in spite of a sharp fall in earnings as investors cheered restructuring at the print maker. LaBranche, the largest market-maker on the New York Stock Exchange, jumped 13.9 per cent to $11.93 after strong quarterly figures.However, McAfee, the maker of computer virus technology, slumped 17.7 per cent to $22.75 as earnings failed to meet market expectations.
609;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2006-01-20T22:05:45Z;Dow tumbles 200 points on earnings gloom;;Wall Street endured its worst one-day session for almost three years on Friday as a sharp jump in the oil price and badly received figures from Citigroup, General Electric and Motorola robbed the market of what was left of its early-year gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points or 2 per cent to 10,666.99, its worst single-day performance since March 2003.The broader S&P 500 lost 1.8 per cent to 1,261.43 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plunged 2.4 per cent to 2,247.70.“It is a domino effect of negative news,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The chief reason was a further undermining of already-dented investor confidence in corporate earnings. The culprits were some of the country’s leading blue-chip companies, including financial services giant Citigroup, whose fourth-quarter earnings fell short of what the market had expected.Citigroup was the biggest faller on the Dow, down 4.7 per cent to $45.69, closely followed by conglomerate General Electric, off 3.8 per cent to $33.37. GE’s earnings came in largely as expected, but revenues were less than hoped.At the same time, Motorola, the telephone equipment maker, failed to raise guidance for the first quarter, and guidance from maker Xilinx also disappointed. Motorola and Xilinx lost 7.7 per cent to $22.48 and 8.1 per cent to $27.39 respectively.Google, the search engine, endured its worst day as a listed company, falling 8.5 per cent to $399.46 amid concerns over the possibility of a legal threat concerning how people use its search technology.The cocktail of bad news came at the end of an already difficult week during which JPMorgan Chase reported figures that even the bank’s chief executive admitted were disappointing and guidance from Apple Computer and Ebay left investors unsatisfied.“Companies tend to put their best feet forward in the fourth quarter, so coming up short is more meaningful than at other times,” said Mr Pado.He also noted that Friday saw the monthly expiry of stocks options, which added to volatility and uncertainty.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, agreed that cuts in earnings guidance were disappointing, but said the market’s main concerns were geopolitical.“The real problem here is the oil price,” he said, as uncertainty about the possibility of conflict with Iran pushed crude over 2 per cent higher to more than $68 a barrel, its highest level for four months.Friday’s slump took the fall in the Dow over the truncated four-day week to 2.7 per cent and took it below the level at which it began the year. Over the week, the S&P 500 lost 2 per cent while the Nasdaq slumped 3 per cent.Sentiment was not helped by Wednesday’s events in Japan, where a sharp rise in trading volumes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange overloaded the market’s computer systems and forced trading to halt early.The week’s other big story concerned contrasting fortunes of two leading chipmakers.Shares in Intel, the global leader, came under pressure as it admitted earnings in the first quarter would be less than expected. A day later, Advanced Micro Devices, its rival, reported record fourth-quarter sales.Joshua Osha, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said it was clear “how much competitive ground [Intel] has lost to AMD.” Over the week, Intel slumped 15.6 per cent to $21.76 while AMD rose 4.6 per cent to $35.70.In the market on Friday, McDonald’s, up 1.9 per cent at $35.86, was the only Dow stock to making gains. Shareholder activist Bill Ackman continues to push for corporate restructuring at the fast food group.Amid the gloom, it was a good day for Schlumberger, the oil services group. It jumped 6.4 per cent to $122.25, an all-time high, as its quarterly profit doubled and beat even the most optimistic of Wall Street estimates.Halliburton, its oil services peer, gained 5.3 per cent to $74.50.There was also some takeover talk, as a rumour circulated the market that Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, was looking to buy a controlling stake in BlackRock.Shares in the money manager rose 6.4 per cent to $127 , while Morgan Stanley lost 2.5 per cent to $57.85.
610;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-12-21T13:18:24Z;Technology year in review;;After years of near-despair the technology industry in 2005 began to experience the kind of excitement not seen since the late 1990s - and no company illustrated this transformation better than web company Google.Spurred on by rapid growth in its advertising business, by November investors had pushed Google’s share price to above $400 - more than double its January price and taking the company’s market capitalisation to well over $100bn - eclipsing McDonalds, General Motors, and Cisco Systems.Google continued to rapidly add new services, but 2005 saw it attract more controversy than before. Its plan to scan hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books and make them searchable was delayed due to a legal challenge from several large publishers, and Google Talk, its instant messaging and voice-over-IP product, was greeted as a sign of looming disruption for traditional telecommunications companies.In October, it launched Google Base - another beta product that seemed capable of taking on commercial listings sites such as eBay and Craigslist.Google in late December struck a dramatic deal with AOL that meant graphical advertisements would appear on Google for the first time.MicrosoftNext to Google’s seemingly boundless growth the biggest technology company, Microsoft, began to look under threat. Revenue growth slowed and the next version of its Windows operating system, Vista, continued to suffer delays.The pressure increased in August when Google launched its free Desktop 2.0 software, which carries out some of the tasks done by Windows, such as searching the hard drive and launching programmes.In September, chief executive Steve Balmer told the Financial Times that the company’s entire software development strategy would be re-worked to avoid the many delays encountered by Vista - which is now due for a late 2006 release.A few days later, the company announced it was splitting its business into three divisions. At the same time Ray Ozzie, a newcomer who joined earlier in the year with the acquisition of Groove Networks, was elevated to chief technical officer.Then in early November, Microsoft leaked two internal memos - one from co-founder Bill Gates and one from Ozzie, which acknowledged that competitors such as Google, Skype and Adobe had taken the lead in many web-based services.In November Gates spoke about web-based software that can be supported by advertisements rather than licences or subscription fees. The ideas in his speech, which drew more comparisons to Google’s strategy, are already being demonstrated in its live.com beta.Web 2.0Yahoo, meanwhile, responded to Google’s growth with several new products and acquisitions, such as buying Flickr in March and del.icio.us in December - both seen as leaders in web 2.0 services, albeit with relatively small user bases.Yahoo also expanded its existing services, such as travel, an “answers” service and a more fully-featured VoIP service to rival Skype.Fellow dotcom pioneer eBay in September snapped up one of the most talked-about start-ups in Europe, voice-over-IP provider Skype for $2.6bn cash. The auction company was criticised for paying too much for Skype, but said it would use its acquisition to offer lucrative “click-per-call” advertising, which was also introduced by Google in November.Computing hardwareIt was a less bountiful year for many in other parts of the technology industry. Just a few days after IBM announced staff cuts of 14,500 in July, Hewlett-Packard did the same, reducing its headcount by 10 per cent. In November however it managed to beat Wall St estimates with its fourth quarter results.Poor results at Dell, once the darling of the PC industry for its efficient direct-sales business model, caused many to wonder whether the PC maker had hit a ceiling.A shift of focus to laptops, servers and storage devices and plans to win a fifth of the Chinese PC market were not enough, and in October, the group issued a rare profit warning, before its third-quarter profits fell by more than a quarter.But it was IBM that made the biggest splash of the year in the hardware industry by announcing in late 2004 a deal to sell its laptop and desktop computer business to China’s Lenovo. Despite some opposition, including from the US Congress, the deal was approved in March. More controversy followed in December this year when Steve Ward, a veteran IBM executive, was replaced as chief executive of Lenovo just eight months after the deal was completed. His place was taken by Bill Amelio, head of Dell’s Asia-Pacific operations and himself a former IBM executive.
611;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;McDonald’s tries to calm European worries;;McDonald’s will admit next week that it has not done enough to allay European concerns about the nutritional value of meals and the quality of jobs at the world’s largest fast food chain.In its first corporate responsibility report aimed at the European market, where sales have suffered amid concerns over food safety and obesity, the company will say it has learned from its customers that “we could do better in our understanding of wider social trends and expectations”.Denis Hennequin, head of McDonald’s Europe and instigator of the report, says: “Stakeholders have told us time and again that we should communicate more on the issues we are dealing with.”The 70-page report, aimed at EU policy makers, pressure groups, shareholders, suppliers and employees, gives details about the content and quality of meals and employment conditions. It draws on the views of a wide range of stakeholders from government officials to health and consumer groups, financial analysts and employees.It says McDonald’s is “a leader in food safety and quality” and strongly rejects claims that restaurant workers are poorly paid and skilled, as epitomised by the American Merriam-Webster dictionary expression “McJob”. The report fits into a broader McDonald’s campaign against what it sees as stereotypes about its operations.Going on the offensive earlier this month, Jim Skinner, chief executive, signalled that the group intended to take a lead on issues such as obesity. “If you’re not the lead dog, you’re not going to like the view,” he told the annual conference of Business for Social Responsibility, a prominent US non-profit organisation, in Washington.It emerged last month that McDonald’s would become the first fast food chain to put nutritional information such as fat and sodium content on most of its packaging.It has also taken initiatives to boost its image with consumers in Europe, where it has 6,200 restaurants. In September, it invited customers in 30 European countries to look round its kitchens under its Open Doors programme. In the UK, where it has lost a quarter of its sales in five years, it has launched a direct mailing campaign to educate consumers about the sources of its organic milk and vegetables.Sales in Europe, which contributes more than 35 per cent of worldwide revenues and 40 per cent of profits, have recovered in the past two quarters after declines earlier this year. But the recovery has yet to gain momentum in the UK.
612;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Hedge fund presses McDonald’s;;Pershing Capital, a hedge fund pushing for a sweeping restructuring of McDonald’s, on Tuesday warned the fast food company that “we are not the most patient people in the world” as it pledged to submit a revised proposal “within weeks”.McDonald’s has been unnerved by a plan presented in September by Pershing, suggesting that the company borrow against its vast property holdings and return the money to shareholders.Pershing has also proposed selling off 65 per cent of restaurants that McDonald’s owns in an initial public offering and operated as a big franchise, like most of McDonald’s 30,000 outlets.The fund has taken a 4.9 per cent stake in McDonald’s - its largest single holding. Some observers have drawn parallels with Pershing’s success in persuading rival fast food chain Wendy’s to spin off its Tim Horton’s coffee chain, after it took a 9.3 per cent stake.Bill Ackman, Pershing founder, told an investor conference that McDonald’s-owned restaurants, which make up 15 per cent of all outlets in North America, are expensive to run and that placing them in one large franchised operation would improve operating margins.While McDonald’s owns 37 per cent of the land under its restaurants, Mr Ackman said he believed the issuance of $14.7bn in debt financing would allow the repurchase of 316m shares at $40 a share.McDonald’s shares ended Tuesday’s session 1.8 per cent lower at $33.31.Pershing values the McDonald’s property assets at $46bn, which compares with a market capitalisation for McDonald’s of about $41.8bn by Tuesday’s close. The problem with McDonald’s is that you have a mix of this huge free cash flow business and a capital intensive business, all consolidated under one roof,” Mr Ackman said after giving his presentation, entitled “A Value Menu For McDonald’s”.McDonald’s, which has rejected Pershing’s call for change, believes any borrowing against its property portfolio would damage its credit rating.However, Mr Ackman said such a deal would be “one of the most desired deals in the fixed income world”. Pershing would be prepared to see a payment of $300m in fees as a “little tickler for the investment banks”.Mr Ackman said: “We are not the most patient people in the world. I’m the most persistent person you’ll ever meet when I believe I am right.”However, he said he did not believe his initiative would lead to a shareholder proxy fight with McDonald’s. “We hope to get McDonald’s a proposal that’s irrefutable. Our preference is to win on the power of ideas. We hope this succeeds with the carrot rather than the stick.”
613;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;McDonald’s sales grow on European strength;;McDonald’s on Tuesday reported increased October sales of 3.4 per cent, the 30th straight month of higher sales. The fast-food giant attibuted the growth to European sales and a promotional game in the US.The company noted that among all of its restaurants – both franchised and company owned - growth was 4.4 per cent in constant currency terms, which remained within its long-term expectations of 3-5 per cent growth.Jim Skinner, chief executive, said he was pleased with the results. “We continue to connect with our customers through our Plan to Win, which is focused on our customers and backed by actions that are delivering sales momentum and traction,” he said in a statement. “We will continue to focus on improving service, enhancing menu variety and building brand relevance to drive sales and profits at our existing restaurants.”Sales in the US grew 3 per cent. The company attributed this to its expanded menus – which has been diversified away from hamburgers and French fries to include healthier options – and expanded store hours. It also said its Best Chance Monopoly game – with prizes such as free iPods and computers - helped US performance for the third consecutive year.In Europe, Germany and France helped boost overall sales by 3.3. per cent. Premium menu items helped here. In the UK, the company said its toasted deli sandwiches, which went on sale in mid-September, boosted its sale there. But McDonald’s conceded it is still working to communicate its “balanced, active lifestyle messages”.Sales were up 4.4 per cent in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.Shares in McDonald’s, which has 30,000 restaurants in 100 countries, closed 0.9 per cent higher in New York on Tuesday at $34.00.
614;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-11-03T20:17:19Z;Lex: McDonald’s;;"For years, McDonald's has tried to convince customers that they get something for free with every happy meal. The same, some investors believe, is true for the fast food chain itself.They argue that there is value hidden in McDonald's real estate holdings. A share in the company effectively gives a stake in at least three very different businesses. Its franchise operation aside, it manages about a quarter of outlets itself. Moreover, it also owns many of the buildings, as well as a large chunk of the land underneath the outlets. Spinning off, say, the real estate business would create a new company capable of supporting a large debt load. It would also flatten McDonald's earnings by taking troublesome depreciation charges off its books.With valuations for US commercial real estate still frothy, selling some now might be a good idea, though the opposite is true for any shares in the new entity. Timing aside, such shenanigans would do little to change the underlying economics of the different businesses.They can clearly alter incentives. But capital discipline has already improved markedly as McDonald's has moved away from expansion, while its share price has more than doubled since summer 2003. The fall in the effective tax rate suggests the scope for further tax savings is limited. Any spin-off could also make relationships with franchisees more difficult. On the face of it, betting on it for overall value creation appears about as healthy as relying on free fries for nourishment.- Click here to add your comments

615;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-10-25T17:15:25Z;McDonald’s to add nutritional data to packaging;;McDonald’s is set to become the first fast food company to put nutritional labels on hamburgers and milk shakes, after the US group pledged on Tuesday to introduce “easy-to-understand” signs on most of its product packaging from next year.The move underscores how some of the largest food companies are moving to head off rising concern that cheap, fatty foods are among the biggest contributors to global obesity rates.It is also the clearest sign yet that food companies believe there is a competitive advantage in embracing the rapidly growing trend towards “health and wellness” in diets and lifestyles.“What we’re going to start seeing is divergence between some leading companies and others that feel they can ride out the storm because they have such a large consumer demand for products as they are now,” said Derek Yach, associate director at Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.Kraft, maker of Oreo cookies, last year pledged to stop advertising certain junk foods to children under age 12. Frito-Lay, the snacks division of PepsiCo, flags low-fat versions of its products with a “green spot” logo.Larry Light, McDonald’s outgoing chief marketing officer, said: “We will not sit around watching what others do.” McDonald’s said the new labels would “convert scientific information into a customer-friendly snapshot” of a product’s nutritional value.The labels would use icons and bar charts to show calorie, protein, fat, carbohydrate and sodium levels. The chain had been working on the packaging over the past year, testing the new labels at restaurants in Scotland, Spain, Colombia and Hong Kong.It will roll them out at restaurants in Italy, to coincide with the Olympic Winter Games in February.McDonald’s aims to involve 20,000 restaurants globally by the end of 2006. It declined to say how much it would cost to implement the labels.Michael Roberts, McDonald’s president and chief operating officer, said the move was in line with the company’s goal of “building consumer trust”.Consumer activists in the US have long argued that current food labels on packaged foods are not sufficiently clear, preventing consumers from making informed choices.Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a US non-profit group focused on food and health issues, said the latest move by McDonald’s was “a useful step forward”. But he said it would be more useful if McDonald’s displayed nutritional information on menu boards in restaurants “so that people would have nutritional information before they buy products”.Also on Tuesday, McDonald’s’ popular Chipotle Mexican Grill chain filed for an initial public offering that could raise as much as $100m. McDonald’s owns a 92 per cent stake in Chipotle.
616;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-10-13T20:34:40Z;Wall Street recovers as oil price softens;;Wall Street closed flat on Thursday as a late rally fuelled by a pullback in oil prices balanced earlier worries over mounting inflationary and interest rate pressures.The US Labor Department said import prices rose at their fastest pace for almost 15 years in September – 2.3 per cent – led by higher prices for energy. Import prices already had risen 1.2 per cent in August and are now 10 per cent higher than a year ago.This added to jitters ahead of Friday’s release of September consumer inflation data. “This gives us concern that the overall CPI [consumer price index] is going to see a bigger pop,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.However, the previously bearish Mr Pado argued that Wall Street was now approaching an “extremely oversold” level with much of the bad news now discounted, and it could be in for a technical bounce, potentially followed by a seasonal November rally.With oil prices falling, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered to close just 0.32 of a point lower at 10,216.59, with the S&P 500 off 0.84 of a point, or 0.1 per cent, at 1,176.84.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 9.75 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,047.22, aided by Apple Computer jumping 9.1 per cent to $53.74, reversing two days of selling.McDonald’s, the fast food chain, rose 1.2 per cent to $32.05. It said sales at outlets open for at least a year were 3.9 per cent higher in September than in the same month last year.Johnson & Johnson, another Dow component, rose 3.6 per cent to $64.02 amid reports that it had filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Amgen, accusing the latter of illegally bundling products to force cancer clinics to use Amgen’s Aranesp drug rather than J&J’s treatment. Amgen reversed earlier weakness to close 1.4 per cent firmer at $75.82.Nabi Biopharmaceuticals rose 4 per cent to $11.81 on good results from a consistency study for its staphylococcus vaccine.But trading in scandal-hit derivatives broker Refco was halted after it plunged a further 27.2 per cent to $7.90, and shares in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell 2.7 per cent to $310.40 as the CME placed restrictions on Refco’s broker dealer.Google, the search engine, fell 1.2 per cent to $297.44 and cable company Comcast lost 2.6 per cent at $27.20 on reports that the pair were in discussions to buy a stake in Time Warner’s America Online business for $5bn. Time Warner firmed 0.6 per cent to $17.59 on the news.Houston oil company Bois d’Arc Energy rose 5.2 per cent to $14.95 after reporting that three of the four wells it had drilled recently in the Gulf of Mexico have been successful.Central Coast Bancorp leapt 25.1 per cent to $24.30 as Rabobank, the Dutch financial services group, said it was buying its California-based peer for $371m in cash, or $25 a share.Bell Microproducts plummeted 24.9 per cent to $7.36 as it forecast third quarter earnings of 7-9 cents a share, well below market forecasts of 16 cents.
617;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-09-27T20:29:43Z;Wall St steady despite slide in confidence;;Taser International, the stun gun maker, saw its shares lose 13.1 per cent to $6.35 after it said the Securities and Exchange Commission was stepping up an investigation of the company to the point where it could subpoena documents.The decline came as Wall Street stocks proved that hope springs eternal by closing virtually unchanged in the wake of a report showing consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low.The report was the first evaluation of the impact of recent hurricanes on American consumers. It raised the prospect of slowing consumer expenditure in an economy that owed much of its recent expansion to the resilience of consumers and their willingness to borrow.David Rosenberg, economist at Merrill Lynch, noted this week that consumer discretionaries have been the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year and warned investors that there was a risk of disappointment next year, given that consensus forecasts see the sector as having the best earnings prospects in 2006. On the Dow Jones Industrial Average, initial declines in those stocks with more direct exposure to consumer spending patterns mostly faded away by the close. Thus, Wal-Mart, the retailer, was less than 0.1 per cent off at $43.10, while Home Depot lost 0.1 per cent to $38.39. McDonald’s lost 0.8 per cent to $33.01.By the close, this background saw a 0.1 per cent advance in the Dow to 10,456.21, while the S&P 500 index was flat at 1,215.66. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.2 per cent to 2,116.42.The day’s other data report appeared to do nothing to help sentiment, showing that new homes sales fell in August. However, homebuilders recouped some of their earlier losses.The news sent the Dow Jones US home construction index 0.6 per cent lower, with Toll Brothers down 1.6 per cent to $43.28. KB Home gave up 1.9 per cent to $72, Centex lost 0.8 per cent to $63.40 and DR Horton gave up 0.2 per cent to $35.50.Lennar, which reported above-expectation quarterly results after the Monday close, was 0.1 per cent off at $57.Other stocks in the news included ExxonMobil, which closed unchanged at $64.62 and Chevron, off 0.1 per cent at $64.18. The two oil groups received a downgrade and an upgrade respectively from analysts at JPMorgan.Meanwhile, in deal news, the shares of WellChoice rose 7 per cent to $75.51 after reports that WellPoint, the largest US health insurer, was set to acquire the company. WellPoint was 0.1 per cent lower at $75.01.News that profits grew by 7.3 per cent at Pepsi Bottling Group pushed the company’s shares up 3.1 per cent to $28.46.Movie Gallery, a DVD-rental chain, was 13.9 per cent lower at $11.04, not far from a fresh low point after the company announced that it would suspend its quarterly dividend in order to pay down debt. The stock is down almost 42 per cent for the year.Blockbuster, a rival, was down 1.3 per cent at $4.51.Netflix, which rents DVDs via the internet, improved by 1.4 per cent to $24.30.
618;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
619;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-09-25T19:00:16Z;Analysts fear fragile confidence;;Shares in most of the largest US consumer goods, beverage and retail companies have been hit with downgrades from Banc of America Securities as its analysts believe “increased macro-economic risk” is likely to hit earnings.The move, on Friday, was unusual in that it involved concerted action by 16 analysts. They believed that in spite of low interest rates and a still-strong housing market, “the consumer's resiliency is becoming less certain”.They said consumers might have reached the limit of their ability to absorb the price increases that many consumer goods companies have implemented to help offset rising energy and raw materials prices.April Scee, the company's household and personal care products analyst, covering companies such as Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Newell Rubbermaid, said: “We have argued that the consumer will not notice the price increases on the shelf, but will notice them when we reach a critical mass of price increases. We think we're approaching that point.” Official figures show prices for gasoline rose 8.2 per cent in August and were 31.3 per cent higher than a year ago. Energy prices for home use rose at a more moderate 1.4 per cent.In the restaurant sector, which includes McDonald's, Yum Brands, Wendy's and Starbucks, analyst Andrew Barish said consumers seemed to be “narrowing their dining-out choices to those executing with great new products/promotions”.“We suspect that most restaurant companies will be very cautious in taking new price increases given the delicate state of the consumer today,” he wrote. Mr Barish said McDonald's was the only large company in the sector where there was “confidence in near-term sales and earnings visibility”.All analysts expressed concern that earnings were at risk given their view that raw material, packaging and transport costs “have risen more than expected and are likely to be sustained longer than we thought”.Bryan Spillane, beverage analyst, said bottlers and beer companies, such as Anheuser Busch, Molson Coors, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, faced the greatest risk to earnings.Last week Cott Corporation, which makes soft drinks for Wal-Mart, issued a profit warning, blaming weak soft drink volumes and rising raw materials costs.
620;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-09-21T22:49:01Z;McDonald’s opens its kitchens to Europeans;;McDonalds is set to invite customers across Europe into its kitchens to see how food is prepared in an unprecedented effort to combat rising concerns over obesity and educate consumers about the quality of its ingredients.The so-called “Open Doors” scheme, which kicks off this weekend, involves 30 countries across the region, where sales of McDonald’s burgers, fries and salads are lagging a robust recovery in the US.McDonald’s is in the midst of mailing millions of nutritional leaflets to households in Britain, where the company has been hardest hit by health lobbyists and politicians raising alarm over obesity.The fast food chain has lost a quarter of its sales in Britain in the past five years.“Frequency of customer visits [in the UK] have dropped as people have been influenced by the economy and trust issues like nutrition,” said Peter Beresford, president, Europe Northern Division.The leaflets in Britain highlight the quality of the beef used in McDonald’s hamburgers and the use of organic milk and vegetables.Jim Skinner, chief executive, said McDonald’s was “committed to using [its] size to educate” consumers about the nutritional aspects of its products and about healthy lifestyles.The latest effort is part of a plan to drive more traffic through McDonald’s restaurants at a time of weak economies in Europe, especially the company’s three core markets of Germany, France and Britain, which account for 75 per cent of sales in the region.Sales at restaurants open more than 13 months in Europe have risen recently, but not as fast as its US outlets.Denis Hennequin, president of McDonald’s Europe, said the company aimed to grow in Europe by continuing to modernise the interiors of restaurants. About 20 per cent of restaurants in the region had been remodelled so far, he said. “We must increase trust in our brand. We must get more serious about improving our image in Europe.”McDonald’s said it may roll out the “Open Doors” scheme in the US next month. It was launched last month in China, after being introduced earlier this year in other Asian countries, as well as in Brazil and Argentina in recent years.Separately, McDonald’s on Wednesday launched a new advertising campaign in the US highlighting “successful individuals whose first jobs were at McDonald’s” – an apparent effort to tackle perceptions that restaurant jobs at McDonald’s offer poor employment prospects.Mr Hennequin, who started his career in a McDonald’s restaurant, said: “It is unacceptable that with employment levels soaring [in Europe] that opinion leaders denounce working at McDonald’s.” He did not elaborate on who he was referring to.Rich Floersch, executive vice president of global human resources, dismissed perceptions that serving meals in a McDonald’s – handled by what the company calls “crew” - was a dead-end job. “I go into stores all over the world and just see the [job] satisfaction scores.”He said turnover levels at McDonald’s restaurants were down, with nine out of the company’s 10 major markets showing decreases at the level of store manager and “marked” decreases at the crew level in the last 2-3 years.McDonald’s also said it planned to partially float its Mexican-style Chipotle restaurant chain in the first quarter of next year.
621;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-09-15T20:26:22Z;Mixed economic news keeps Wall St in check;;A mixed economic picture kept Wall Street stocks stuck in a tight trading range on Thursday.Time Warner, the media group, was in focus amid reports it was in talks regarding co-operation with Microsoft, the software company, in their search and advertising network business.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.9 points to 10,558.75. The S&P 500 rose fractionally to 1,227.71 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.2 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,146.15.Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services, said one reason for the rangebound performance was uncertainty about whether the Fed would raise interest rates when it meets next Tuesday.“The Fed is in a difficult position here,” said Mr Mendelsohn. “It doesn’t quite know what the nationwide impact of [Hurricane Katrina] on the economy is going to be.”The government said consumer prices rose in line with expectations last month. But the tame inflation figures were accompanied by two manufacturing reports that showed higher costs and falling orders in early September in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.The New York Fed’s Empire manufacturing index showed slowing production and higher costs at New York factories in early September. The Philadelphia Fed’s business activity index fell sharply, reflecting a drop in new orders in the days following the storm.The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits jumped by 71,000 last week.Time Warner shares rose 3.2 per cent to $18.48, spurred on by a New York Post report that the group was in talks about selling a stake in its AOL internet unit to Microsoft, the world’s biggest software company. Microsoft shares rose 0.2 per cent to $26.27.Blackstone, the private equity group, was rumoured to be close to buying UICI, the life insurance group, for $37 a share. Shares in the company rose 16.2 per cent to $36.11.Elsewhere, Motorola, the communications technology company, fell 0.8 per cent to $23.67 amid reports that it might sell its automotive division.Google, the internet search company, fell 0.1 per cent to $302.62 after it priced its $4bn secondary share offering at $295 a share. The shares had risen more than $100 this year.Shares in Baidu, the Chinese internet search company, rose 0.8 per cent to $82 after twin downgrades sent its shares plunging 28 per cent on Wednesday.Bear Stearns, the investment bank, fell 2.5 per cent to $102.90 in spite of record profits. The slide followed strong results by Lehman Brothers on Wednesday.Fifth Third Bancorp, the retail banking group, fell 5.1 per cent to $38.45 after it was hit by downgrades.McDonalds, the fast food chain, led gainers on the Dow. Its shares rose 3.4 per cent to $33.45 ahead of an analysts’ meeting next week.
622;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;EBay surge not enough to lift wary Wall St;;Wall Street shares dipped on Thursday as traders debated the benefits of a revaluation of the renminbi, the implications of four explosions in London and a blizzard of earnings news.Before trade began, stock futures surged on the news that China was to adjust its currency in the hope that it could help tame the US trade deficit by pushing up the price of Chinese exports.Another school of thought feared it could slow down growth in China and all gains were quickly lost on a day that was set to be dominated by earnings news from big companies, including Coca-Cola and eBay.Dennis Gartman, who publishes an influential daily newsletter for traders, said China’s 2 per cent revaluation was “far, far too little to have any major effect upon the imbalance of trade”.He added that some US exporters would benefit from the move, but retailers such as Wal-Mart were likely to suffer as Chinese goods become dearer in dollar terms. The effect could be either higher prices for consumers, or depressed margins for Wal-Mart and other retailers. Wal-Mart ended down 1.2 per cent to $49.39.The news of four more attacks on London’s transport system just two weeks after the July 7 attacks also pressured the main indices.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.6 per cent to 10,627.77, the S&P was down 0.7 per cent at 1,227.04 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent down at 2,178.6.Travel stocks were hit, the Amex airline index falling 3 per cent to 51.78, with Delta Air Lines dropping 9.2 per cent to $3.55.Bob Baur, head of equities trading and lead economist at Principal Global Investors, questioned whether the market would recover as quickly as it did after July 7.“One event is one thing, but two events in one month makes you think about how often it can happen and its ramifications for the future.”Adding to the weight of news were Alan Greenspan’s remarks about the US economy before the Senate Banking Committee and important earning news from some of corporate America’s biggest beasts.EBay was the day’s star turn, with its shares climbing 20.4 per cent to $41.98 after the online auctioneer announced that profits soared 53 per cent.Dow component Coca-Cola was up 1.4 per cent at $43.95 after better than expected sales in North America boosted earnings.McDonald’s was down 0.4 per cent at $30.78 after the burger chain reported a 10 per cent fall in second-quarter earnings.There were disappointments in the pharmaceutical sector. Eli Lilly was down 1.8 per cent at $56.25 after reporting a quarterly loss due to a legal settlement, while Merck fell 1.5 per cent to $31.38. The group’s second-quarter earnings were hurt by the withdrawal of its hugely popular Vioxx painkiller.
623;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-07-05T16:08:33Z;Sugar farmers sour Florida's faith in Cafta;;Belle Glade, a farming town on the edge of the Florida Everglades, is only 90 minutes' drive from Miami but the two places feel as though they are on different planets.Miami is one of America's most vibrant and cosmopolitan cities, its skyline pierced by the glass offices of international banks, the towering cranes of its busy port and the luxury apartment blocks of fashionable South Beach.In sleepy Belle Glade, surrounded by alligator-infested dykes and swampy sugar plantations, the tallest landmarks include a whitewashed church steeple, the golden arches of a McDonald's outlet and the chimneys of a sugar-processing plant.Miami and Belle Glade represent opposite sides of the fierce political battle raging in the Sunshine State over the proposed Central America Free Trade Agreement (Cafta), which was approved by the Senate last week but faces a more uncertain vote in the House of Representatives sometime this month.Florida's business community, concentrated in Miami, is overwhelmingly in support of Cafta, which will reduce barriers to trade and investment between the US, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. But the deal is opposed by the state's powerful sugar farmers, based around Belle Glade, who say it would threaten their livelihoods by opening the US market to cheap sugar from Central America.It is a debate echoed across the US south, where the protectionist instincts of traditional sectors such as agriculture and textile production clash with the interests of newer parts of the economy, such as financial services and technology.Cafta is a relatively small deal. The six countries involved have a combined economy about the size of Indiana's. But winning congressional approval for the agreement is crucial if President George W. Bush is to have any hope of securing domestic backing for bigger trade pacts, such as the Doha round of World Trade Organisation negotiations and the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the mooted pan-American agreement.Florida is at the heart of the conflict over Cafta because, as the US's commercial and cultural gateway to Central America, it conducts more trade with the region than any other state. Collectively, Cafta countries are Florida's largest export market, accounting for $3.2bn (€2.7bn, £1.8bn), or 11 per cent, of its exports in 2004. That dwarfs the 1.9 per cent of total US exports that went to the region last year.However, Florida is also the biggest sugar-producing state, responsible for about a quarter of national output. Sugar farmers are among the most powerful forces in state politics, none more so than the Fanjuls - considered the first family of Florida sugar - who donated $431,000 to political candidates last year.Florida's two senators - Bill Nelson and Mel Martinez - both defied the sugar lobby by voting in favour of Cafta - and Governor Jeb Bush is strongly in favour. But many of the state's 25-strong congressional delegation are either opposed or undecided. “We are making sure all representatives understand a vote for Cafta is a vote to send sugar farmers to the unemployment line,” says Phillip Hayes, spokesman for the American Sugar Alliance, an industry lobby group.Critics accuse the sugar industry of exaggerating the threat posed by Cafta. They say the additional imports allowed by the deal would amount to less than 1 per cent of domestic sugar supplies. US consumers stand to benefit from a more open market because they pay more than twice the world market price for the product.Supporters of Cafta complain that the industry's influence far outweighs its importance to the economy. Sugar accounts for less than 9 per cent of Florida's annual agricultural revenues and about 2 per cent of agricultural jobs. “The sugar industry is holding the rest of Florida's economy hostage,” says John Price, president of InfoAmericas, a trade consultancy. George Foyo, the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce president, cites banks, legal firms, education providers, software developers, telecommunications operators and logistics companies as those eager to do business with Central America.“The benefits of trade agreements tend to be widely dispersed while the costs are concentrated on specific industries - often those with a loud political voice,” says Tony Villamil, chief executive of the Washington Economic Group and a former US undersecretary of commerce.Mr Villamil says the importance of Cafta to Florida stretches beyond trade. “We are part of the neighbourhood so the extent to which an agreement can increase stability and prosperity in the region is good for Florida,” he says. “If we don't do this, China and the European Union will step into the breach and we will lose business and influence on our doorstep.”
624;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-06-07T19:49:38Z;McDonald’s names new European head;;"McDonald’s on Tuesday unexpectedly replaced Russ Smyth, its head of European operations and a 21-year veteran of the company, as the fast food chain continues to battle weak economic conditions across the region.Mr Smyth, 48, was replaced by Denis Hennequin, 46, an executive in charge of McDonald's France.The company said Mr Smyth, who had been leading a turnround effort at McDonald's Europe, had resigned for personal reasons.However the European turnround has been slow, widening a gap between the region and the company's rapidly growing US business.Sales at McDonald's stores open at least 13 months in Europe have dropped in two of the three months up to April. The US posted a 4.7 per cent sales gain in April, compared to a 0.7 per cent fall in European sales.Mr Smyth said last month at the company's annual shareholders meeting that the company was gaining momentum in Europe but that it faced ""a lot of economic wind in our faces"".He said the company would not be satisfied ""until we see US-like results"". Europe and the US each account for about 35 per cent of worldwide revenues.In Germany, economic recession and high unemployment have hit sales, with only gradual improvement after the introduction of the ""one euro menu"" aimed at driving restaurant traffic.In the UK, where McDonald's first opened a restaurant in 1974, the company has lost a quarter of its sales in the last five years as health concerns have driven customers away.However McDonald's this year introduced a range of low-fat salad dressings to accompany its year-old range of salads. The last six months had seen signs of a turnround, Mr Smyth said last month.In Scandinavia, McDonald's recently launched Pita Mac, pita breads stuffed with meat or vegetables.Mike Roberts, chief operating officer, said of Mr Smyth's departure: ""I regret that he's moving on, but I know what he is doing what's right for him, his family and the direction he wants to take his career.""He said Mr Hennequin had contributed to the ""sales traction"" the company was beginning to see in Europe. ""We remain extremely confident in our people and in the strategies in place in Europe,"" Mr Roberts said. McDonald's will on Wednesday report comparable-store sales for May.McDonald's also promoted Glen Steeves, currently overseeing company operations in northern Europe, to chief operating officer for the whole of Europe.McDonald's shares fell 1.6 per cent to $29.90 in late New York trade."
625;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-05-31T19:42:59Z;Lex: Repsol;;It used to be said that the presence of McDonald's indicated a country's stability. Repsol's presence might signal the opposite.Spain's integrated oil company bought YPF in 1999, just before Argentina's collapse. Its subsequent focus on Bolivia and Venezuela has been perfectly timed for a lurch to the left in both countries.The strategic plan unveiled yesterday by Antonio Brufau, the newish executive chairman, ends the investment drought enforced since the YPF deal. Repsol will invest €14bn over five years, equivalent to two-thirds of its capital employed, in upstream and downstream projects, outside Latin America. Its reserve replacement ratio should reach 100 per cent as a result from just 33 per cent in 2004.Whether this creates value, as opposed to simply increasing the capital base, remains to be seen. However, it will not transform the asset mix. Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil are today 74 per cent of production and 75 per cent of proved reserves. They should still be 71 per cent and 63 per cent in 2009. While energy prices remain high and the region's penal tax and pricing policies persist, Repsol's realised value per unit of production will be below average. This suggests its valuation will be too.Mr Brufau is trying to implement cultural change at Repsol. His financial plan, however, looks conservative. Given Repsol's turbulent history, that is understandable. But investors should not be surprised if he opts for more revolutionary policies once he has been in command for longer.
626;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-05-27T20:14:12Z;Mauresmo's trial at court of France;;"What is the most difficult name to have at the French Open? Justine Henin-Hardenne, the favourite in the women's event, laughs: ""Mauresmo isn't easy, is it?""Indeed: each year Amélie Mauresmo carries the hopes of France on her bulging, tattooed shoulders, and each year she chokes. This outrages the French. They invent tennis, centuries later finally produce a player ranked first in the world, embrace her for being gay, and then each May, just as the arrival of summer turns Paris into the best city in the world, she lets them down.In fact, she does to the French what Tim Henman does to the British. This year she has to win. No pressure, though, Amélie.Part of the problem is that Mauresmo understands as well as anyone in France that Roland Garros is special. She grasped this aged three, sitting in the living room with her parents watching Yannick Noah win the 1983 tournament. ""He seemed so happy,"" she remembers. ""I told myself I wanted to do the same thing."" In the garden she imitated his strokes, which she did perfectly: much of sport is the ability to mimic.The myopic engineer's daughter slogged her way to the summit, doing whatever it took including a Christmas Eve spent alone in a McDonald's in New Zealand. She developed perhaps the broadest palette of strokes in women's tennis. In 1999, aged 19, she reached the final of the Australian Open. What interested the world more, though, was her mention in Melbourne that that she had a girlfriend.""Le coming out"", to use the French phrase, was the first by a French celebrity. It was tough. At the time, French reactionaries were demonstrating against the proposed civil unions for gay couples. The country's version of Spitting Image, Les guignols de l'info,depicted Mauresmo as a removals woman who looked and talked like a man. Some players carped too: Martina Hingis, noting Mauresmo's big muscles and big strokes, called her ""half a man"".Yet, after a little fuss, Mauresmo was accepted. France has changed fast since 1999: civil unions are now almost passé (or, to use the new French word, ""hasbeen""). The debate has turned to whether to allow gay marriage and more lesbians have ""come out"" citing Mauresmo as their inspiration.The French realised that she was charming, kind and intelligent, and embraced her. Deciding that she should win Roland Garros, they packed the courts and screamed her on. It did not help. Mauresmo succumbed to ""le syndrome Roland-Garros"", common among French players. She blamed one early defeat on ""media pressure"" and another year said: ""In future I'll have to approach this with a bit less passion.""Yet she has still never got past the quarter-finals in Paris. In fact, despite having briefly been the world's number one, she has never won any of the four major tournaments.Each spring Mauresmo tries a different remedy. She once used a sports psychologist but now her mental coach is the greatest living Frenchman: Yannick Noah.The dreadlocked one did not have le syndrome Roland-Garros. In fact he played his best tennis there. After retiring he achieved the dream of most sports stars: becoming a pop star. Today, when he isn't singing Africanesque French rock, Noah is a sex symbol and occasional mental coach, currently working for Cameroon's national football team. Intimates reveal that his method is to talk a lot, yet without ever mentioning his pupil's weaknesses.This fortnight, Noah is the most prominent participant in the women's event. Whenever he is spotted urging Mauresmo on from courtside, the crowd forgets the match and cheers him, which must be irritating to her. Asked once too often to define his magic, she grunts, ""Nothing special"", and her usual giggles dry up.Mauresmo hasn't needed Noah yet. She began the tournament by sacrificing an Australian butcher's daughter, and then a cherubic French 15-year-old named Aliz Cornet who has a poster of Mauresmo on her bedroom wall. It was like watching a child being eaten by a wolf. Told afterwards about Cornet's poster, Mauresmo burst out laughing: ""I didn't know at all!""Everyone else in France did, which suggests Mauresmo is managing not to read the papers. The one hint of nerves she has shown so far is a tendency to blast her forehands long, the result of trying too hard to hit winners. But she always wins her easy matches. Today, against Ana Ivanovic, the 29th seed, things get harder. Mauresmo is scheduled to choke.For once, she may not. The pressure on her is easing. Noah helps, as does the fact that the French public is getting bored with tennis in general and with her in particular.Most significant may be the death of her father last year. It put things into perspective. Months after he died, she finally reached number one. ""Today defeat doesn't have the same importance,"" she says.She could calm herself with another reflection: even if she triumphs, people will remember the winner of this year's women's event as Yannick Noah."
627;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-05-25T20:19:34Z;Observer - Asia;;Not very merry for MurrayThere are not many chief executives who have the power to increase the stock of a company they don't run. David Murray is one, but perhaps not for the best of reasons.The boss of Australia's Commonwealth Bank had seen his own company's shares rise to an all-time high last Friday following rumours that he was on the march, then plummet after he took himself out of the running for the top job at Telstra. That news sent shares soaring at the former telecommunications monopoly.With Australia's leading candidate no longer in contention, a foreigner with telecoms experience is seen as the most likely replacement for Ziggy Switkowski, who is set to leave Telstra on July 1.Of course, experienced executives don't come cheap. AT&T's Bill Hannigan, says Observer's man on the phone, would need at least A$10m ($7.6m) a year to match his current job.That's bad news for Peter Costello, Australian treasurer, who has just climbed aboard the salary-bashing bandwagon of the Labor opposition.The extraordinary executive salaries revealed by investment bank Macquarie last week, including A$18m for chief executive Alan Moss, were beyond comprehension, he said. It was up to shareholders to pull the company's executives into line. Telstra's controlling shareholder is, of course, the government.That's another incentive for the incoming boss to sell off its remaining stake pronto.Mac-kimchiForget the Big Mac index, measuring the price of one of McDonald's burgers around the world. Those with more cosmopolitan tastes will now be following the kimchi index.A Korean trade organisation has researched the price of the country's national dish, a bubbling stew made from pickled cabbage, in different parts of the globe, with some surprising results.The hearty dish costs a shocking $34.20 in Zurich and $26.32 in Copenhagen. It goes for $4-$5 in Seoul. The researchers said it was clear Korean food had yet to establish itself in the global village. Anyone who has woken up after a night of heavy kimchi eating will be able to taste why.observer@ft.com
628;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;McDonald’s to open China ‘drive-through’;;"McDonald's, the US fast food chain, said on Wednesday it would open its first ""drive-through"" hamburger outlet in China this autumn as it moves to capitalise on growing car ownership and demand for western-style fast-food.The disclosure came as the Illinois-based company said it had started to see a turnround in its UK business after years of falling sales.It also said it planned to significantly expand the number of restaurants in the US that are open 24-hours a day.Jim Skinner, chief executive, said McDonald's would open 100 new restaurants in China this year. By 2008, the year China hosts the next Olympic games, there would be about 1,000 outlets in the country, a more than 50 per cent increase on the current number.Mr Skinner said it was possible the company could exceed that number: ""We need to be more impactful in the country relative to the size of our [overall] business,"" he said after the company's annual shareholders meeting.The new drive-through outlet would be opened in Shenzhen, in southern Guangdong province.As well as offering hamburgers and fries, McDonald's sells a range of meals tailored to Chinese tastes, including rice-cake sandwiches filled with diced mushroom and ginger.McDonald's China business has not been a profitable as the company had hoped. But Matthew Paull, chief financial officer, said that 15 to 20 per cent of China's population could afford McDonald's meals and that this ""middle class"" was growing quickly.""You have to remember that in places like Australia and Spain it took us 10 to 15 years to make money. China is in its 15th year and it's making very good money; it just could be better.""Very clearly a huge proportion of our future growth is going to be in China, that's why we are going to continue to invest.""He said McDonald's returns in China were ""in the double digits"".He also said the country would be one of a handful of markets where the company would be investing more than half of this year's planned $1.7bn in capital expenditure, compared with $1.4bn last year.The others were the US, Australia, Russia and France.On a net basis - taking into account regular, planned restaurant closures - McDonald's would open 350 new restaurants this year globally, compared with 300 last year.Russ Smyth, president of McDonald's Europe, said that in Europe, where McDonald's has suffered from sluggish economies, sales grew two quarters in a row.Sales at stores open at least 13 months were up 1.9 per cent in Europe for the year until April, compared with a 5.1 per cent rise in the US.Mr Smyth said the company's challenge on the European continent was to ""grow in a shrinking market"", by taking market share from competitors through offering more premium-priced products.Mr Skinner said that observers tended to underestimate the performance of the company's European business because its US business was performing much more strongly by comparison.He also said it was taking McDonald's extra time to implement the company-wide growth plan because Europe, with over 50 countries, had ""a lot of moving parts"".""To generate those synergies is a little more complicated and yet those plans are moving forward and we are seeing traction there and we expect that our success will be rewarded over the next six or seven months,"" Mr Skinner said.In the UK, where concerns aired by nutritionist about McDonald's foods have helped cut sales by a quarter in the past five years, the business had been ""turning around in the last six months"", Mr Smyth said.""The UK's a canary in the coal mine from a nutrition standpoint. We've become a target. We need to get out there and tell the real story of McDonald's,"" he told the Financial Times.Last month, McDonald's UK added carrot sticks, grilled chicken strips and jellies made from real fruit juice to its children's ""Happy Meal"" menus.Mr Paull said McDonald's in the US would this summer would reduce rents slightly for franchisees as an incentive to encourage them to open on a 24-hour basis. About 2,500 out of McDonald's total 13,600 franchised restaurants in the US are open 24 hours.The incentive would last for six months and only if operators committed to staying open on a 24-hour basis for 12 months. ""The idea is get a critical mass of restaurants in different 'TV markets' so we can advertise that we are open more hours,"" Mr Paull said.McDonald's defines TV markets as large urban areas with a concentrated television advertising market.Mr Paull said it ""would be nice"" to have half of McDonald's franchisees open 24 hours a day in some TV markets."
629;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-05-08T17:53:42Z;US tourism ‘losing billions because of image’;;The US is losing billions of dollars as international tourists are deterred from visiting the US because of a tarnished image overseas and more bureaucratic visa policies, travel industry leaders have warned.“It's an economic imperative to address these problems,” said Roger Dow, chief executive of the Travel Industry Association of America, tourism's main trade body, which concluded its annual convention this weekend in New York.Mr Dow stressed that tourism contributed to a positive perception of the US, which spread across to business. “If we don't address these issues in tourism, the long-term impact for American brands Coca-Cola, General Motors, McDonald's could be very damaging,” he said.The plea echoed that of other industry trade organisations which say bureaucratic visa procedures and stringent security after the September 11 terrorist attacks have deterred business travellers and foreign students. “The idea has gotten out that we've pulled in the welcome mat,” said Rick Webster, the association's director of government affairs.The number of international visitors last year rose 12 per cent, compared to 2003, to 46.1m, according to the US Commerce Department. They spent $93.7bn, or 17 per cent more than their counterparts the previous year. However, US market share of foreign visitors is still down 38 per cent since 1992, according to the TIA. The number of global travellers has grown by 2 per cent to 770m since 2000, but US market share has not kept pace. “Our piece of the pie has shrunk by 5m visitors,” said Mr Dow.The weak US dollar has boosted the number of international visitors, but given favourable currency rates for many foreigners, those numbers should be far higher.“The weak US dollar is masking some of the problems,” said Mr Webster. “And the dollar won't remain weak forever.”Mr Dow said rising anti-Americanism has created a feeling that the US is inhospitable and difficult to visit. “There's a perception of ‘Fortress America' that is much worse than it really is,” he said. Mr Dow added that more competition from other destinations such as Australia, South Africa, Spain and Asia had siphoned off tourism to the US. The TIA urged US policymakers to facilitate various security measures. An October 26 deadline that requires some foreign passports to have biometric facial-recognition technology is unrealistic and must be extended, according to the TIA.It also wants problems resolved with the US-Visit programme, an initiative requiring photos and fingerprints of some visitors, which is scheduled to be in place at land borders and ports-of-entry by end the end of the year.

The S&P 500 rose 2 per cent to 1,159.95, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5 per cent to 1,962.41.A steep drop in jobless claims, falling oil prices, and an upbeat manufacturing report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve also gave Wall Street a boost.Gains strengthened throughout the day in spite of a warning from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chief, that rising deficits could cause the US economy to stagnate.In spite of the day’s gains, US indices were still down substantially from monthly highs.Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services, said that, with bulls and bears locked in an increasingly volatile tug-of-war over investor sentiment, the market’s short-term fortunes may hinge on whether the indices can break through critical upward resistance points today. “If they fail here and this rally doesn’t succeed, it’s going to become more apparent that the bears are correct.”Motorolasurprised analysts with a 13.6 per cent increase in quarterly earnings. The mobile handset maker also raised its second-quarter guidance. Shares in the company rose 6.7 per cent to $15.93Transport finished higher after UPS, the express shipping company, reported higher first-quarter profits and forecast stronger growth this year. UPS shares rose 4.9 per cent to $70.56Yum Brands, owner of the KFC and Taco Bell fast-food chains, fell 4.3 per cent in spite of higher earnings amid concerns about food safety in China.

631;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;McDonald's woos its ‘burger flippers';;At a McDonald's restaurant on the main street in Fargo, North Dakota, a “help wanted” sign is displayed on the front counter as a small lunch crowd queues for burgers, salads and fries. “Premium pay” and free uniforms are on offer.Application forms are stacked nearby, featuring pictures of smiling faces from a range of ethnic backgrounds and the words: “At McDonald's You Can Go Anywhere!”Kaila, an assistant manager, explains the effort to attract staff: “There's a pretty high turnover here.”On Friday, the fast food chain will mark a half century since founder Ray Kroc opened the first restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, with the launch of a new restaurant in downtown Chicago featuring 60ft-high “golden arches”.The company's anniversary theme is not how the chain launched a revolution in fast food. Nor is the emphasis on the company's recent efforts to introduce more healthy foods amid rising concern over obesity. Instead, McDonald's wants to be seen, quite simply, as a good place to work. Stung by decades of criticism that its “burger-flipping” jobs are low-paying and monotonous, it is embarking on a campaign to convince the public otherwise.Jim Skinner, the seventh McDonald's chief executive, says: “What I try to communicate to the organisation is: please don't take it personally when someone calls you a burger flipper, or when people talk about ‘McJobs' or when they suggest there is no career path at McDonald's.”McDonald's latest campaign to change that image is being spearheaded by figures in the executive suite of 50 top managers - almost half of whom started their careers working part-time at McDonald's. Mr Skinner spent seven months as a “crew person” in a McDonald's restaurant in Iowa in 1962.“McDonald's is an organisation that has done an incredible job of creating a culture that is predominantly based on promoting from within,” says Tierney Remick, managing director for global consumer markets at Korn/Ferry International, an executive search firm.McDonald's is proud of the fact that every manager of its 30,500 restaurants globally must attend a week-long training course at one of six “hamburger universities” dotted around the world.Diana Thomas, “dean” of the hamburger university, says: “If you're going to continue to grow you've got to have the talent and that's something our competitors can't replicate.”But a more pressing issue is how the company improves working conditions for the burger flipper. McDonald's says it has made progress in the past two years in reducing turnover in so-called seasonal, part-time jobs such as taking orders in a restaurant.In January, McDonald's increased dental and prescription drug benefits for eligible employees and recently introduced new kitchen equipment to reduce noise in its restaurants. The company's recently launched global slogan “I'm lovin' it” is also aimed at employees, says Anna Rozenich, a company spokeswoman. “It's not just for external constituents, it also had huge internal implications as a kind of rallying cry for our employees.”The company's efforts in Germany were acknowledged last month when the Corporate Research Foundation, an independent researcher, ranked McDonald's among the top 10 companies to work for in Germany.However, Denis Hennequin, Paris-based executive vice-president for McDonald's Europe, admits it is not a “lifestyle” job: “Most of the workers we have are students it's a complementary job.”But for those who havea longer-term view, McDonald's is regarded as a good place to build a career in restaurant operations.“At the corporate level McDonald's is probably one of best professional experiences. From the restaurant level, it is an entirely different labour force,” says Carl Sibilski, analyst at Morningstar. “I don't think anyone grows up saying ‘I want to work at McDonald's flipping hamburgers forever'.”
632;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-03-31T17:38:57Z;Russians rally to Boeing's cause;;"In the titanic struggle for supremacy between Boeing of the US and Airbus of Europe, what may turn out to be the next model for aircraft design and production has been quietly taking shape above a McDonald's restaurant just off Moscow's Red Square.Twelve floors above street-level lies one of two outposts of the Boeing Design Center. Here hundreds of engineers, some of whom cut their teeth on cold war defence projects designed to wipe America off the map, have been helping to craft a design and development strategy for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.Launched last year and intended to go into service in 2008, the 787 is the aircraft Boeing hopes will re-establish its position as the world's number one commercial aircraft producer.In its search for engineering best-practice, a quest that has taken it all over the world, Boeing made the surprising discovery that pockets of the Russian aerospace industry - not noted for its prowess in lean manufacturing techniques - had an intuitive skill for simplifying the production of complex aircraft structures.Since the centre opened in 1998, BDC engineers have streamlined the process by which the upper and lower halves of the 737, another Boeing aircraft, fuselage are joined and have made other changes to remove weight, cost and time from the manufacturing process.Their eye for detail was also invaluable in designing two other aircraft, the Boeing 747-400 Special Freighter launched in January 2004 and the 747-400 Large Cargo Aircraft, which is being procured by Boeing to support the final assembly operation of the 787.Hank Queen, Seattle-based vice-president of engineering and manufacturing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, emphasises the centre's importance: ""We couldn't have launched those programmes without the design input of the BDC.""Andrey Kudryashov, a senior manager for international co-operation programmes at the BDC, pinpoints a more specific advantage: a special ""blended"" rate that merged US and Russian labour costs for the Special Freighter and Large Cargo Aircraft programmes.An experienced Russian engineer, desperate for work in an aerospace industry that has virtually collapsed since the demise of the Soviet Union, can command a contract fee from a foreign aerospace producer of about $12,000 a year - a small fortune in Russia. Many of their counterparts in Wichita or Seattle, however, are paid salaries of more than $75,000.In the US, where the aerospace industry remains heavily unionised, the practice of farming work out to low-cost economies has been bitterly attacked and, in the early days of the BDC, led to threats of strike action.Mindful of this, Boeing executives are keen to stress that low labour rates are a small part of the overall value that the BDC brings to the US aircraft-maker's design capabilities.""We've been going through horrific up and down cycles in Seattle,"" Mr Queen observes. ""After 9/11, we laid off 7,000 workers. Through the BDC we can bring in contract labour when we need it, stabilising our labour force in the Seattle/Puget Sound area.""Boeing's presence in Russia has helped it capture 83 per cent of the market for western aircraft in the former Soviet Union. It also buys more than 50 per cent of its titanium - a critical metal for load-bearing structures such as undercarriages - from VSMPO, a Russian supplier, and works with the Russian aerospace industry on civilian research and space launch programmes. The value of Boeing contracts in Russia has almost doubled since 2000, when it stood at $1.3bn.None of this, Boeing executives believe, will be lost on political and commercial decision-makers in Russia when the country's domestic commercial aviation market eventually takes off. Airbus also has a design office in Moscow, but its presence in the Russian capital is smaller. Even so, the European aircraft manufacturer has made important inroads into the Russian marketplace and Boeing is taking nothing for granted.Shared design software as well as procedures and methods mean that BDC designers work digitally in real time alongside Boeing's entire network of suppliers.This skill in marshalling an international team of engineers underpinned the 787 Dreamliner programme when Boeing launched it last year.The 787 is designed to carry about 225 passengers and will make its first flight in 2007 - a relatively tight schedule not just predicated on the needs of the market, but to counter the predatory impact of Airbus, which last year overtook Boeing for the first time in sales and deliveries.To reduce costs, acquire new technology and capture market share, Boeing planned the project as an international venture from the outset. It retained control over design and final assembly but virtually every other part of the process was open to outsourcing.When it announced a $6bn launch order from All Nippon Airways for 50 787s in April 2004, Boeing revealed that as much as 35 per cent of the aircraft's structure would be manufactured by Japanese companies. In China, where six carriers have placed orders for a total of 60 Dreamliners, Boeing expects that parts worth several hundred million dollars will be produced in the country.The model of co-operation that has allowed the 787's design to come together rapidly in locations around the world was developed largely through Boeing's experience with the BDC, say company officials.At the end of a working day in Seattle, engineers are able to hand on design packages to their colleagues in Moscow - a round-the-clock capability that continues all year, since Russians even work during the Christmas break. At a dedicated 787 design facility ten minutes' walk from the McDonald's building, BDC support for the project comes in many forms, including design of the front edge of the wing, production tooling, ground support equipment and elements of the forward fuselage. But Russian engineers' understanding of materials technology - especially composites and titanium - has also had an impact.As it battles to reassert itself, Boeing aims to overtake Airbus in its use of composite technologies on the 787. Some 10 per cent of the 777's structure is made of composite material - graphite and fibreglass. With the 787, however, this will jump to 50 per cent.The advantage of composites is their high strength-to-weight ratio compared with traditional aluminium. The 787 is therefore 10,000lbs lighter than it would have been had its structure been made of aluminium - the equivalent of 53 passengers.But the use of this revolutionary material also presents design challenges. How, for example, do you join the wings to the body of such a large aircraft? ""It was our first composite commercial aircraft,"" Mr Queen says, ""so our old methods weren't appropriate.""Boeing organised a joint team of BDC and Wichita engineers and came up with a titanium-based design for the highly loaded joints that connect the wings to the fuselage. Mr Queen is clear about the value of the Russian contribution: ""Their knowledge covers the complete spectrum of the aerospace industry. There's still a lot of residual talent. They speak aircraft,"" he says.Monday: How American Airlines met the challenge of the US airlines unionsWHY A GIANT OF THE SKIES IS STAKING ITS FUTURE ON THINKING SMALLMuch is riding on the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing’s new aircraft, when it enters service in three years. While Airbus, its European rival, is predicting that a large market exists for its 555-passenger A380 superjumbo, which is planned to enter service next year, US-based Boeing is staking its future on a different prospect: that the true market for commercial aircraft is based on the airlines’ need for a smaller, more flexible aircraft in the class of the 787.Three versions of the Dreamliner are on offer. The baseline 787-8 is designed to carry about 225 passengers in three classes over a range of 8,500 nautical miles. The longer 787-9 will take 259 passengers up to 8,300nm and the shorter-range 787-3 will carry 296 on journeys of up to 3,500nm.To counter the threat of the 787, Airbus is planning to launch the A350, which is based on the A330, for service entry in 2010.By the beginning of this year, Boeing had notched up 60 firm orders for the 787 and more than 190 commitments.Through its extensive use of composite materials and new fuel-efficient engines produced by General Electric and Rolls-Royce, the 787 will be 20 per cent more fuel-efficient than today’s 757 and 767 and their Airbus equivalents. Its overall operating costs are designed to be 10 per cent lower than today’s similarly sized aircraft."
633;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-03-29T18:55:21Z;Observer - Asia;;"Numbers add up for TelstraSo, the UBS and Caliburn partnership has walked off with Australia's most hotly contested mandate in some time, beating favourites ABN Amro, CSFB and Goldman Sachs for Telstra's pre-privatisation work.The mandate is only for a study of the options for the giant A$33bn (US$25bn) telecommunications sale, likely to be the biggest of its kind undertaken anywhere, but it will put UBS in pole position for a global co-ordinator role for the eventual offering. Caliburn is not a stockbroker.ABN Amro will feel especially aggrieved as Caliburn, a Sydney boutique, was set up by two of its ex-banking chiefs, one of whom, Peter Hunt, had a key role in Telstra's previous privatisation offerings.But it's hard to know what all the fuss is about, seeing as bankers will barely make a bean out of the sale.Australia is about the most competitive investment banking market around - no fewer than 12 international and local groups trekked down to Canberra earlier this month to spend the weekend pitching for the job. And all for a deal that, judging by Telstra's earlier sales, will be lucky to earn them 1 to 2 per cent in total brokerage fees, well below what they would expect to pick up on Wall Street.Micro-managingWhat's in a name? Quite a lot, when you dislike each other as much as the European Commission and Microsoft.After a bitter six-year antitrust battle, the two have been at each others' throats for the past four months over the vital issue of what to call the slimmed-down version of the software group's flagship Windows operating system.Brussels ruled a package without Media Player must go on sale in the European Union last year. But it feared it would have a name that would put customers off. Microsoft's suggestion, ""Reduced Media Edition"", was rejected.Observer's man stirring the alphabet soup wonders why Brussels also objected to alternative letters proposed by Microsoft, such as U, B and C, before finally settling on N.Even then Brussels had to have the last word. Microsoft wanted N to come before ""Home"" or ""Professional"" edition. The Commission has insisted it is tagged on the end. Apparently the N stands for ""not"", rather than ""niggling"".Big Mac attackSo Ronald McDonald is boarding the hip-hop bandwagon in the hope of getting some extra custom. The burger group is to offer rap stars up to $5 every time a song mentioning Big Macs is played on the radio.Why only rappers? Well, for a start the more commercial ones are cheaper to buy than a Glock semi-automatic pistol, their favourite fantasy weapon. Second, they shape lifestyles, with, for example, French brandy and Cristal champagne receiving sales boosts after being namechecked.In fact, burgers have been sung about since hip-hop came to prominence in the 1980s, with the US's KRS-One terming beef ""the number one drug on the street"" because it is pumped full of hormones.Sadly, McDonald's will approve the lyrics. So Eminem, rap's biggest star, will probably not be collecting for this line from Quitter: ""Heart attack seizures/Too many cheeseburgers/ McDonald's Big Mac Greases.""Tangled webChinese anti-Japan activists are crowing about the success of an online petition against Tokyo's attempt to win a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, with local media claiming on Tuesday that well over 10m people had signed up.There is no doubt the petition taps into a deep well of feeling in China, where many people nurse bitter memories of Japan's brutal 1931-45 invasion and believe their neighbour has never atoned for the past.But Observer cannot help wondering about the authenticity of some signatures added to the internet petition.After all, it is something of a surprise to see Junichiro Koizumi, Japanese premier, repeatedly expressing opposition to his own government's policy, seconded, it seems, by Chen Shui-bian, Taiwan's president.And any accurate signature count would surely have to remove the large number of petitioners with even less convincing names, such as ""Chinese Person"", ""Remember National Shame"" and ""Kill Japanese"".Crying off WolfHaving insisted that he should audition Paul Wolfowitz, the US candidate to run the World Bank, Louis Michel, the EU's development commissioner, will in fact not be around for his visit to Brussels on Wednesday.When he invited Wolfowitz on March 18, Michel said he wanted to ""listen to his ideas on development, the main challenges ahead and his vision for the World Bank as a major actor"". The lure of the Caribbean, where he has been on tour since last Thursday, has proved stronger than that of rainy Brussels.Observer thinks it's a shame. The laconic Michel, as Belgian foreign minister, fiercely opposed the US war on Iraq planned by Wolfowitz, so it could have been quite a fixture.Curiously, the European Commission has not found a substitute commissioner to play host. A snub or just a logistical cock-up?Family valueObserver is launching a hunt for the world's most expensive shares. It's not that we can afford to buy them. We just wonder whether anyone can top Karlholt, the family business of Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation tycoon, which recently listed on the Bermuda stock exchange to avoid tax. It has a market value of $3.8bn with just 10 shares, making each a pricey $380m.Play on wordsGoldman Sachs and Sweden's Wallenberg family are prepared to pay $3.8bn for Danish cleaning company ISS. It surely proves that, as Shakespeare wrote, something is rotten in the state of Denmark.observer@ft.com"
634;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-03-11T18:23:21Z;Chinese learning to talk contracts, not contacts;;At the “grand opening” of the Mermax furniture and garden store in the Fox Valley Mall, snacks are laid out and a presenter from the local radio station is broadcasting the best deals to listeners in the surrounding Chicago suburb of Naperville.The only sign that this is no ordinary opening is the presence of three Chinese staff standing near the entrance. For the store is owned by a Beijing-based group, Longfa Decoration Corporation, and this is its first overseas project.Yan Shihong, the manager, says the plan is to spread the Mermax franchise to America's largest cities within five years.Asked why a Chinese company would pick the Midwest, he says it is where McDonald's, the hamburger chain, started in 1955: “We want to provide a full service and create a brand. It's the American way, right?”Mermax seems to be learning “the American way” fast. It studied the US market for furniture for two years before moving in, using a local estate agent to pick its new premises for selling its furniture, made in China and shipped to the US.As Chinese companies increase their investments in the US to pick up expertise and technology, not all are finding the going as easy as Mermax.Chief among the problems they face is tackling a business culture that is based on contractual obligations, in contrast to greater Chinese reliance on contacts, or guangxi.David Helfrey, a lawyer with Missouri-based firm Helfrey, Simon & Jones, says: “They operate on relationships and trust, whereas we operate on pieces of paper called contracts.”The issue has come into sharp focus because a new wave of Chinese companies is arriving in the industrial Midwest eager to manufacture rather than just trade.The Chinese consulate in Chicago estimates there are about 900 companies with investments worth around $1bn in the US. Many are automotive parts makers, keen to sell to carmakers and larger parts makers around Michigan, home to the US car industry.Many are entering joint ventures with US manufacturers, or buying themoutright as a way of accessing proprietary technology. This is where the problems begin, involving disputes with partners.Chunlin Leonhard, a lawyer at Sonnenschein, Nath & Rosenthal, is advising an increasing number of Chinese companies involved in such disputes.She says they arise because the Chinese have relied too much on verbal assurances that may have been given in the course of negotiations.“Typically the Chinese say, ‘This is what they [the US side] said orally they would do, and they're not doing it',” says Ms Leonhard.Such complaints may seem naïve in a business culture where each party is assumed to be capable of evaluating its own business risks and making provision for them in a written contract.“In some cases the Americans will say, ‘You're a big boy and you understand the risks'. But often the Chinese will not necessarily see it that way because they are used to very different norms,” says Ms Leonhard.Preston Torbert, a lawyer in Baker & McKenzie's Chicago office, says language difficulties compound the problem.“You have quite senior people on the Chinese side but they don't know English well enough to be able to negotiate an M&A agreement. What happens is they demand a Chinese version of the agreement. How many law firms have the capability of doing that?”Mr Torbert, a fluent Chinese speaker and writer, has made an effort to improve understanding, writing a guide in Chinese, published three months ago, that shows how to draft contracts in Chinese and English.Chinese companies face other obstacles. Julia Zhu, assistant vice president in the commercial marketing group of Citibank in Chicago, says US companies typically allocate spending in their budgets to research and marketing in China before they invest.She says “Chinese companies don't have this as part of their culture” when considering investments in the US. “It's something they have to learn.”Pin Ni, president of Wanxiang America Corporation, an automotive parts maker which has acquired five companies since establishing operations in Elgin, Illinois, over a decade ago, cites other obstacles. He says the company's biggest problem early on was dealing with US customers' fears that a Chinese company would fail to deliver on time, would produce products of inferior quality, or would always be selling cheaply.“The worst thing you could do is focus on being cheap,” he says. “That way you'll have very little margin and no money left for research and development. Respect the market and take care of customer fear that's the key.”But for Mermax's Mr Yan, the choice is clear between the US and Chinese style of business: “I like to do things this way. There are rules and you can follow them. In China, if you don't have the right guangxi, you're dead.”
635;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-03-09T22:31:58Z;Wall Street slides on inflation fears;;"Wall Street closed firmly lower on Wednesday after a spike in bond yields sparked a flight from equities.The leading US indices fell amid inflation fears, fuelled in part by the rising price of oil, which continued its march toward the $55 mark.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 10,805.25, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,207.21, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 2,061.29.Upbeat economic news and a record season for corporate earnings have been overshadowed by lingering doubts about the state of the US economy in recent sessions.A sharp sell-off in bonds underlined concerns that rising oil prices could prompt a more aggressive programme of interest rate rises from the US Federal Reserve. Many expect the Fed’s anti-inflation efforts to lead to a slowdown in corporate earnings growth later this year.Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said concerns over rising oil prices were overblown. He noted that oil prices had more than doubled since the S&P 500 reached its nadir in October 2002. The S&P has gained more than 56 per cent over the same period.“We have an economy that is still great,” said Mr Goldman. “However, it’s at its fourth year of expansion. We can’t rock and roll day in and day out.”Interest rate-sensitive stocks such as real estate groups and utilities took the brunt of investors’ ire. Prologis, the real estate investment trust, fell 4 per cent to $38.77. Con Edison, the utility company, fell 1.8 per cent to $41.71.Semiconductors also fell, in spite of an upbeat sales update from Xilinx.The world’s biggest maker of programmable computer chips raised its quarterly sales targets and said it was making progress clearing a backlog of inventory, but shares slipped 0.6 per cent to $31.27.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, rose 0.2 per cent to $24.84, however, as investors staked out positions ahead of a mid-quarter earnings update tomorrow.McDonald’s fell sharply after a downgrade by Credit Suisse First Boston. The company, which issued a disappointing sales update on Tuesday, lost 2.8 per cent to $32.53 and was the biggest loser on the Dow.Other fast food groups
also suffered. Yum! Brands, which owns the KFC and Taco Bell restaurant chains, fell 1.6 per cent to $50.23. Wendys, a rival, fell 2 per cent to close at $38.90.Shares in the International Securities Exchange, the New York-based options exchange, jumped 69 per cent to $30.40 on their first day of trading following
the group’s initial public offering.Energy companies also suffered in spite of rising oil prices.ExxonMobil fell 3.7 per cent even as it said it expected this year’s capital spending to surpass the record spending levels of 2004.Chemicals were mostly higher, but Kerr McGee slipped 2.2 per cent to $79.73 after it said it would sell its chemicals unit and buy back $1bn in shares. Dow Chemical rose 0.8 per cent to $55.99, while rivalMonsanto rose 0.4 per cent to $61.50."
636;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-03-08T23:17:36Z;Wall St slides after TI narrows guidance;;Wall Street stocks slid on Tuesday after a disappointing earnings update from Texas Instruments put pressure on semiconductor shares.By the closing bell, the Nasdaq Composite had lost 0.8 per cent to 2,073.55. The S&P 500 slipped 0.5 per cent to 1,219.40 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 10,912.62.The slide, which followed a mixed performance in the previous session, cast a further pall over a burgeoning rally that had appeared to be gathering strength late last week amid a fall-off in oil prices and an upbeat jobs report.The prospect of a slowdown in earnings and concerns about the sustainability of the US trade deficit have kept stock market gains in check this year, disappointing market watchers who had been hoping the sharp rally that closed out 2004 would continue through early 2005.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the market’s lacklustre performance was surprising given recent upward revisions to estimates for key economic indicators such as gross domestic product growth and business capital spending. “The fundamental things that drive performance have improved,” he said. “At some point you are going to see this market doing better as people recognise that the business conditions are better than expected.”Narrowed earnings guidance from Texas Instruments, the computer chip maker, provided much of the downward momentum. TI shares fell 3.8 per cent to $26.34. Other chipmakers also suffered. Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip maker, slipped 1.2 per cent to $24.80. Qualcomm, TI’s chief rival, gave back 2.9 per cent to $36.29 following Monday’s 5 per cent rise. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which tracks a basket of chip stocks, drifted 1.4 per cent lower to 435.44.McDonalds led shares in food groups lower. The fast food chain fell 2.1 per cent to $33.48 after it reported February same-store sales up just 1.6 per cent – its worst performance since 2003. Kroger, the grocery chain, fell 4.9 per cent to $16.85 after its quarterly losses widened.Las Vegas Sands, the casino and conventions group, weighed in with its maiden set of quarterly results following its meteoric initial public offering. LVS shares, which shot up more than 60 per cent on their first day of trading in December, fell 4.9 per cent to $47.35.The mergers and acquisitions buzz continued as Circuit City, the electronics retailer, rebuffed a takeover bid from Highfields, the Boston hedge fund, sending its shares down 2.7 per cent.Johnson Controls, the maker of car interiors, rose 3.2 per cent after it raised its second quarter guidance.Energy stocks were among the leading gainers as the price of oil resumed its climb above the $54 mark. Sunoco rose 2.1 per cent to $105.25.
637;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-03-08T20:25:16Z;Lex: BHP Billiton/WMC Resources;;Staff at McDonald's restaurants once asked: “D' you wanna super-size that?” The phrase could equally apply to takeover bids in the mining sector following BHP Billiton's A$9.2bn agreed offer for Australia's WMC Resources.The A$7.85 a share bid tops rival Xstrata's hostile approach by 12 per cent and is a 60 per cent premium to WMC's undisturbed share price.Expected net cost synergies, taxed and valued at a multiple of 10 times, cover only 21 per cent of the premium paid. Admittedly, WMC's value has risen since Xstrata's initial approach. Operational performance has improved, while drilling work has revealed further potential at its Olympic Dam project. WMC's defence included an independent valuation of its shares at between A$7.17 and A$8.24 albeit based on bullish long-term commodity price assumptions.Net present value calculations, BHP's favoured metric, are sensitive to these assumptions. At best NPV is subjective, but since BHP will not reveal its price forecasts, in this instance it is also opaque. Paying in cash rather than shares should also concern BHP investors who believe the commodity cycle is close to its peak. BHP says that its base case assumes that long-term real prices decline at 1.5-2 per cent a year, but that buying WMC creates options in the event of a “super-cycle”. The super-size cash price it is prepared to pay for this option suggests BHP is rather more bullish about a secular cycle of rising real prices than it cares to admit.
638;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-02-23T18:38:25Z;Food groups get taste of fear;;"Pam Murtaugh holds up some packaging with a picture of a seven-year old boy on it. He is relaxing in a ""video rocking chair"", which resembles a child's car seat but is curved so it can rock back and forth on the ground. He holds a television remote control. And he is clearly overweight.The box is evidence, says Ms Murtaugh, who owns a Wisconsin-based management consultancy, that obesity is so pervasive that household goods manufacturers are aiming products at the parents of overweight children.She was speaking last week at a conference on obesity organised in New York by UBS, the Swiss financial services group, aimed at assessing the impact of America's obesity problem on its food and drinks companies.""It is just such a clear statement of what's happening to us,"" she told the conference.While the issue of obesity in the US is clear - about 30 per cent of Americans can be considered obese - the legal implications for food and soft drinks companies are also clarifying.Companies such as General Mills, Kellogg's, McDonald's, Kraft Foods and Coca-Cola are at risk from tobacco-style obesity lawsuits even as they step up efforts to remove fatty ingredients from their products, embrace wholefood diet programmes and scale back advertising junk food to children, panellists at the conference warned.Attorneys-general in the US, encouraged by success against tobacco companies, now have the food companies in their sights.""The attorneys-general will be the cutting [edge] force in the obesity argument,"" says Stephen Merrill, a former governor and attorney-general of New Hampshire, now president of Bingham Consulting, a Washington DC group.He believes attorneys-general are willing to co-operate across states in the US to bring cases against another industry with ""deep pockets"". They are also armed with ""broad consumer powers without statutory back-up"", as well as the incentive of acting for clients on a contingent-fee basis.Discussion about obesity lawsuits died down after the dismissal in 2003 of a case brought by two New York teenagers against McDonald's, seeking billions of dollars in damages for allegedly hiding the health risks of Chicken McNuggets. But last month, the spectre of ""McLawsuits"" returned after a US appeals court re-opened part of the landmark Pelman vs McDonald's case, arguing it had been dismissed without hearing enough evidence. Specifically, there had been insufficient scope for ""discovery"" - the process of soliciting from plaintiffs and defendants documents and other testimony that might shed light on the case.Uppermost in the minds of food and soft drinks company management is likely to be whether there are similarities between tobacco and food that might encourage attorneys-general.Richard Berman, executive director of the Centre for Consumer Freedom, a non-profit coalition of restaurants, food companies and consumers, believes there is no correlation. He told the conference: ""The biggest problem tobacco ran into was that people began to perceive that tobacco companies were lying to them. I don't think we're there yet with food companies"". Others pointed out there is no ""safe"" tobacco, whereas there is plenty of harmless food.Indeed, opinion polls at the time of the Pelman v McDonald's case showed that more than 80 per cent of the US public thought the case was frivolous. McDonald's maintains it remains so, and says the issue is still personal choice over what we eat.However, attorneys-general, many of them elected, are sensitive to the possibility that public opinion could turn. In that case, they might feel more able to sway juries in any obesity cases, some panellists argued. Worryingly for the food companies, it seems that some parallels between tobacco and food can be drawn. One is that it was largely thanks to discovery that the tobacco companies were forced to settle, after incriminating evidence was made public.Richard Daynard, professor of law at Boston's Northeastern University, believes last month's decision to reopen part of the Pelman v McDonald's case to allow discovery was ""a tremendous step that says discovery is necessary"". He told the conference: ""Discovery in turn may provide materials that would help change public attitudes towards these cases.""Potentially more explosive is a link between children and vending machines in schools. The Centre for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group, says there are 3m snack foods and drink vending machines in the US - or one for every 100 people. Their widespread presence in schools has been blamed for contributing to childhood obesity.According to Mr Merrill, vending machines could provide the crucial ""hook"" attorneys-general may be looking for to launch cases: ""It is difficult to predict where the attorneys-general will go but the tobacco case became incendiary when children were tied to it.""Kenneth McClain, a lawyer with Missouri-based Humphrey, Farrington & McClain, says the fact that food and drinks companies were not acting to address the issue of easy access to vending machines by children was itself a basis of liability:""If health effects come forward, liability will attach over time.""Mr Merrill says attorneys- general were likely to focus on the cost to their states of maintaining Medicaid payments to low-income patients with obesity-related diseases: ""Attorney-general lawsuits remove the obese person from the litigation and substitute financial loss to the state's finances."" Obesity-related conditions were lifelong conditions ""with staggering costs"", he said. Medicaid pays regardless of fault. States will focus on whether the food industry's advertising and marketing adequately identified the risks of the product. Compensation would be calculated by looking at the advertising and marketing budgets of defendant companies as a way of gauging what a corporation should pay ""to redress the wrong"".Last month's decision to revisit one part of Pelman v McDonald's was followed by a flurry of announcements by food companies of healthier products, partly in response to new US government dietary guidelines. Hamburger chain Wendy's now has fruit at all its US restaurants, while Green Giant, the canned vegetable unit of General Mills, launched a web-based campaign called ""Mix-Up Dinner: Get Your Greens!"". But the move that won the most praise was Kraft Foods' voluntary pledge to stop advertising certain junk foods to the under-11s.At the meeting Laurian Unnevehr, professor in the department of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, did question the motivation of such moves. ""It is not clear whether this is a marketing strategy or a legal strategy to enable you to say 'I gave consumers the right choice'.""Mr Benson argues that changing menus and developing healthy food lines was not enough and that companies had to become more aggressive in countering attacks from obesity lobby groups: ""My concern is that, from a defence point of view, public opinion is a driver of outcomes in courtrooms. Companies have not figured out how to play offence on the public policy [area].""Whatever the tactics employed, Mr Merrill says, the issue had already assumed urgency. ""There seems to be a lack of appreciation that the train is already going down the track. The light at the end of the tunnel is the oncoming train.""OBESITY: THE PARALLELS WITH TOBACCO• It was largely thanks to “discovery” - soliciting relevant documents and other testimony from both sides - that the tobacco companies were forced to settle, after incriminating evidence was made public.
• The kids factor: potentially more explosive is a link that adds children and vending machines in schools to the mix:”the tobacco case became incendiary when children were tied to it”.
• How cases might be structured: attorneys-general would probably focus on the cost to individual US states of maintaining Medicaid payments to low-income patients with obesity-related diseases.
• More to digest: changing menus and developing healthy food lines may not be enough to head off legal action from obesity lobby groups: “public opinion is a driver of outcomes in courtrooms. Companies have not figured out how to play offence on the public policy [area].”"

But does the bluff cockney, who lacks a science degree, have the faintest notion of the particle physics underlying the functioning of his gadgets? One suspects not. Successful entrepreneurs with more than a smattering of O-levels are rare. As one apocryphally remarked: ""I have no qualifications to hold me back.""To be fair to the BCC, its beef is with the educational attainment of employees rather than employers. It wants the government to improve vocational training and careers services for young people, which sounds worthy. However, there is something fishy about the statistics used to justify its demands. The BCC says 43 per cent of companies complained of a skills shortage at the end of last year, against 29 per cent in 1994, an increase of roughly 50 per cent.The symmetry is with unemployment, as defined by the International Labour Organisation. In 1994, as the UK recovered from the post-Thatcher economic slowdown, this was about 9.5 per cent. By the end of last year the figure had halved. Perhaps the skills shortage complained of by BCC members is the fault of a tight labour market, instead of that perennial Aunt Sally, the nation's schools? Previous surveys have shown that hotel and leisure employers, who generally pay low wages, complain most about recruitment difficulties.The BCC's members may be partly to blame for their woes. They are mostly small to medium-sized enterprises, which have a low propensity to spend more on training when skills shortages are acute. A more common reaction is to try to pinch each other's workers by advertising vacancies more heavily. Big companies such as Asda and BMW rarely gripe about what thickos school leavers are. They just want bright, eager recruits they can train in-house. Strong brands and decent employment policies mean that is what they get.McGroundhog dayThe vindication of the McLibel Two in the European Court of Human Rights has reminded businesses how to behave if two scruffy strangers ever turn up outside their premises distributing insulting leaflets. Do offer them coffee and a sit-down. Do not, under any circumstances, sue them for libel.In the early 90s, McDonald's lost a 2½-year libel trial in the UK, costing the company an estimated £10m. It was on a technicality that the judge found against David Morris and Helen Steel, awarding the burger chain a few thousands in damages. To the public, McDonald's came across as a wealthy bully, setting its legal Dobermans on two naive campaigners rambling along the right of way that is freedom of speech.Yesterday, McDonald's lost again, even though it had no involvement in the European case. The finding that the McLibel Two were denied a right of fair trial by the UK legal system will suggest to many consumers - the only people who really matter - that even the company's Pyrrhic High Court victory has been disallowed. Possible tweaks to the libel system resulting from yesterday's ruling are of little consequence to business compared with the recapitulation in mile-high letters of the old salesman's adage ""never win an argument and lose a sale"".Brit awardsIt is Day Two of Notebook's campaign to defend Britishness. Heeding the call, Michael Howard has announced exciting proposals to test immigrants for HIV and TB. The Tory leader rightly surmises that foreigners seeking work are more likely to have horrid diseases than returning Brits, for example single chaps coming home after a break in exotic Bangkok. The focus of a Tory government would be those suspiciously swarthy types from outside the EU, not Gaston, the jolly French onion seller,Labour has been doing its bit for Notebook's campaign, giving the green light for the resumption of that traditional British rite of passage, the school trip. Pupils will once again enjoy such character-forming experiences as: tumbling off Snowdon in a blizzard; being sick on the coach coming back from the Jorvik Centre; and losing their virginity with Melanie Harbottle from 5B during the biology field trip. Sadly, the positive move has been offset by government plans to adulterate traditionally nutrition-free school meals with actual food. But two steps forward, one step back is still progress.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com"

641;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Fast-food sellers fear the fat will start suing them;;Ihop Corporation, a California-based restaurant chain offering pancakes and bacon-and-egg breakfasts, will soon start offering customers a pamphlet explaining the calorie and fat content of some of its foods.“We recognise that with this recent [obesity awareness] trend that we could be doing a better job providing information at the point of purchase,” says Stacy Roughan, director of investor relations.This week, hamburger chain Wendy's will offer fresh fruit with a low-fat strawberry yoghurt at all its US outlets.The fast-food industry's latest moves to make their menus healthier come amid fears of a possible resurgence of so-called Mclawsuits.Two years ago, a judge dismissed a case by teenagers claiming billions of dollars from McDonald's for allegedly misleading them into eating fattening foods. But last month, a federal appeals court ruled that the judge had dismissed the original lawsuit on the basis that the plaintiffs had not answered relevant questions such as what else the teenagers ate and whether they exercised.The appeals court, however, said such answers were “the sort of information that is appropriately the subject of discovery” the process of revealing documents and other evidence at a trial.John Banzhaf, an architect of legal action against the tobacco industry, said this meant plaintiffs could now demand that McDonald's hand over previously undisclosed documents. The plaintiffs could also seek depositions where officials must testify under oath.“What we're hoping is that these documents will be as effective and persuasive in encouraging juries to rule for the plaintiff as they were in persuading them to rule against the tobacco companies,” said Prof Banzhaf, a law professor at George Washington University Law School. However Cheryl Falvey, a lawyer with law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, disagreed.“Although the decision puts the fast food companies back in the frying pan, at least temporarily, it only allows the claims to survive procedurally for one more round of discovery,” she said. It was “still uncertain how far the trial court will allow discovery to progress before …considering dismissal for yet a third time.”She said the burden could lie with the plaintiffs to make further disclosures such as what else they ate before McDonald's should be sucked into making any further disclosures.That was because the teenagers never made any express allegation that they relied on a specific McDonald's advertisement in ordering their meals.Without such allegations, Ms Falvey says it would “be highly unlikely that it [a court] would force McDonald's to open up its documents”.According to McDonald's, the latest ruling was “strictly procedural” and “simply delays the inevitable conclusion that the case is without merit”.For some in the food industry, there are less technical issues. “It's a shame that the courts will now have to spend more time and money teaching a few money-hungry lawyers what the rest of us have known since kindergarten,” says Richard Berman, executive director of the Center for Consumer Freedom, a lobby group financed by the restaurant and food industry.“Individuals are responsible for their own food choices.”

It sold the Donatos Pizzeria business back to its founder in December 2003 for an undisclosed amount.McDonald's previously announced that it would limit development of Chipotle and its Boston Market chain to the US in order to ""remain sharply focused on revitalising sales and service"" at McDonald's restaurants outside the USLegg Mason said in a research note: ""Chipotle may be spun off soon, which is not a surprise to us, given the 400-unit chain's success and McDonald's focus on its core brands. We believe cash raised would eventually make its way back to shareholders in the form of an increased buyback.""McDonald's plans to announce a global program in the next six weeks that will include a new ad campaign and more health-oriented menu items.The fast food giant has been the recent target of anti-obesity litigation. Earlier this week a US appeals court ruled that McDonald's must face a suit by New York teenagers seeking billions of dollars for allegedly hiding the health risks of its Chicken McNuggets.McDonald's also on Friday reported fourth quarter net income of $397.9m, or 31 cents a share, from $125.7m, or 10 cents a share, the previous year.Earnings were affected by a change in the way the company accounts for leases. Excluding items, McDonald's earned 45 cents per share, a penny below analysts' estimates.Quarterly revenues increased 10 per cent to $5.01bn while comparable sales at restaurants open more than a year increased 5.1 per cent.Full-year earnings reached $2.27bn, or $1.79 per diluted share. Revenues rose 11 per cent to $19bn. McDonald's forecast system-wide sales and revenue growth of 3 to 5 per cent and operating income growth of 6 to 7 per cent.

643;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2005-01-27T18:23:09Z;Just what has capitalism done for football?;;"It's time to remind ourselves of that line from the old Ealing film classic, 'The Life of Brian Moore': ""Just what has capitalism done for football?""We know the answers: an improved standard of football, players from abroad we could only once have dreamed of seeing, better stadiums, McDonald's, pizza, and Coke served where before there were only Percy Dalton's roasted peanuts…. oh, and the most boring Premiership season in living memory.That does not say a great deal, given that the Premiership is only a dozen years old, but the pattern is set. Last season we had Arsenal go through it unbeaten, with momentary excitement when a few draws suggested they might perhaps lose a game. This time Chelsea look set to defy gravity and do enough to win the title, and every other competition they have gone in for.Their coach Jose Mourinho said at the start of the season that he saw no reason why a group of world class players, when told exactly what there roles were, couldn't conserve their resources sufficiently to keep on playing each and every match to the required level of success. So what we now see is even more two-dimensionally dull than when Liverpool dominated English football in the 1970s and 80s.Furthermore, Chelsea have surely already qualified for next season's Champions League and it also seems unlikely that Arsenal and Manchester United could falter in that quest. Thus the Premiership contains its ""superleague"", that will join those from other countries - with few surprises as to which teams will be among them - that each year compete for the continent's top prize.Thanks to the free market, football is imitating the inequalities that we see on a world scale. A few rich teams are at the top enjoying the big share of resources (and are always able to justify why they should have more), a significant group is caught in the purgatorial middle ground, with their hopes of rising matched by fears of sinking into oblivion, and the rest are at the bottom reduced to the status of collapsed states.As someone once said: 'What is to be Done?' First, look across the Atlantic to where they know about the vagaries of the market's hidden hand. The United States instinctively understands that if the fantasy of ""life as a game"" is to be maintained, then, above all else, sport must be fixed to be upliftingly competitive. Safety nets might be hard to find in society as a whole - and in our post-welfare ""Opportunity Society"" are being withdrawn - but for sport they have to be guaranteed.Just how the US idea of siphoning off players from the top sports' clubs each year to recycle them to the struggling teams ever slipped through the net of the Un-American Activities Committee, I'll never know. But it is something that should be adopted here before the fans en masse withdraw to Hackney Marshes and other ploughed parklands of the nation to watch a decently competitive level of the game.How would the mechanics of it work? Who knows? Rich clubs would object to giving handouts to the poor - claiming, no doubt, that it would be the last thing the poor themselves needed, and wanted, to improve themselves - while top players spoilt by the bright lights of North and West London would object to moving to West Bromwich.But the debate must begin. With neo-conservative thinking accepted as the casual norm these days, it is necessary for equally nutty ideas to rise up from what was once called the ""Left"" to match its influence. The harmless world of sport is a good place to start.Mack's backI made a point of settling into the sofa to watch last Saturday's racing from the wintry damp of Wincanton, a ""nice little card"", as the great man proclaimed it, and which welcomed back John McCririck to his rightful place on screen.Personally I'd tipped him to be still in the Big Brother house, and remain surprised he didn't go on to win. Ratings plummeted with his departure, but it was McCririck's ""in yer face"" way of having a laugh that proved too much for the world of post-modern irony, with its preference for wind-up telephone calls and sneaking up on old ladies on park benches.A lot of glee was had from the secret cameras in the dead of night picturing McCririck in his underpants picking his nose but, had he known he was being filmed, he'd have done it anyway. McCririck has been publicly humiliating himself for years and has maintained a lucrative freelance existence as a result.I worked with him on the London-based part of the ITV team covering the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Neither of us had much to do and it was his idea to go out with a camera crew and film him dressed in British vest and scant shorts running around the cinder track in Regent's Park, as if winning the 1,500m gold.It was never going to be pretty, and deteriorated when the crew was late in showing up. McCririck furiously expleted his way through the next half hour until it showed, shocking the crowd drawn to the track by a face that even then was one of the most recognisable in the country. Now he should find work for life.The mutterings from the eminent Scudamore stable, suggesting that McCririck's Big Brother escapades disgraced racing, are taken by some as a sign that Channel Four might ease him out. Fat chance. Without McCririck, TV steeplechasing's attractions would be limited to the Grand National, the Cheltenham Gold Cup and muddy afternoons at Wincanton.Over the AlmuniaSir Alex Ferguson was gracious in his refusal to slag off Manchester United's Tim Howard on Wednesday night after the keeper's ""gaffe"" had given the Carling Cup semi-final to Chelsea.This may have been less a supportive than self-serving exercise, of course, given that Sir Alex's chopping and changing of his keepers has done nothing for their confidence. But we must take him at face value, and assume that he recognises that these days a goalkeeper's lot is near impossible.As Howard's dilemma showed, the keeper now rarely knows when to come for a cross, given the bend that any player can put on the modern plastic ball. Had Howard advanced, inevitably - as he had anticipated - the briefest touch on the ball from an attacker's head would have directed it past him. As it was, everyone missed it and the ball looped straight in.The willingness to build a keeper's morale by giving him a good run in the first team is presumably behind Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger's determination to stick with Manuel Almunia. But for how much longer?There was a period late last year in the second half of Arsenal's important, and fortunately easy, Champions League home tie against Rosenborg of Trondheim when the demoralised Spanish keeper put in the most embarrassing performance of goalkeeping at Highbury that I have seen in getting on for 50 years.Retired goalkeeping sources close to Arsenal tear their hair out on such occasions and wonder why Wenger has tried virtually every option available to him, other than give Stuart Taylor - currently languishing on loan to Leicester - a decent run in the team.peter.chapman@ft.com"

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Cimarex shares fell 10.3 per cent to $36.06.Many investors view the oil and gas sector as ripe for further consolidation following a run-up in energy prices in 2004 that left many producers with healthy balance sheets and big cash piles.The S&P 500 energy index, which tracks 29 oil and gas stocks, has almost doubled in value since January 2002.An analyst at AG Edwards said: ""The majors got out of North America years ago, and now it's been the smaller companies that have begun developing resources that have once again become attractive.""Fast food companies brushed off a decision by a US appeals court to reinstate an obesity-related lawsuit against McDonald's.Shares in McDonald's, the world's biggest fast food chain, rose 0.2 per cent to $31.99. Yum!

Shares in the computer chip company jumped 7.3 per cent to $22.66.International Business Machines dipped 0.3 per cent to $91.95 after US lawmakersraised concerns about the proposed sale of its personal computer division to Lenovo, the Chinese computer group.SBC Communications,the second-largest US telecommunications group, rose 0.5 per cent to $24.58 in spite of lower earnings.Transport stocks led decliners in spite of afive-fold increase in quarterly profit at Norfolk Southern, the biggest US railway company. Norfolk shares fell 1.8 per cent t o $34.08.The S&P 500 transportation index rose more than 30 per cent in 2004 but has dropped 10 per cent from its December peak.Genentech, the biotechnology company, rose 2.1 per cent to $48.45 after Merrill Lynch offered upbeat comments on the company's earnings potential."
646;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Is the world falling out of love with US brands?;;"Joseph Nye, the Harvard academic who coined the phrase ""soft power"" to describe indirect US influence in the world, likes to recall the dining deliberations of a family in India to explain what he means.Asked what attracts them to McDonald's, the middle-class parent she cites suggest something more seductive than a Chicken Maharaja Mac and fries cooked in vegetable fat. They say they want to take the children out ""for a slice of America"".When burgers can stir such emotional aspirations, it is no accident that 64 of the most valuable 100 global brands, as measured by Interbrand, are owned by US companies. For more than half a century, the US and its products have stood for progress, glamour and freedom in the minds of consumers around the world.But Mr Nye sees a growing challenge for US companies in the attitudes of people such as John McInally, a Scottish management consultant living in Brussels, whose boycott of US products goes as far as asking that his four-year-old son not be given Coca-Cola at birthday parties.""I used to have a lot of respect for America; now there is mostly fear,"" says Mr McInally. ""You feel pretty powerless, but the one thing you can do is stop buying American products.""There is little doubt that there are more Mr McInallys in the world today than there were before Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay became household names. Poll after poll has shown that allegations of human rights abuses and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq have tarnished the international reputation of the US.But geopolitics is easily left behind when shoppers get to the till. Those activists who express their anger at the US through conscious boycotts of its companies remain a small minority.The bigger question worrying the business world is whether the opinion poll data point to a more subtle tarnishing of US brands in the minds of millions of ordinary consumers. If the American dream played such an important role in the growth of iconic US brands, what happens if significant numbers of consumers begin to think of the US as a bit of a nightmare?Mr Nye, a former dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and assistant secretary of defence in the Clinton administration, is one of many who are certain of the connection.""US brands have benefited from a sense that it is fashionable, chic and modern to be American,"" he says. ""The other side of that coin is when US policies become unpopular, there is a cost.""This kind of unconscious brand association is the lifeblood of the marketing industry, and those taking the threat most seriously tend to reside on Madison Avenue, home of New York advertising.Keith Reinhard, chairman of DDB Worldwide, an agency that counts McDonald's and Budweiser as clients, is leading Business for Diplomatic Action, a coalition of advertising executives and public relations consultants who want to fix brand America's problem.""That slice [of America] no longer looks so attractive,"" says Mr Reinhard. ""Foreigners are transferring anger at the US government to anger at the US and anger at US business.""Others question whether politics is affecting consumer behaviour. Why, they ask, are more companies not reporting it?Could it be the era of one-size-fits-all global brands, rather than US dominance of consumer markets, that is coming to an end?Earl Taylor, chief marketing officer of the Marketing Science Institute, a US think-tank, is typical of the sceptics. ""Consumers are able to compartmentalise the brands of a country from its foreign policy,"" he says. ""If there was a simple relationship between US brands and foreign policy we would have seen it decades ago.""Until recently, US companies have either tended to agree or stayed out of the argument.But there is growing evidence that this is a problem they cannot afford to ignore. In European markets such as Germany and France many iconic US names - Coca-Cola, Marlboro, McDonald's, Wal-Mart, Disney, Gap - have reported weak or falling sales, though each blames other local factors.Corporate America is not admitting to an image problem just yet, but some companies are at least beginning to talk about it. McDonald's, for example, recently agreed to join the board of Business for Diplomatic Action. It is also expected to co-host a seminar in March at Hamburger University, its management training centre, to discuss how US companies can be better ""world citizens"".John McNeel, an advertising executive at TBWA Worldwide, says the restaurant group's concern comes as no surprise: ""McDonald's is a very vulnerable brand i n this context - not only is it closely associated with America but they have fixed assets all over the world.""PepsiCo, the soft drinks group, also recently joined Business for Diplomatic Action in sponsoring a travel guide for US college students, which aims to help curb the image of the ""ugly American"" abroad.One reason for the growing business interest in this kind of project is that market research increasingly proves the link between politics and brands.Early signs of trouble appeared in a 2003 study of ""power brands"" by Roper, the market researcher, which showed popularity scores for leading US companies had slipped. NOP World found similar evidence suggesting that US companies were seen as less trustworthy and honest after the Iraq war.The strongest evidence yet of a link between politics and consumer behaviour was supplied by Global Market Insite (GMI), an independent Seattle polling group, which surveyed 8,000 consumers in eight countries over several months in 2004. In December, one-fifth of the Europeans and Canadians in its sample said their anger over US foreign policy would deter them from buying US brands [see chart].Of course, what people tell pollsters and what people do in the privacy of the shopping mall can be two entirely different things. But if even a fraction of these people act out their frustration, a significant potential market is lost.Most interesting is work carried out by Research International, part of British media group WPP. Its study of Latin American consumers in 2003 supported the idea that you could hate the US but still support its brands. But a repeat of the study carried out this year had gloomier findings, particularly in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.""The news is not all bad for US brands but we have demonstrated that younger people in particular react to [US brands] more negatively,"" it said.Tom Miller, formerly a pollster with NOP World, is one of many in the profession who feel it is only a matter of time before such attitudes begin to make a serious dent in business performance.""Sales can be a lagging indicator, but no matter how you look at this, it's not good news,"" he says.Not all brands are treated the same, of course. GMI's data [see scatter graph] show that companies such as Kodak, Kleenex, Visa and Gillette are simply not perceived as American. Users of Microsoft software might know its heritage but have few alternatives.Technology companies also seem immune - as the worldwide success of Apple's iPod and the Chinese purchase of IBM's consumer PC business demonstrate.But among those consumer companies perceived as American, and vulnerable to boycotts there is a remarkably consistent set of problems in the countries that have seen the biggest swing in public opinion. Coca-Cola, which makes 80 per cent of its profits outside North America, sold 16 per cent less beverages to Germans in the third quarter of 2004 than a year previously. McDonald's blamed falling German sales for virtually eliminating growth across Europe. And Altria sold 24.5 per cent fewer Marlboro cigarettes in France and 18.7 per cent fewer in Germany during the third quarter.In each instance other factors play a role. The falling dollar will also mask problems by inflating repatriated profits and lowering the cost of exports.Marlboro, for example, blames tax changes that encourage customers to trade down to cheaper brands. Coke says German bottling laws have a similar effect. But neither seems able to overcome such obstacles as well as it used to.Some companies say they do not lose much sleep over political factors that are outside their control. ""What could we do anyway?,"" asks one Altria executive. ""Fly the French flag? Tell them it wasn't us that boycotted their wine?""Most importantly, some European companies such as Unilever and Nestlé have experienced their own problems with weak consumer spending.""It's too simplistic to say [that] what's happened in Europe is just a function of anti-Americanism"", says John Quelch, a professor at Harvard Business School and a leading sceptic about the link between politics and consumer behaviour. ""The economic downturn is particularly important in the case of global brands because consumers do not want to pay a premium price and will switch to local brands and private labels.""Yet it is not just discount brands that have been gaining at the expense of American rivals.Swiss private banks claim to be winning savings business from US competitors such as Citigroup in the Middle East, France and Germany. Some rich individuals are said to be concerned at the unpredictability of US foreign policy and risk of asset seizures - a direct threat to the reputation of the US financial system for fairness.Foreign airlines benefit from the fear of terrorist attacks on carriers with strong US associations. Air Canada says it has seen an upsurge in business passengers opting to fly via Canada rather than brave the notorious US visa system.Similar obstacles for overseas students erode US soft power by encouraging them to enrol at British or Canadian universities.Even US hotels abroad now fear being seen as terrorist targets. Barry Sternlicht, executive chairman of Starwood - which owns Sheraton - was one of the first business leaders to speak out on anti-Americanism this year: ""Our politicians must remember that our businesses are global and we rely heavily on trade and tourism.""For many multinationals, the answer increasingly seems to be to downplay any US heritage or even a single global identity.Neville Isdell, new chief executive of Coca-Cola, is typical of many business leaders who work hard to stress local credentials with sports sponsorship and customised advertising. ""We are not an American brand,"" he says.Starbucks, the coffee chain, has thrived by making more of its products' associations with the developing world than of its own Seattle heritage.But Doug Holt, professor of marketing at the Saïd School of Business in Oxford, cautions against running away from historic roots entirely. ""Local is not always better,"" he warns. ""People assign value to brands that have succeeded globally; that's why multinational companies do so well.""If nothing else, the trend reveals a declining confidence in the aspirational pull of the US. Simon Anholt, author of Brand America, sums up how far the US has slipped from its pedestal: ""The world's love affair with America isn't exactly over, but it has stopped being a blind and unquestioning kind of love.""‘Cool would come from Tokyo rather than LA’US brands face a new threat in Asia. But it has less to do with the policies of President George W. Bush than with the preferences of consumers such as Han Yue, a 21-year-old native of Shenyang, China, who has moved to Singapore to learn about the property business, writes Gary Silverman.Shopping on Singapore’s bustling Orchard Road, Ms Han makes clear that she looks to other Asian countries for her cultural cues. She is not hostile to US brands: some even strike her as “sexy”. She just prefers fashions from Japan.”I think they are very cute,” she says. “They look very young.”Ms Han’s cultural sensibility is important. Marketing services executives see little evidence that the war in Iraq is provoking an overt backlash among Asian consumers. But they do see signs that some consumers are increasingly indifferent to US brands and are paying great attention to Asian trends and products.“Japan is really what people are looking at for quality and relevance,” says Andy Wilson, regional planning director in Asia-Pacific for the Ogilvy Mather advertising agency. “Cool would definitely come from Tokyo rather than Los Angeles.”The growing interest in Asian labels is a challenge for US brands, but not an insurmountable one. Across the street from Ms Han, a sign in the window of a Levi’s st ore on Orchard Road proclaims that “iconic American jeanswear” can be found inside. If the image of the US has been tarnished, there is no sign of it on the rear ends of Singaporeans. Levi’s commands 85 per cent of the country’s premium jeans market, says Charles Wigley, strategic planning director for the BBH advertising agency in Asia.Mr Wigley says that kind of market dominance is difficult in the west, where young trendsetters often abandon products because they are popular. By contrast, consumers in Asia still see brands as guarantors of reliability. “There is still a good deal of comfort and attraction in brands in Asia,” says Linda Locke, regional creative director for the Leo Burnett advertising agency.Also, US brands have done an artful job of blurring their ties to their home market. Last year, a survey by Leo Burnett in China, India, Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines found that 49 per cent of respondents saw Coca-Cola as a global brand. Only 31 per cent viewed it as American and 15 per cent considered it to be local.Since the Iraq war, Ms Locke says, US brands have been trying to stress their ties to local producers and franchise owners. For example, McDonald’s has been running advertisements celebrating the lives of people in Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim country.Maurice Levy, chief executive of Publicis, the marketing services group, says he has yet to see “an important sign” that the Iraq war is seriously harming western brands in Asia. “It is more a subject of debate between intellectuals than something that is hampering the development of these brands with consumers,” he says.The danger for US companies is that they will fail to appreciate the growing self-assurance of consumers in markets such as China or India. This increasing confidence could translate into a growing tendency to take offence at cultural slights.This month, China banned a Nike advertisement that depicted US basketball star, LeBron James, defeating a kung fu master and other Chinese cultural icons in a video game-style battle.China said the advertisement was offensive. Advertising executives suggested Nike erred by not letting the home side win. BBH got a better response with a Levi’s advertisement that showed an Asian man facing down a street full of mean-looking westerners. “We have to be very careful about advertising in these countries,” Mr Levy said. “We know cultural things are very touchy.”"
647;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-12-10T15:44:13Z;What is compensation culture?;;Compensation culture was popularised in the US in the 1990s after cases such as that of Stella Liebeck, an elderly woman who in 1992 was awarded $2.9m in damages by a jury after spilling a cup of hot McDonald's coffee on her lap, scalding her legs.If the number of accident claims is going down, why are my premiums going up?Big insurers say they make no money on liability insurance so they can't be profiting from continual rises in premiums. In fact, they say, most liability insurers pay £1.10 for every £1.00 paid in premiums. They argue that “vexatious and frivolous” claims have driven up liability premiums and led to an explosion in claimant costs. Fuelling this, the insurers add, are “claims farmers” and “no win no fee” lawyers who take on all types of case regardless of their merit.Research from Datamonitor this week backed this view by saying that soaring legal fees and medical advances have pushed up the overall cost of claims by almost 10 per cent to about £7.2bn in 2004. The advances are unearthing new diseases and health problems over which to launch claims.Lawyers are sceptical of the insurers' focus on legal costs, when the fairness of fees can be challenged in court. They also say the industry could be more transparent about its premium policies. The government has also raised an eyebrow at insurers, saying all too often increases in premiums are often “unjustifiably” blamed on a rising number of claims or the compensation culture. Sceptics, such as journalist and academic George Monbiot, also believe that insurers use compensation culture as a “convenient bogeyman”. That is because it allows big business to associate many victims such as thousands of asbestosis sufferers with “scroungers and conmen”.What's stopping us from going down the same route as the US?The Better Regulation Task Force, which prepared a report on compensation culture for the government, identified several reasons why US-style litigation wouldn't take off in the UK:■ Juries, which are often more sympathetic to a claimant, are seldom used in civil cases here, unlike in the US.■ Punitive damages, which have been large in the US, can be awarded only in limited circumstances here.■ The UK has measures to weed out vexatious claims such as pre-action disclosure and a requirement to consider mediation. In spite of these measures, the government admits that there is a widespread belief here that a compensdation culture exists. The prevalence of advertising by claims farmers promoting the “have a go culture” and the arrival of mobile X-ray clinics, which screen people for asbestos-related diseases in shopping centre car parks in the north of England, were said to be signs of a creeping US-style litigation culture.How are other countries dealing with this?The insurance industry has focused on the Irish Republic which has put in place legislative changes to restrain the growth of premiums which were the among the highest in Europe, particularly in motor insurance. Axa UK, which has a large presence in the Irish market, says the number of compensation claims in Ireland fell by 20 per cent in the first six months of 2003 following a government clampdown on fraudulent claims and other measures, such as the banning of “no win no fee” advertising.In the same year the Irish government also set up the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which requires all parties to appear before an independent board without lawyers.Australia has also taken measures to tackle the level of its compensation payouts, which in 2000 were almost twice as much relative to GDP as in the UK. The Australian government has curbed the right to sue for pain and suffering which has lead to a fall in claims for injuries such as dog bites.What's changing here?The government has recently warned claims management companies and “no win, no fee” firms that they face regulation if they can't improve their practices. The government has taken steps to discourage “have a go” ads in hospitals and is working with insurers to make premium costs more transparent and more closely aligned with risk in some sectors.Meanwhile, insurers suggest that one way to modernise and simplify the system would be to concentrate first on the medical treatment of claimants, before compensation is discussed. Norwich Union has recently suggested that personal injury claims of less than £1,000 which might be for bruises and cuts should be excluded from compensation claims.
648;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-11-24T19:00:03Z;Children are off the menu for marketers;;"Food and drink marketers are digesting the contents of the government's white paper on public health. They are now aware that some form of limitation on advertising their products to children is a real possibility from 2007.Matthew Howe, McDonald's UK senior vice-president, told last Thursday's annual conference of the Advertising Association's Food Advertising Unit that ""in spite of our combined efforts, we seem to be losing the argument"".Conscious of the sensitivity over marketing to children, advertisers have already been booking fewer advertisements among children's TV programmes. There was a 22 per cent reduction year on year in numbers of advertisements booked into children's programmes for food, drink and chain restaurants in September, according to Nielsen Media Research.Coca-Cola is the highest-profile example of this strategy. It announced in November 2003 that it would be no longer be advertising during the traditional times that children watch TV, during the day and after school.Many marketers have simply chosen to maintain a very low profile on the issue. Some manufacturers are reformulating products with lower salt and sugar levels, conscious that advertising a product that a pressure group could deem unhealthy is a commercial risk.The furore that surrounded Cadbury in 2003 when it tried to launch a campaign that combined a healthy living message with a voucher-collection scheme has also scared a lot of marketers away from considering any active contribution to the debate. The confectionery and soft drink maker was upset by criticism of the promotion, which encouraged children to save chocolate wrappers in exchange for school sports equipment.But some, like McDonald's and Asda, the supermarket chain, have been looking at how they can direct healthy eating messages at children - one of the government's suggestions.McDonald's introduced Ronald McDonald magazine for UK children late last year, having introduced a comic in 19 European countries the year before. Using cartoons, puzzles and word games, it focuses on encouraging children to eat more fruit and vegetables and to play sports. Produced by specialist children's magazine publisher Egmont Magazines, it was designed ""as a fun way of improving children's literacy, numeracy and creativity, while talking about balanced diets"", says McDonald's.In August 2003, the company introduced children to the ""Yum Chums"" in a series of two-minute advertisements produced by the advertising agency Leo Burnett. A set of characters formed from fruit and vegetables dance around and sing about the importance of eating fruit and vegetables. They are introduced by Ronald McDonald. Mr Howe says: ""Children connect with Ronald - he attracts attention."" The advertisement was shown every day at the same time throughout the month on children's TV channel Nick Junior, placed around educational show Blue's Clues. A new ad was introduced each week, moving the action on like a programme series.The idea is not a new one for McDonald's. In the US, its old Willie Munchright character has been given a new lease on life to tell children about balanced diets in similarly styled ads. He has also been supplied for free to the New Zealand government to promote its own healthy eating messages to children.Mr Howe says he is aware that consumers are cynical about McDonald's motives for introducing these types of health education initiatives, but he believes the company's commitment to the strategy will eventually win people over. ""We are realistic - we will only be taken at face value when we have shown that we are willing to stay the course.""The company is still refining the execution of the strategy. Yum Chums are currently being reworked to bring in more humour to appeal to older children, while the Ronald McDonald magazine's frequency and format is being reviewed.Asda has introduced more child-oriented copy in its customer magazine. The title is read by many children, but the strategy has been to focus on mothers as ""gatekeepers"", says Gerri Richards, group publishing director of Asda's customer publishing agency, Publicis Blueprint. ""Most food manufacturers are wary of targeting children directly - it's far better to talk to children via the mums.""Asda recently ran a competition in the magazine asking children to think up a new character for the ""Garden Gan"" - bags of chopped fruit and vegetables in small portions - which elicited the highest number of competition entries the magazine had ever had.Experts in marketing to children say that targeting parents using media that they can absorb with their children is the safest territory for food and drink marketers at the moment.""In the long term I can see marketers moving more of their budgets towards marketing to families rather than just children,"" says Dave Lawrence, planning director at UK-based Logistix Kids. ""Parents are more relaxed if they are involved in the message their children are receiving - it is the campaigns using media that target children directly, like texting, the internet and competitions on their mobile phones, that bother parents the most."""
649;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-11-23T21:55:59Z;Lex: McDonalds;;"The end of Charlie Bell's brief tenure as McDonald's chief executive is a personal tragedy. Despite losing Mr Bell's admired leadership, however, it should not be a tragedy for the company. Luckily for McDonald's, Mr Bell and Jim Cantalupo, his predecessor, had time to change the company's course. The results of their efforts are only beginning to surface.The emphasis has shifted from opening new restaurants to getting more customers into existing ones. Marketing efforts have been sharpened, and menus adjusted to suit changing tastes. The effects are clearest in the US. Comparable sales in October increased 7.5 per cent over October 2003 sales, which were already 15.1 per cent higher than the year before. Seeing such progress, investors want more of the same rather than radical change. That justifies the company's ""steady as she goes"" response to Mr Bell's departure. McDonald's named Jim Skinner, an experienced insider, as chief executive. A new number two, Mike Roberts, also emerged from the company's strong management bench.McDonald's handled Mr Bell's departure well, as it did the sudden death of Mr Cantalupo in April. Investors reacted with relief. The new team, though, still has work to do. European growth remains slow, especially in Germany. Measures that have helped turn the US business around have not, so far, delivered the same results in Europe. Mr Bell's enthusiasm helped set a new direction. Investors will be hoping Mr Skinner can reap all the potential rewards."
650;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-11-23T21:44:17Z;Strong finish for Wall Street;;"US stocks played seesaw with crude prices once again on Tuesday, rallying off earlier lows to end flat after oil prices retreated.Analysts said thin trading volume was likely to exaggerate all market moves this week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.03 per cent off to 10,492.60, while the broader S&P 500 index shed 0.03 per cent to 1,176.94. The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 0.04 per cent to 2,084.28.Crude oil closed just under $49 a barrel. Earlier, oil prices rose above $50 per barrel in morning trade amid concerns about lower reserves of heating oil as cold weather was forecast in the US northeast.In addition to rising oil prices, the falling dollar also weighed on stocks as it reached a new low against the euro. The dollar's decline has highlighted long-standing concerns about the potential effects of massive trade and fiscal deficits in the US.While it increases the competitiveness of US exporters, the weak dollar can also make those companies' earnings look better than they are, potentially causing investors to question the prices they pay for those shares.Stephen Carl, head trader at Williams Capital, cautioned against overinterpreting yesterday's decline. He said investors could be closing positions ahead of a slow day today before Thanksgiving tomorrow and a short session on Friday.However, technical analysts have warned that a failure to put more volume behind the current rally might cause it to run out of steam, especially if crude oil resumes its rise. But just as low volume dents the credibility of an advance, it also exaggerates a retrenchment.Shares in McDonald's were up 2.5 per cent to $30.10 after the company announced that its chief executive had stepped down owing to health concerns after only seven months in the job. A replacement was appointed swiftly.Among technology shares, Intel eased 3 per cent to $23.37 after the stock received a downgrade to ""underperform"" from analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston. Its rival LSI Logic fell 2.1 per cent to $5.60.Shares in Computer Network Technology surged 17.3 per cent to $5.63 on an upgrade by Bear Stearns analysts to ""peer perform"" from ""underperform"".In the same sector, and also among Dow stocks, Hewlett-Packard shares eased 0.2 per cent to $20.16 after the computer company told US regulators it was expecting to incur $200m from job cuts in the first half of next year.The higher price of crude oil buoyed ExxonMobil by 0.6 per cent to $51.21 but hit stocks such as Delta Air Lines, which fell 0.9 per cent to $6.55.Boeing shares were up 0.7 per cent to $54.33 despite reports that the aerospace company faces competition for its planned ""Dreamliner"" commercial jet from Airbus, its European rival.Meanwhile, shares in Time-Warner rose 2.8 per cent to $17.94 amid reports that the media conglomerate was close to settling charges of accounting irregularities at its internet division for $750m.TiVo, the maker of digital-recording technology for cable companies and consumers, saw its shares lose 11.6 per cent to $5.20 after it warned of a wider loss than previously expected in the fourth quarter.Among retailers, Mothers Work reported a quarterly loss for its fourth quarter, saying that oversupply of the maternity clothing it makes had led to depressed profit margins. Its shares fell 21.2 per cent to $13.85.HJ Heinz, the food company best known for its tomato ketchup, saw its shares give up 1.6 per cent to $37.78 after it reported rising net profits but missed analysts' estimates.Deere & Co, the tractor maker, reported results that exceeded analyst estimates thanks to strong sales, sending its shares 2.2 per cent up to $70.21 by mid-afternoon.Also reporting results, but to less upbeat reception, Dycom Industries had a 14 per cent tumble to $29.80 after it warned of declining revenue in its next quarter.In merger-and-acquisition news, Penn Virginia shares rose 3 per cent to $48.01 after the company announced it would buy a natural gas company from Cantera Resources.US Steel was down 2.1 per cent to $47.97 after a UBS report said monthly short interest in US steel stocks was near four-year highs."
651;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-11-23T20:27:21Z;SBC seals Wi-Fi deals;;SBC Communications, the second largest US Baby Bell telephone group, announced deals with Barnes & Noble, the world's largest bookseller, and Avis, the car hire company to provide Wi-Fi wireless networking service to bookstores and Avis business center customers throughout the US.SBC said its 'FreedomLink' Wi-Fi service is now available at more than 600 Barnes & Noble bookstores across the US enabling the companies' customers to use their portable and handheld PCs to connect wirelessly to the Internet and corporate networks at speeds 50 to 100 times faster than a dial-up connection.Meanwhile, the telecommunications group said its Wi-Fi service will also be made available in up to 88 Avis locations at major airports throughout the nation by early 2005.The addition of Barnes & Noble bookstores turns SBC's FreedomLink Wi-Fi service into one of the nation's largest Wi-Fi networks, with more than 5,000 hotspot locations throughout the US.SBC already provides Wi-Fi service at many McDonald's restaurants and The UPS Stores and has set a target of operating more than 20,000 Wi-Fi hotspots by the end of 2006.The move reflects the growth of Wi-Fi 'hotspot' services throughout the US and Europe as a complimentary technology to traditional cellular phone and 3G data services and the growing willingness of the telecommunications operators to embarce Wi-Fi technology.In the US, wireless operators like T-Mobile USA and Sprint and fixed telecommunications operators including SBC and Verizon, have been steadily building the reach of their Wi-Fi hotspot networks in competition and sometimes partnership with independent operators and 'aggregators' including Boingo, Airpath and Wayport.Under the agreement with Barnes & Noble, the bookstore's customers can either sign up for an annual subscription to the FreedomLink service with unlimited access to all the SBC Wi-Fi hot spots for $19.95 a month, or opt for a 'pay-as-you-go' scheme for $3.95 per two-hour session.Last month SBC announced that as part of its 'bundling' strategy designed to encourage its customers to sign up for multiple telecommunications services, subscribers to SBC's broadband service dubbed SBC Yahoo DSL, will receive unlimited free access to SBC FreedomLink hot spots until mid April next year and pay just $2 a month with a one-year term commitment thereafter.
652;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-11-18T21:38:48Z;Wall Street stocks take a breather;;"Wall Street finished an uninspiring session marginally higher on Thursday as technology shares shrugged off a cautious outlook from Applied Materials and the broader market flirted with extending recent gains.By the close the S&P 500 index was 0.1 per cent up at 1,183.56. The Nasdaq Composite index inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,104.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent up at 10,572.55, mosrtly thanks to Altria Group.Stocks have enjoyed a prolonged rally and have yet to experience a retrenchment that even bulls admit will be needed before the market can climb further. Optimists say such a retreat would be healthy and see it only as a pause en route to further gains.The present rally has lasted 17 sessions and approaches the four consecutive weeks noted by some traders as the average lifespan of so-called buyer panic rallies, which the current rally resembles. During such advances, trading volumes rise alongside share prices, indicating that investors buy stocks motivated primarily by the fear of missing out on gains.However, Louise Yamada and Ron Daino of the technical research team at Smith Barney have pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reversed a medium-term sell indication into a buy signal. They add that all other equity market indices are giving similar signals and said their initial target for the Dow is 11,300, about 6.4 per cent from its level on Thursday.Among mostly tepid performances for Dow stocks, Altria Group shares put on 2.2 per cent to $58.70 after an upgrade by Goldman Sachs and Prudential analysts who were sceptical that a government lawsuit against the tobacco industry would succeed. Altria owns Philip Morris USA, the largest of the companies targeted.Elsewhere on the corporate news front, the shares of Applied Materials were 1.8 per cent higher at $17.65 after the chipmaker announced its best financial year since 2000 but warned that momentum was likely to peter out.Meanwhile Intel begged to differ as its chief executive officer said he saw ""improved performance"" for the first half of the next year. Shares put on 2 per cent to $24.80.News of a possible mad-cow disease case sent McDonald's shares 1.5 per cent lower to $29.95, alongside Tyson Foods, a beef processing company, which gave up 1.7 per cent to $16.63.The fallout from the global withdrawal of Merck's Vioxx drug threatened to spread to other drugs groups as a regulatory official told lawmakers in Congress other similar drugs needed to be monitored. The NYSE-listed shares of AstraZeneca fell 8.6 per cent to $40.34 while GlaxoSmithKline's US-listed shares lost 3.22. Merck's stock saw limited action while Pfizer's was fractionally lower.Genesco was one of a latest batch of retailers this week to report quarterly results and saw shares put on 9.8 per cent to $29.36, in one of the best showings at the New York Stock Exchange after the company said its Johnston & Murphy shoe brand helped it walk to higher profits and increase its outlook for the year.However, Claire's Stores sounded a less sanguine note for the upcoming quarter and saw shares put one of the worst performances at the Big Board, down 15.7 per cent to $22.45.Williams-Sonoma fared equally badly, down 6 per cent to $36.77 after the retailer of high-end houseware guided investors lower for the fourth quarter after it missed estimates with its results for the current quarter.Kmart shares staged a retreat after a sharp rally in the previous session when the company's $11bn merger with Sears was announced. Sears was 1.5 per cent up to $53.80 and Kmart gave up 4.9 per cent to $103.71.After the closing bell, investors will also get quarterly results from Gap, another clothing retailer. Gap shares were down 2 per cent to $22.54.The shares of Medtronic, the medical device maker, were 7 per cent lower at $48.65 after the company guided analysts towards the lower end of its range for third-quarter profits.Meanwhile Multimedia Games shares rebounded 5.4 per cent to $13.14 from sharp earlier falls after the casino games maker reported a 3 per cent decrease in profits.Salesforce.com, one of the most eagerly anticipated initial public offerings earlier this year, saw shares decline 14.5 per cent to $17.82 amid disappointment at the guidance given by the company after the Wednesday close. The news prompted a downgrade to ""underperform"" from ""neutral"" by Credit Suisse First Boston.On a more upbeat note, the shares of Netflix rose 14 per cent to $11.92 after the internet DVD rental company increased its forecasts for revenues and subscriber growth in the fourth quarter."
653;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-11-18T00:47:28Z;Bombers strike at Buenos Aires banks;;A security guard was killed on Wednesday as several homemade bombs exploded in branches of banks around Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital.No group claimed responsibility for the attacks and experts had no immediate idea regarding perpetrators or motives. But the explosions are likely to exacerbate a growing sensation in some circles that the government is struggling to maintain law and order in a country traditionally seen as among the safest in the world.One bomb exploded on Wednesday in a branch of Citibank, killing a male security guard and causing superficial damage. Police said they found another bomb in the same building but defused it before it could detonate. That attack was followed shortly afterwards by an explosion in Banco Galicia, a locally owned bank. Police detonated a third bomb in another Citibank branch.Since the country's economic collapse in December 2001, rising rates of crime particularly kidnappings have made security Argentines' first priority, according to opinion polls. At the same time, protests and roadblocks by groups of unemployed people known locally as piqueteros demanding more government handouts are on the increase again. According to Neuva Mayorá, a Buenos Aires think-tank, there were 94 roadblocks in October, compared with 63 in July.Wednesday's blasts follow attacks in August on a branch of Citibank and a branch of McDonald's, the fast-food chain, to protest at a brief visit by Rodrigo Rato, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Banks, particularly foreign-owned institutions, became one of the main targets of public outrage after the government announced a freeze on Argentines' accounts in a desperate attempt to avoid a run on banks in late 2001.For months after Argentina's economic collapse, default and then devaluation of the peso, depositors deprived of access to their savings hammered on the doors of financial institutions to demand their money. In response, many branches erected defences.
654;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-11-04T18:39:27Z;Richard Tomkins: Why Europe is rejecting US brands;;"How fortuitous. There I was, glumly predicting in this space a year ago that the golden age of global brands was over. Then, last week, I read in the FT that big US brands such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Marlboro were suffering a sales slump in what Donald Rumsfeld, US defence secretary, once described as ""old Europe"".I bear no personal malice towards big US brands, nor for that matter towards Mr Rumsfeld, but I am sure you will understand when I tell you that the story filled me with a momentary glow of smug self-satisfaction.The only problem is: to the extent that I was right at all a year ago, was it for the wrong reason?The question raised by last week's FT story was whether anti-American sentiment resulting from the Iraq war and the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib was adding to local difficulties that US brands were suffering in Germany, France and other European markets. US companies tend to dismiss this kind of talk, at least in public, but a study that came out in May this year gave credence to the idea.NOP World, a market research company that carries out an annual poll of 30,000 consumers in 30 countries outside North America, found in its latest survey that the growing support for American brands seen in earlier years had peaked and gone into decline. The proportion of interviewees saying that they liked American brands had gone down from 30 per cent the previous year to 29 per cent, while those saying that they used American brands had declined from 30 per cent to 27 per cent.The implication was clear: although the study was carried out before news of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse broke, the concatenation of America's militarism, its unilaterism on issues such as the Kyoto treaty on climate change and its high-profile series of corporate scandals had dented the country's image, and with it, the image of its consumer brands.A year earlier, my take had been a bit different. Then, too, many US brand owners were struggling. But I took this as a reaction to the ideas set out in 1983 by Harvard Business School's Theodore Levitt in his influential essay The Globalisation of Markets.Prof Levitt argued that, as improved communications and technology shrank the world, cultural preferences would disappear and people's tastes would converge. The corporations that stood to gain most from the trend were those that exploited the economics of simplicity and supplied this single, global market with standardised consumer products that were the same wherever they were sold.Sure enough, when the Berlin wall and other barriers to world trade came down, consumer products from the west, particularly the US, poured into the world's newly opened markets - and people long-denied the forbidden fruits of Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Marlboro eagerly lapped them up.In many countries, however, the novelty of these newly accessible global brands soon wore off. People of modest means found them far too expensive to buy on a regular basis. Consumers also started taking greater pride in their cultural identity, intensifying the preference for local, as opposed to global, products.In short, Prof Levitt turned out to be wrong. Although homogenisation did affect some product categories - mainly in the technology sector where functional attributes tend to count for more than emotional or cultural preferences - globalisation led not to monoculturalism and a convergence of tastes but to the emergence of a global culture embracing an enormous increase in the range of choices available to consumers. Now, people can buy products from all over the world, expressing their preferences and indeed their identities by choosing from a vast array of local, regional and global brands.On balance, I still think this increase in the range of choices and the fragmentation of tastes poses a greater threat to the likes of Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Marlboro than anti-American sentiment. I just do not believe that many people are in a frame of mind to think much about US foreign policy when they are thirsty and wondering which soft drink to buy.And there is evidence to back this up. According to a global brands survey involving 3,300 consumers in 41 countries cited in September's Harvard Business Review, people may say they are against American products - but when it comes to making purchasing decisions, anti-American sentiment has a negligible impact. The three factors that do matter are: quality (the idea that if a brand has become world-famous, it must be good); the sense that, by consuming a global brand, the user becomes part of a like-minded global community; and the extent of the brand owner's commitment to social responsibility.That said, if you were inventing a global brand today and could choose anywhere in the world as its country of origin, would you honestly pick the US? For a technology product, the answer might still be yes. But for a consumer product with greater emotional content?For as long as anyone can remember, the US has stood as a metaphor for freedom, tolerance and democracy, and American brands have been the beneficiaries of that image. Recent anti-American sentiment may be regarded as an aberration and insufficient to impinge much on America's underlying brand equity. But if the result of this week's US presidential election signals that the anti-American sentiment is likely to persist, it would be surprising if big US brand owners were not quietly wondering at what point their country of origin would become a liability instead of an asset.richard.tomkins@ft.com"

The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite lost 0 .7 per cent to 1,922.90.On the anniversary of the 1987 market crash, fears that worse was yet to come in Mr Spitzer's investigation of insurance brokers and health insurance groups chilled any early optimism from a falling crude oil price and encouraging results from several leading companies.Arthur Hogan, chief US markets analyst at Jefferies & Co, said: ""We're seeing the Spitzer effect on the insurance stocks, where the market is throwing the baby out with the bath water . Then there is the election …we don't like it being so close with two weeks to go, we're a forward pricing mechanism and we don't know what to price now.""He added that the sell-off was likely to be exaggerated and a rebound likely once markets got a clearer picture of the effects of Mr Spitzer's latest campaign against alleged corporat e malfeasance.Health insurance shares saw broad selling after one company confirmed it had received a subpoena from Mr Spitzer's office. The insurer in question, Cigna, saw shares trim 10.3 per cen t off their value to $59.73 as UnitedHealthcare lost 9.3 per cent to $66.50 while Aetna fell 11.8 per cent to $86.17.The insurance groups initially cited by Mr Spitzer continued to suffer as Marsh & McLennan was 5.8 per cent off at $24.10 while ACE lost 6.4 per cent to $33.10.The ""Spitzer effect"" trumped comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who said that ""household finances appear to be in reasonably good shape"". Some bearish market wa tchers have long warned about excessive household indebtedness in the US and a possible retrenchment in consumer demand.Among the key stocks battling the downward pressures on the the market yesterday was IBM, the world's biggest computer company, which saw shares rise 4 per cent to $89.37 after it reported after the market close on Monday. Flat net profit was eclipsed by the company's optimistic outlook, as net revenue rose 9 per cent in the quarter. Excluding costs associated with a legal settlement, net profit was b etter than forecasts.Texas Instruments,which also reported after the close on Monday, beat expectations with its quarterly earnings and its shares rose 6.9 per cent to $22.55.EMC shares rose 1.1 per cent to $12.28 after the data storage company reported an in-line 37 per cent rise in third-quarter profit as it gained market share.Ford Motor announced higher-than-expected quarterly profit as gains for the company's finance division offset losses at its auto unit. The company raised its full-year earnings outlook and the shares edged off 3.4 per cent to $12.93.Ford's news came after rival General Motors announced sharp cost-cutting decisions at its European operations in a bid to stem losses there. GM shares were 2.3 per cent lower at $38 on the Dow.Shares in McDonald's, another component of the blue-chip stock gauge, eased 0.7 per cent to $29 after the restaurant operator reported a 42 per cent rise in profits.Leapfrog Enterprises cut its quarterly earnings outlook and sent shares 34.1 per cent lower to $11.99 as the educational toy company cited a challenging industry environment.Boston Scientific shares lost 5.6 per cent to $35.71 as investors were disappointed by its guidance even after earnings grew amid strong demand for the group's medical devices.Economic news gave a mixed reading of the recovery in the US. Consumer prices rose by 0.2 per cent last month, taking the annualised inflation rate in September to 2.5 per cent, but a sharp jump in lodging costs pushed core inflation up a surprise 0.3 per cent.Stephen Gallagher, the chief US economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said the data were unlikely to cause the Fed to interrupt its course of steady increases in interest rates. He added that employment trends would be more important in that process."
656;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-10-18T17:36:58Z;Jonathan Guthrie: McDonald's can still serve profits;;The golden arches of McDonald's used to be a gold standard in franchising, in which private entrepreneurs and big brands work together in partnership. Buying a franchised restaurant was expensive, at up to £500,000. But the footfall was high and a few well-sited outlets could make returns running into millions for a shrewd franchisee.I visited the National Franchise Exhibition at the NEC a couple of weeks ago expecting that McDonald's would still enjoy a prime rating. A franchise removing scratches from cars might be fine for a redundant factory worker, I reckoned, as I checked out the stands. A franchise making souvenir casts of babies' feet could suit a stay-at-home mum seeking a pin money business, meanwhile. But McDonald's - whose reps at the exhibition were all busy with prospects - was the one for wannabe franchisees with ambition and capital. Right?Wrong, said veteran small business broker Ed Pendarvis, chairman of Sunbelt Business Advisors, who was over from the US for the show. He told me: “McDonald's is locked into low prices and rising costs. Other franchises are a better opportunity at present.” I heard the same view from any number of delegates unwilling to be named in print.The problem is the obesity scare, incarnated recently in Morgan Spurlock, star of Super Size Me. The documentary records Mr Spurlock's astonishing discovery that eating a lot of Big Macs makes you resemble an elephant seal in elastic-waisted trousers. Public worries about fatty food meant net profits stagnated last year at £118m for McDonald's UK, which has 470 franchised restaurants, 40 per cent of its total.The antithesis of Mr Spurlock is Jared S. Fogle. You can find a photo of him on the UK website of Subway, the US-based sandwich chain seen as Maccy D's roughage-dispensing nemesis. The svelte Mr Fogle is pictured brandishing a pair of elephant seal-sized strides and proclaiming: “I lost 245lbs eating at Subway!”With a similar symmetry, Mark Scott, national franchise manager at NatWest, sang the praises of Subway, not McDonald's, when I called him. He said: “Subway is the franchise we get the most enquiries about and the most funding requests for. And many existing franchisees are looking to open an additional 2-3, or even 4-7, outlets. That shows the network has a very positive story.” Subway has 350 UK stores, all franchises, and a target of 2,010 by 2010.Now, I have no downer on McDonald's. So I was reassured when a McDonald's spokesperson told me: “Our franchise opportunities are performing at the same level, if not better than before, and we have seen no drop-off in interest.”A Paxmanesque exchange ensued in which I repeated the question: “Have your franchise charges nevertheless softened?” in different tones of voice without eliciting a straight answer. The official eventually vouchsafed: “If you were the right candidate - but did not have capital - we could find an appropriate way of recruiting you as a franchisee.” That sounded like a cue for potential restaurant owners to haggle mightily.Even so, negativity towards the company created by marketing wizard Ray Kroc seems overdone. The US sales of McDonald's are recovering on the back of healthier menu options, according to a statement last Thursday. Europe remains tough, but Neil Black, who represents Subway franchisees in UK and Ireland, says magnanimously: “McDonald's is a big oil tanker which takes a long time to turn around. Anyone writing it off is very foolish.”Any franchise backed by a big brand is worth looking at because, according to Sir Bernard Ingham, president of the British Franchise Association, “between 93 and 95 per cent of franchises are profitable, and you cannot say that of any other sector of the economy”. Franchise businesses generate annual sales of £9.65bn, employ 330,000 and include names such as Bairstow Eves Countywide, Burger King, Levi's, Office Express, Pizza Express and a slew of hotels.As a franchisee you typically pay an upfront fee for your franchise, and a proportion of sales after that - for example, a Subway franchise costs $10,000, and then 8 per cent of turnover. Those fees generally buy you the information, support and equipment to open and run a business with a proven formula. Multi-franchising, or developing a territory as a master franchiser who recruits and manages other franchisees, is probably the most appealing option for managerial types. Martin Bell, 39, who runs seven outlets of Cartridge World, refilling and refurbishing printer cartridges to save computer users the extortionate cost of new ones, says: “I make a very comfortable living and have never had so much fun in my life.”The caveat from John Pratt, senior partner at Hamilton Pratt, a franchise law specialist, is that a franchise business may not suit the many entrepreneurs who hate authority. “You need flair, but you have to do what the franchisor wants,” he says. You must also be able to go out and sell hard, which some corporate refugees may find tough. As for businesses seeking to expand by franchising, Mr Pratt warns them to “avoid the temptation to recruit people with a pulse and a cheque book, and not much else”.A lack of bright franchisees is the problem most complained of by franchisors. It is a limitation to the sector's growth. So I am taking the claim of McDonald's that a busy exhibition stand equates to healthy franchisee recruitment with a pinch of salt. That does not mean a golden arches franchise is a bad deal: rather the reverse, I suspect. As contrarian investor Nathan Rothschild once put it, buy when the blood is running in the streets. Or in this case, the tomato ketchup.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
657;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-10-13T22:19:10Z;Overview: Volatile oil sets the agenda;;"Copper prices collapsed on Wednesday and oil prices reversed early falls, leading equity investors to overlook positive corporate news and sell stocks sharply lower.Crude oil futures turned round as concerns grew that weekly US inventory data, due today, would show a decline in heating oil stocks.Nymex November crude, which fell as low as $52.50 in intraday trade, settled $1.13 higher at $53.64. In London, Brent crude rose 45 cents to $50.05 after peaking at $51.50 on Tuesday.Copper prices plummeted in New York and London as the market was hit by what looked like unstoppable waves of fund and speculative selling. The price tumbled nearly 10 per cent in London, a decline of 12 per cent from near 16-year highs on Monday.Some dealers said the drop was exaggerated by the lack of traders on metals desks, which were left with skeleton staffs during London's Metal Exchange Week.While the commodity markets stepped back, European markets tried to put their best feet forward as investors digested a healthy diet of corporate results.Wall Street, however, found the headwinds too strong and turned tail as the oil price started to rise. Alcoa, the world's leading aluminium producer and a Dow component, was a significant decliner.Falls for Alcoa and Exxon Mobil more than offset positive sentiment generated by results from McDonald's, Intel and Yahoo, with the tech companies' figures meeting analysts' expectations and easing worries about a slowdown in the industry.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7 per cent to 10,002.30 and the Nasdaq shed 0.2 per cent to 1,920.53. The Conference Board, the private US research group, said yesterday that chief executives' confidence in the nation's economy had slipped for a second straight quarter.""CEO confidence has slipped considerably over the past two quarters as both current conditions and expectations have softened,"" said Lynn Franco, director of The Conference Board's Consumer Research Centre. ""However, nearly a third of CEOs have increased capital spending plans this year, with an increase in sales volume the most cited reason.""The early fall in oil prices and reassuring news from chip equipment maker ASML bolstered European markets, which had been on the slide for the previous five trading days. Miners, however, were a weak spot after JP Morgan cut its rating on the European sector, citing the potential for a global industrial slowdown. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index edged up 0.3 per cent.Weaker oil and metals prices hit shares in Asian resource companies, taking the shine off gains in technology issues after the upbeat overnight earnings reports from Intel and Yahoo in the US.Tokyo closed lower for a fourth consecutive day, with losses in oil prices dragging energy stocks down."
658;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-10-13T20:39:39Z;McDonald?s serves up 42% rise in earnings;;McDonald?s demonstrated the continuing strength of its US recovery on Wednesday, saying quarterly earnings would beat analysts' forecasts on the back of surprisingly buoyant US sales.The world's largest fast-food chain showed it was still reaping the benefits of new and healthier menu items including salads, chicken strips and ?deli? sandwiches, as well as efforts to improve service and quality standards.But sales in Europe were disappointing, raising questions about whether the US revitalisation can be repeated elsewhere.The company was not due to report third-quarter earnings until next week, but announced on Wednesday that net income would be up 42 per cent at 61 cents a share. Even subtracting a tax-related gain of 7 cents, underlying earnings of 54 cents beats Wall Street consensus forecasts by 5 cents.Quarterly comparable sales - which McDonald's defines as those from restaurants open at least 13 months - increased 8.5 per cent in the US, on the back of a 9.5 per cent increase in the same period in 2003.Comparable US sales for September were up 10.6 per cent - the 18th consecutive month of year-on-year gains - on top of a 10 per cent gain in September 2003.Sales growth had been expected to slow after McDonald's last May passed the first anniversary of its sales turning positive.The recovery has also continued in spite of the untimely death in April of Jim Cantalupo, former chief executive and co-architect of the turnround.His successor, Charlie Bell, who worked closely with Mr Cantalupo on revamping the company as chief operating officer, has also undergone surgery for colon cancer in recent months.Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst at Smith Barney, said the robust performance was due to improved products, including the national launch of Chicken Selects chicken strips, effective marketing and business momentum.The one weak spot, Mr Kalinowski added, was Europe. Comparable sales there grew only 0.3 per cent in the quarter, after a 0.1 per cent decline a year earlier.McDonald's blamed high unemployment and stagnant economic growth in several countries, especially Germany. But the flat sales are a disappointment, coming several months after the company introduced main-course salads similar to those that helped drive the US recovery.McDonald's has faced particular problems in the UK, where regulatory filings recently showed profits in 2003 from its 770 company-owned restaurants fell 71 per cent to ?24m ($43m), though that included restructuring charges.The company voiced concerns at an investor conference in New York last month that it was having less success in countering its ?unhealthy? image in the UK than it had in the US.
659;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-09-07T19:47:40Z;Notebook;;"Brown's Polish government in exileThroughout history there have been governments-in-exile. Gen Sikorski was prime minister of the Polish government-in-exile; Gen de Gaulle led the French one. But Britain today is a privileged witness to a new phenomenon; the first administration which is both in exile and in government at the same time.The leaders of the Brownite government-in-exile (titular head - General Fury) are spread far and wide, many still collaborating with the unrecognised Blairite administration.The resistance campaign that is waged by the Brownites-in-exile is an immensely subtle one which consists in persuading people that the government is a shambles save for those projects which are demonstrably attributable to the chancellor.In addition to disseminating Brownite propaganda through favoured media outlets and building alliances with other emigré groups, such as the Cookites, the key task is obviously directing the activities of resistance fighters on the ground.This means blowing up schemes the chancellor dislikes, rallying opposition to appointments which threaten the glorious emancipation and planning the political assassination of eminent Blairites. The prime minister's current plan to appoint the fanatical and trusted Alan Milburn as gauleiter of the Great Queen St party HQ has met particularly fierce opposition, though Mr Blair is now threatening to raze Brownite villages in retaliation.At the heart of the network is Ed Balls, the chancellor's right-hand man and former chief aide at the Treasury. He, like the newly banished Andrew Smith, is marking time until the inevitable liberation when they will drive down Whitehall in an open-topped Rover Sterling to the cheers of the crowd.Freed from his Treasury tasks, Mr Balls - who is waiting for the next election to become an MP - is now a salaried senior research fellow at the John Smith Institute, effectively the Brownite thinktank. He now sits in Grosvenor Gardens at a nexus of phone lines planning the takeover and geeing up his allies with news of the latest Blairite iniquity against the rightful leader. Blairites have long seen Mr Balls as a more zealous prosecutor of the conflict than his master.Inevitably there have been casualties. Nick Brown, the former chief whip and agriculture secretary, was defenestrated merely for his loyalty to Mr Brown (well, that and his disastrous oversight of the foot-and-mouth crisis). Charlie Whelan, one-time propaganda chief, was shot down over occupied territory after one too many raids on the enemy positions.Mr Blair himself vacillates between waging war and making overtures towards the exiles. Only on Tuesday at his monthly press conference he was singing the praises of Team GB - but it turns out he was talking about the British Olympic squad.Think smallEven before the film Supersize Me - an exposé of one man's suffering as he shoved down sufficient quantities of McDonald's food to render himself indistinguishable from a space-hopper - there was Supersue Me.That epic saw the junk food giant force-feeding similar amounts of legal medicine to two insignificant critics of its operation.The ensuing “McLibel” case was a spectacular PR disaster. The sledgehammer attempt to stop Helen Steel and David Morris distributing little leaflets outside one branch led to one of the country's longest-ever trials.McDonald's suffered the indignity of seeing its every worst practice laid bare in a 314-day court case in which it was clearly cast as the bad guy using teams of lawyers to crush a postman and a gardener.The pair returned to the fray on Tuesday arguing in the European Court of Human Rights that British libel law undermines their right to free speech by denying such little guys legal aid when sued by well-heeled multi-nationals. In the original trial the pair ending up defending themselves. It took years out of their life and they still owe McDonald's £40,000 in damages - although the once-bitten behemoth is evincing no urgency about securing payment.But the ECHR case does seem to have missed the real significance of the McLibel action. Far from lining up to crush individual campaigners under the weight of the law, companies have seen the damage such action can do their image and would need a lot of convincing to repeat the mistake.Couple this fear with the power of the internet, and it is pretty much open season on big corporations these days as long as the critic is small enough; the slogan for campaigners now is not so much Supersize Me as Undersize Me.Al-eatniliaAndy Gilchrist and his madras-munching mates at the Fire Brigades Union who ran up an £800 bill at a top Indian restaurant may not wish to know about a new model of direct action coming from Italy. A radical union is threatening a hunger strike in protest against Alitalia's planned job cuts - and it isn't even the union of airline food-tasters.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"
660;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-09-07T19:47:40Z;Observer - US;;"From Morgan Stanley with loveThe Studs effect continues at HSBC. Banking legend John Studzinski, who “retired” last year from Morgan Stanley at the ripe old age of 47 but promptly popped up to co-head HSBC's investment banking arm, has reeled in Danny Palmer from his old employer.Palmer will head equity capital markets, where HSBC has some serious catching up to do. Morgan Stanley is number one globally in ECM, according to Dealogic, to HSBC's 22.Palmer made a name for himself in London, pushing Morgan Stanley to top place in European convertible bonds before heading out to Hong Kong as Asia co-head of capital markets. At HSBC he will remain in Hong Kong.While HSBC is the second-biggest bank in the world, investment banking has never been its strong suit. Palmer's arrival suggests it is bent on changing that.Retail god?Evidently, Wal-Mart is not happy having half of Mexico's retail market. The discount chain is now building a store in the town of Teotihuacan, home to the spectacular 2,000-year-old pyramids an hour north of Mexico City.Although most Mexicans appreciate the chain's everyday low prices, a group of residents and small business owners is balking at the idea of seeing the powerhouse of consumer capitalism from the pyramids, where indigenous Mexicans and pagans venerate the ancient gods of the sun and the moon.Although the chain says the building will be discreet and carry the local Aurrera brand, perhaps it should take a hint from McDonald's, which was forced to abandon plans to open a franchise in Oaxaca's historic plaza. Or from Costco, which is still the target of shareholder resolutions after building on the site of the abandoned Casino de la Selva in Cuernavaca.Otherwise, they may face the wrath of those sun and moon worshippers who won't kneel before Mr Sam.Well engineeredMemo to BMW: try not to upset customers who have a flair for publicity.Chinese advertising executive and irate 7-series sedan owner Lin Jie has been giving the German carmaker all kinds of bad press with a bid to have three skinny donkeys tow his broken-down Beemer half way across the country for service.Local media quote Lin as saying the bid to tug the luxury car from Beijing to Hangzhou city was prompted by BMW's failure to fix a series of faults.Lin has been trying to enlist nationalism as well as donkey power in the dispute, setting out recently under a banner calling for the protection of “Chinese consumers' rights” - though police soon stopped the procession.Maybe BMW, which launched a Chinese production joint venture this year and sees the China market as a vital source of future growth, should be relieved that Lin is being so restrained.After all, one unusually vindictive Mercedes Benz owner in the central city of Wuhan won headlines a couple of years ago by having his sports car towed through the streets by a water buffalo - and then paying a team of workmen to smash it with sledgehammers.Speak softlyDoes believing in George W. Bush's convictions get you in trouble in Singapore? Chee Soon Juan, one of the city-state's most outspoken opposition politicians, has been accused of being a tool of foreign interests that want to “attack Singapore” by a libel lawyer for former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong.Chee “is acting in concert with foreign backers who will continue to fund him so long as he is prepared to be used by them to hurt Singapore,” said Davinder Singh, who is seeking $500,000 in damages for remarks Chee made in the 2001 election.What are these foreign interests? Singh didn't say, but it is no secret that Chee was recently a Reagan fellow at the Washington-based National Endowment for Democracy, one of Bush's favourite foundations.No word on where this leaves Singapore's policy of promoting closer military and economic ties with the US, which Lee and Goh backed . . .Unfriendly skiesThere was much gloom at Rome's Fiumicino airport yesterday as stunned staff at Alitalia absorbed the news that management wants to cut 5,000 jobs to try to save the airline.Their mood would not have been brightened had they heard what Roberto Castelli, Italy's justice minister, said about the company.On an internal Alitalia flight last week, Castelli commented that he had noticed quite a few seats were occupied by airline personnel being transferred from one airport to another.He didn't specify where the flight was, but in all likelihood it was between Rome and Milan. It is no secret that some Rome-based Alitalia staff take seats on early morning flights to Milan to start their day's work in northern Italy.Yet such bizarre arrangements aren't necessarily the fault of the airline. Rather, they reflect the endless political tug-of-war between northern Italy and Rome. Northern politicians want Milan to be Italy's hub, while those in Rome favour the capital; the result is that Alitalia loses money flying its personnel between the two.As Castelli remarked: “Alitalia's situation is not just beyond market reality, it's beyond reality itself.”Legal reform?George W. Bush made a point in his speech at the Republican Convention of making fun of his use of English. At a rally yesterday in Missouri, he proved this trait remains strong.“We need to do something about these frivolous lawsuits that are running up the cost of your health care and running good docs out of business,” he said in his stump speech.“We've got an issue in America. Too many good docs are getting out of business. Too many OB/GYNs [obstetricians/gynaecologists] aren't able to practice their love with women all across this country.” What kind of tort reform does Bush want?observer@ft.com"
661;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-09-02T20:22:28Z;Observer - US;;Carey chases the market downRupert Murdoch's decision to move News Corporation's primary listing from Australia to the US might be good for succession planning but it is costing Chase Carey, his trusty director, money.The newish boss of DirecTV isn't exactly short of a dollar, with a base salary of $2m and a guaranteed annual bonus of up to $3m if the compensation committee likes his work.But as part of the deal when he took over at DirecTV, owned 34 per cent by News Corp, Carey had to mollify institutional investors. They wanted him to tie his wealth to the satellite group, rather than the parent, by trading in his News Corp options, worth about $170m on paper.Carey agreed to exercise or cancel options over 5.3m News Corp shares, in exchange for a 1.88m options package over DirecTV shares.But News Corp's move to change its domicile from Australia has triggered a fall in both the preferred and ordinary shares. Since he started exercising options and selling preferred shares, Carey has seen the price of News Corp's American Depositary Receipts fall by 12 per cent, from $34.69 in May, to $30.30 at the most recent sale last week.And he still has about 1m options to go, under pressure to complete the tidying of the directors' register before the switch to a US listing.So far, Carey has cashed in about 2.8m options over stock worth about $69m and another 1.5m were cancelled at the end of July.Vestey interestBritish peer Lord Vestey, whose family once made money selling beef to McDonald's through its Dewhurst butchers business, has brought home the bacon again from a US buyer.Dewhurst went into receivership in 1995 but, in the up-and-down world of investment, Lord Vestey, with 100,000 shares, is one of a number of shareholders benefiting from the £125m ($223m) sale of KVault Software to Veritas of the US this week.Cazenove, the blue-blooded bank that had to write off its 1999 £3m strategic investment in online investment bank Wit Capital, made a much wiser move funding KVS at the seed capital stage at about the same time through its separate private equity fund.It stayed with the business through rounds of funding worth a total of £23m and will now exit with KVS achieving more than five times that figure through the all-cash offer.KVS is also the latest example of venture capital group Index Ventures' impressive track record in technology investments. It has been an early-stage investor in Skype, the hot internet voice call start-up, the Betfair betting exchange and MySQL, the open-source database.“I knew there were a lot of highly promising European tech companies when I moved here [from Silicon Valley],” says Index partner Danny Rimer. “The deals over the last year prove this - before KVS, Kelkoo [comparison shopping], Suse [Linux], Espotting [search] and Jamba! [wireless] were all bought at a premium by their US brethren.”Gucci rapRobert Polet, the new head of Gucci, is evidently a bit of a ladies' man. Speaking near the end of a mind-numbingly long meeting of parent company PPR with analysts and journalists, he spoke of his pride in his new staff.The 49-year-old former head of ice-creams at Unilever demonstrated his cool by enthusing about a Gucci meeting where “80 per cent of people were lay-deez and the average age was 33”. Just when the assembled masses thought it must be a joke, DJ Polet continued: “These lay-deez are tough cookies.”Even the tough cookies cringed a bit at that.Home from homeAlfonso Portillo has chosen an odd place to seek refuge. Guatemala's past president went into self-imposed exile just after his term ended in January, fleeing to Mexico amid allegations of rampant corruption under his rule.Portillo, who this month secured a work visa, will be employed by a friend's construction company in Guerrero. Piquantly, Portillo fled that state in his youth in order to avoid trial for double murder.Five years ago, Portillo acknowledged killing two men in a 1982 brawl while he was a student in Guerrero. He claimed the killings were in self-defence and that he fled because, at the time, he believed he would not get a fair trial. A judge later dismissed the case.Observer hears Portillo will be living mainly in Mexico City and won't need to travel much to Guerrero. That's fortunate. In a state with the lawlessness of the Wild West, it wouldn't be good to run into people who might remember that brawl.Old TinersWhen Santander Central Hispano executives recently met the UK regulator to discuss its move on local bank Abbey, Financial Services Authority chief executive John Tiner asked them to pass on his regards to an old friend.SCH non-executive director Manuel Soto Serrano was a senior director at Andersen, where Tiner spent 25 years and headed its worldwide financial services practice before joining the FSA. Soto now chairs SCH's auditing and compliance committee.Slick marketingIs Opec getting just a bit too greedy? Oil prices might be close to record highs but the producers' cartel is seeking to squeeze the brand even more. Attending its biennial seminar after this month's meeting in Vienna will cost €1,000 ($1,216).For the first time, even journalists are being asked to pay to hear and report the thoughts of Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, Opec president Purnomo Yusgiantoro and corporate bigwigs such as Lee Raymond of Exxon Mobil and Lord Browne of BP.The reason, according to Opec? “A lack of spare capacity.” Observer's heard that somewhere before.observer@ft.com
662;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2004-08-30T19:31:01Z;China telecoms groups discuss Olympic tie-up;;Huawei Technologies and ZTE, the leading Chinese telecommunications equipment makers, say they are in discussions to become sponsors of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.The rivals, well known in China but less so overseas, see the games as a chance to build their profiles internationally.Chinese companies, eager to catch up with foreign competitors in brand recognition, are positioning themselves to make the most of the Olympics.In March, Lenovo Group, the personal computer company, became the first Chinese company to enrol in the games' worldwide sponsorship programme, putting it alongside the likes of General Electric, Samsung and McDonald's.?We believe the Beijing Olympics is a good opportunity for us to promote our brand,? said Shi Lirong, the ZTE director in charge of marketing.There are different kinds of Olympic sponsorship, the most prized being the Olympic Partner Programme. These sponsors get exclusive worldwide marketing rights, including permission to use Olympic symbols on their products. Companies can also become sponsors by supplying equipment, although their marketing rights are more limited.ZTE and Huawei, both based in the southern city of Shenzhen, are talking to the Beijing Olympic Committee about co-operation. Huawei said it was considering supplying equipment.?Sponsorship may be very important, but through other ways you can also promote your brand,? Mr Shi said. ZTE, which has been more cautious in expanding overseas than Huawei, provided 16 stadiums at the Athens Games with broadband internet access through OTE, the Greek telecoms operator. It sent executives to Athens to observe how companies such as Visa and Coca-Cola used the event to promote their brands.ZTE and Huawei, which recently entered the mobile handset market, have been stepping up promotion of their brands at industry conferences overseas and inviting potential customers to visit their headquarters in the hope of overcoming the view that Chinese companies can make only cheap, low-quality goods.Overseas sales accounted for about 20 per cent of ZTE's $1.9bn (?1.6bn) sales last year.

It estimates that its three Olympic food service venues - at the Olympic village, the main stadium complex and the media centre - will get through “2m meat patties, 404,469lbs of potatoes and 26,455lbs of lettuce” during the Games.But what it cannot have bargained for - or indeed dreamt of - is that US swimmer Michael Phelps, the phenomenon who won six golds and two bronzes in the Olympic pool, would proclaim the end of his active participation at Athens with the words: “It's McDonald's time”.After his first day off, a demob happy Phelps was delighted to provide more information. “I had a Big Mac and that's all I had. I had McDonald's for both meals today. Two meals so far…Double cheeseburgers.”You just cannot buy that sort of publicity. And no, I've checked, Phelps is not a McDonald's-sponsored athlete. Yet.As part of what it calls its “proud tradition of serving the athletes of the world”, McDonald's says it is helping athletes to plan their meals at the Games with “nutritional information and suggestions for meal combinations”.The company enjoyed another bonus on Sunday, with spectators lining the marathon route in 35 degrees of heat being able to choose between no fewer than five McDonald's restaurants. It was expecting “a very nice bump” in sales as a result.
664;MCD;McDonald's Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
