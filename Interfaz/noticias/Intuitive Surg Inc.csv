The robotic healthcare revolution has already created a near $11bn industry in diagnostics, physical rehabilitation and surgery. Next year, Transparency Market Research expects it to exceed $14bn.For surgery, the appeal is both financial and humane. Robots can make more precise incisions than humans wielding scalpels. Operations are less invasive, meaning quicker recovery times and lower hospital expenses. In 2000 there were 1,000 “robo-surgeries”. By 2015 there were 570,000.For companies, surgical robotics provide a recurring revenue model. After purchasing a system, which can range from $1m-$2.5m, hospitals must buy parts for each operation. Amid the start-ups, two listed companies stand out. California-based Intuitive Surgical, whose da Vinci Robotic Surgical System has operated on more than 3m patients, and Stryker which bought surgical robotics platform MAKO in late 2013 for $1.65bn — an 86 per cent premium.Valuations are high. Stryker trades at 22 times forward earnings. Intuitive Surgical at 39 times. Both, however, are valued far below technology company multiples and are already profitable. Their values are justified if growth trajectory is good — which it is. Ageing baby boomers with weakening knees and chronic conditions need more surgery. Global health systems must reduce costs.The catalyst is not just due to demographic shifts. China’s medical technology ambitions over the next decade should also offer a spur, as the country invests in robots of its own. A robotic arms race could be coming. If so, these two US specialists have already got a lead. Intuitive Surgical has hundreds of patent applications pending.The public adores humanoid robots that bumblingly attempt general tasks. Robot arms whose form reflect their function are less popular. But these surgical robots have a touch delicate enough to stitch up a cut in a grape — or a person. That is more useful than being able to stand on two legs.The Lex team is interested in hearing from readers. Would you be happy for a robot to operate on you? Do robotic surgery companies offer an appealing intersection between healthcare and tech stocks? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.
1;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Demand for robotic surgery drives Intuitive shares to fresh highs;;Intuitive Surgical led the S&P 500 higher on Wednesday after the medical equipment maker reported upbeat first quarter results and lifted its outlook for procedure growth.Shares in the company, whose da Vinci surgical systems dominate the laparoscopic surgery market, climbed as much as 7.6 per cent to hit a new record high of $817.20, before trimming back those gains to trade about 7 per cent higher at pixel time. That took the company’s year-to-date gains to nearly 28 per cent and lifted its market value to $29.4bn.The rally came as revenues for the three months to end of March rose more than 13 per cent from a year ago to $674.2m, ahead of analysts estimates of $665.7m. The California-based company said procedures conducted by the da Vinci system grew nearly 18 per cent worldwide — driven primarily by growth in US general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures that focus on the urinary tract system and male reproductive organs. The number also tops the 11 per cent growth that analysts had forecast.Profits rose to $179.8m or $4.67 a share during the quarter, from $136.4m or $3.54 a share in the year ago period. That eclipsed analysts expectations of $4.03. Adjusting for one-time items earnings of $5.09 a share also handily beat forecasts.As a result of the strong demand for robot assisted surgery, the company lifted its annual procedure growth guidance to 12 to 14 per cent, from 9 to 12 per cent previously. “That is actually the same beat and raise pattern that Intuitive Surgical had in 2016, where it ended the year with 15% procedure growth,” Matthew Taylor, an analyst at Netnet, said.“We see positive signs of continued adoption in hernia/colorectal, thoracic procedures, strong international growth and continued growth in mature categories adding up to more upside.”
2;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2015-12-15T06:00:49Z;Next generation of robot technology enters the operating theatre;Expensive machinery means cost benefits will depend on achieving economies of scale;The surgical equipment developed by UK-based Cambridge Medical Robotics has “shoulders”, “elbows” and “wrists” and mimics the movements of a human arm. It allows surgeons to work with greater accuracy and precision, according to the company.But as the next generation of robot technology enters the operating theatre, practitioners stress that surgeons still control what happens during procedures.Predictions that robot technology would enable surgeons to perform operations on the other side of the world have not come to pass. “That has not happened and one of the reasons has to do with the speed of light,” says Martin Frost, chief executive of Cambridge Medical Robotics. “You can’t transmit the amount of data you need over a communications network fast enough to give the surgeon the feedback he or she needs.”Even though telesurgery has not yet materialised, surgeons say robot technology is improving their work. “Your vision is better and your movements are more refined,” says Maurice Lau, a consultant urological surgeon.“The evidence and our anecdotal experience show that you have a lower complication rate and a lower blood transfusion rate — and blood is an expensive and rare commodity,” says Mr Lau, a specialist at the Christie Clinic, a leading UK cancer centre. In August, the clinic bought two da Vinci Si Surgical System robots, the latest technology from Intuitive Surgical of the US, the market leader.While lower blood transfusion rates save money, the increased cost of the machine, its maintenance and the disposable devices it requires make robot surgery more expensive than standard operations. This means its cost benefits will depend on achieving economies of scale.Some have tried to calculate this. Research funded by the UK’s National Institute for Health Research’s Health Technology Assessment programme found the extra cost could be offset if each robot system conducted at least 100 to 150 procedures a year.Mr Frost argues that, to make these procedures cost effective, the price of the equipment must be reduced, something he says his company has achieved by taking a modular approach in the design and by building greater flexibility into the robotic arms.Minimally invasive surgery has long been possible using laparoscopic or keyhole techniques. However, surgeons say robot surgery takes minimally invasive surgery to another level.Rakesh Suri, a cardiac surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, says traditional laparoscopic equipment lacks the wrist-like movements made possible by robot technology. “It is like eating with chopsticks as opposed to eating with your fingers, and imagine peeling a shrimp with chopsticks,” he says.Not everyone views robot surgery as a cure-all. Peter Dunn, perioperative medical director at Massachusetts General Hospital, argues that claims about the benefits to patients over other techniques have been overstated.“Our robotic programme is at a low level because our surgeons want to individualise the care for each patient, whatever the right device or technique, not to advocate for one technique over another just for the sake of using a device,” says Dr Dunn.Surgeons stress that robotic tools are just that — machines that extend the capabilities and precision of the surgeon, rather than replacing human skills. In fact, when applied to surgery, the term “robot” can be misleading. Rather than referring to automatons such as those used in car manufacturing, the term refers to robotic tele-manipulation.“It is merely taking the surgeon’s hand, replacing it with a robot arm,” says Dr Suri. “Every single movement is conceived and carried out by the surgeon.”Some operations continue to require open surgery. Mr Lau cites the case of procedures to remove large tumours, sometimes weighing 15 kilogrammes. “You don’t have enough space in an abdomen to do a keyhole procedure,” he says. “So there will always be certain operations that cannot be done because of physical limitations.”This poses a conundrum when it comes to training surgeons. In the past, all surgeons would have had experience with open surgery, but the take-up of robot technology could create a cohort of surgeons trained only to operate laparoscopic or robot equipment.This could be problematic in cases where an operation needs to be converted to an open procedure. “That is an issue that we are all grappling with at the moment,” says Mr Lau.But if the kind of training surgeons will receive in future has yet to be determined, Mr Frost is confident that the use of robot surgery is set to increase. He predicts a tenfold rise in its use over the next decade.“We will see robotics becoming commonplace,” he says.

Revenues advanced 14 per cent to $1.2bn, with the company attributing much of the growth to store openings and higher menu prices.Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $4.40 a share on sales of $1.22bn.Shares of Chipotle, which have advanced 6 per cent this year, rose 7.7 per cent to $725.Intuitive Surgical climbed 8.7 per cent to $548.81 after it topped second-quarter profits and sales expectations.The maker of surgical robots reported profits of $134.5m, or $3.56 a share, in the three months to the end of June, compared with $97m, or $2.57 a share, in the period a year before. Sales rose 10 per cent to $586.1m.Analysts had forecast earnings of $3.10 a share on sales of $564.8m. Adjusting for one-time items, Intuitive reported earnings of $4.57 a share, ahead of expectations for $3.99.Shares of Blue Buffalo, which makes premium pet food, surged 36 per cent to $27.20 in their debut on the Nasdaq on Wednesday morning, securing a valuation of more than $5.3bn.The company priced its initial public offering at $20, above an earlier targeted range of between $16 and $18 a share.Investors sold 33.8m shares in the offering while Blue Buffalo issued 35,934 shares to employees. The company did not receive any of the proceeds from the $677m flotation.Disappointing results from Yahoo and Microsoft and weaker than expected iPhone sales at Apple weighed on the Nasdaq Composite and triggered a sell-off in technology stocks that pushed US stocks lower on Wednesday.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 5,171.77, while the S&P 500 slid 0.2 per cent to 2,114.15 and Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 17,851.04.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
4;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Robot surgery market set to change;Newcomers may lower costs and add an analytical edge;"If you are having prostate surgery in the US, it is highly probable your procedure will be carried out by a robot.Robot-assisted surgery has been available for more than a decade and has gained popularity because it allows operations to be carried out with potentially smaller incisions than conventional procedures. A YouTube video that shows two robotic hands delicately suturing a flap of skin back on to a grape demonstrates the precision that can be achieved. In many cases, patients now demand robot surgery.“In the US, where patients have more choice in medical care, hospitals have to have these systems to attract customers,” says Simon Burnell, technology expert at PA consulting. “Whether it is right or not, this plays a significant part in the uptake.”To date, the market has been dominated by a handful of companies, including: Intuitive Surgical, whose da Vinci system dominates the laparoscopic, or keyhole, surgery market; Hansen Medical, which makes robotically controlled catheters that can be inserted into blood vessels; and Mako Surgical, which makes robots used for knee resurfacing and hip replacements.These companies have fared well. There are more than 3,300 da Vinci systems installed worldwide, and Intuitive had revenues of $2.13bn in 2014. The company, which is listed on Nasdaq, has a market capitalisation of $18.24bn. Hansen Medical made a loss in 2014 but is valued at $130m. Mako Surgical was bought by medical equipment maker Stryker for $1.65bn in 2013.The problem with robotic surgery has been the expense, says Emmet Cole, a Texas-based technology writer who specialises in robot technology. A da Vinci system costs $1.25m-$2.3m, and instruments, which are limited to a maximum of 10 uses, cost a further $1,300-$2,200. For a da Vinci to be financially viable, hospitals need to perform between 150 and 300 procedures annually for six years, he says.It is also unclear whether robotic surgery always offers clear benefits over traditional methods such as laparoscopy. In 2013 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (Acog) said robotic surgery was not the best, or even the second best, option for hysterectomies. “A study of more than 264,000 hysterectomy patients in 441 hospitals found that robotics added an average of $2,000 per procedure without any demonstrable benefit,” Acog said in a statement.Companies entering the market may change some of these dynamics. Titan Medical is close to being given approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for its Single Port Orifice Robotic Technology surgical system, similar to da Vinci, but which is expected to have a lower cost of about $600,000.The benefits may also increase as technologies develop. Aeon Scientific, a Swiss company, has developed a system of catheters that can be guided through blood vessels remotely using magnetic fields. “It is a safer system for patients, as the catheter in the patient is softer, reducing the risk of perforation,” says Dominik Bell, Aeon’s chief executive.Aeon has so far installed one surgical system in Switzerland, and is reliant on funding from private investors.Meanwhile, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US are developing “squishy” surgical robots, which would be less likely to damage tissue when they travel through the body.Other benefits could come from connecting surgical robots to other devices and sensors, which would provide a richer stream of feedback for surgeons while they are operating.Aeon’s Dr Bell says: “Once clinics begin [to use more connected systems], we can get feedback, we can refine the sensors and algorithms, so the robots cannot only be steered more precisely but they can process the information to help the surgeon make better decisions.”PA’s Mr Burnell says non-traditional companies are also entering the field. Google, for example, recently signed a deal with Johnson & Johnson’s medical device company, Ethicon, to create surgical robots that use artificial intelligence. Manufacturers may be expert at creating the surgical equipment, but Google will bring its big data analysis capabilities that will take this technology to a different level, he says."
5;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2015-04-22T17:00:32Z;Chipotle sags as sales disappoint;Disruption in pork supply also affected results;Chipotle shares faced the heat after the US restaurant chain reported first-quarter same-store sales that fell short of expectations and while disruption in pork supply affected its results.The company said comparable sales climbed 10.4 per cent in the first quarter, down from a 16.1 per cent pace in the final three months of 2014 and short of analysts’ expectations.Executives forecast that same-store sales over the course of the year would rise by a “low-to-mid single-digit” percentage.“The quarter was not without its challenges however, as we suspended one of our primary pork suppliers and are exploring options to increase the supply of pork that meets our high standards,” said Steve Ells, the company’s chairman and co-chief executive.The Denver, Colorado-based company reported a 48 per cent rise in profits in the three months to the end of March from a year earlier to $123m, or $3.88 per share. Revenues advanced by a fifth to $1.1bn, with volumes at the average restaurant reaching $2.5m.Analysts on Wall Street had expected the chain to report earnings of $3.63 a share on sales of $1.1bn.Chipotle is a momentum-driven stock, having gained more than 400 per cent in the past five years. However, investors have grown more cautious as same-store sales growth at the company declined for the second consecutive quarter.Shares of Chipotle, which have climbed 26 per cent in the past year, declined more than 7 per cent to $641.23.Boeing shares fell 1.4 per cent to $151.19, after the company said first-quarter profits climbed as it delivered more aircraft.Profits rose to $1.3bn, or 1.97 a share, from $965m, or $1.28 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 8 per cent to $22.1bn.Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $1.77 a share, on sales of $22.5bn.Revenues at its commercial aerospace business climbed 21 per cent in the period to $15.4bn.Shares of McDonald’s were buoyed by promises of a “turnround plan”, despite reporting first-quarter results that missed Wall Street forecasts.The company said Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, would reveal the plan “to improve our performance and deliver enduring profitable growth” on May 4.The announcement came alongside an 11 per cent drop in sales to $5.95bn for the three months to the end of March. Net income fell by a third to $811.5m, or 84 cents per share. McDonald’s shares rose 3 per cent to $97.84.Disappointing first-quarter results pushed shares of Intuitive Surgical more than 5 per cent lower to $516.93.The surgical robot maker reported profits of $97m or $2.57 a share, on sales of $532.1m. This fell short of estimates for earnings of $2.59 a share, on sales of $536.4m.Technology and energy stocks led the S&P 500, as US stocks fluctuated between gains and losses.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 2,107.96 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 18,038.27.

6;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2014-11-07T16:29:55Z;Making money in an age of machines;Robots are increasingly performing tasks once done by humans;"When I was a teenager I worked as a waitress for a while. When I wasn’t doing that I was counting quarters in a casino in Miami, working in a bookshop (the only job from which I have, so far, ever been fired) or pulling pints in what was then a relatively low-grade pub on Ledbury Road in west London.That makes me one of millions. One in eight Americans has at some point worked in McDonald's and pretty much every member of my generation has experience of waiting tables. That was our introduction to the world of work. But here’s an odd thing: taking beer orders shouted across a damp bar on a Saturday night might be an experience our children never have. Why? Because those kinds of jobs are being automated.A few weeks ago McDonald's announced new technology “to make it easier for customers to order and pay for food digitally and to give people the ability to customize their orders”. Think mobile ordering and self-ordering kiosks. Chili’s Bar & Grill is starting a tablet ordering system and Applebee’s is doing the same in 2,000 of its restaurants. In China a fully robot-staffed restaurant (yes, they cook too) has been running for a few years. There’ll be no real people left behind any fast food counters in 15 years.This is partly about cutting the cost of labour. The clamour for higher minimum wages is rising (it has just gone to $15 an hour in San Francisco) and savvy employers know that even without legislation, wages won’t stay static in the west for ever. Wage growth might be sluggish here, but in the US worker compensation was up by an annualised 2.2 per cent in the third quarter.It’s not just about nasty capitalists trying to avoid paying a living wage: ordering via machine is quicker and better. Robots don’t get sick, get pregnant, ask for more money, argue about repetitive tasks, or fall in love with their co-workers. They might also be better sales people than people. Are you more likely to sign up to a loyalty programme on an iPad in your hand while you wait for an order, or on a form shoved at you by a harassed teenager at the counter?Nor is it just about restaurants. According to research company Gartner, one in three jobs will be replaced by some kind of software, robot or smart machine by 2025. Visit a factory today and you can see how. I went to a sawmill last year. From the second the logs rolled off the lorry the only human interaction came via a computer control room. They were sized, sorted and cut on orders from a software system. Amazing.Technological change is at the intersection of employment, nominal economic growth and inflation risk – the focus areas of global policy makersRobots are already cleaning hospitals, vacuuming the houses of people slightly richer than you; picking strawberries in Japan (with a camera that analyses ripeness). But this also isn’t just about boring jobs. Take what you can when you can, said one strategist to me a few days ago when I was wondering whether to write more or not. “Give it a decade and both our jobs will be being done by a machine.” Far fetched? Not really. Futurist Ray Kurzwell reckons that by 2020, computer processing power will have reached the level of a human brain. Middle-aged bankers might want to look back to their first graduate job: how much of it is automated now? A third? We don’t need junior number crunchers any more.It’s the same in journalism. I had two assistants when I first started out as an editor. Now I have an iPad. I miss the girls. But there it is. The same goes for train drivers: I was mildly surprised to see last month that the trains at the Tokyo Disney Resort have no drivers, but run very smoothly. We also don’t need so many cameramen or pilots – aerial footage of everything from war zones to farmland comes from drones. And what of nurses? If remote devices can monitor patients with heart disease and diabetes and infrared light can guide robots to the right veins to take blood from, we don’t need so many of them either. The same goes for surgeons.Do we need to worry? A little. This kind of change is very deflationary and our radicalised central bankers can’t cope with that. It’s also bad for people with the wrong skills. If robots can do everything simple, being good at simple things is useless (see Race Against The Machine by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee for more on this).But we shouldn’t be hysterical either. Creative and innovative people will do well and there’ll still be plenty of jobs in newish service areas. Think one-on-one full time help for the elderly (of whom there’ll be many more). Robopets aside, companionship will remain a human function. So will gardening, fixing old cars, decorating and plumbing. At the same time, with labour costs no longer a big deal, we can expect reshoring to accelerate, which will bring some employment with it.And all these machines will need designing, building and controlling. Let’s not forget the internet as we know it is only 20-odd years old. Imagine trying to explain to an agricultural labourer in 1930 that his grandchildren would be making £100,000 a year each as computer programmers.So what should you do? Bring up creative children; give them something to differentiate them from machines. Second, think about investing. Getting into robotics isn’t easy. In their soon-to-be-released book Fast Forward, Jim Mellon and Al Chalabi run through some of the innovators in the sector: Kuka AG, the world’s biggest player in industrial robots and US-listed Intuitive Surgical and Hansen Medical, both of which work in robotic surgery, are obvious places to start.So what should you do? Bring up creative children; give them something to differentiate them from machines. Second, think about investingBut many of the best companies are privately held and clear winners haven’t yet emerged. With that in mind you could look at a newish exchange-traded fund listed in the US – the Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF. It isn’t at all cheap by ETF standards – the ongoing charges are 0.95 per cent but at the moment, there isn’t much competition.This also seems a good time to point you in the direction of the new (to the UK at least) Guinness Global Innovators Fund. This is cheaper (an introductory management fee of 0.25 per cent) and invests in companies positioned to benefit from innovation in all areas. It clearly isn’t specifically about automation but it is hard to see how any company wanting to drive growth via innovation these days can do so without using technology.Finally, a note on communication: not all technology works perfectly and I have had some trouble with my FT email address.

This comes at a time when investors have warmed to acquirers, in contrast to the late 1990s when the stock of the acquirer typically fell.The agreement has yet to be approved by US regulators and CareFusion’s shareholders.Intuitive Surgical, a manufacturer of surgical systems, advanced 2 per cent to $486.55 after analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded the company to “buy” from “neutral” and raised their price target to $584 from $466.“Following (1) a new 80 surgeon survey (gynaecology and general surgery); (2) a detailed review of the ageing US installed base . . . and (3) an analysis of the geographic footprint and international expansion opportunity, we are more optimistic on the outlook for Intuitive Surgical,” said David H Roman, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.GT Advanced Technologies, a producer of sapphire displays used in electronics, tumbled 92 per cent to $0.83 after the company filed for bankruptcy protection in New Hampshire.The company, which indicated it had assets and liabilities in excess of $1bn in the filing, said it would seek debtor-in-possession financing to provide the company with a source of financing to conduct business.GT Advanced said it had $85m in cash at the end of September.Investors had broadly expected the company’s components to be used in the new Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, lifting GT shares more than 100 per cent over the year to the end of August.Shares of Brazilian oil and gas company Petrobras climbed 13 per cent to $15.80 in New York after a surprise result from the first round of Brazil’s presidential election, which saw pro-business candidate Aécio Neves make a run-off vote.H&R Block declined 6 per cent to $29.91 after the tax services provider said its bank sale to BofI Federal Bank cannot be completed this year.The company said this was because the regulatory approval of the transaction had been delayed.Hewlett-Packard advanced 5 per cent to $36.87 after the company announced that it would split in two, separating its PC and printer unit from its software and hardware business.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent to 1,964.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 16,991.91 and the Nasdaq Composite sank 0.5 per cent to 4,454.80.Email: mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar"
8;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2014-04-23T16:54:17Z;US airline industry gathers speed on strong results;;The US airline industry, which has outperformed a broadly turbulent market this year, gathered further speed on Wednesday after results from Delta and Boeing topped Wall Street profit forecasts.Shares in both companies advanced in early-afternoon trading, as Delta shrugged off severe winter weather and Boeing reported robust global demand for commercial jetliners.Delta, the third-largest US airline, said net revenues grew 5 per cent from a year earlier, to $8.9bn, as it flew more densely packed flights in the US and expanded domestic and Latin American service.Profits in the quarter rose to $213m, or 25 cents per share, compared to $7m a year earlier. When adjusting for restructuring and other expenses, earnings per share rose to 33 cents, ahead of expectations. Analysts at Goldman Sachs called the results “solid”.Boeing also surprised Wall Street as it reported an 18 per cent rise in deliveries of its passenger jets and increased earnings guidance for the current year.Revenues at its commercial aeroplane division rose by almost a fifth to $12.7bn in the quarter, while operating margins firmed to 11.8 per cent from 11.4 per cent. Boeing reported a commercial order backlog of $374bn, which included 235 net new orders during the quarter.“Despite some variation in emerging market growth rates, we see no softening of demand for commercial aeroplanes,” Jim McNerney, chief executive, said on a call with analysts. “In fact, underpinning the strength of the cycle relative to past ones is a sustained high level of replacement demand.”The results from Delta and Boeing come a day ahead of earnings from airlines representing more than half of US domestic passenger air capacity and revenues. They include United Continental, American Airlines, Southwest and JetBlue.Four of the five top-performing members of the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which also includes rail and freight shipping companies, have been airlines. The index itself has climbed 5 per cent this year, compared to a small dip in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Shares in Boeing rose 2.41 per cent on Wednesday to end at $130.62 while Delta climbed more than 6 per cent to close at $37.07, putting it among the top performers on the benchmark S&P 500.Gilead Sciences said sales of Sovaldi, the $1,000-a-day hepatitis C drug at the centre of a political row, tallied $2.3bn during its first full quarter on the market. The debut helped lift Gilead’s net sales 97 per cent from a year earlier to $5bn, while profits tripled to $2.2bn, or $1.33 per share.Both sales and profits easily topped Wall Street forecasts. Shares in the company climbed 3 per cent before settling back to finish 1.39 per cent higher at $73.87.Analysts at Citigroup estimate the hepatitis C treatment could enjoy sales of more than $12bn at its peak in 2016.Despite the better than expected earnings from Boeing, Delta and Gilead, as well as Dow Chemical, Procter & Gamble, and Norfolk Southern, stock markets slid. The benchmark S&P 500 broke a six-day winning streak, slipping 0.22 per cent to close at 1,875.39 after new home sales showed a second consecutive month of decline.“The trend in the data has been soft for a while now, and separate reports on mortgage purchase applications and homebuilder sentiment as well as figures related to the existing home sales market are indicative of weak conditions in the housing market persisting for the time being,” JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.08 per cent to 16,501.65 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended 0.83 per cent lower at 4,126.97.Intuitive Surgical led the declines on the Nasdaq 100, home to the largest companies on the wider Nasdaq index, after cutting forecasts for sales of its surgical robots.First-quarter profits slid 77 per cent to $44m, with procedure growth on Intuitive’s da Vinci systems expected to rise 2 to 8 per cent this year, compared with as much as 12 per cent earlier. Its shares fell 11.46 per cent to close at $373.93.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Excluding restructuring costs and other items, the company said it earned 9 cents per share, ahead of estimates.The company has found greater profitability and demand from its mid- and downstream efforts – which include the sale of aluminium rolled sheets for car and airline manufacturers and alloy castings for jet engines.“While Alcoa highlighted the growth potential for several end markets . . . we believe the majority of investor focus was on growth in the automotive market,” Stifel analyst Paul Massoud said.The company forecast such sheet revenue could reach $1.3bn by 2018 as a growing number of carmakers turned to aluminium over steel. Alcoa shares rose 3.75 per cent to close at $13.00.Shares in General Motors faltered after broker Morgan Stanley dimmed its view on the carmaker as costs to keep pace with Tesla and Ford eat into the company’s profits.Analyst Adam Jonas lowered his rating on the firm to ‘underweight’ and reduced his price target as pressures on GM mount, including rising technology costs and a peak in US car sales.“The global auto industry is entering an epoch of significant technology disruption,” Mr Jonas said. “The pressures will challenge conventional thinking on capital allocation, engineering and human resources.”General Motors will be forced to increasingly spend on technology for autonomous and electric vehicles, Mr Jonas notes, crimping its ability to return cash to shareholders.Lower profitability in Russia, South America and China, as well as increasing competition in the pick-up market from Ford, will also intensify in 2015.The downgrade comes as US auto safety regulators fined the company $7,000 per day for failing to fully respond to questions related to the recall of 2.6m vehicles.Shares in General Motors fell 2.61 per cent, ending at $33.63.Intuitive Surgical was among decliners on the S&P 500, giving up 6.78 per cent to close at $456.64, after first-quarter revenues fell by nearly a quarter amid a steep drop in sales of its da Vinci robotic surgical system.The company said sales slid 24 per cent from a year earlier to $465m, shy of analyst forecasts for $538m.Intuitive also announced that it would take a $67m charge related to product liability cases related to a recall of some surgical instruments in 2013.Hershey shares weakened after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to ‘sell’ from ‘neutral’ on concerns that shares have neared “peak valuation” while the company is on the cusp of a “negative expectation recalibration”.The investment bank said after a strong cycle of chocolate sales, productivity gains and cost relief, earnings growth were likely to fall short of high forecasts.“We see some factors as transitory, with others as more enduring, but regardless of the cause, this is a stock we see as seemingly priced for perfection and any shortfall could be painful for shareholders,” analyst Jason English said.Hershey shares declined 2.76 per cent to $98.91.Shares in La Quinta, the US hotel chain acquired by Blackstone in 2006, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange to choppy trade. It spent much of early morning trading in negative territory, then rising to as much as $17.85 before closing at $17.21, above the $17 price shares were sold on Tuesday evening.Overall, US markets ended higher for a second straight day helped by a tentative rebound in momentum stocks that had suffered steep losses days earlier.The S&P 500 rose 1.09 per cent to close at 1,872.18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.1 per cent to 16,437.18.

All three companies have properties in Macau.Ford Motor led US automakers higher following better than expected monthly sales figures.The second-largest US car manufacturer reported a 3.4 per cent rise in sales in March as buyers returned to dealership showrooms as the weather eased.The Detroit-based company sold 244,167 vehicles last month, compared with 236,160 in the same month a year earlier.Ford was joined by Chrysler and Toyota in besting Wall Street estimates, as sales rose 11 per cent and 4.9 per cent from a year earlier, respectively. General Motors initially delayed its monthly report due to a computer issue, but later announced that sales in March were 4.1 per cent higher on last year.Shares in Ford rose almost 5 per cent to $16.31 while General Motors slipped 0.23 per cent to $34.34.Intuitive Surgical shares climbed after the company announced it had won regulatory approval to bring a new surgical system to the US market.The company said the Food and Drug Administration cleared its da Vinci Xi Surgical System, a new system that uses minimally invasive approaches to abdominal surgeries.“We view this as a significant positive for Intuitive Surgical, as it has the potential to both drive a replacement cycle and further increase penetration/utilisation within hospitals,” JPMorgan analyst Tycho Peterson said.Intuitive Surgical ended 12.7 per cent higher at $493.60, leading the benchmark S&P 500.Nvidia, the chipmaker, advanced following a broker upgrade to ‘market outperform’ on Tuesday as analysts at JMP Securities warmed to the company’s focus on the cloud market.“The company is successfully realigning its business model to more stable growth and gross margin opportunities, and, in our opinion, is in a position to deliver earnings upside in coming quarters,” analyst Alex Gauna said.Mr Gauna established a $26 price target on the company and said Nvidia should benefit from an increase in sales of its Tegra mobile processor for auto applications. He noted PC headwinds should also be lower than in past years.Shares in Nvidia increased just over 4 per cent to $18.65.Overall, US equities strengthened for the third consecutive day following a rise in the monthly ISM manufacturing survey. The report showed improving new orders and production activity at the country’s manufacturers.Millan Mulraine, a strategist with TD Securities, said gains in key forward looking indicators in the monthly ISM report pointed to “sustained upside momentum” in the future.“This report offers an upbeat assessment on US manufacturing sector momentum in March, and more importantly with the key forward-looking heading higher, it provides a constructive outlook on the performance of this crucial sector,” he said.The S&P 500 advanced 0.7 per cent to 1,885.52 after touching a new record high earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.46 per cent to close at 16,532.61. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 1.64 per cent to end the day at 4,268.04.
12;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2013-07-12T13:30:33Z;Letter from Lex: not OK computer;The PC market continues its slow decline as consumers and companies remain cautious about spending;In 1943, IBM’s chairman allegedly made a bold prediction that the world market for computers would reach a grand total of five machines. He was off by a few hundred million, but the market is now slowly shrinking. That is bad news for the likes of Microsoft, Lenovo, Seagate and Micron. The latter three are doing well for the moment, but Microsoft has been forced into another operational realignment and management reshuffle. In machines of another kind, Schneider Electric made a £3.3bn approach for UK engineering group Invensys while US robotics company Intuitive Surgical saw its second-quarter sales growth slow.US consumers are still in a frugal mood. Family Dollar’s results showed that Americans are spending less on discretionary items. But they are still buying enough food and health & beauty products to keep supermarket operator Kroger in expansionary mode as it acquired smaller rival Harris Teeter for $2.5bn. In China, the world’s largest jeweller, Chow Tai Fook, benefited from investors spending more on gold as its price dipped and other investment opportunities dried up. When it comes to corporate capital expenditure, however, companies show no sign of spending more of the estimated $4tn of cash they are holding.In the UK, oil & gas giant Shell hopes its new boss can increase its returns when he takes the reins next year while pharma company GlaxoSmithKline is again facing allegations of bad practices, this time in China.In the banking sector, calculations are still being made about the effect of higher interest rates and the latest brutal move in bond markets. Investors got clues as to how US banks are coping when JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reported results. Meanwhile in Europe, policy makers are still squabbling over how banking union is going to work with Brussels and Berlin engaged in another power struggle. It would be foolish to make bold predictions about the outcome.John Casey, Lex Publisher
13;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2020-04-24T21:25:54+0000;Intuitive Surgical: robots at bay;How big is the market for robot surgery?;It cannot be long until the machines rise up and become our overlords. How reassuring, then, that it has not happened just yet. Intuitive Surgical is a US pure-play robotics company with a market capitalisation of $17bn. It makes machines that manoeuvre instruments inserted into bodies through tiny incisions. The surgeon sits at a controller, telling the machine what to do (until the inevitable moment when the roles are reversed). Intuitive’s products were used in 450,000 procedures last year, mostly in the US, and mostly in gynaecology and urology, up a quarter from 2011.But the ‘droid revolution seems to have slowed in the second quarter, according to results released on Tuesday. While procedures have continued to grow well, sales of the machines themselves fell 6 per cent. While revenue still expanded by single-digits – driven by the service and consumables revenues that are the best feature of Intuitive’s business – the results were still a shock for the decidedly human investors who have become used to 30 per cent revenue growth and who have paid, in recent years, 30 or 40 times earnings for the stock. Shares fell 17 per cent.The bad quarter should be kept in perspective. Intuitive’s systems cost $1m-$2m and, with the US medical care system in flux, hospital capital spending was bound to be lumpy. At the same time, remember that the markets for medical innovations have always been presented, by manufacturers and stockbrokers, as very underpenetrated. The cardiac stent and the defibrillator, to pick two examples, were expected to be jammed into most of the middle-aged chests in America. In fact, growth has been modest. Intuitive thinks its target market is worth at least $7bn, compared with $2.3bn in current sales. In the future, happily, the robots charged with picking stocks will be programmed for scepticism.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
14;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2013-02-28T23:55:25Z;US investigates robotic surgical devices;;Shares of Intuitive Surgical fell 11 per cent on Thursday after reports that the US Food and Drug Administration is investigating the safety of its robotic surgical devices.The FDA said it is surveying a small sample of surgeons who use Intuitive’s da Vinci surgical system. The devices are used in more than 2,000 hospitals around the world and allow surgeons to conduct operations with remote controls and cameras.The FDA has received an increase in reports of problems associated with the robotic devices and said it is trying to weigh the risks and benefits of using robotic surgery rather than conventional surgery.“Since it is difficult to know why the reports have increased, FDA has elected to talk with some surgeons to help in determining if the rise in reports may be a true reflection of problems, or may simply be an increase in reports because of other contributing factors,” Synim Rivers, an FDA spokeswoman, said.The FDA would not share details of the reports. It said the survey would give a “qualitative” picture of safety of the devices.The da Vinci system has been used in heart surgeries as well as urological and gynaecological procedures. The device gives doctors a sense of touch and three-dimensional vision during an operation but cannot be programmed to perform surgeries on its own.Critics of robotic surgery warn that it is risky because doctors are not in direct contact with their patients. However, a study in the Archives of Surgery last year found that individual patient risk factors were more to blame with surgical problems than the robotic technology.Robotics is a growing area in medicine and Intuitive, which introduced the da Vinci device in 1999, made $2.2bn in revenues last year and $656.6m in net income. The company’s shares fell 11 per cent to $509.89 after Bloomberg News first reported the investigation but rose 3.2 per cent in after-hours trading.Angela Wonson, an Intuitive spokeswoman, called the inquiry “routine” and said there has not been an increase in deaths or problems related to its devices.“The clinical evidence shows that da Vinci is safer than open surgical alternatives in many of the common procedures in which it is used,” Ms Wonson said. “We are committed to continuous improvement and, independent of this survey, we are always working to improve both our products and processes.”
15;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2012-07-06T18:34:15Z;My aversion to reversion – and UK banks;Sometimes prices revert to zero, not their historical average;"I often refer to the tendency for prices, valuations, and other investment metrics to “revert to the mean”. When I do, I’m usually talking about the ratio of house prices to earnings; the cyclically adjusted price/earnings (Cape) ratio of a market; or corporate profit margins in the US.They are all things that, over time, hang around a noticeable average. When they move to an extreme from that average, they tend to move back again.But just because whole markets have a tendency to revert to a mean valuation doesn’t mean that everything does.I’ve been looking at a report on this from Mark Urquhart, one of the indefatigable optimists at Edinburgh based Baillie Gifford (I am on the board of one of its investment trusts). According to him, the four most dangerous words in investment are not, as most of us think: “this time, it’s different.” They are: “reversion to the mean”.When it comes to individual stocks or sectors, he says, the idea that prices will return to some kind of average assumes that the “external environment remains the same over time”. But, he argues, it doesn’t. Instead, we are living in a period of exceptionally rapid change – change that can have a “profound effects on equities”.Take the way Urquhart satisfied himself with the definition of reversion to the mean. He looked it up on Wikipedia, a website now accessed by 15 per cent of internet users every day, and viewed by pretty much everyone as the starting point for researching anything. Just 12 years ago, Wikipedia didn’t exist.Then look at our high streets. Twenty years ago, the regional press and speciality retailers were deemed good investments. So much for that: the internet has utterly destroyed the business models of both – making fortunes for the founders of the likes of Google, Facebook and Zynga (a social gaming company) along the way.Here, the point is obvious but it is still worth making: some things don’t revert to the mean, they just go to zero.This thought is also taken up in a recent paper from Nick Train of Lindsell Train (I know I mentioned him last week, too, but I promise it is just a short-term crush).He notes that, in 1892, it cost $9 in 1892 prices for a five-minute phone call from New York to Chicago. Today, if you can figure out how to use Skype, it is free. There probably isn’t going to be a cyclical upswing back to the average price of a phone call.Compared with their historical p/e or price-to-book ratios – or just about any other measure you care to mention – banks are not so much cheap as practically free . . . But history doesn’t tell us everything. In some cases, such as this one, it tells us nothing at all.Set too much store by reversion to the mean and you will be “routinely tempted to sell out of long term winners and into clunkers . . . this is not an obvious winning investment strategy”.All of which brings me to the clunkers of the week: UK banks.A good many people think you should buy their shares. They look at how the financial crisis and, more recently, the hounding of Bob Diamond has pushed prices down across the sector. Compared with their historical p/e or price-to-book ratios – or just about any other measure you care to mention – they are not so much cheap as practically free.That’s true. They are.But history doesn’t tell us everything. In some cases, such as this one, it tells us nothing at all.The banking business model of the past couple of decades (taking advantage of leverage, abnormally low interest rates and light-touch regulation to make managers rich and shareholders poor) is not a model that will be allowed in the next decade.There is going to be significantly tougher regulation. There is going to be intense public scrutiny. There are going to be all sorts of new entrants to the market – witness the peer- to-peer lenders I wrote about a few weeks ago and the number of companies issuing bonds directly to investors.There will also be changes to managerial incentives.All of that suggests the banks are virtually guaranteed to make lower returns in future and should command much lower valuations as a result – well below their old mean.If you want to invest in companies for whom the business environment is improving rather than collapsing, you might instead look to some Baillie Gifford favourites in the US: companies such as Illumina, the world leader in genome sequencing technology and Intuitive Surgical, the leader in robotic surgery. Both are held by the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust.● A few weeks ago, I wrote that while property in much of Europe is starting to look cheap, further tax rises will mean that the upfront price is only the beginning of the cost. This is increasingly going to be the case in France, where François Hollande, the president, has just announced a tax grab on holiday homes. The income tax take on rentals is to rise from 20 per cent to 35.5 per cent, and the capital gains tax on sales is to rise from 19 per cent to 34.5 per cent.

16;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2012-01-20T15:48:09Z;Letter from Lex: Post-holiday blues;;The week started on what one UK psychologist has labelled Blue Monday – the most depressing day of the year – and for some it was not much better by the end. The 131-year old company that helped turn photography into a popular pastime, Kodak, had a worse week than most as it filed for bankruptcy. The world’s second largest retailer, Carrefour, also had a bad week, predicting that 2011 earnings would be up to 20 per cent lower. Citigroup is in no such danger thanks to a government backstop despite its disappointing third quarter performance. The US bank is in far better shape than Italy’s UniCredit and ING of the Netherlands, which are both struggling to put their post-crisis houses in order, and the world’s largest listed hedge fund, Man Group, which has turned to cost cutting. Even the mighty Google did not have the best of weeks as it reported top- and bottom-line results that were short of expectations. But private sector bondholders who bought Greek debt were probably more miserable than most as it looks like they will have to accept a default on lousy terms.However, it was not all grim news. Italy appears to be in good hands with Mario Monti as prime minister despite its still precarious debt position. China’s growth may be slowing, but its rural economy is still expanding rapidly and 8.9 per cent quarterly growth is hardly depressing. In the UK, investors in DS Smith may have been doing cartwheels after it announced a €1.6bn deal to buy the packaging division of Sweden’s SCA. Investors in the world’s largest biotech company, Amgen, and a maker of robotic equipment for surgery, Intuitive Surgical, were happier than most as both companies are performing well. Even bankers at state-controlled RBS may have been feeling happier after the $7.3bn sale of its aircraft leasing unit to a Japanese bank. But few are probably as happy as those who have worked for Goldman Sachs for the last decade during which the bank has paid its employees a staggering $125bn, twice what it made in net profits.John Casey, Lex publisher
17;ISRG;Intuitive Surg Inc;2012-01-16T23:20:57Z;Intuitive Surgical: cutting the mustard;It is very profitable but it is crucial the company steps up international sales;Intuitive Surgical has the key ingredients of a go-go growth stock: torrid revenue growth, a profitable business model, and robots. The company, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, makes systems that allow doctors to perform minimally invasive surgery while sitting at a video-game like console, using hand controls to manipulate a scope and tools within the patient’s body, by way of four mechanical arms.Revenue growth has averaged 40 per cent over the past five years. The business runs on a razors and blades model, with more than half of the revenue from recurring sales of accessories and from service contracts. It is very profitable, due in part to a near monopoly in robotic surgery, and has $2bn in net cash.All the excitement has left Intuitive shares selling at north of 20 times this year’s estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It has little company at this heady altitude, now that some of the biggest momentum stocks, such as Netflix and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, have cracked. A Capital IQ screen finds only eight other US companies (outside of real estate) valued at more than $10bn trading at 20 times ebitda or higher, including Amazon, Groupon and Salesforce.com.If Intuitive can maintain growth near recent levels, it merits the price tag. But despite being in a defensive sector, a sharp sales slowdown in 2008-2009 shows that the company is sensitive to hospitals’ capital budgets and, therefore, the economy. JPMorgan notes that many of the largest US hospital groups now own Intuitive systems, which, at $1m-$2m apiece, are harder for smaller hospitals to afford. So it is crucial that the company steps up international sales, now just a fifth of the total. If growth slows, the market will perform a very invasive procedure on Intuitive’s stock.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Bristol-Myers rose 2.8 per cent to $20.86 and Medarex soared 89.2 per cent to $15.89.Amazon announced its expansion into the clothing sector with a $928m deal for privately-held Zappos.com, the online shoe retailer.
The shares rose 5.7 per cent to $93.87.Amazon’s rival Ebay further boosted market sentiment after sales and profits topped estimates. The shares climbed 10.6 per cent to $21.52.Two smaller healthcare companies added to Bristol-Myers’ gains, helping the sector outperform the broader market.Rival drugmaker Celgene jumped 18.6 per cent to $55.97 after it beat estimates for its profits and said a test showed that a blood cancer drug could be used earlier in a patients’ treatment than thought.Intuitive Surgical surged 26.8 per cent to $215.37 after profits that were 26 per cent better than analysts’ forecasts as sales of its robotic system for surgery easily beat expectations.Ford showed signs of strength from the US consumer as it reported a smaller operating loss and cash-burn rate than exppected. Its shares gained 9.4 per cent to $6.98.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.3 per cent up at 976.29, while the Dow rose 2.1 per cent to 9,069.29 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.5 per cent to 1,973.60.“The markets broke through a key resistance level,” said Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group. “Now the S&P can get to 1,100 before you get significant resistance.”But Richard Hughes, co-president of Portfolio Management Consultants, warned: “Much of this is fuelled by short covering. Some see signs of stabilisation in spending, but with the exception of tech stocks most companies have not seen revenue growth.”Economic data gave further fuel to the rally. The number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits unexpectedly fell and sales of existing homes rose more than expected.This helped homebuilders rally strongly as DR Horton climbed 7.6 per cent to $11.17 and Lennar gained 6 per cent to $11.26.But the session was dominated by earnings news, with two companies in particular boosting the Dow.Strong sales at 3M helped the maker of Post-It Notes easily beat revenue and profit expectations. The shares picked up 7.4 per cent to $69.43.AT&T, the telecoms company, also beat expectations, helped by strong sales of Apple’s iPhone, which in the US operates only on the AT&T network. The stock advanced 2.6 per cent to $25.48.But McDonald’s injected an element of caution as the restaurant group’s revenues missed Wall Street expectations and analysts warned that its results were a sign of continued weakness from the US consumer. McDonald’s shares fell
4.6 per cent to $56.09.Omnicom, the advertising conglomerate, and UPS, the parcel deliverer, experienced continuing declines in revenue and profits, suggesting business spending remained constrained.But both reversed early losses as the rally gathered steam and Omnicom closed up 0.4 per cent at $34.56 and UPS was 2.3 per cent higher at $53.51.There were mixed results from banks as both Huntington Bancshares and Fifth Third reported their earnings. Investors remain concerned over future write-offs from bad loans. Huntington more than tripling the reserves set aside for such losses and Fifth Third saw an 82 per cent rise in net charge-offs.Huntington fell 4.9 per cent to $3.73 but Fifth Third, which made a smaller operating loss than expected, jumped 14.3 per cent to $8.01."
