0;SYK;Stryker Corp;2019-11-04T12:45:51Z;US medical device maker Stryker to buy Wright Medical ;$5.4bn deal boosts group’s exposure to orthopaedics market;US medical device maker Stryker will buy smaller rival Wright Medical in a deal worth $5.4bn including debt as it seeks to boost its exposure to the fast-growing orthopaedics market. Michigan-headquartered Stryker said on Monday that it would pay $30.75 per share for Wright Medical, a near 40 per cent premium to Friday’s closing share price. The deal has an equity value of $4bn, with a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4bn.Shares in Wright Medical soared 31 per cent to $28.78, while Stryker stock fell 2.9 per cent to $212.77 in pre-market trading in New York. Stryker, which in 2018 denied reports linking it to Boston Scientific, said the acquisition would strengthen its trauma and extremities business “in among the fastest growing segments in orthopaedics”.In particular, the deal should boost the company’s market share in shoulder devices, with Wright’s Simpliciti shoulder-replacement system, where Stryker said an organic path to becoming a category leader would have taken a “long time”. Stryker said it would also benefit from acquiring Blueprint, Wright’s 3D software that helps surgeons plan for operations, which it described as “a unique and strong enabling technology” that gives it a “meaningful competitive advantage”.Founded in 1950, Wright Medical manufactures implants to treat injuries to parts of the body including the shoulders, elbows and ankles, and has recorded global sales approaching $1bn. The deal is the latest in the fast-consolidating medical device industry. Earlier this year 3M agreed to buy wound-care maker Acelity for $6.7bn including debt, while US-based Boston Scientific bought the UK’s BTG for £3.3bn in cash in a deal unveiled one year ago. Stryker has made a string of acquisitions including buying Mobius, which makes an advanced imaging technology, and its sister company for up to $500m in September, and agreeing to spend up to $220m on OrthoSpace, maker of a rotator cuff implant, in March. The deal left Stryker with enough room to make additional “tuck-in” acquisitions if it desired, the company said. “This acquisition enhances our global market position in trauma and extremities, providing significant opportunities to advance innovation, improve outcomes and reach more patients,” said Kevin Lobo, chairman and chief executive officer of Stryker.The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2020 and would have little impact on adjusted earnings that year. Stryker said the acquisition would dilute earnings in 2021 by about 10 per cent before becoming accretive in 2022. Stryker said there could be “meaningful” synergies, saving about $100m to $125m in the first three years after the deal closes. The two companies’ global salesforce had focused on different areas, making their work “complementary”, Stryker said. 
1;SYK;Stryker Corp;2018-06-11T14:58:12Z;Boston Scientific jumps on media report of takeover interest from Stryker;;Boston Scientific shares jumped almost 10 per cent on Monday after a media report Stryker made an approach to purchase the rival maker of medical devices.News of a possible takeover come amid a flurry of dealmaking in the healthcare sector.The shares were recently up 8.3 per cent in mid-morning trade in New York. Monday’s report from The Wall Street Journal triggered a brief volatility halt, according to New York Stock Exchange data.The Journal cautioned in its report, which cited unnamed sources, that it is “unclear” whether Boston Scientific is receptive to the approach.Boston Scientific’s enterprise value, which includes net debt, was $48bn as of Friday, FactSet data show.The group, which makes devices such as medicated stents for cardiac patients, generated $9.05bn in net sales last year.

For years, the medical devices maker has topped brokers’ lists of potential bid candidates. Do not expect the appointment of an industry veteran as the company’s next boss to stop the chatter.Namal Nawana, who sold diagnostics company Alere to Abbott for $5.3bn last year, has experience of both turnrounds and deals. Both may come in handy when he takes over from Olivier Bohuon, in charge at S&N for the last seven years. Over that period, the share price has almost doubled, outperforming the FTSE 100. But it has trailed the MSCI’s World Heathcare Equipment index. Activist investor Elliott Management reportedly took a stake last year.Mr Nawana’s top priority will be replacing those sluggish sales and margins. Revenue growth has trailed rivals, inching ahead by just 15 per cent over the past five years. Margins are about five points lower than some competitors’, in spite of efficiency drives. S&N has more work to do on costs. It spends half its revenues on general overhead; at US peer Stryker, the ratio is just over a third.The problem is partly scale. While Smith & Nephew is the second biggest in sports medicine and wound care, it is in fourth place in both trauma and implants. It is one of the smallest manufacturers in the $14.5bn hip and knee replacement business, which is dominated by Zimmer Biomet, Johnson & Johnson and Stryker. No wonder there has been talk of consolidation. Stryker considered a bid for S&N in 2014, to bolster its position in implants and sports medicine.So far, any buyer interest has been repeatedly dashed by S&N. That might change if Elliott gets its way. It has reportedly pressed the company to offload parts of its business to become a more attractive target. Mr Nawana can fend off the pressure if he turns around the company’s fortunes. If he fails, it could be Smith & Nephew’s turn for surgery.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

The FTSE 100 company has turned to help from advisers at Morgan Stanley and Lazard.Elliott’s campaign is being run out its European division called Elliott Advisors, which is based in London and led by Paul Singer’s son Gordon.The exact size of the $33bn hedge fund’s stake could not be determined, although two of these people said that Elliott had a position of more than 2 per cent in S&N. At that level, it would rank as one of the company’s top seven largest shareholders.The hedge fund’s moves in Europe come as prominent US activists are turning to the continent for more opportunities. European campaigns by US activists have deployed $9.9bn this year, compared with only $2bn last year.This month S&N said it had begun a search for a new chief executive after Olivier Bohuon, who joined the company in 2011 after stints at a number of pharmaceuticals groups including GlaxoSmithKline, announced he would retire by the end of next year.S&N, which reports its next set of results on November 3, said it “does not comment on rumour or speculation and we do not comment on the identity of our investors”. Elliott declined to comment.The UK group has been perennially viewed as a takeover target in recent years, as the medical devices industry has consolidated.The company’s share price has more than doubled over the past five years but it has also underperformed some of its peers, such as Stryker, its larger US-based rival, which in 2014 disclosed that it had been working on a bid for the UK company.Read more: Elliott urges Smith & Nephew to slim down business

Elliott declined to comment.The UK group has been perennially viewed as a takeover target in recent years, as the medical devices industry has consolidated.The company’s share price has more than doubled over the past five years but it has also underperformed some of its peers, such as Stryker, its larger US-based rival, which in 2014 disclosed that it had been working on a bid for the UK company. Over the past year, shares in S&N, which has a market capitalisation of £12.42bn, have risen by more than 14 per cent.Besides Stryker, other leaders in the industry include Johnson & Johnson, which acquired orthopaedic device maker Synthes for $21.3bn in 2012, and Zimmer Biomet, which was formed by a $14bn takeover in 2014. S&N is divided into three franchises: one which focuses on sports medicine, trauma and other surgical businesses, a second focused on reconstruction and a third concentrated on advanced wound management. Each of the divisions showed low single-digit underlying growth — stripping out the impact of currency movements — according to the company’s latest set of results.Geographically by far the company’s strongest performance was in emerging markets, where underlying growth was 13 per cent, compared with 2 per cent in the US. Joe Walters, a fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, which owns shares in S&N, said the company needed to move away from lower growth products and increase sales in emerging markets. He added that the company had a credible management team, pointing to the appointment of Graham Baker, who began in March as chief finance officer from AstraZeneca, and a strong chairman in Roberto Quarta, a private equity executive at Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. Dan Mahony, a life sciences investor from Polar Capital, an investment management company not currently invested in S&N, argued that it needed to make an acquisition to cement a dominant position in one of its areas of operation, suggesting the board may have been too “risk averse” about engaging in M&A. He added: “With the amount of change going on in the industry, I don’t think just trying to keep a status quo and keep a ship steady is a viable option.” Nor had the company displayed sufficient technological innovation, for example in the area of robotics where Stryker had built capability, he said.
5;SYK;Stryker Corp;2017-08-17T18:05:02Z;Medical robotics: code comfort;US specialists will have the lead in event of an arms race;When robots are done displacing car workers they are coming for doctors. The robotic healthcare revolution has already created a near $11bn industry in diagnostics, physical rehabilitation and surgery. Next year, Transparency Market Research expects it to exceed $14bn.For surgery, the appeal is both financial and humane. Robots can make more precise incisions than humans wielding scalpels. Operations are less invasive, meaning quicker recovery times and lower hospital expenses. In 2000 there were 1,000 “robo-surgeries”. By 2015 there were 570,000.For companies, surgical robotics provide a recurring revenue model. After purchasing a system, which can range from $1m-$2.5m, hospitals must buy parts for each operation. Amid the start-ups, two listed companies stand out. California-based Intuitive Surgical, whose da Vinci Robotic Surgical System has operated on more than 3m patients, and Stryker which bought surgical robotics platform MAKO in late 2013 for $1.65bn — an 86 per cent premium.Valuations are high. Stryker trades at 22 times forward earnings. Intuitive Surgical at 39 times. Both, however, are valued far below technology company multiples and are already profitable. Their values are justified if growth trajectory is good — which it is. Ageing baby boomers with weakening knees and chronic conditions need more surgery. Global health systems must reduce costs.The catalyst is not just due to demographic shifts. China’s medical technology ambitions over the next decade should also offer a spur, as the country invests in robots of its own. A robotic arms race could be coming. If so, these two US specialists have already got a lead. Intuitive Surgical has hundreds of patent applications pending.The public adores humanoid robots that bumblingly attempt general tasks. Robot arms whose form reflect their function are less popular. But these surgical robots have a touch delicate enough to stitch up a cut in a grape — or a person. That is more useful than being able to stand on two legs.The Lex team is interested in hearing from readers. Would you be happy for a robot to operate on you? Do robotic surgery companies offer an appealing intersection between healthcare and tech stocks? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.

Perhaps that was an invitation for investors to step back in.”New money was directed primarily to funds investing in US equities, with those accounts counting $3.4bn of inflows. International equity funds based in the US attracted $1.1bn of fresh money.Taxable bond funds saw $5.8bn of inflows, including $1.8bn directed to junk bond funds and a further $2.2bn into investment grade debt portfolios. Leveraged loan funds counted a net inflow for the first time in 33 weeks.The rally in risk assets has provided an opening for the sale of new debt, with Berkshire Hathaway, ConocoPhillips, Stryker, Citigroup and a subsidiary of Nissan Motor completing multibillion-dollar deals in the past two weeks.Investors funded those moves in part by a shift out of Treasury funds. Portfolios invested in US government paper recorded $326m of redemptions in the last week.European and Japanese focused equity funds were also hit by the sixth consecutive week of withdrawals, as investors rotate out of two of last year’s top performing trades.After tumbling as much as 11 per cent since the year began, US stocks have staged a significant rally. The benchmark S&P 500 finished Thursday less than 3 per cent lower for the year. By contrast, Italian, German and Japanese equity bourses remain more than 10 per cent lower this year.Cameron Brandt, director of research for EPFR, noted that investors were “steering clear of fund groups that include quantitative easing among their tailwinds”.He added that the decision from the European Central Bank to increase stimulus measures had done “nothing” for equity and bond funds within the continent.Fund flows tracked by EPFR showed that investors continued to increase exposure to emerging markets at the start of March, with flows into global emerging market funds hitting the highest level since the end of 2013.The rapid moves have surprised portfolio managers. The threat of a deflation scare in China and recession in the US had driven investors to the sidelines, with fund managers reporting their highest holdings of cash in February since November 2001, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data showed.US figures last week showed the labour market remained on a solid footing in February, with the unemployment rate stable at 4.9 per cent as 242,000 jobs were created.“If you look at the economic surprises, we’re seeing surprises in both consumer and housing [sectors],” Mr Ablin said. “We’re not firing on all cylinders but we are firing on a couple of important ones.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
7;SYK;Stryker Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Pharma M&A for 2016 continues to surge;As Abbott and Stryker of the US announce deals, FT data show pharma dealmaking jumps to $56bn;Despite suffering a sharp sell-off in January, global healthcare companies’ appetite for mergers and acquisitions is far from over as deal activity has more than doubled to $56bn compared with a year ago, according to a Financial Times’ analysis. Abbott Laboratories, the US healthcare heavyweight, was the latest to strike a deal after it announced on Monday it had agreed to acquire Alere, a diagnostic group, for $5.8bn. On the same day, US medical device group Stryker also unveiled a $2.8bn deal to buy Sage, which makes products to prevent infections in hospitals.The brisk deal activity — up from $20.5bn during the same period a year ago — comes despite healthcare and biotech stocks suffering extreme volatility in the first month of the year, usually a deterrent to any dealmaking.The S&P healthcare index is down more than 8 per cent since January 1, while the Nasdaq biotech index has dropped nearly 22 per cent. Bankers advising healthcare companies said many of their clients, especially those that did not strike a deal in 2015, were very focused on M&A this year. “The correction in the market is more of an opportunity than anything else for many large healthcare companies as they have plenty of cash and valuations have suddenly become more attractive,” said an adviser to some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the US. Overall M&A activity in the healthcare sector hit a record $724bn last year, up 66 per cent from $436bn in 2014, and representing about a fifth of all transactions. Abbott will pay Alere shareholders $56 a share to take control of a company that specialises in medical tests for infectious diseases, such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue. Alere will become a subsidiary of Abbott in a deal that is expected to result in annual pre-tax synergies of $500m by 2019.Stryker said that the acquisition of Sage, which makes products for oral care, skin preparation and patient hygiene, would generate future tax benefits worth about $500m.The largest deal of the year so far is Shire’s $32bn takeover of Baxalta. UK-listed drugmaker’s cash and stock transaction valued Baxalta at $45.57 a share, representing a 37.5 per cent premium over the US company’s share price before the initial takeover approach was made public in August.

Operating income, which excludes certain items, rose 12 per cent year on year to $1.37 a share, easily beating estimates of $1.21.Aetna’s bottom line received a lift from a reduction in medical care spending. The proportion of premiums paid in healthcare costs fell from 83 per cent to 81.9 per cent as its medical benefit ratio in the government and commercial segments dipped.Mark Bertolini, chief executive, said the group was “on track” to complete its buyout of fellow health insurerHumana in the second half. The pact, which was unveiled in 2015, would deepen exposure to the Medicare market, where its plans supplement those offered to the elderly by the US government.Aetna’s shares rose 1.50 per cent to $103.37 by the close, bringing their 12-month advance to around 12 per cent.Elsewhere healthcare companies were in focus after another batch of deals were announced.Shares in Alere, a provider of diagnostic tests, surged almost 45.5 per cent to $54.11 after industry heavyweight Abbott Laboratories agreed to acquire it for $56 a share.Under the deal, which will give Alere an equity value of $5.8bn, Abbott will assume about $2.6bn of its debt. Abbott expected the acquisition to lift its total diagnostics sales to more than $7bn.Not all deals received a thumbs-up from shareholders. Shares in Stryker, the medical device company, fell earlier in the day after it announced a deal to buy Sage Products, which makes care products, for $2.78bn. They closed almost flat.Twitter, the short messaging service, closed up 6.61 per cent to $17.91 after a report said Marc Andreessen and Silver Lake had “considered some sort of deal”. However, a source close to Silver Lake dismissed the report, which had appeared in The Information.The shares have halved during the past 12 months as a management overhaul has done little to assuage investor concerns over user growth.Dominion Resources came under pressure after the midsized US electricity and gas distributor unveiled plans to buy smaller rival Questar for $4.4bn. In a sign that Dominion’s all-cash offer of $25 a share might be too rich for investors, the stock fell 2.76 per cent to $70.18.Shares in Questar jumped 22.56 per cent to $24.99.Aluminium producer Alcoa added to its 14-month rout, dropping 1.10 per cent to $7.21 as news that Elliott Management was supporting its board nominees failed to lift sentiment. The stock’s losses for the past 12 months exceed 54 per cent.By the close the S&P 500 was almost flat at 1,938.85, the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged down to 16,444.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was slightly up at 4,619.53.
9;SYK;Stryker Corp;2016-02-01T13:30:27Z;Abbott expands presence in diagnostic testing with Alere deal;;More wheelings and dealings in the pharmaceutical industry on Monday.Abbott Laboratories, the US healthcare heavyweight, is extending its presence in diagnostic testing with the acquisition of Massachusetts-based Alere for $56 a share.The offer, which represents a 50 per cent premium to Alere’s closing price on Friday, would give the diagnostic test specialist an equity value of $5.8bn. Abbott will also assume Alere’s net debt of $2.6bn.Miles D. White, Abbott’s CEO said:The combination of Alere and Abbott will create the world’s premier point of care testing business and significantly strengthen and grow Abbott’s diagnostics presence.The deal is expected to lift Abbott’s total diagnostics sales to more than $7bn a year.For Alere, the sale to Abbott caps a turbulent two years at the company.Alere, which which provides rapid diagnostic tests for infectious disease and toxicology, has been hit by a string of senior departures, including its founding chief executive and top scientist, soon after pulling the UK initial public offering of its BBI Diagnostics Group subsidiary in 2014.Also on Monday, medical device company Stryker agreed to buy Sage, which makes care products, for $2.8bn.

Volume, at nearly six times the daily average, was the highest in more than four years.An afternoon sell-off led the FTSE 100 lower by 51.51 points to 6,889.13, a 0.7 per cent decline.Builders’ merchant Travis Perkins lost 4 per cent to £19.44 after results showed store refits weighing on profit at its largest division. “Broadly in line but nothing incrementally positive,” summarised RBC.RSA Insurance faded 3.2 per cent to 420.2p as broker downgrades followed its annual results on Thursday.“We have lost our conviction that RSA’s turnround will lead to marked outperformance over the next 12-18 months,” said Sanford Bernstein.“Previous management not only ripped the capital base but failed to adequately invest in essential business capabilities and left more accounting holes to fix than expected, in our view. We hence expect the turnround to take far longer than we originally anticipated.”British Airways owner IAG fell 3.1 per cent to 556p after Cantor Fitzgerald advised taking profit.Margin expansion guidance for 2015 “could prove challenging, particularly if premium passenger demand and yields weaken”, Cantor told clients.In-line results meant Moneysupermarket, the price comparison website, lost 9 per cent to 243.4p.Management noted tough comparison periods for the next two quarters and flagged an unexpected £4.5m amortisation charge to cover technology investment.Among the gainers, Taylor Wimpey was up 2.1 per cent to 147.9p. A healthy market meant recent trading had been at the top end of expectations, justifying a more than doubled dividend, the housebuilder said.Pace gained 8.1 per cent to 363p after raising 2015 guidance. Having hit targets for its strategic plan a year early, the set top box maker said “significant opportunities remain for further improvement”.
11;SYK;Stryker Corp;2015-02-05T18:50:20Z;Smith & Nephew ‘can prosper on its own’;Medical devices CEO brushes away takeover talk;Smith & Nephew can prosper as a standalone company, its chief executive has insisted, brushing away takeover speculation surrounding the UK medical device maker.Olivier Bohuon cited growth in the highly competitive US market for hip and knee implants as proof the company could survive on its own.“Despite what many people say about needing to be big, we have beaten the market in knees and hips,” he said.“If you are able to bring innovative products to market that meet unmet needs you can have a great future and that’s what we’re doing.”S&N has been widely seen as a potential acquisition target since Stryker of the US acknowledged last May that it had been in the early stages of preparing for a possible bid, before calling a halt to the plans.Much like the pharmaceuticals sector, medical device manufacturers have been embroiled in a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the past year as they seek greater scale and growth.Medtronic of the US last month completed its near-$50bn takeover of Ireland-based Covidien and Zimmer last year bought Biomet for $13.4bn.S&N made its own acquisition with the $1.7bn purchase of ArthroCare, a Texas-based specialist in high-margin surgical devices to treat sports injuries.Mr Bohuon said he was looking for more bolt-on deals, but his main focus was organic growth from the burgeoning sports medicine business and emerging markets, where revenues increased 17 per cent last year.In countries such as China and South Africa, he said, demand for implants and other devices was spreading beyond the wealthiest elite to the growing middle classes.Fourth-quarter revenues rose 2 per cent to $1.25bn, producing earnings per share of 25.6 cents, up 9 per cent and beating market expectations. Shares in S&N closed up 2.6 per cent at £11.98. They have gained 37 per cent in the past year.Alex Olvera, analyst at Makor Securities, said in a report this week that a renewed Stryker bid for S&N was likely. “Stryker needs to acquire if they are to maintain positioning and profitability.”Mr Bohuon declined to comment on the possibility of an offer, other than to say it would be up to the board to decide what is in the best interest of shareholders.
12;SYK;Stryker Corp;2015-01-11T18:48:57Z;UBS loses two blue-chip corporate broking clients;Swiss bank suffers further blow after scandals as BAE Systems and Smith & Nephew look elsewhere;UBS has lost two more blue-chip corporate broking clients, in a further blow to the Swiss bank as it seeks to restore its image after recent scandals.BAE Systems, the UK defence group, and Smith & Nephew, the medical equipment company, have both dropped UBS as a corporate broking adviser. Last year, the Swiss bank lost the corporate broking mandate of two other FTSE 100 companies: Standard Chartered and Anglo American.Neither company would comment on its decision to replace UBS. However, people familiar with the situation confirmed the moves.Smith & Nephew had launched a review of its advisers late last year, amid market rumours that US peer Stryker was considering a bid. It decided to replace UBS with Bank of America Merrill Lynch as joint broker from this month. JPMorgan Cazenove was retained as its other joint broker. StanChart also replaced UBS with BofA.BAE chose Morgan Stanley as its corporate broking adviser, in place of UBS.Corporate broking is a largely British tradition, whereby banks act as intermediaries between companies and their shareholders. They help foster good relationships with investors and can drum up support for capital raising, and mergers and acquisitions activity.Corporate broking fees are nominal but there is an expectation that companies will turn to their corporate brokers for more lucrative capital markets or M&A work. UBS has seen the number of its broking clients fall from 77 to 60 over the past two years. But a person close to UBS said that the bank was deliberately concentrating on key broking clients. “Some will move on as a result,” the person said.In November, UBS was one of six banks to settle with global regulators investigating allegations of manipulation in the $5.3tn a day foreign exchange market.
13;SYK;Stryker Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;UK lesson for Stryker and Pfizer;;Twice in two weeks, US companies interested in buying UK groups have walked away after coming up against British takeover rules.On Wednesday, Stryker, the medical device maker, said it did not intend to make an offer for Smith & Nephew. Just days earlier Pfizer had abandoned efforts to engage with AstraZeneca on its £55 per share approach to the British pharma group.The two cases are different, but in each instance, the deadline for the possible acquirer to “put up or shut up” was significant. And in each case, the potential bidder seemed to be expecting the takeover regime to facilitate deal discussions, but its effect was to curtail talks.Stryker’s statement came as Smith & Nephew’s share price rose 17 per cent after the Financial Times reported that the US orthopaedic products group was working on a bid. So the Takeover Panel, which regulates the dealmaking process, said Stryker had to be clear about its intentions.Even though Stryker had been in the early stages of preparing an approach, if the US group had said it intended to bid, it would have had just 28 days to make a formal offer.Likewise, Pfizer also had only 28 days to strike a deal or secure AstraZeneca’s agreement for more talks after going public with its approach on April 28.As Pfizer’s May 26 deadline approached, the US group described its £55 per share approach as “final”, and it was the use of the technical term “final” which limited the US group’s room for manoeuvre and clouded its intentions.“I think they must just have been under a lot of pressure,” says one seasoned practitioner.Some lawyers say that the 28-day deadline was uniquely difficult in the Pfizer-AZ situation, because Pfizer had the additional burdens of navigating UK politics and dealing with questions from AZ about how the change in tax jurisdictions under the proposed inversion would work.The end result was that even though some AZ shareholders were keen to enter discussions, they could not convince the board to talk to Pfizer and so keep the process going, before the time limit on its “virtual bid” expired.Hewlett-Packard’s $11bn acquisition of Autonomy may not seem to be a likely advertisement for US takeovers of UK companies, mired in acrimony as it has become.But it is an example of how an American group can execute a significant takeover of a UK blue-chip company.Continue …That 28-day deadline was brought in after criticism of how the previous rules worked during Kraft’s $17bn protracted takeover of Cadbury from September 2009.Over several weeks, the US food group was able to besiege the UK confectioner, but the 60-day take­over timetable did not begin until it made a formal offer.It highlighted how an extended “virtual” bid could both destabilise the day-to-day business and lead to big changes on the share register.After the deal, Sir Roger Carr, then chairman of Cadbury, said that increase in the proportion of hedge funds among Cadbury’s shareholders was a weakness for the group, as he believed they were likely to sell to Kraft.At the time, some politicians argued for stronger protections for target groups, such as moving away from the UK one-share-one-vote principle to favour the views of longer-term shareholders. But the Panel resisted such radical changes, and many in the City believe it struck the right balance.Selina Sagayam, a partner at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, says: “Procedural changes to the takeover code since Kraft and Cadbury have had the effect of increasing execution risks for bidders, but the impact has varied depending on the type of bidder or type of transaction.”Procedural changes to the takeover code since Kraft and Cadbury have had the effect of increasing execution risks for biddersMs Sagayam, who was seconded to the Panel for two years and advised on Kraft on its acquisition of Cadbury, says that the changes have had the most impact on private equity bidders or in situations involving a cross-border hostile acquirer.The new rules are challenging for private equity, which can find it burdensome to arrange financing in such a short window, lawyers say. Cross-border hostile bids must navigate rules across many jurisdictions, adding to complexity.But practitioners generally say it is up to advisers to familiarise themselves with regulatory requirements and that deals usually stand or fall on value.Piers Prichard Jones, a partner at international law firm Freshfields, says: “The rules were designed to help targets defend themselves, and have achieved this. At the margin, they may deter some would-be bidders.“But I wouldn’t say the rules or the way the Panel administers them are typically the cause of bids failing to get off the ground or announced bids falling over. What usually causes an announced bid to fall over is the bidder failing to get sufficient board and/or shareholder support.”
14;SYK;Stryker Corp;2014-05-29T18:21:00Z;Smith & Nephew pushed into deal frenzy;;Smith & Nephew was pushed firmly into the deal frenzy gripping the healthcare industry on Thursday after its US rival Stryker said it had been evaluating a takeover bid for the UK medical device maker.The confirmation that a potential deal had been under consideration caused Smith & Nephew shares to rise 3.6 per cent in London, adding to gains made on Wednesday.Stryker’s decision to make public its interest marked an unusual twist at the end of a day in which the company had responded to a report in the Financial Times by issuing a statement ruling out making an unsolicited bid in the next six months.Smith & Nephew’s stock had surged more than 17 per cent to £11.20 on Wednesday after the FT published a story saying Stryker had hired banks and was working on arranging finance for a possible bid. Stryker’s statement sent the shares back to £10.29.However, in an interview with Fox Business late on Wednesday, Kevin Lobo, Stryker’s chief executive, said: “We were actually in preliminary evaluations about considering a transaction.”He added that following Smith & Nephew’s price rise, Stryker was contacted by the UK Takeover Panel and under its rules had to make a statement about its intentions.“It was [at an] early [stage], but based on the price spike of Smith & Nephew we were called by the panel and we had to make this public statement.”An acquisition of Smith & Nephew would cut Stryker’s tax bill using a so-called inversion, under which a US company uses a foreign takeover to relocate its headquarters, thus sheltering overseas revenues from US taxation.To qualify for the inversion, at least 20 per of the shares in the combined company would need to be held outside the US, meaning Stryker, which makes hip and spine implants, would need to fund a large proportion of any bid with its own stock.Smith & Nephew would be the second big UK healthcare company to face takeover interest from a US rival within weeks, after Pfizer’s failed £69.4bn offer for AstraZeneca – another deal that was driven in part by potential tax savings.Smith & Nephew has declined to comment on the process.A bid by Stryker would have added to the wave of dealmaking in the healthcare sector, with more than $150bn of mergers and acquisitions proposed so far this year.
15;SYK;Stryker Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Smith & Nephew shares rise after Stryker confirms bid work;;Shares of Smith & Nephew rose 2.7 per cent in early trading on Thursday after the chief executive of Stryker confirmed that the US medical devices maker had been evaluating a bid for its UK rival.Smith & Nephew’s stock had surged more than 17 per cent to £11.20 on Wednesday morning after the Financial Times reported that Stryker had hired banks and was working on arranging finance for a possible bid.The shares then fell back after Stryker put out a statement that “it does not intend to make an offer” for the UK group.However Kevin Lobo, Stryker’s chief executive, has confirmed his company had been in the early stages of considering a transaction. He said that following the UK company’s price rise, it was contacted by the UK Takeover Panel and under its rules had to make a statement about its intentions.“We were actually in preliminary evaluations about considering a transaction,” Mr Lobo told Fox Business. “It was [at an] early [stage], but based on the price spike of Smith & Nephew we were called by the panel and we had to make this public statement.”Smith & Nephew’s shares were trading at £10.20 in London on Thursday morning.In the statement on Wednesday, Stryker said it reserved the right, under certain circumstances, to “participate in an offer or possible offer for Smith & Nephew and/or to take any other action”.UK takeover rules prohibit Stryker from making a bid for six months unless recommended by Smith & Nephew’s board.An acquisition of Smith & Nephew would cut Stryker’s tax bill using a so-called inversion, under which a US company uses a foreign takeover to relocate its headquarters, thus sheltering overseas revenues from US taxation.To qualify for the inversion, at least 20 per of the shares in the combined company would need to be held outside the US, meaning Stryker, which makes hip and spine implants, would need to fund a large proportion of any bid with its own stock.Smith & Nephew would have been the second big UK healthcare company to face takeover interest from a US rival within weeks, after Pfizer’s failed £69.4bn offer for AstraZeneca – another deal that was driven in part by potential tax savings.Smith & Nephew declined to comment.A bid by Stryker would have added to the wave of dealmaking in the healthcare sector, with more than $150bn of mergers and acquisitions proposed so far this year.While much of the activity has been among drugmakers, the medical device sector has already seen one blockbuster transaction with April’s $13.35bn deal between Zimmer, the maker of the joint replacement technology, and Biomet.Smith & Nephew has also been involved in its own dealmaking with the announcement in February of a $1.7bn agreed takeover of AthroCare, a Texan medical devices company.Smith & Nephew shares eased back to £10.63, valuing the UK group at about £9.5bn.Consolidation in the healthcare sector reflects pressure to increase competitiveness as governments and healthcare providers try to push down prices. Other big players in the medical devices market include Johnson & Johnson of the US.Smith & Nephew is one of the world’s biggest makers of joint replacements, with 11,000 employees in more than 90 countries and revenues of $4.3bn in 2013. It also makes products for wound management, repair of broken bones and surgery.The group’s history dates back more than 150 years to a small pharmacy opened in Hull in 1865 by Thomas James Smith and later inherited by his nephew Horatio Nelson Smith. The company still has a big manufacturing presence in Hull in the north of England.Under the leadership of Olivier Bohuon, chief executive, Smith & Nephew has been diversifying into faster-growing businesses to offset sluggish demand for its replacement hip and knee joints.After the Biomet acquisition was announced, Mr Bohuon said he felt Smith & Nephew could benefit from consolidation among its rivals. “It gives us huge opportunities . . . whether in new talent leaving the [combined] company, or business disruption.”With additional reporting by Lindsay WhippThis article has been ammended to correct an error about Zimmer Holdings’ business.
16;SYK;Stryker Corp;2013-12-09T23:41:57Z;Carl Icahn forces his way into Hologic’s boardroom;;Activist investor Carl Icahn has forced his way on to another board – medical diagnostics group Hologic.Two Icahn representatives will join the board of the Massachusetts-based company as part of a settlement that headed off the threat of a proxy battle at the next annual shareholder meeting.Shares in Hologic slipped, however, because the company also appointed a new chief executive – Stephen MacMillan, former head of the device-maker Stryker – in a move that dashed hopes that Mr Icahn might prompt the group quickly to put itself up for sale.“I clearly was not brought in here to sell the business,” Mr MacMillan said. “My energy is on growing it, and Mr Icahn and I are aligned. This is a company with good assets that can be run better.”Hologic began courting Mr MacMillan in October, several weeks before Mr Icahn turned up on the investor register through a derivatives position that gave him a 12.6 per cent stake in the company.Mr Icahn, who in recent weeks has trumpeted the value that his representatives can add to share price performance when they join corporate boards, welcomed the appointment of Mr MacMillan. “We are enthusiastic about and supportive of the appointment,” he said.“He has extensive industry experience and a record of delivering strong financial results and creating shareholder value,” he added.The two Icahn representatives joining the board are Jonathan Christodoro and Samuel Merksamer, both managing directors at Icahn Capital.The activist investor had not made specific demands over the strategic direction of the company, according to people with knowledge of his approaches to board members. Mr Icahn spoke to Mr MacMillan for the first time only on Saturday.Mr MacMillan was forced out of Stryker in February 2012 after seven years at the helm, after revealing to the board that he had a relationship with the flight attendant on the corporate jet. He was previously talked about as a rising star chief executive and a possible contender to run Johnson & Johnson.David LaVance, Hologic chairman, said: “Steve led Stryker to strong operating performance, including nearly tripling revenue, and delivered stock price appreciation that significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index.”Mr MacMillan replaces Jack Cumming, a former chief of Hologic, who had returned to run the company this year and to launch a review of its businesses.
17;SYK;Stryker Corp;2012-02-06T20:00:32Z;Smith & Nephew in $22m bribes fine;;US regulators have fined Smith & Nephew $22m for bribing Greek doctors to use its products over the past decade, in an intensifying series of actions against healthcare companies for corruption that took place in foreign countries.The UK-based medical devices company agreed to a settlement with the Department of Justice and the appointment of an official to supervise its compliance procedures over the coming 18 months.The action follows a similar $77m settlement by regulators with Johnson & Johnson last year concerning bribes paid in Greece, Poland, Romania and Iraq, with at least another dozen healthcare companies under investigation for violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.It comes as officials struggle to restructure Greece’s public sector after years during which corruption and mismanagement helped substantially inflate use of medical products.Charges filed by the justice department alleged that Smith & Nephew oversaw a system that channelled more than $9m in bribes through a maze of offshore companies to persuade Greek surgeons to use its artificial hips and knees. The network was one of several unearthed during a probe by the US in 2007 into corruption by medical device groups in Greece, with probes continuing against rivals including Biomet, Stryker, Zimmer and Medtronic.In an email cited by prosecutors, Smith & Nephew’s Greek distributor, who controlled three offshore shell companies designed to strip out up to 40 per cent of the nominal sale price for commissions, justified the system to a senior US executive, saying competitors were paying 30-40 per cent more. “I absolutely need this fund to promote my sales with surgeons, at a time when competition offers substantially higher rates,” he wrote in 2002, describing the cash incentives as “a real pain in the neck but an unavoidable fact of Greek life”. He added: “I am paying cash incentives right after each surgery.”As a result of the probe, Smith & Nephew also identified separate problems with Plus, another orthopaedics company that it acquired in 2008, leading to substantial restructuring.Olivier Bohuon, Smith & Nephew’s chief executive, said: “These legacy issues do not reflect Smith & Nephew today. But they underscore that we must remain vigilant every place we do business and let nothing compromise our commitment to integrity.”The system described by prosecutors shows the supply of orthopaedic products by Smith & Nephew’s German subsidiary with manufacturing operations in Greece via its Greek distributor who used shell companies to receive a share of sales for “promotion support” and “marketing” although no true services were provided in exchange.

The broker argued that, though growth for the domestic banks had stalled, investors anticipating a repeat of the 2008 crisis were being too pessimistic.Current valuations have priced in returns below the cost of equity into perpetuity, Deutsche said. “We are cautious on our ability to precisely call a turn, we think the value proposition is clear,” it told clients.With domestic lenders trading at about half their tangible net asset value, they could afford to write off half of their exposure to Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece combined, Deutsche said. The broker also argued that capital deficit fears were misplaced as the government’s stakes in RBS and Lloyds would complicate forced recapitalisation.Its share price targets were 35p for RBS and 70p for Lloyds, which gained 7.8 per cent to 32p. Barclays, ahead 6.7 per cent to 165½p, was Deutsche’s top pick in the UK sector.The wider market played catch-up following Monday’s holiday with the FTSE 100 closing up 2.7 per cent, or 138.74 points, to 5,268.66. Risers outnumbered fallers by 20-to-1, though volume was light.Rising metals prices led the miners higher. Lonmin was the day’s top performer, up 8.5 per cent to £12.75. Vedanta Resources rose 7.3 per cent to £13.37 and Fresnillo gained 6.4 per cent to £19.99.Smith & Nephew was up 3.9 per cent to 596½p, helped by a retread of theories that US rival Stryker might make a bid approach.Deutsche provided a less speculative reason for S&N’s strength, starting coverage of the medical devices maker with “buy“ advice and a 775p target.“We think investors have over-discounted the temporary slowdown in S&N’s sales and earnings growth outlook and have not priced in material improvements in its ability to generate cash in the last few years,” Deutsche said.Defensive stocks slid. Reckitt Benckiser fell 0.3 per cent to £31.98 and GlaxoSmithKline lost 0.2 per cent to £12.87.Tesco retreated 0.2 per cent to 364¾p amid a retread of speculation that the supermarket could bid for Pick n , South Africa’s second-largest retailer. Pick n Pay denied in June that it was talking to Tesco.Vodafone edged up 0.4 per cent to 162½ after the company confirmed it was talking to Wind Hellas, Greece’s third-biggest mobile operator, about a “business combination” but denied reports that it would offer €1bn cash.The potential acquisition – a rarity for Vodafone since Vittorio Colao took over as chief executive in 2008 – led to speculation that the group may also be interested in consolidation of similarly challenged markets such as Spain, Italy, Portugal and the UK.Bunzl put on 7.9 per cent to 779p after the cleaning and catering supplies group accompanied better than expected half-year results with the disposal of its UK vending machine business.The share price gain put Bunzl in the running to join the FTSE 100 in the next index reshuffle, due to be announced on September 7.Other stocks in line for promotion to the blue-chips were Ashmore Group (up 5.8 per cent to 384½p), Meggitt (up 3 per cent to 336p), and Mondi (up 5.6 per cent to 535½p).

20;SYK;Stryker Corp;2011-07-18T18:16:20Z;Medical Devices;The industry once seemed to have it all;"Medical cost inflation may be out of control, but it is not showing up on the income statements of medical device makers. For many of the most important products – pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, orthopaedic implants, spinal implants and cardiac stents – revenue growth has slowed or turned negative over the past few years. Recent company reports show the trend continues.The industry once seemed to have it all: a demographic tailwind from an ageing rich world, defensiveness, exciting scientific innovation. Yet share performance in the past two years has been mixed, with firms focused on pacemakers/defibrillators and stents (Medtronic, St. Jude, Boston Scientific) underperforming badly while orthopaedic specialists (Stryker, Smith & Nephew, and Zimmer) have fared better.All these companies offer newer, fast-growing products, but few of these are likely to be as large as those that are struggling: Bernstein Research pegs global annual sales of pacemakers and defibrillators at $11bn; replacement hips and knees at $13bn. The faster-growing trauma market, for example, totals just $5bn.What is going on? In stents and spinal devices, debates over the strength of the underlying clinical data are reflected in slowing sales. In general, though, despite the secular forces pushing up demand, and the apparent non-discretionary nature of its products, the industry turns out to be surprisingly cyclical. The economic downturn has hurt. Patients’ insurance co-payments and deductibles, loss of job-based coverage and tougher negotiations with strapped hospitals are taking their toll. The critical question is whether economic recovery would restore the industry to health – or whether the crisis has taught doctors, hospitals and patients that they can get by without shelling out for the very latest medical gizmo.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
21;SYK;Stryker Corp;2011-04-20T19:10:48Z;Xstrata leads miners upwards on hopes of Glencore merger;;Takeover hopes helped lift Xstrata as the FTSE 100 registered its biggest daily gain of the year so far.Xstrata rose 4.9 per cent to £15.27 after house broker JPMorgan Cazenove argued in favour of a merger with Glencore, its largest shareholder. Glencore’s flotation next month forms a conflict of interest and, with Xstrata focused on its own growth strategy, the burden is on Glencore to find a resolution, said analyst David Butler.“The market, we believe, is now reacting to this conundrum, which may result in an M&A risk discount for Glencore and a takeover premium for Xstrata,” he said.To merge Xstrata’s operational expertise with Glencore’s commodity trading business would form a company with an unrivalled reach that could go on to pursue other targets, said Mr Butler. “We have yet to see Xstrata management in full defence mode,” he added.JPMorgan upgraded Xstrata to “outperform” with a £20 target price. The rest of the miners climbed as a weaker dollar lifted metals prices. Anglo American, considered by some to be the most likely target for a merged Glencore-Xstrata, was up 4 per cent to £31.75 and Rio Tinto rose 3.2 per cent to £43.66.Ferrexpo, the Ukraine iron ore producer, gained 5.7 per cent to 464p on a rumour of predatory interest, with Vale and Rio mentioned as potential bidders.Any deal would require the backing of Ukrainian billionaire Kostyantin Zhevago, Ferrexpo’s 51 per cent shareholder, traders noted.Better-than-expected earnings by a host of US companies helped to lift the wider market, sending the FTSE 100 up 2.1 per cent, or 125.39 points, to 6,022.26.Arm Holdings was up 5.7 per cent to 271¾p after Intel, its would-be rival, beat forecasts on emerging markets demand.Analysts also argued that Intel’s guidance had reinforced Arm’s insurmountable competitive advantage, with the US group pushing out plans to release a mobile phone chip from this year to “within the next 12 months”.Arm’s own first-quarter results are due next Wednesday, with supply chain disruption in Japan representing the chief concern for investors. “Any caution on prospects could prompt share price weakness,” said Société Générale, noting the shares were trading at 75 times 2011 earnings, factoring in employee bonuses.In spite of trading ex-dividend, GKN rose 5.6 per cent to 204¾p as RBC and Investec raised earnings forecasts in response to the engineer’s capital markets day last week. RBC, which also upgraded the stock to “buy”, said management had been upbeat on aerospace sales in 2011 and reassuring about auto driveline demand.Reckitt Benckiser, an underperformer since the unexpected retirement last week of its chief executive, bounced 3.9 per cent to £31.98. Quarterly earnings from the soap maker matched market expectations and came with unchanged guidance for 2011, with Reckitt’s heroin substitute providing the main positive. It said its film formulation of the Suboxone treatment, which unlike the standard product remains patent-protected, accounted for 37 per cent of US volumes.Smith & Nephew was among the few blue-chip fallers, down 0.7 per cent to 676p. Results from DePuy, Johnson & Johnson’s orthopaedics division, and Stryker, both highlighted slowing demand for replacement knees, an important product segment for S&N.Ocado led the mid-cap fallers after a press report that Waitrose, its sole supplier, was preparing to expand its own delivery service in London. Ocado lost 3.1 per cent to 231½p.The rest of the sector gained, with Home Retail Group up 5.5 per cent to 218½p on a short squeeze after full-year results from the Argos owner were no worse than feared.A resilient performance by Homebase, Home Retail’s DIY arm, helped closest peer Kingfisher add 3.8 per cent to 278p. Traders also noted that sterling’s weakness against the euro would help its French unit.
22;SYK;Stryker Corp;2011-02-10T20:51:20Z;Smith & Nephew appoints new chief;;Smith & Nephew took the markets by surprise on Thursday with the departure of its chief executive, as the medical devices company reported stronger-than-expected full-year earnings.David Illingworth, appointed four years ago, will be replaced in April by Olivier Bohuon, an executive drawn from the pharmaceutical industry including most recently a stint of less than six months running Pierre Fabre, a drugmaker based in south-west France.The appointment helped lift shares in Smith & Nephew by 15p to 727p after a surge in recent weeks triggered by speculation that the company was subject to takeover proposals, which some analysts argued would now be dampened.Mr Bohuon, who previously worked in senior positions at GlaxoSmithKline and Abbott, brings experience that will prove important at a time when the medical devices sector is facing increased regulation, as already experienced by the drugs industry.The company lifted pre-tax profits by a third to $895m (£555m) in the year to end-December on sales up 4 per cent to $3.96bn. Fast growth in endoscopy and advanced wound management offset sluggish expansion in orthopaedics, Smith & Nephew’s biggest product line. Emerging market sales compensated for falls in Europe and the US.Mr Illingworth told the Financial Times he had been working on a succession plan for some time.He is returning to the US, although he has no alternative job lined up. “This was a personal decision and my decision,” he said. “The company is in great shape. We have gone through four years of a change in culture and have just come off some of the best results in a long time.”He said “we have a strategy that we can leave in a place for a while”, while adding that with his the appointment of his successor, “I’m a realist. He will look, maintain a lot of things we have worked hard at but have some ideas on what to improve.”Mr Illingworth restructured the company and expanded its sales in emerging markets. He said that Smith & Nephew would be launching products tailored to such countries.FT CommentMr Illingworth’s surprise departure leaves plenty of questions over the future of the company, while suggesting neither he nor the board is keen on a takeover. His legacy in restructuring Smith & Nephew, shifting to higher-value products and expanding in emerging markets, has helped offset the damping effect on discretionary spending in slower growth industrialised countries. Smith & Nephew has consistently outperformed expectations, but it is less clear whether it will outperform its peers in the longer term. Trading at about 16 times 2011 earnings, the shares look a little expensive for its niche market, reflecting continued takeover speculation that now looks a little hasty.
23;SYK;Stryker Corp;2011-01-17T23:03:09Z;Deal talk stimulates demand for S&N;;City analysts covering Smith & Nephew have never been so popular. Over the past week, they have been bombarded by calls from clients demanding information on the UK medical devices maker, which has been the subject of takeover speculation.The chatter continued over the weekend, with Smith & Nephew shares rising 3.5 per cent on Monday to 709p in response. Since the start of December 2010, the shares have risen almost 20 per cent.There are sound reasons why the stock is being targeted. Venkat Rajan, medical devices manager at research firm Frost & Sullivan, says: “Smith & Nephew is very strong, with a good brand reputation and a high presence outside the US in sales and marketing.”The economic background has also played its part. Medical devices, including orthopaedics, which is one of Smith & Nephew’s core markets, have come under pricing pressure since the downturn. Patients have traded down to older, lower-cost artificial hips or deferred elective surgery. And debates around tougher regulatory standards in the US and Europe alike are threatening higher costs both for approval and post-approval scrutiny. In this environment, companies are looking for opportunities to cut costs. A deal would present just such an opportunity.The UK-based company also has a strong geographical spread of revenues, offering scope for diversification into new markets for many of its US peers.“We believe M&A considerations are unlikely to cool down in light of the substantial benefits of further industry consolidation,” Christoph Gretler, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note last week.David Illingworth, chief executive of S&N, is expecting to see deal activity in the industry. “We want to be as broad as we can while being synergistic,” he told a global healthcare conference in San Francisco last week, while declining to comment on the speculation around the company.After criticism of its earlier silence, the company put out a statement last Friday that did not rule out expressions of interest from rivals. “Smith & Nephew wishes to clarify that it is not engaged in any discussions which could lead to a merger or a takeover involving the company,” it said.The list of realistic bidders for S&N is limited to a handful of US groups: Biomet, Johnson & Johnson, Zimmer and Stryker.For Zimmer and Stryker a deal would help to alleviate the impact of falling prices and would also enable them to diversify outside the US. But analysts caution that their management teams had less experience than others in consolidating large transactions.Biomet and Smith & Nephew have tried to get together before. In 2006, the latter tried to buy the former, but was outbid when a private equity consortium comprising Blackstone, Goldman Sachs, KKR and TPG Capital stumped up almost $11bn to seal the deal.But with Biomet reporting net debt equivalent to 5.7 times operating earnings, a deal with S&N now would have to be structured as a reverse takeover. To help pay down its debt, S&N could look at selling its wound care business – which analysts at Deutsche Bank estimate is valued at between $2.6bn and $3.4bn.Analysts at Sanford Bernstein argue that for S&N investors, Biomet’s debt would make it an unfavourable merger partner.“We think that a merger between Smith & Nephew and Biomet looks unappealing for Smith & Nephew shareholders who would face significant dilution. Since J&J seems much better placed than anyone else, a bidding war for Smith & Nephew seems unlikely”.And some Smith & Nephew investors have argued that a combination with Biomet may not produce synergies high enough to justify the rise in the company’s share price.Tactics will be key. If Biomet makes the first move for S&N, it may quickly be outbid by cash-rich J&J, which has completed a steady stream of recent deals. One investor said that a move to combine S&N and Biomet would in effect serve as a “put-up or shut-up” for J&J.Unlike Biomet, J&J and S&N are competitors in all of S&N’s markets, creating the potential to squeeze out significant savings.But that also means there are likely to be regulatory hurdles. In orthopaedics, for example, the two companies would have a combined market share of 34 per cent in reconstructive hip and knees, globally, and about 20 per cent in orthopaedic trauma, according to analysts at Credit Suisse.S&N’s wound care business would be less problematic for antitrust regulators, but J&J is unlikely to be very interested in it given that it sold its own professional wound care business to buy-out group One Equity Partners three years ago.Finally, J&J, with much revenue generated outside the US, could enjoy a tax advantage by acquiring a target abroad, instead of repatriating its spare cash.For now, few investors are expecting any imminent news. One trader who specialises in short-term investments in takeover situations said: “Is the market being stupid? Yes. Will the shares go up on every further bit of speculation? Yes. Will I be buying any shares? No.”
24;SYK;Stryker Corp;2010-12-08T20:38:47Z;Smith & Nephew jumps as bid talk gathers pace;Shares in the orthopaedic device maker jumped 9.1 per cent to 662p;Smith & Nephew was the the main feature on Wednesday as takeover speculation returned to the London market.Shares in the orthopaedic device maker jumped 9.1 per cent to 662p on renewed bid rumours. One theory was that Biomet, its US rival, may be in the early stages of investigating a takeover approach.Traders said a tie-up between the two made sense if Biomet’s private equity owners including Blackstone Group and KKR could secure funding. However, they doubted anything was imminent.Industry peers such as Johnson & Johnson, Zimmer and Stryker have also been linked with S&N over the years, though all would face competition hurdles.A “buy” recommendation from Goldman Sachs also helped support S&N shares, with the broker arguing that wound management and endoscopy sales should drive above-average growth.“We believe that Smith & Nephew’s 10 per cent discount to global orthopaedic peers is unwarranted in light of a similar growth outlook,” it said.Mining stocks pulled the wider market into negative territory as a stronger dollar dragged on metals prices. The FTSE 100 was down 0.2 per cent by the close, losing 13.92 points to 5,794.53.Rio Tinto lost 3 per cent to £43.70 after saying it would invest up to $4.3bn in Ivanhoe Mines, owner of a copper project in Mongolia, to raise its stake to 49 per cent. “Some investors might suggest that Rio has paid a lot of money without yet taking control of the asset. We think this is a fair comment,” said Merrill Lynch.Services companies were in demand on news that Apax Partners entered exclusive talks to buy ISS, the Danish security contractor for about $8.5bn. G4S jumped 4.8 per cent to 249½p, also benefiting from the clearing of a stock overhang, while Capita rose 2.6 per cent to 689½p.Another positive for the services company came from the Ministry of Justice’s Green Paper proposals to open up the UK’s £1.6bn probation budget to the private sector.A short-squeeze helped lift Burberry by 2.3 per cent to £11.56 amid renewed speculation that the fashion label was a potential takeover target for the likes of PPR and Coach.In a rising insurance sector, Prudential took on 3.7 per cent to 634½p after UBS added the stock to its recommended list with an 800p target price. “We believe that the group’s Asian exposure offers unique strategic appeal,” analyst James Pearce said. “Sharp increases in remittances from Asia mean that the corporate centre’s historic role funnelling cash from west to east will soon have run its course, giving new relevance to sum-of-the-parts valuations.”Aviva climbed 1.6 per cent to 389p and Standard Life rose 2.1 per cent to 210¼p. Resolution rallied a further 2.2 per cent to 231¼p amid talk of growing shareholder pressure on founder Clive Cowdery and his management team to change strategy.Standard Chartered was the top performer among the banks, rising 2 per cent to £18.78 ahead of a trading update.Capital Shopping Centres was the sharpest blue-chip faller, down 5.3 per cent to 386¼p after Simon Property threatened to pull its bid approach and sell its 5.1 per cent shareholding. Simon has been trying to halt a planned acquisition by CSC that would give John Whittaker at least 19.9 per cent of the expanded group.Among the mid-caps, polymer maker Victrex rose 7 per cent to £14.42 after results on Tuesday led Deutsche Bank to take the stock off its “sell” list.Micro Focus rose 4.4 per cent to 373¾p after results and guidance from the IT services group proved no worse than expected.Telecity the data host, was up 1.5 per cent to 485½p after news of its plans to build a new warehouse in Amsterdam triggered “buy” advice from brokers.Enquest lost 4.4 per cent to 140p after RBC Capital Markets downgraded the company to “sector perform”. The North Sea explorer needs to use its financial strength to buy assets in 2011, but a scarcity of high-impact targets mean any deals will not be cheap, RBC argued.Evolution Group fell 4.9 per cent to 72¼p after house broker Arden Partners lowered forecasts in the wake of a meeting with the investment bank.Analyst Sarah Spikes cut her 2010 earnings per share forecast by 48 per cent to 2.15p, saying corporate finance deals she had expected to complete by December had fallen into next year. “This is the third time we have changed forecasts for Evolution because of deteriorating market conditions. We believe we are at the bottom, and the pipeline of business for next year is strong,” she said.Desire Petroleum , the Falkland Islands explorer which announced a dry well earlier this week, rallied 13.1 per cent to 68p, while Encore Oil improved 7.6 per cent to 127½p on word the Transocean Galaxy II rig had left dock in Dundee and was headed to the Varadero prospect in the North Sea.Frank Timis’ African Minerals was in focus amid reports that China’s Shandong Iron & Steel Group would in the first quarter of next year sign a $1.5bn deal to develop the company’s iron ore project in Sierra Leone. Shares in the group ended down 0.6 per cent to 405p.Bellzone Mining dipped 2.5 per cent to 67¾p even though the company announced the appointment of engineering consultants to conduct the detailed feasibility study for the Kalia iron ore mine in Guinea. Solo Oil rose 10.3 per cent to 0.42p after Neil Ritson, a recently appointed director, bought 1m shares.F&C Asset Management , in which activist investor Sherborne has amassed a near 10 per cent stake, eased 2.2 per cent to 78¾p. However, the fund management group could be promoted to the FTSE 250 next week to take the place of BSS, which is set to be acquired by Travis Perkins.Phorm Group Phorm Group fell 17.4 per cent to 47½p amid financing worries. At the time of results in September the internet advertising group said it was close to resolving its funding position.
25;SYK;Stryker Corp;2010-08-06T02:32:41Z;S&N senses pressure in orthopaedics market;;Smith & Nephew cautioned that its main orthopaedics market will be under pressure for several quarters as patients opt to live with pain rather than take time off work in an uncertain economic environment.First-half results to July 3 from the medical devices maker showed revenue from orthopaedics, which accounts for more than half of group turnover, rose 4 per cent to $1.1bn (£693m). However, that figure masked a growth rate of just 1 per cent in the second quarter, to $535m.The group echoed comments from rivals Stryker, Zimmer and Johnson & Johnson, who have also cited concerns that orthopaedic markets may be slowing.David Illingworth, chief executive, said healthcare budgets would remain challenging and younger, more active patients who would normally take S&N’s more advanced devices were opting instead to deal with the pain with a pill.He also suggested the market may not return to growth this year as at first forecast.“We are going to see pressure in the marketplace for the next few quarters. We’ll continue to see pressure on the premium products,” he said.However, shares in the group rose 10½p to 570½p as the interim results beat expectations thanks to accelerating growth at the wound-care and endoscopy businesses.Turnover rose 6 per cent to $1.95bn, while pre-tax profit increased from $322m to $436m. Earnings per share rose from 24.4 cents to 33.2 cents and the interim dividend is raised 10 per cent from 5.46 cents to 6 cents.Endoscopy, which makes hip and knee replacements, saw revenues rise 12 per cent to $422m, while advanced wound management increased 8 per cent to $431m.The latter was helped by the increased adoption of Smith & Nephew’s negative pressure wound therapy device, which places a vacuum over an open wound to accelerate healing.● FT CommentIt came as little surprise to see Smith & Nephew equally downbeat on the orthopaedic market but more of a concern was its growth rate underperformance compared with its rivals. Nevertheless, the shares have already been humbled by the market, down 17 per cent in the past three months. But the question remains whether the sell-off is overdone since the rest of the business looks fairly resilient. Analysts are forecasting the group to make a profit of $857m from revenue of $3.9bn in 2010, which would still represent an improvement from 2009 figures. The shares are trading on a prospective price/earnings ratio of about 12 times – in line with its rivals – but S&N remains a world leader in its field and demographic trends will continue in its favour in coming years, a fact that could attract the interest of private equity groups.
26;SYK;Stryker Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Don’t count on pre-election profits;;"Opposing trends are pulling my short-term expectations in different directions.On the negative side, one worry is that shares have risen 14 per cent since the most recent rally began on February 8. Common sense suggests that trees do not grow to the sky – and neither do share prices.The upcoming general election is also worth thinking about. History shows that shares rarely rise strongly in the three- week run-up to election day. Since 1964, only two out of 12 elections produced significant profits in this period.This year I am especially concerned because of
the threat of a hung parliament. Fears that the next government will be unable to deal firmly with our economic problems could spook investors.Sterling’s value is also worrying. First-quarter declines boosted profits of UK multinationals, once foreign earnings were converted into sterling. It helps to explain why the recent rally occurred. But sterling has now stabilised. Without further weakening, the FTSE-100 loses a key growth trigger.Across the Atlantic, Wall Street’s recent rally was boosted by hopes that US companies have turned the profits corner and will produce satisfactory increases. The first-quarter earnings season has begun, and I fear that some investors will take profits.
I also worry about prices
if improved profits are due to cost-cutting, not rising revenue.Countering my list of negatives is a riveting positive. After two years of rising unemployment, the recent US jobs report showed a small rise in job creation. Remember that jobs are a lagging indicator, which suggests a turnround is already under way.Several of the Obama administration heavyweights just claimed the economy was on the verge of solid growth. Whether they are right remains to be seen. But we have not been exposed to this level of bullishness for two years.My own trading strategy in times of uncertainty is to remain watchful, but to keep investing. Experience teaches me to follow the trend, not the theory, during such moments.One recent purchase was Corin (CRG), a small manufacturer of orthopaedic devices for hip and ankle replacements. Corin is an old trading favourite. I initially bought its shares back in its high-flying days when prices tripled to over 600p per share in less than a year. The trigger was a significant relationship with Stryker, a leading player in the US orthopaedic market.Unfortunately, Stryker over-promised and under-delivered on its volume projections. Corin shares reversed direction and quickly lost 90 per cent of their value.The trend is changing once again. The graph shows that Corin’s decline is over. Investors are awaiting proof that profits are improving. I saw early signs of a turnround about six months ago. The signals are now growing stronger.A write-off programme for obsolete inventory has run its course. Corin’s new management team has broadened its product line. Sales efforts outside of markets in North America and Europe have expanded, and are beginning to pay off. Asian revenues are rising. This is significant because it is time- consuming to sell to surgeons. They stick with familiar hip or knee devices, and huge effort is required to shift them to
a new surgical device. Corin’s recent success bodes well for the future.Another longer-term positive is that hip replacements have become a necessary part of modern life. Recent industry weakness is likely to be a temporary issue. Demand should return as the world economy recovers.Even hapless Stryker is now re-ordering, admittedly at a low rate. And an institution recently lightened up by selling a block of 1.8m shares, causing prices to rise immediately – suggesting that the overhang was known to the City and had been holding back price increases. On balance,
I believe much of the bad news, but little of the recent good news is now
in the price.Stock market historian David Schwartz is an active short-term trader writing about his own trades.

27;SYK;Stryker Corp;2020-04-24T23:01:26+0000;David Schwartz: Trader’s Diary;;"Afrustrating aspect of trading shares is that the investment world is forever changing. Trading strategies that worked well for months, or even years, suddenly stop working.One reason is that none of us owns exclusive rights to a winning strategy. There are many smart investors who are quick to spot a winning approach and adjust their trading practices accordingly. As more of them shift their behaviour to exploit a new opportunity, money flows change and, eventually, profitability falters.Say, for example, that a new short-term trend suddenly developed and shares began to bounce up every Tuesday. Some eagle-eyed traders would spot this short-term profit window and purchase shares on Monday afternoon to catch the bounce. As more traders play this trend, money flows would change. Some money that once drove prices up on Tuesday would now be committed on Monday. With less buying occurring on Tuesday, prices would be more likely to decline, not rise.This example illustrates the stock market adage that, in the world of investing, success virtually always breeds failure.Two changes in market behaviour recently caught my eye. I do not know for how much longer these trading quirks will remain but, for the moment, both are worth thinking about.Value ratios such as price-to-earnings ratios (p/e) and dividend yields have played an important role during most of 2009. But some investors are now placing less reliance on absolute valuations. My impression is that relative value is becoming more important. Traders seem increasingly willing to invest in a company because of a perceived level of under-performance versus sector competitors.Another sign of the times is that traders are increasingly willing to buy shares prior to an earnings update. I often see prices bounce two or three weeks before an update is published. This is quite a change from trading conditions earlier this year when prices typically rose after the release of a positive update. Pre-announcement gains were rare.I regard both of these trend changes as signs that the bull market is beginning to mature. There is probably more upside to come but explosive gains that often occur near the beginning of a bull run may now have run their course. If I am right, the easy money has now been made for the bull market of 2009. Future investment profits will be harder to come by.One company with promising prospects is Corin Group, a small manufacturer of orthopaedic devices for hip and ankle replacements.Its shares were buffeted by wild fluctuations in the last two years. Prices initially rocketed up on news that a significant long-term agreement had been signed with Stryker, a leading company in the US orthopaedic market. The agreement was extremely important because the US is the world’s largest market for orthopaedic devices, accounting for almost three quarters of global demand. Corin shares more than tripled in just 12 months and eventually peaked at around 640p.Unfortunately, Stryker dropped the ball with a series of delays. Corin had to issue a warning in May 2008 that its US partner would not reorder any hip devices until the end of the year at the earliest. Its shares crashed to an all-time low.A follow-up announcement in November 2008 quashed hopes that Stryker would soon begin to reorder. Shares plummeted once again, losing more than half of their already depressed value.There is no getting around the fact that 2008 was a dire year for Corin. But under the surface, a number of positive events occurred. A new management team wrote
off obsolete inventory and began to broaden the product line. Marketing efforts outside the US were expanded.Corin’s efforts are beginning to pay off. Revenues in Europe, Australia and Japan are rising. This is significant because surgeons are a very difficult group to sell to. They tend to stick with devices they are familiar with and great effort is required to swing them over to a new surgical product as Corin is doing. My view is that it bodes well for the future.Another point that investors appear to be ignoring is that Stryker has now finally begun to reorder, admittedly at a low rate.But the cherry on the cake was a recent statement by a top executive at one of Corin’s competitors. He observed that hip replacements had become a necessary, not discretionary, part of modern life. Any revenue declines that his industry experienced because of the recession would be temporary.Analysts regard Corin as a potential rebound candidate. Some try to pick the precise inflection point when the sales trend will begin to rocket up. Current forecasts are for no second-half revenue growth, compared with last year. But sales and profit margins are expected to grow in 2010.It is hard to know if these forecasts are on target. My view is that all the bad news is now in the price and foundations are in place for a solid improvement in Corin’s fortunes. Attempting to predict the moment when explosive growth will occur is an attempt to predict the unpredictable. But the time to prepare for the eventual rally is right now.Stock market historian David Schwartz isn an active short-term trader writing about his own trades and strategies.

BG closed up 2.8 per cent to 1136p.Outside the large caps, Wellstream gained 9.4 per cent to 645p on speculation the oilfield services provider was a target for Saipem, the Italian driller.The benchmark FTSE 100 reclaimed the 5,000 level, rising 0.48 per cent, or 23.79 points, to 5011.47, a high for the year. The FTSE 250 rose 0.9 per cent to 9207.89.Miners underpinned the index, helped by firm metals prices.Fresnillo, the Mexican silver miner, was in demand as spot silver prices rose to the highest level in more than 13 months; its shares gaining 5 per cent to 736p. Lonmin rose 3.2 per cent to 1724p, while Xstrata closed up 2.7 per cent at 925p.Sports and financial betting company IG Group fell 8.4 per cent to 326p after a board member sold shares in the company for a second session in a row. Jonathan Davie, a non-executive director, sold 100,000 shares, taking his remaining holding down to 800,000.888 jumped 14.3 per cent to 97½p after the online gaming group announced a deal for US casino operator Harrah Entertainment to use its software in the UK, and said it had further deals in the pipeline. A push from Cazenove sent RPS Group, the environmental consultancy, up 14.4 per cent to 240p.“We believe that RPS is likely to see a substantial re-rating over the coming few months as confidence returns. The group continues to expand the geographical spread of its operations, both organically and through acquisition,” said Cazenove. “With management’s strong reputation for making good quality, well-priced purchases and little gearing, we believe shareholders will continue to support that expansion.”Sports Direct International dropped 0.9 per cent to 107.9p as the market continued to digest news it was under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and Office of Fair Trading over allegations of anti-competitive business practices.Numis said the market had overreacted to the inquiry but lowered its price target from 145p to 130p. “The fall in the share price is overdone,” the broker said. “Precedents from the pub sector would suggest that the chances of prosecution are low, while the building industry has seen companies accept liability in return for a 50 per cent reduction in the fine.“Moreover, any OFT investigation would be likely to drag on for a number of years, with the chance to appeal likely to lengthen this process”.JJB Sports, which has been granted partial immunity for co-operating, regained some ground, rising 11.5 per cent to 38¾p.Exploration companies with operations in the Falkland Islands were in focus again on Friday. Shares in Rockhopper Exploration jumped 33.3 per cent to 78p after it announced an agreement to share the costs of developing one of its licences with an unnamed partner.The news came just a day after Desire Petroleum, up 3.3 per cent to 93p, secured a rig to drill in waters off the Falkland Islands. BPC, another Falklands play, rose 30.4 per cent to 3¾p after the clearance on Thursday of a large stock overhang.Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer, rose 9.2 per cent to 121¼p after chairman John von Spreckelsen acquired 50,000 shares at 110p each. Thorntons said during the week that trade was improving. Workspace, the business space developer, firmed up 1 per cent to 25½p amid talk that it could be a takeover target for Hansteen, the Aim listed property company that raised £200m this year to take advantage of low property prices.Hansteen rose 1.3 per cent to 94p.Gulfsands Petroleum put on 3 per cent to 248¾p as takeover rumours did the rounds again.

More than 5.5m shares changed hands – almost twice the daily average over the past month.The talk in the market was that S&N could be a target for US rivals Stryker Corporation or Biomet. Traders noted that a private equity consortium including Blackstone and Goldman Sachs bought Biomet in 2007, a few months after S&N had failed to agree a merger, and that Stryker had a strong balance sheet.However, they also reflected on the fact that S&N had risen almost 13 per cent since this rumour first surfaced three weeks ago.Meanwhile, a tired FTSE 100 drifted 21.2 points, or 0.4 per cent, lower to 4,869.25 on a mixture of profit-taking and weakness in two of its biggest stocks – Diageo and BAE Systems.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 dropped 81.9 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 8,701.3.Drinks group Diageo fell 4.1 per cent to 956p after annual results failed to impress. Although figures met expectations, traders said this was largely down to the fact that marketing spend had been slashed. They also believed guidance for “low single digit” earnings growth in the new fiscal year was disappointing.BAE Systems was marked 5.5 per cent lower at 306p after losing a contract with the US Department of Defense to supply trucks to rival Oshkosh. Traders said the loss would impact on 2012 earnings by 5-6 per cent.In the banking sector Lloyds TSB dipped 3.5 per cent to 104.7p on profit-taking, which traders said might have been triggered by bearish comments from Jonathan Pierce, the banking analyst at Credit Suisse.He said that any upside from Lloyds’ diluting its involvement in the government’s asset protection scheme was reflected in the price, which has risen 25 per cent in the past month.British Airways dipped 2.2 per cent to 187½p after poor figures from Aer Lingus and a note from Cazenove, which said that investors could not be blamed for locking in profits after its recent strong run. BA has risen 32 per cent this month. “We retain our view that the flag carriers are trading stocks in the absence of any evidence of sustainable positive earnings momentum which is unlikely before next year,” it said.Defensive stocks were in demand though, as investors switched out of mining stocks. International Power added 1.5 per cent to 285p, while Pennon Group put on 1.3 per cent to 467.7p and GlaxoSmithKline improved 1 per cent to £12.12.Among the mid-caps National Express added 2.2 per cent to 408.6p on news that it had received a 450p cash offer from a consortium led by the Cosmen family, which owns an 18.5 per cent stake in the bus and train company.However, the view of many in the market was that National Express would knock back the offer – some shareholders are said to be holding out for at least 500p – and proceed with a £350m cash call instead.Barratt Developments dipped 3.1 per cent to 238.6p on talk that the housebuilder could soon launch a £500m cash call.Dealers are forecasting another wave of equity fund raisings in September and another rumour doing the rounds yesterday was that BT, off 1.2 per cent to 136.6p, was looking to raise cash either through an equity issue or a convertible bond. Another cash call candidate is UK Coal, which fell 3.5 per cent to 122½p after reporting half-year results.Back among the housebuilders, Bovis Homes dipped 5.1 per cent to 526½p after a RBS downgrade from “buy” to “hold”. The broker cited valuation for its move.“Having run up sharply since July 6 [47 per cent in absolute terms, 31 per cent versus the FTSE All Share] and sitting at 1.08x Price/Net Asset Value, the shares now better reflect the group’s landbank margin profile,” it said.Alexander Mining was in focus on talk it was close to agreeing a large deal for its metal leaching technology.The group, which is thought to have been in talks with multinational miners for about six months, was said to be near a licensing agreement that would provide both a lump sum payment and regular royalties. Alexander shares were steady at 7¼p.Chinese gas group Fortune Oil slid 13.5 per cent to 7¾p after interim results showed price controls had erased profits at its state-controlled aviation fuel joint venture.Financing deal speculation lifted European Nickel by 36 per cent to 11¼p. Its joint-venture partner Rusina Mining was up
19.4 per cent to 4¾p.Real estate fund Matrix European, owner of the IZD Tower in Vienna, rallied 34.8 per cent to 61¼p after receiving a takeover approach.Matrix had been trading at a sharp discount to net asset value, estimated by Cazenove at about 372p a share, because of concerns about its debt refinancing and lending covenants. The news lifted sector peers including Invista European, up 13 per cent to 28¼p, and Kenmore European, ahead 5.8 per cent to 36¾p.Silence Therapeutics, the gene “silencing” developer, lost 11.3 per cent to 21½p.

30;SYK;Stryker Corp;2008-05-16T22:42:48Z;Zimmer faces $450m bill after legal clash;;Zimmer, one of the world’s biggest makers of orthopaedic implants, is reviewing its contracts with hundreds of US surgeons in a move that could take the company’s bill for clearing up a legal case last year to more than $450m.Under procedures intended to make its dealings with surgeons with whom it has consultancy relationships more transparent, Zimmer is considering terminating its royalty contracts with many of these doctors.As part of the change, Indiana-based Zimmer would “buy out” the surgeons from their current agreements, handing them a one-off payment to substitute for the chance of gaining regular fees for years ahead.Although the company refused to speculate on how much these one-off payments might amount to, one US-based analyst with close knowledge of the industry – who asked not to be named – said it was “reasonable” to estimate the sum could come to about $250m.The new arrangements have irritated some surgeons, who might have to be offered substantial one-off sums to win their support for being bought out of current contracts, analysts believe.The payments to surgeons being contemplated by Zimmer would come on top of a $169.5m fine levied on the company last September by the US government.This followed an inquiry by the Department of Justice into allegations that Zimmer and other implant makers had paid illicit “kickbacks” to surgeons in the US in an effort to persuade them to use their products.Zimmer has also said the costs of fitting in with new compliance measures – agreed in the wake of the legal case to prevent unethical practices recurring – could amount to up to $54m over an 18-month period ending next April.The one-off payments could be classified by the company as a special charge, and are due to be worked out during the next few months.Zimmer said it would calculate the basis of the payments in a fair way, as part of a procedure for putting all its contracts with surgeons on a new footing.“We want to be out in front through adopting a new model [for dealing with surgeons],” the company said.Many of the current agreements between Zimmer and surgeons – which relate to how much the physicians should be paid for helping Zimmer develop novel implants for joints such as hips and knees – are likely to be replaced by new arrangements instituted in the aftermath of last year’s legal case.The case cast a pall over the entire orthopaedics industry, which includes implants and related products such as operating equipment and had sales last year of about $30bn.In the case, Zimmer and four other companies – Depuy, Biomet, Stryker of the US and Smith & Nephew of the UK – were accused of paying large sums of money to surgeons as well as giving them trips and expensive perks. None of the companies admitted to any wrongdoing, but agreed to pay fines totalling $311m to settle the affair.All these new arrangements have to be vetted by a team of lawyers – appointed by the US government but paid for by Zimmer – to ensure that surgeons are paid for work that they have performed, rather than being offered what amounted to bribes for specifying particular products.
31;SYK;Stryker Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Hipsville, USA;;It was as I laboured to the 3,200ft summit of Scafell, the second highest peak in the Lake District, that I finally decided to call a halt to my 52-year battle with a recalcitrant hip. That day in May 2007 was laden with mist. Even so, the occasional views of some of England’s most striking scenery were well worth the climb. I was on a five-day trip with eight companions, all members of the Battersea & District Walking Society, a group I founded 13 years ago. Under the rules of the society, twice a year we go to mountainous places in the UK, stay in youth hostels and walk from place to place. Only now, I had to admit that the walking was becoming as much a burden as a pleasure.The battle that ended that day had its roots in a childhood illness. When I was three I contracted osteomyelitis, a bone infection that in those days was a serious condition. Fortunately, suitable antibiotics became available just in time for my treatment and the only lasting effect was a small amount of damage to the bone in my right hip joint. For many years, the effects were mild. I played Sunday league football until I was about 30 and five-a-side for another decade. But over the next 15 years, the aching gradually became more noticeable, particularly after long walks or games of tennis. I developed a limp that grew progressively more pronounced, to the point where people kept asking what I had done to my leg. It was partly the irritation of having to answer the same question time and again that spurred me into action.A few weeks after my painful hike up Scafell, I walked into the London consulting room of Warwick Radford, a surgeon I had been talking to for some time about a possible hip replacement. I hadn’t wanted to rush into it, but rather wait for the latest technology to become available, particularly since the newest hips last longer. On the other hand, I knew it was a good idea to have the operation while I was still relatively fit and healthy. “I think I’d better go for it,” I told Radford. “But which implant will I have, and what will it be made of?” That might not be a question most patients ask, but for 12 years I have written about engineering and manufacturing for this newspaper, and my fascination with machines stretches back further than that. Now, my professional and personal interests were about to converge, and would ultimately take me thousands of miles to three small American towns at the heart of an extraordinary global industry.Studiously courteous, Radford warmed to my question. “Basically, it will be made of titanium, with a special plastic liner,” he said. “The liner is there to make sure the joint lasts for a reasonable time. I like using the Stryker X3 system. The plastic liner is made from a new material that’s especially durable. This allows it to be quite thin, meaning the ball it supports in the new joint can be fairly large, giving greater stability and making the patient more mobile.”There was another advantage to a plastic-on-metal hip: you don’t squeak when you walk. Owners of ceramic joints – including the likes of Jack Nicklaus – “squeak a bit”, said Radford. He didn’t think I’d want that. I couldn’t help but agree.…As a journalist specialising in engineering, I naturally wanted to investigate Stryker and its products myself before falling in with Radford’s recommendation. The company, it turns out, is one of five that, between them, account for 90 per cent of the global market in new hips and knees. The others are Zimmer, Depuy and Biomet, all based in the US, and the British company Smith & Nephew. Helpfully, there is a video on Stryker’s website that explains the workings of the X3 hip. A new hip joint is not just one product but a kit of parts that fit together in an operation Radford likens to a mixture of engineering and carpentry. The X3 – his shorthand for the complete hip system – is in fact a highly durable polyethylene liner that fits between the moving parts to allow the joint proper mobility. The other elements include a metal rod that is inserted into the upper part of the thigh bone to provide a solid connection. Fitted to this is a metal ball that must be extremely hard-wearing. This slides up against the liner and connects with an “acetabular cup” – which looks like half a small coconut shell – secured in the patient’s pelvic socket.Stryker was set up in 1941 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, by Homer Stryker, a surgeon-cum-inventor who was born in a nearby farming community. Growing up, Stryker was surrounded by people who liked tinkering with agricultural gadgets, such as ploughs and tractors. He was also not too far from the emerging engineering powerhouses of eastern Michigan, centred on Detroit, and northern Indiana. Many of the US’s pioneering carmakers had their roots in these areas, their engineering expertise drawn from the early drive to mechanise farming. Immersed in this fertile environment for would-be engineers, Stryker’s fascination with technology led him in a new direction – into the emerging discipline of medical technology. He devised a new kind of hospital bed and various power saws for cutting bone, before inventing assorted prosthetic devices. In the 1950s, Sir John Charnley, a renowned British surgeon, devised the techniques that made hip replacements possible, opening up an important new market for Stryker, today a public company capitalised at $27bn (£14bn). Although its products are sold all over the world, it remains resolutely rooted in Kalamazoo.Two months after my first question to Radford about the implant, and having found nothing in the interim to put me off the idea of a Stryker X3, I was once again talking to my surgeon. Only this time, on July 31, I was lying on my back in an operating theatre, waiting to have several thousand pounds worth of orthopaedic products joined to me on a long-term basis.I reflected that I was not alone. Last year, the total market for orthopaedic devices was worth about $30bn, about $5bn of which was accounted for by replacement hip joints and another $5bn by artificial knees. Worldwide, an estimated 600,000 people this year are likely to have a replacement hip – nearly three times the total in 1980 – and the figure is expected to grow quickly over the next 20 years, as the technology for producing the implants improves and increasing numbers of younger people have them.As I was wheeled into the operating theatre, I spotted several trays full of instruments and parts next to Radford – replacement-hip components, sizing tools, power saws, a special hammer for knocking the parts into the right places and devices known as “cheese graters”, which are used to remove pieces of disintegrated bone – the results of the erosion of my original hip. Radford was preoccupied with preparing for the operation and didn’t want to bother me with these details. “This will take about two hours,” he said.I did not get out of bed for about a day and a half, and my right leg remained quite painful and swollen for about two weeks. I walked with crutches for the first six weeks to keep the weight off my new hip joint and allow time for the stem of the implant to bind into the bone of my femur. After six weeks I moved to using a single crutch, and two weeks later was walking unaided. After a few weeks of exercises to strengthen the muscles in my leg, I found walking a different, almost new experience. For the first time in years I felt I could go for long walks and play tennis without the familiar ache in my hip and the nagging limp. I found I was standing straighter because both legs were supporting me properly, and people started telling me I had grown taller.I had also grown more curious. If 600,000 people a year were being fitted with implants, that amounted to a market worth billions of dollars. The journalist and engineer in me wanted to know more. Where were these life-changing contraptions coming from, and what sort of expertise did it take to lead the world in this business?…The town of Mahwah, New Jersey, takes its name from a Native American word meaning “meeting place”. My reason for making the 45-minute drive from New York was to meet Mike Mogul, Stryker’s head of orthopaedics, at the firm’s main global manufacturing centre for replacement hips and knees (it has others in Ireland and France). This was where the all-important pieces of titanium and polyethylene now fused with my femur and pelvis had been made. Here, in a low-rise building on the edge of town, crammed with advanced machinery, 700 workers perform a huge range of tasks, from heat treatment to precision cutting of plastics. I was privileged to be there: Stryker is a publicity-shy business and not accustomed to inviting journalists (whether or not they are customers) into its factories. I had been told that parts of the plant would be off limits.This is the cutting edge of manufacturing. We tend to think that factories mass-produce millions of identical products – the huge volumes and uniformity of the products helping to keep costs low. Mahwah turns that notion on its head. Since people come in all shapes and sizes, so must implants. That means waving goodbye to uniformity and high volumes, and making thousands of different versions of products in short runs – sometimes a mere 10 at a time before the machines are switched to another specification. In all, the plant’s product range runs to around 3,000 items, while overall Stryker sells something like 200,000 different manufactured pieces, from components made by sub-contractors to the large computer-guidance systems used by surgeons during operations. “We make our hips in thousands of different configurations,” Mogul told me. The machining technology in the plant is of a similar sophistication to that required to make parts for jet engines, and the standards of testing are no less rigorous. Samples of the X3 hip systems, such as the one I had fitted, are placed in machines where they are shaken vigorously for up to three weeks to simulate the wear and tear of 20 years of walking.…Leaving Mahwah behind, I continued my journey into the Midwest, towards the heart of the world orthopaedics industry. Two hours’ drive west of Detroit, in the office of Stephen MacMillan, Stryker’s chief executive, I came a step closer. “This is a great industry to be involved in. It’s changing people’s lives for the better,” MacMillan told me in his office at the company’s headquarters in Kalamazoo, Michigan, overlooking the town’s small airport. “Of course we make our manufacturing as efficient as possible,” he said, in answer to my questions about why his company continued to site its factories in high-wage countries. “But in this business the goal is not to drive out the last penny of costs. So the orthopaedics industry generally has not joined the rush to cut costs by rushing into China. I feel comfortable telling surgeons our devices are made in the US or Europe.”But if Kalamazoo was an important staging post on my journey through the fast-growing global orthopaedics industry, my ultimate destination was even more obscure.The drive south from Kalamazoo takes you along winding roads that bisect a flat, agricultural landscape as they pass through small farming towns such as Three Rivers and Goshen. This area is home to one of the larger communities of Amish in the US. The stricter Amish, Anabaptist Christians who have their origins in European Protestantism, eschew almost all modern technologies such as electricity and telephones, and dress in plain, old-fashioned clothes. As I drove through the snowy landscape, every few minutes I passed an Amish farmer trundling along in a horse and cart, oblivious to everyone around him. This unfussy approach, I later reflected, held good for much of what I was about to see.Some two hours’ drive south of Kalamazoo, you reach Warsaw, a community of 12,000 people clustered just to the south of two highway intersections. At its centre is a grid of streets around Buffalo and Market, with a handful of late 19th-century and early 20th-century buildings, including the imposing Kosciusko County Courthouse (completed in 1884). The houses are mostly spacious and pleasant-looking two-storey wood-framed buildings, generously spaced out along the roads around the centre.Warsaw got its name because it is the biggest town in Kosciusko County, a district of Indiana formed in 1836 and named after Thaddeus Kosciuszko, a Polish engineer who at the time was a hero to many Americans. Kosciuszko fortified the West Point military complex and was a leading aide to George Washington during the war of independence. His advice on how to approach life has been followed assiduously by those who came after him in Warsaw: “Set yourself to work with reflection and intelligence, either at your prescribed duty, carried out in the most scrupulous manner, or perfect yourself in some science in which you should have true mastery.”True to Kosciuszko’s words, Warsaw has achieved true mastery of the orthopaedics business. In this small town are the headquarters of three of the five biggest orthopaedics companies in the world. Altogether, about a third of the $30bn revenues of the world orthopaedics industry can be traced back to this small town in an unassuming corner of rural Indiana. And, as I’d already discovered, Stryker, another of the top five, is only two hours’ drive away. In the quiet way of many small American towns, Warsaw is hugely proud of being “orthopaedic capital of the world”. Over tea and biscuits in his tiny office, Ernie Wiggins, Warsaw’s mayor, confesses that he loves to tell people about its seminal place in this high-tech industry. “When people have a new hip or knee, most of them are very surprised it has quite probably been made or developed here,” he says.The concentration of orthopaedic businesses in Warsaw has its origins in the late 19th century. In 1895, Revra Depuy, a travelling pharmaceutical salesman, founded Depuy Manufacturing in Warsaw to produce a new kind of splint he had invented for setting broken bones. Later on, Depuy started making slings, neck collars and braces, the basis for the business today. In 1926, one of Depuy’s leading salesmen, Justin Zimmer, quit his job to start a rival business, named after himself and based in the town. Then, in 1977, Dane Miller, an orthopaedic scientist, and three colleagues chose Warsaw as the base for their new company, Biomet, making artificial joints.Today, Zimmer employs 1,300 people in 12 low-rise buildings scattered discreetly around the town. The company has its own hangar at Warsaw’s small municipal airport and runs its own hotel in the centre (converted from a cinema) to cater for visiting surgeons and other guests. None of the companies is high profile. In fact, barring Depuy, which has a large headquarters next to the highway, it would be easy for a visitor to remain oblivious to the huge concentration of industrial excellence in Warsaw.For the locals, however, it is inescapable. Together with their main suppliers and sub-contractors, the three big companies based here account for about 20,000 jobs within a three-mile radius of Warsaw. Of these, about 12,000 are directly in manufacturing, according to estimates by Joy McCarthy-Sessing, president of the local chamber of commerce.It is an astonishing concentration of industrial expertise for such a small town, and creates some special characteristics. “It’s essentially a blue-collar town with a lot of white-collar aspects to it, because the jobs here tend towards the fairly highly skilled and well paid,” says Don Clemens, who runs Rabb Water Systems, a company that supplies many of the implant businesses. An engineer in Warsaw can earn $100,000 a year and a skilled factory floor worker $50,000-$75,000 – well above the US average for manufacturing workers of $37,000. Michael Bergen, joint proprietor of a local retirement planning firm, says that, thanks to high local wages and near-full employment, Warsaw is a “fantastic” place to run a financial services business such as his.Industrial clusters – as economists like to call them – such as orthopaedics companies in Warsaw are a well-documented feature of business. Even so, it seems few people are aware of Warsaw, Indiana, even among the world’s leading thinkers and writers on industrial excellence. When Michael Porter, the Harvard University professor and expert on centres of manufacturing excellence, published his seminal 1990 book The Competitive Advantage of Nations, he made no mention of the town.Yet what holds good for other, better known industrial clusters works here too. “If an engineer has an idea for a new product, he can pick up the phone to a company and discuss it, and then five minutes later be round there to show how the product should be made,” says Rick Stetler, operations director at Paragon, a specialist orthopaedics sub-contractor in Warsaw. “It’s a lot easier to do that kind of thing here than if the businesses were thousands of miles apart.”As I drove out of town, back through the flat farmland of Indiana and past the Amish men in their horse-drawn carts, I reflected that it might be some time before the people of Warsaw feel the heat from China’s industrial miracle.Peter Marsh is the FT’s manufacturing editor. As a result of his hip replacement operation, he was forced to pull out of the Battersea & District Walking Society’s autumn 2007 trip to the Lake District. He will take part in the next outing, to North Wales, this month.
32;SYK;Stryker Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Medical devices shine;;It’s all in the joints. Shares in medical technology companies, having lagged behind broader indices last year, are now enjoying a respite and have outperformed by nearly 5 per cent this year. As well they should. Medical technology companies are truly defensive stocks. Like the pharmaceuticals companies with which they are often compared, most of medtech churns out products that are non-discretionary and paid for by governments or insurers. But medical device makers generally face shorter approval processes and less generic competition, giving them better growth prospects than their drugmaking cousins.The orthopaedic sector looks particularly promising. The huge baby boom generation is developing creaky joints and new products aimed at early intervention could expand the customer base. With $32bn in global sales in 2007, the segment is expected to expand 10 per cent annually until 2011, according to Espicom, a consultancy. They expect the fastest growth in spinal products and the still-small area of tissue repair agents. Joint replacement sales are expected to increase almost as quickly and market share is up for grabs after a change in marketing practices forced by a US government probe.Medtronic of the US is the clear leader in the spinal sector, with 37 per cent of the world market, but the area represents just a fifth of the company’s overall $12.5bn turnover. Investors interested in more exposure to orthopaedics should look to the US group Stryker and the UK’s Smith & Nephew, where such products made up 60 per cent and half of 2007 sales respectively. The latter is expected to report a less-than-stellar first quarter but was first into the US market with a new higher-priced hip repair method that preserves bone. Device sellers are expensive, trading on 30 times historical earnings, double the average for markets globally, but they may just be worth it.Post and read comments on this Lex
33;SYK;Stryker Corp;2007-09-29T06:36:23Z;Smith & Nephew fined for medical kickbacks;;Smith & Nephew, the maker of artificial hips and knees, has been fined $28.9m (£14.9m) by the US government and will undergo five years of ethics monitoring after being accused of paying kickbacks to surgeons to get them to use its products.S&N and three other device makers – Zimmer, Biomet and Johnson & Johnson – paid out a combined $311m to settle an investigation carried out by the US Attorney for the District of New Jersey.A fifth company, Stryker, will pay no civil settlement, but has agreed to reforms and federal monitoring.The four companies were accused of paying large sums of money to surgeons as well as giving them trips and expensive perks. Together these device makers account for about 95 per cent of the implant market.“This industry routinely violated the anti-kickback statute by paying physicians for the purpose of exclusively using their products,’’ said Christopher Christie, the US Attorney, at a news conference in New Jersey. “The entire industry has agreed that their entire practices need to be reformed.”None of the companies on Friday admitted wrongdoing. David Illingworth, chief executive of S&N, said: “We are satisfied that the industry-wide compliance programme made uniform by this settlement will ensure continued, appropriate use of consultants and we look forward to working with the monitor.”Brett Pollard, an analyst at Numis, said: “This removes an uncertainty and it could have been a lot worse. This won’t be an ongoing issue and should have already been priced in. We will treat it as an unfortunate one-off exceptional.”S&N pointed out that its financial settlement was significantly lower than that of the others and said it had abided by an internal code of conduct at all times.Shares in S&N closed up 14½p at 597p.
34;SYK;Stryker Corp;2007-08-16T21:24:37Z;S&N recalls hip implants after mix-up;;Smith & Nephew, the medical devices company, on Thursday recalled 185 hip implants following a packaging error by a subcontractor.The company said a small number of production batches of its successful Birmingham Hip Resurfacing System were incorrectly packaged and as a result different sizes of hip implant had been mixed.S&N confirmed that two patients had already been implanted with the wrong- sized device and that some other cases could surface during the recall process.“All hospitals and surgeons who have received these implants have either been notified or are in the process of being notified,” the company said.The UK Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the US Food & Drug Administration have also been informed.The recall comes shortly after Corin, the UK medical devices maker, won approval for Cormet, its rival hip that will be marketed by Stryker in the US.Elizabeth Klein, an analyst at Landsbanki, said: “The number one issue is how many people have been implanted.”“185 implants at $13,000 each isn’t the end of the world but it’s about the public relations. This is one of the problems of not doing your manufacturing in-house and this is an advantage that Corin has.”S&N’s Birmingham hip was the first in a new class of less invasive implants approved by US regulators.This month the company reported a 12 per cent rise in interim profits boosted by demand for replacement hips. US hip revenues increased 50 per cent.S&N said the devices in question were distributed to a small number of countries, including the US and the UK, but a number had already been recovered in their packaging.The shares fell 23p to 565½p.
35;SYK;Stryker Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;S&N confirms merger talks with Biomet;;Smith & Nephew on Thursday confirmed a Financial Times report that it is in preliminary merger discussions with Biomet, its US rival best known for its artificial hips and other replacement joints, in a deal that could double the size of the British healthcare group.While sources stressed on Wednesday that the talks were at a very early stage, the deal is aimed at creating an orthopaedic specialist worth up to $20bn and capable of competing against the US sector leaders, Zimmer and Stryker.S&N said in a statement on Thursday: “No agreement has been reached, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will be proposed or completed.”Morgan Stanley, Biomet financial adviser, was drafted in to work on the company’s options in the spring following the sudden resignation of its co-founder and president, Dane Miller.At the time the bank was asked to consider “strategic alternatives focused on enhancing shareholder value.”But it is understood that a fully-fledged auction for the Nasdaq-listed company is now under way, attracting widespread private equity interest as well as the attentions of S&N.Biomet is believed to have also held discussions with JPMorgan private equity.Both companies are of a similar size as S&N is valued at £4.8bn ($9.2bn), while Biomet’s market capitalisation is $8.9bn.Confirmation of the talks came as S&N reported a 15 per cent rise in trading profit to $134m as revenues rose 11 per cent to $679m. The group reaffirmed its full-year guidance.S&N shares were down 2.75 per cent at 495¼p in afternoon London trading. Biomet shares were up 48 cents at $33.88 in early New York trading.Analysts speculate that S&N would likely demerge Biomet’s dental business, which has been valued at $2bn. Zimmer has been mooted as a possible buyer.Bruce Nudell, analyst at Bernstein Research, said any deal was likely to be a cash offer funded by debt and a rights issue.Michael King, analyst at Nomura Code, said: “The rationale for Smith & Nephew is to get a critical mass in the reconstruction orthopaedics business where they are a relatively small player.”“This deal would ramp them up close to the market leaders, give them the benefits of scale and leverage of sales force,” he added.Mr Nudell believes Smith & Nephew could encounter regulatory issues in the US in the event of a deal.Mr Miller’s departure has never been fully explained. Since he left, the company has been run by interim president Daniel Hann and some irritation has been voiced by investors over the amount of time headhunters have taken to find a replacement.

""It could be negative for the industry as a whole, but it (the share fall) looks a bit of an over-reaction to me.""The US Attorney's office in Newark was not immediately available for comment. Smith & Nephew was not immediately available for further comment."
37;SYK;Stryker Corp;2004-10-26T17:46:45Z;Bid speculation boosts FTSE;;London's senior index staged a modest recovery on Tuesday although few were convinced it signified a sea-change in sentiment.The FTSE 100 was up 0.4 per cent at 4,583.4 while the FTSE 250 index added 0.6 per cent to 6,277.0. Volume was 2.5bn shares.The three major energy stocks, BP, Shell Transport & Trading and BG Group were all lower, mirroring the decline of the price of crude as fears of a disruption to supplies receeded. The market appeared to be no clearer about with the day's dealings described as 'inconclusive' by one trader.“The polls for the US elections are completely indecisive and so many dealers are off for the school half-term holidays, its a great excuse for inactivity,” said another market professional.“We're range bound and investors forget that we can have long periods of trading sideways so we could be going nowhere for a while.”In a research note to clients, Khuram Chaudhry, European Quantitative Strategist, at Merrill Lynch, said: “There appears to be 'no clear consensus for 2005' for either market direction or more significantly for the direction of profits.” A survey by the broker found UK fund managers were still reluctant about placing firm bets on 2005 owing to a great deal of uncertainity about the global economy. “Many managers have stuck with cylical positions and are unwilling to write-off the fourth quarter. However, the drivers of profit growth are turning negative.”N Brown, the home shopping group, was the latest retail group to be subject to bid rumours yesterday with its shares closing 8.5 per cent higher at 128p.The management, led by major shareholders the Alliance family, were supposedly interested in taking the company private. Many said the story seemed fairly plausible. It has struggled in recent years and while interim results last week showed an improvement, analysts felt a complete turnaround was some way off. Potential attractions included securitising its large credit book and with the shares' valuation looking relatively cheap, private equity groups are rumoured to be interested.But another rumour suggested one large institution, believed to be Citigroup, had sold a hefty chunk of 1.5m shares to clients at a premium to the market and were trying to buy them back.Easyjet, the budget airline, jumped another 8 per cent to 158.75p in late trade after Icelandair increased its stake to 10.1 per cent.British American Tobacco dipped 0.1 per cent to 817p after third-quarter results were at the top end of expectations. One institution took the opportunity to offload 30m shares.WPP, the advertising group, added 3.1 per cent to 539.5p aftert hird-quarter results and new business orders topped expectations.Property stocks were stronger after Merrill Lynch upgraded net asset value estimates for the major companies on average by 3 per cent for each of the next two years, in view of the weight of money in property markets, both from institutional and private buyers. British Land was up 2.6 per cent to 743p, Liberty International rose 1.5 per cent to 863p and Hammerson added 1.7 per cent to 736p.Smith & Nephew, the medicial devices maker, lost 2.2 per cent to 454.5p after it was hit by a downgrade by Credit Suisse First Boston. Having surveyed the results from all of S&N's major competitors, the broker felt the company, like US rivals Stryker and Johnson & Johnson, would report lower third quarter underlying sales growth at its orthopaedics unit on November 4th. As a result, it cut its rating to 'neutral' and cut its target price to 500p from 591p.Fresh talk of a bid underpinned GKN, up 3.5x per cent at 214.75p. Dealers noted that volumes in the auto parts maker were far higher than fellow engineering stock Tomkins, when hedge funds often play the pair together, as vague talk circulated that US parts maker Delphi was interested. However, analysts said the large pension deficit could still act as a potential 'poison pill' to any takeover plans and its dividend yield remained attractive.Westbury rose 3.8 per cent to 383p as the housebuilder announced record interim results. The figures also gave a boost to the rest of the sector, which has underperformed in recent weeks. Bovis Homes was up 3.9 per cent at 532½p and Barratt Developments gained 2.8 per cent to 513½p.Jardine Lloyd Thompson, the insurance broker, was up 1.1 per cent at 446.5p, after broker Panmure Gordon swam against the tide of market opinion by arguing that New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's investigation into the insurance industry was a positive for the group. Pointing out that it was the only major global group not to have been subpoenaed, analyst Robin Savage said weakening competition, increased demand for insurance cover from clients and a depressed share price made JLT a 'buy'. The company, and Bermuda-based Alea, up 3 per cent at 213¾pp, also benefited from comments from Mr Spitzer in which he said he was likely to charge individuals and not industry practices.International Power ended unchanged at 156¾p despite a downdrade by UBS downgraded to 'reduce' from 'neutral'.London Asia Capital received plenty of interest, up 10.3 per cent to 10.75p, after announcing the formation of a $200m China private equity fund.Consolidated Minerals, the mining group, was up 2 per cent at 160.9p after it said it would increase its production of managanese. Numis Securities responded by increasing its target price to 94p from 85p.
38;SYK;Stryker Corp;2004-09-24T14:35:44Z;Nick Louth: Just what the doctor ordered;;Pharmaceutical companies were a significant part of my share portfolio for many years. With an ageing and increasingly wealthy population in the industrialised west, and increasing demand for life-enhancing drugs, the market's demographics seemed firmly underpinned. Companies such as Glaxo-Wellcome were steady earners, reaping large annual profits from blockbuster drugs in the fields of ulcers and anti-HIV treatments. There was also the added boost of a gradual series of mergers which were turning market leaders into industry behemoths that could spread the risk of bringing new compounds to market over many candidate drugs.However, by around 2000 something seemed to go wrong. It became increasingly clear that the industry's business model was under attack. First, the cost and time that was needed to bring new drugs to market was climbing, eroding the number of years of patent protection in which high profits could be earned. Moreover, a new breed of aggressive generic drug companies was challenging the patents of the industry giants. Even Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, in which I had sporadically held shares, seemed to be unable to turn its 20 per cent annual growth in earnings per share into a higher share price.From 2000 I gradually ran down my holdings in drug companies, fortunately missing the big share price falls that happened in early 2002, which pretty much saw the halving of GlaxoSmith-Kline's share price. Nevertheless, I very much wanted to find an equivalent industry which would show growing demand, high and stable profit margins and high barriers to entry. I wanted it also to benefit from the greying population.Toward the end of 2003 I found it in the handful of companies that dominate the market for hip and knee joint replacements and spine implants. The largest companies in this market are Zimmer, Stryker and Biomet of the US and our own Smith & Nephew. Their business models display tremendous advantages over their pharmaceutical rivals. The products are made from known and already tested materials which do not react with the human body. By contrast, pharmaceuticals are ingested and are aimed at reacting with the body, with all the unexpected results that can produce. New orthopaedic products are mostly incremental designs, taken from blueprint to market in two or three years compared with up to a dozen years for a new drug. Cheap generic copies of drugs are easy once the chemical formula is known, and if the patent can be challenged, but cheap copies of precision joints would not do the job and might harm the patient.While the joints are expensive and complex, the surgical procedures designed to install them are getting easier. So the extra outlay on the device is more than compensated by savings through quicker theatre times and shorter occupancy of hospital beds. The fact that the most modern implants relieve pressure on healthcare budgets is a crucial contrast to the cost burden of new drugs.The one fly in the ointment of this strategic shift was price. Almost all these companies were trading at very high p/e ratios spurred by the takeover tug-of-war between Zimmer and Smith & Nephew for Switzerland's Centerpulse. So in December I bought a stake in one of the smaller firms, Biomet, at $37 a share. Although it was growing more slowly than Zimmer, it was much cheaper, trading at only two-thirds of the p/e ratio. Once Smith & Nephew lost in the race for Centerpulse, I thought there was a chance Biomet would be next in line as a bid target for the UK company. Meanwhile, I earmarked cash should either Zimmer or Smith & Nephew become cheaper.For months, nothing happened. Finally, in July there was a bout of market nerves sparked by weaker-than-expected results for Stryker and a sharp dip for the entire sector. Zimmer, which had been trading at $90, fell to $76, where I bought a stake. It then fell even further to $69 at one point before recovering to $72 in recent weeks. I also bought some shares in Smith & Nephew at 490p, far below their year peak of 610p. So far I have made about 24 per cent on Biomet in less than a year, and nothing much yet on the others.This is a long-term shift strategy, however. While the drug companies have found it ever more difficult to bring new blockbusters to market, the orthopaedic market is broadening all the time. Knees, hips and shoulder replacements are already common, and many other joints and tissues will surely follow. With half of all people over 65 enduring some form of musculoskeletal ailment, prospects of improved life quality will drive demand for these products.Nick Louth is an active private investor, writing about his own investments.
