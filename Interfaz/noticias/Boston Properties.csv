Investors have sought these assets as haven investments, banking on predictable income streams and driving up property values.In June, the families of Chinese property developer Zhang Xin and Brazil’s Safra banking empire bought a 40 per cent stake in the General Motors Building for about $1.4bn.The Norwegian fund is seeking to raise the proportion of its holdings in real estate to 5 per cent. It made its first US investment this year through the acquisition of a 49.9 per cent interest in a $1.2bn portfolio from the New York-based Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association – College Retirement Equities Fund.The oil fund also has commercial property holdings in London, Paris, Frankfurt and other European cities. As of the end of the second quarter, it had property assets equivalent to 0.9 per cent of its holdings.“The property is unencumbered by debt, and no financing will be involved in the closing,” the fund said in a statement.The 47-storey Times Square Tower was developed by Boston Properties and completed in 2004. It is 99 per cent leased. The property group, which develops and operates office, residential and retail buildings, will retain a 55 per cent interest in the property and will manage the tower.“Boston Properties has taken some chips off the table while staying invested in the building. High quality assets like these are difficult to come by,” said Douglas Harmon at Eastdil Secured, who advised Boston Properties on the transaction. “It’s a win-win trade.”Boston Properties said it expected to distribute at least the amount of proceeds needed to avoid paying a corporate level tax on any gain realised from the planned sale.“Times Square Tower is exactly the type of asset that sovereign wealth funds look for. It’s a trophy property with a trophy operator,” said Dan Fasulo, managing director at Real Capital Analytics, the commercial property group.“For the Norwegian fund there is transparency as Boston Properties is a publicly listed company and there is real potential for expanding the relationship in the future.”The agreement to purchase the stake was signed on September 6 and the transaction is expected to close within 90 days.Shares in Boston Properties edged 0.6 per cent higher to $105.43.

Borrowers are always on the lookout for the best time to come back to markets as volatility has eased and we have earnings starting next week,” said Adrian Miller, a director for fixed income strategy at GMP Securities.“Even though valuations for investment grade bonds have been stretched on secondary markets, the new sales will go smoothly,” he added.Demand for investment grade bonds has remained strong at the start of 2013 even as total returns on the securities have dwindled and US equities rose to record highs. Year-to-date, investors have poured almost $23bn into mutual funds and exchange traded funds that buy investment grade debt. By comparison, funds buying junk bonds saw only $516m in purchases in the same period, while equity funds experienced a $64bn inflow, according to RBS data.Total returns on investment grade bonds are flat so far this year, while junk bonds are showing a 2.9 per cent gain, according to Barclays indices. The S&P 500 stock market index, which closed at record high on Tuesday, is up over 10 per cent. But the bonds are still compelling, in particular among institutional investors, insurers and pension funds which depend on long-term and liquid securities in order to match future liabilities.In addition, analysts said, the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep benchmark rates low until the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 per cent provides another incentive to hold low-yielding investment grade bonds.“As long as the Fed remains engaged in bond buying, the risk of a dramatic [rise] in yields is small,” said Mr Miller. “Investors know that.”

In the first half of the year, ad revenue fell 33.4 per cent.Terry McGraw, chief executive of McGraw-Hill, which owns Business Week, told reporters earlier this month that “all options are open” regarding the title.News of Mr Zuckerman’s bid was first disclosed on Business Week’s web site, which earlier reported Bloomberg appeared to be the current front runner in the auction.Other bidders include OpenGate Capital, which purchased TV Guide and ZelnickMedia, whose founder Strauss Zelnick was chief executive of BMG Entertainment, according to Business Week.

Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
4;BXP;Boston Properties;2008-12-17T00:28:34Z;Zuckerman may sue over Madoff loss;;Mort Zuckerman is considering legal action over the $30m loss by his charitable foundation in Bernard Madoff’s alleged $50bn fraud, the property and media investor said on Tuesday.About 10 per cent of the $300m Mortimer B Zuckerman Charitable Remainder Trust was invested in Ascot Partners, a fund founded by J Ezra Merkin, chairman of the GMAC automotive and housing lender.“I will be taking legal action at some point against the person who led the chief portion of the fund,” Mr Zuckerman told the Financial Times. The investment of almost all of the $1.8bn Ascot fund with Mr Madoff “was inconsistent with the agreements we had”, he claimed.The comments by Mr Zuckerman, the chairman of Boston Properties and owner of the New York Daily News, came as lawyers swarmed over the Madoff case, looking for compensation for their clients.Ascot and Mr Merkin were sued on Tuesday by the New York Law School, which said it had invested $3m in Ascot.Andrew Levander, a partner with Dechert, the law firm representing Mr Merkin, said: “He intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously, while seeking redress for himself and his investors from whoever perpetrated this fraud.”Mr Merkin and his family were personally among the largest victims of the Madoff affair, he said.Harry Susman, a Houston lawyer trying to co-ordinate claimants, said in a press release: “Given the size of the losses and the limited pools of recovery . . . it will be critically important for investors to proceed collectively.”Mr Zuckerman said it was too early to know whether his planned legal action would be co-ordinated through Mr Susman. “It’s all in the process of being formed but we will undoubtedly have the same lawyer.”He said that early checks on where his trust had been invested suggested that a further $5m might have been invested with Mr Madoff. Mr Zuckerman reiterated that the trust losses were not from his personal funds, but related to a charitable donation he had made in 2001. The shock of the unfolding Madoff scandal has sparked debate about the level of due diligence wealthy investors should conduct on managers of their money.Philip Segal, North American general counsel at GPW, a business intelligence group, said such requests had become more common but many investors still relied on cursory checks.A routine $900 check on Mr Madoff’s investment group would not have shown any red flags other than gaps in the public record, he said. More thorough due diligence, typically costing $5,000-$7,000, would, however, have raised questions.“We’d call people who used to work for him to find out how the place works. That’s something a machine won’t do.”
5;BXP;Boston Properties;2008-08-26T22:31:19Z;Lehman Brothers can bank on sky-high asset;;Lehman Brothers’ share price has fallen more than 80 per cent since early last year but there is one asset the bank owns that has provided a decent return – its 38-storey headquarters in Times Square.The price of the 575-foot skyscraper could exceed $1.3bn in New York’s relatively healthy office property market – probably less than it would have raised a year ago, but still nearly double the $700m Lehman paid in 2001 – and is now a big slice of the bank’s market capitalisation of $9.6bn.Lehman declined to comment but it is understood that it is not considering selling the building. Brokers also say they have not heard rumours of attempts to sell the building.But the building could prove important for the fourth-largest US investment bank, which has now raised more than $13bn in capital after taking credit-related writedowns and losses of more than $8bn. In its search for cash, Lehman is considering options including the sale of its $40bn commercial real estate portfolio or its highly prized asset management business. It has also had unsuccessful talks on off-loading a 50 per cent stake in the company to Korea Development Bank.Meanwhile, the Lehman Brothers building is one of the highest regarded office towers in Manhattan, as well as one of the newest.“It’s a high quality property, very well built and located,” says Colin Thomasson, managing director at real estate advisers DTZ.Its huge open-trading floors and new electrical infrastructure are the sort of features that makes real estate investors salivate.“[Lehman] are very, very proud of that building,” says The Rockefeller Group, which developed and still manages the site.The value of Lehman’s tower at 745 Seventh Avenue and 49th Street could also be an important factor in any possible takeover – as was proved with the fire sale of Bear Stearns in March.Bear offered a guarantee that JPMorgan Chase, the stricken investment bank’s eventual acquirer, could buy its Manhattan headquarters even if a deal for the whole company fell through.Lehman’s tower has 1.1m square feet of space, including 75,000 sq ft for shops, and was originally developed for Morgan Stanley.However, the bank did not move in after the September 11 terrorist attacks.Assuming Lehman or another tenant keep all the building, brokers say it could be worth as much as $1,200 a square foot, according to David Berkey, director of leasing at L&L Holdings, up from about $636 a square foot when Lehman bought it.That high value comes as Manhattan property has held up better than other parts of the country, with rents continuing to rise – albeit at a slowing pace – although vacancies are up.Underlining the still strong demand in the New York market, Boston Properties recently paid a record $2.8bn for the GM Building on the south-east corner of Central Park, equivalent to about $1,400 a square foot.However, should Lehman or another tenant only use part of the building, and leave it without long-term tenants, its value could be much lower – nearer $900 a square foot, or about $990m, brokers say. Pain in the financial sector from the credit crisis might make it harder to lease a building designed for trading.“One million square feet financial tenants are not growing on trees at the moment. In fact quite the opposite,” said Mr Thomasson.Nevertheless, real estate professionals are confident that if put up for sale the building would attract plenty of suitors.Another option could be for Lehman to sell the property and lease it back – a growing trend.“So long as people have confidence in Lehman as a creditworthy tenant …there will be investors interested,” says Richard Warshauer, senior managing director at broker GVA Williams.
6;BXP;Boston Properties;2008-07-09T19:09:57Z;Abu Dhabi fund takes control of Chrysler Building;;An Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund has bought a controlling stake in the Chrysler Building, an icon of the Manhattan skyline, in the second acquisition of a trophy asset in New York by a Middle Eastern investor in little more than a month.The Abu Dhabi Investment Council is taking a 90 per cent stake in the landmark Art Deco tower for $800m, according to a person familiar with the deal. The building briefly held the title of the world’s tallest building until being pipped by the Empire State Building in 1931.Prudential Real Estate Investors is selling its 75 per cent stake in the tower, while Tishman Speyer, the New York developer, will sell part of its 25 per cent stake, according to the person. Tishman Speyer declined to comment.The acquisition comes after Meraas, an Dubai private equity fund, was among investors who took part in the $2.8bn acquisition of the GM Building in early June, along with Boston Properties and Goldman Sachs. That was the highest price ever paid for a US building, for a skyscraper with one of the most sought-after locations in Manhattan at the south east corner of Central Park.Investors from the region have been a force in New York real estate for some time, rivalling Europe for the dollar volume of their investments in recent years.Now many in the industry say they have seen increased interest from the Middle East, especially in top assets in major US cities such as New York, LA, Washington and Boston, as oil prices soar, the dollar remains weak and building values soften or fall.The investments in the Chrysler and GM buildings come after Dubai World’s investment with MGM Mirage for a hotel, casino and residential project in Las Vegas, and a $1.4bn investment last year in developer Related Companies from investors including the Abu Dhabi government and a Saudi Arabian firm.The foray into commercial property comes after Middle Eastern funds ploughed billions into US banks in the wake of their losses from the credit crisis.ADIC was established last year as an alternative to the huge and longer-established Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and had been thought to be more focused on investing in the Middle East and the Gulf.The office building, not considered to be among the most desirable office spaces in the city, was completed in 1930 for Chrysler, the car company. It is 77 storeys tall and 319 metres high.Prudential took control of the Chrysler Building stake when it bought TMW Real Estate, an Atlanta-based investment company. TMW had taken the investment in the building in 2001 for $300m. It was the last property sold by Prudential from funds managed for German investors, after the company sold 665 5th Avenue and the so-called Lipstick building, both in New York, over recent years.“We are proud to have been able to invest in this US icon, and just as proud to be able to deliver exceptional returns to our German clients,” said a spokesperson for Prudential.
7;BXP;Boston Properties;2008-05-27T20:30:56Z;US stocks gain buoyed by oil price drops;;US stocks ended higher yesterday after struggling for clear direction through the course of the session following the holiday weekend.Investors weighed fresh data on housing and a drop in oil prices against continuing worries about the wider economy.The fall in oil prices through the course of the day added steadily to stock market gains.All eyes were on the financial sector after UBS warned that it might record further losses on non-US real estate holdings. Shares of UBS fell 7.2 per cent to $25.39. The bank is in the process of seeking nearly $16bn in additional capital from its shareholders.Several other investment banks were also back in focus. Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had second-quarter profit estimates cut by Bank of America and Sanford Bernstein analysts based on the risk of further asset writedowns.Lehman, the largest underwriter of mortgage bonds before the subprime market collapsed, has lagged behind Wall Street rivals this year as it tries to shed unwanted assets. Shares in Lehman fell sharply at the opening bell on Tuesday before recovering to end up 3 per cent at $37.20.Goldman Sachs shares were 0.7 per cent higher at $173.92, while Morgan Stanley shares rose 1 per cent to $42.24.Stocks sank during the previous trading session amid surging oil prices and another weak reading on the housing market. US markets were closed on Monday for Memorial Day.But the rising dollar helped push the cost of oil and other commodities markedly lower on Tuesday.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 Index was 0.7 per cent higher at 1,385.35, having been down for the day earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.5 per cent ahead at 2,481.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent higher at 12,548.35.Investors digested several pieces of economic data. Prices of US single-family homes plunged a record 14.1 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, five times faster than the last housing recession, according to the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller national home price index. But there was a gain in April’s figure for the annual rate of new house sales.Mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae fell on the back of the Case-Shiller numbers. Shares in Freddie were down 3.9 per cent at $24.73, while Fannie shares lost 3.8 per cent to $26.53.Shares of bond insurer MBIA lost 2 per cent to $7.22.Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, told the FT there was a better than 50 per cent chance that the nation would endure a recession, in spite of some recent signs of stability in the economy.David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said: “If oil prices come down significantly in the next few weeks, then the economy should still see a decent rebound in the second half of the year. If not then this mild recession will likely be followed by a very tepid rebound in the second half of the year, with unemployment continuing to rise.”Even a weak expansion, if sustained, would probably be positive for stocks and negative for Treasuries given current valuations, said Mr Kelly.Boston Properties, the largest US office real estate investment trust, said it had agreed to buy the General Motors building and three others in New York from Macklowe Properties for $3.95bn. Its shares rose 1.5 per cent to $97.58.Blackstone Group and Apollo Management, the private equity groups, are in talks to buy Chemtura, a manufacturer and marketer of speciality chemicals, in what would be one of the bigger US buyouts this year. Chemtura shares were up 8.9 per cent at $8.49.General Motors fell 1 per cent to $17.42 after Citigroup cut its rating on the largest US automaker to “hold” from “buy”, citing higher energy and commodities costs and credit constraints.Gamestop rose 0.3 per cent to $49.50 as the world’s largest video-game retailer said it would stop carrying Microsoft’s Zune digital music players in stores after they failed to sell as well as other products.Oil companies Exxon Mobil and Chevron both retreated, as crude slid. Shares in Exxon were 1per cent lower at $89.80, while Chevron fell 1.1 per cent to $99.58.
8;BXP;Boston Properties;2008-05-25T19:26:40Z;Macklowe sells GM Building;;Harry Macklowe, the property tycoon, has agreed to sell the General Motors Building and three other Manhattan skyscrapers to Mort Zuckerman’s Boston Properties for $3.95bn.The deal, which could help loosen the logjam within New York’s commercial real estate market, represents a timely escape for Mr Macklowe. The real estate investor had defaulted on loans used to fund his $7bn purchase of buildings from Blackstone Group in February 2007, the height of the property boom.Mr Macklowe had already ceded control of seven buildings to Deutsche Bank, one of his creditors in the deal, earlier this year. Deutsche is now trying to sell those towers. Sunday’s agreement will free Mr Macklowe to pay off a $1.4bn loan from Fortress Investment Group.The sale of the office buildings, including the prized GM tower, have been closely watched by the city’s real estate industry for hopes that it would give better indications of how the credit squeeze had affected prices.The GM Building alone went for about $2.9bn. While it is the highest price paid for a single US building, the figure fell short of the $3bn-$3.3bn analysts had said that Mr Macklowe had initially hoped to pocket.Also included in the sale were office towers at 540 Madison Avenue, 125 West 55th Street and Two Grand Central Tower.Mr Macklowe will receive $1.47bn in cash and $2.47bn of debt. He will also retain a stake in the buildings through a $10m stake in units of Boston Properties’ limited partnership interest.“He will be in a very strong position to pay off his debt,” said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr Macklowe. “He’s still in business as a very strong player, will pay off his remaining debt and still own a great deal of property. He’ll be in a position to do new things.”Boston will take a stake of up to 49 per cent in the properties, with the rest going to other investors.Goldman Sachs, as well as sovereign wealth funds from Kuwait and Qatar, is expected to invest in the deal, people familiar with the discussions said.The GM Building’s lower price tag is a sign of the damage the credit crisis and ensuing economic slowdown have inflicted on the property industry. The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities has almost dried up since last summer.But the deal gives hope to the real estate industry that large deals can be done.
9;BXP;Boston Properties;2008-05-23T19:39:20Z;Mideast wealth funds eye New York property;;Middle Eastern investors in New York may be shifting their sights from banks to buildings.The city’s real estate industry is looking to the region to replicate the capital infusions that Gulf and Asian sovereign wealth funds made into Wall Street banks struggling with subprime losses, by seeking stakes in big real estate assets on the cheap.This week sovereign wealth funds from Kuwait and Qatar emerged among a group of investors led by Boston Properties in talks to buy the GM building, a prize asset overlooking Central Park, as well four other Manhattan skyscrapers, from Harry Macklowe, the struggling New York property tycoon.Mr Macklowe has been caught short by the credit squeeze, and is desperately selling off buildings in order to pay off creditors. The deal would be a big moment for investors from the region.The suggested $2.8bn (£1.4bn, €1.8bn) price for the GM building alone would be the highest price paid for a single building in the US.It would also be one of the highest-profile foreign property acquisitions in the city since Mitsubishi took a stake in the Rockefeller Centre in the late 1980s, a moment that came to symbolise the soaring confidence of Japanese investors in the US. “It’s a very apt comparison,” said Richard Warshauer, senior managing director of broker GVA Williams. “It would be a watershed transaction.”The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as Meraas, the new real estate company of the Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, are among investors from the region that have also looked at the portfolio, according to a person familiar with the matter.A spokesman for Mr Macklowe declined to comment, while Boston Properties and the sovereign funds could not be reached for comment.In recent years Middle Eastern investors have already taken hold of a number of landmark New York buildings.In 2005 and 2006 the region was responsible for more property investment in New York than European sources of cash, according to research by Jones Lang LaSalle.Nakheel, the property investment arm of Dubai World, a Dubai government fund, took a 73 per cent stake in the luxurious Mandarin Oriental hotel in Columbus Circle, overlooking Central Park, in the middle of last year in a deal worth $248m.It also owns more than 90 per cent of the trendy W Hotel Union Square, which it bought in October 2006 for $285m.Investcorp and Broadway Partners bought 280 Park Avenue from Istithmar in January of this year for $1.28bn.“I think there is very high interest in investing in NY assets,” says a private equity investor, adding that with oil at record prices he did not see the trend coming to an end so soon.The attraction of New York property, as well as other US gateway cities such as Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Boston, is that the market is well known to Middle Eastern investors and among America’s most liquid.With the shrivelling of the market for mortgage-backed securities, a greater reluctance on the part of banks to lend and greater economic insecurity, sources of debt have also dried up, leaving those with cash in a better position than they have been for years.Nonetheless, some industry figures argue there may be an element of wishful thinking in hopes of a major injection of Middle Eastern money.“The only real avenue that could undertake the real headline-grabbing deals is the Middle Eastern investors,” says Colin Thomasson, a managing director at DTZ, the real estate adviser.But asking prices have largely not yet fallen far enough to attract such deals.“Buyers and sellers aren’t on the same page yet,” he said.
10;BXP;Boston Properties;2008-05-21T22:20:58Z;Zuckerman in talks on GM building;;Mort Zuckerman, the billionaire real estate and publisher of New York’s Daily News, may ride to the rescue of embattled rival Harry Macklowe, after his Boston Properties entered “advanced” talks to buy the GM building in Manhattan and four other properties, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr Zuckerman’s Boston Properties, along with a group of investors including Goldman Sachs and two Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, could seal a deal within days for Mr Macklowe’s properties valued at between $3.6bn-$3.9bn, people briefed on the matter said. The price is likely to be closer to the high end of that range.The 50-storey GM building – which overlooks Central Park in Manhattan and houses a large Apple store marked by a distinctive glass cube – would be sold for about $2.8bn. That would be the highest amount ever paid for a single building in the US, and double what Mr Macklowe paid for it in 2003, but would still fall short of the $3bn-$3.3bn he had initially hoped for.Mr Macklowe put the GM building and other properties up for sale earlier this year after defaulting on $7bn in short-term loans used to buy seven New York skyscrapers from Blackstone near the peak of the commercial real estate market in February of last year.The sale of Mr Macklowe’s buildings has been nervously awaited by the New York real estate industry, who are desperate for a sense of how far prices have fallen since the credit crisis amid a dearth of deals.Banks’ reluctance to lend and the weakening economy has meant an 82 per cent drop in the volume of New York commercial property purchases in the first quarter, Cushman & Wakefield estimates.“A deal would be very good news because it effectively gives us some data [on pricing] and clears some of the logjam,” said Colin Thomasson, managing director at property brokers DTZ.The involvement of the sovereign wealth funds – the Kuwait Investment Authority and the Qatari Investment Authority – also gives the US commercial property industry a boost.The industry has been increasingly looking to the Middle East to provide equity for deals as sources of debt financing have dried up.None of the parties involved offered comment.According to one person briefed about the matter, talks are “very advanced” and an agreement could be reached within days, but also said that the discussions could easily fall apart.However, another person said talk of a deal was “way premature”.The deal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday evening.
11;BXP;Boston Properties;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;‘Fear’ index jumps amid new worries over banks;;Hopes for a post-Christmas rally on Wall Street were dashed on Thursday after an analyst predicted that Citigroup would cut its dividend and a report showed monthly orders for US durable goods were much weaker than expected.Although investors were reassured by an unexpected pick-up in US consumer confidence, fears of more writedowns in the financial sector again weighed heavily on the main equity indices, all of which sold off.The assassination of Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan’s opposition leader, prompted a flight to safety and a preference for US Treasuries over stocks. Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets, said: “It’s a contributing factor. It’s obviously not a positive for the market.”By the close of trading, the S&P 500 was down 1.4 per cent at 1,476.27 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.8 per cent lower at 2,676.79, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.4 per cent to 13,359.61. Small-cap stocks fared particularly poorly. The Russell 2000 shed 3 per cent to 773.52, dragging the index back into negative territory for the year.Volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge” – jumped 9 per cent to 20.3 although it remains sharply below recent highs.Citigroup fell 2.9 per cent to $29.56, its lowest in more than five years, after a Goldman Sachs analyst said Citi could cut its dividend by 40 per cent and write off as much as $18.7bn in the fourth quarter as it looks to raise an extra $5bn-$10bn to boost its capital reserves.“We assume a more challenging credit environment mired by additional write-offs and higher credit costs,” William Tanona, Goldman Sachs analyst, said.Citi has forecast writedowns of $8bn-$11bn for the fourth quarter and last month sought a $7.5bn capital infusion from Abu Dhabi.Goldman also said it ex-pected another $11.5bn in writedowns from Merrill Lynch, compared with a previous estimate of $6bn, and it said JPMorgan could see a $3.4bn writedown, double Goldman’s previous forecast.Merrill Lynch fell 2.5 per cent to $53.20 and JPMorgan shed 2.9 per cent to $43.64. The S&P financial index fell 2.2 per cent to 391.26.Sallie Mae, the troubled student lender, fell 11.2 per cent to $19.65 after it said it plans to raise $2.5bn through a stock sale to help settle bad bets on its share price.Sallie will offer $1.5bn in common stock and $1bn in preferred stock to pay off equity forward contracts. These derivative contracts have soured after its shares suffered sharp losses following the collapse of a proposed takeover by a consortium led by JC Flowers. Lehman Brothers cut its price target from $31 to $29.Sterling Financial fell 4.3 per cent to $16.39 after the bank revised its fourth quarter and full-year outlooks, citing an increased provision for credit costs.The real estate investment trust sector also felt selling pressure after a trade association report showed a decline in mortgage applications. Boston Properties dipped 2.2 per cent to $93.07.However, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the troubled government-sponsored mortgage agencies, rose 2.1 per cent to $39.61 and 4 per cent to $33.70 respectively after a regulator said the companies were “adequately capitalised” through to the end of the third quarter, when both companies posted big losses.In technology, Apple hit a new all-time high on reports of a plans to offer video rental through its iTunes online store. The shares rose to $202.96 before ending slightly down at $198.57.Potash Corp, the world’s largest potash producer, hit a new 52-week high after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “buy”, citing the company’s ability to raise prices due to strong demand. Shares rose to $146.38 before settling 1.3 per cent higher at $145.29.
12;BXP;Boston Properties;2007-08-09T18:39:56Z;View from the Top: Mort Zuckerman on the credit crunch;;Chrystia Freeland, Financial Times US managing editor, interviewed Mort Zuckerman, chairman of Boston Properties. This is a transcript of the interview, which you may watch here. In this segment he discusses the credit crunch and real estate.FINANCIAL TIMES: Thank you for joining us Mr. Zuckerman.MORT ZUCKERMAN: I’m delighted to be here.FT: Has the US property market peaked?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, let’s disaggregate the US property market. You have commercial space which is office space, retail space and residential space. I would say that residential space is pretty close to the top - in fact residential prices, for the first time since 1991, had been doing down. They’re up one or two per cent this year.FT: Is there an end in sight? Will the same ills which plagued residential property hit commercial -MR ZUCKERMAN: That’s always possible. The difference is that, in the markets that we are in, the suppliers constraint, for one reason or another. Either because there are very few sites available, such as is true in New York City or, indeed, in Washington or, indeed, in Cambridge, Massachusetts - and even in San Francisco there are very few sites that are available, so the supply is constrained in these markets. The Mayor of Chicago always calls and asks why we don’t want to develop in Chicago and I always have the perfect answer for him: I say “Because your city is too well managed.” By that I mean “You can bring on new supply very quickly.” That’s what will constrain pricing.FT: And you are not seeing a tapering off from that demand yet?MR ZUCKERMAN: We have not seen it at all. Quite the opposite, in terms of - if you have a good building in the right location in these markets, the rents are still moving and moving up, and the supply is being absorbed dramatically.FT: How far do you think the problems that we are seeing in this sub-prime mortgage market are going to spread?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, I actually believe its more serious than I originally thought, and in fact, on some level, you have to say nobody knows quite how serious it is. Because the way so many homes have been financed in the last couple of years, where you had less than 5 per cent equity in the homes - in over 45 per cent of the homes that have been sold in the last couple of years, you had less than 5 per cent equity.If you begin to have a decline in home prices, you’re going to be in a situation where many of these homes will be worth less than the mortgages, and at that point, you don’t know what the occupant will do. Will they walk away from whatever the equity is, would they walk away from whatever they’ve done? If they have good jobs they probably won’t, but there will be a lot of times where they will walk away and, at that point, the whole system is going to get into a freeze position because everybody’s rushing towards the door at the same time. There’ll be no orderly liquidation of these things because they have changed the ownership of the mortgages of these homes from where they used to be held, which is in certain kinds of banks, they’ve now -FT: Who maybe knew their customers?MR ZUCKERMAN: Right. Knew their customers, knew something about the real estate, knew something about the value of the homes and, frankly, by and large, had larger down payments. More than a 5 per cent thing. That has only become part of the new kinds of financing mechanisms and the CDOs, as they’re called, where they slice and dice all of these different tranches, as they call them, measuring them according to different, quote unquote, risks. And now you are finding the rating agencies are going in and they are re-pricing the risks. And, whatever the risks are, the lenders are re-pricing the risks as well.FT: As these CDOs were being invented, one of the arguments that was made was that they actually would make the financial system more stable, they would allow people more precisely to choose the amount of risk they wanted. Do you think that’s what we are seeing?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well they certainly diversified the ownership and the risk so that if one area, for example, of housing got into trouble, the local banks generally got into much more difficulty. On the other hand what happened is something very different. Since everybody’s business became a function of off-loading this paper, for the fees that you made, okay, and all you were concerned with was not holding the paper but off-loading it to other investors, be it hedge funds or what have you, then you have a different situation where, in one sense, you disperse the risk but in another sense the judgement about the risk got to be looser and looser and looser.And now we are finding out that we’re in real trouble on this. In part because housing prices had been pushed up so dramatically by these new methods of financing that the homeowners were virtually unable to support these homes without very low interest rates and a huge proportion of an interest rate, and everybody was banking on housing prices going up forever.FT: So do you think we really don’t have a sense of how much risk there is in the system?MR ZUCKERMAN: I don’t think we really do. I think there are some people who think they do but I think, as we have found out, in terms of how quickly the whole system went into a panic mode - in a matter of two weeks really, although it was building - nobody knows just how serious this will get. And you can have one statement or one mortgage company going under again, and all the financial markets can tank again or freeze up. And it doesn’t mean it will necessarily happen, but it’s the first time everybody can say, “Hey, this is a real risk.”FT: And how likely is that kind of freeze, that you described, how likely is it that sort of a freeze is likely to continue?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well if it happens it’s going to continue for a while and the only thing that will unglue it, okay, is what the Federal Reserve can do. And the Federal Reserve is in a position to lower interest rates, and make more money available, and in a sense, free up the system to a degree.FT: And what do you expect the Fed to do in coming months?MR ZUCKERMAN: I believe, and I just wrote an editorial saying, there is no doubt that the Fed is going to have to move and cut rates. The limitation on that, of course, is what it will do to the dollar, which the Fed is concerned about, on another level.FT: Which is also weakening.MR ZUCKERMAN: Which has been weakening, and been weakening for quite a while. So this is - they don’t want to see a run on the dollar, okay? Which has negative inflationary implications for the United States economy. So they are going to be very careful about this, and you just have to assume that they have pretty good judgement, and I think the Federal Reserve chairman, [Ben] Bernanke, really has very good judgement on this matter, so I think we will get a measured response from them.FT: Do you think the Sam Zell/Blackstone deal could have gone through under today’s credit conditions?MR ZUCKERMAN: I think it would have been much more difficult and, if the deal had gone through, well you just saw where the Archstone deal was now deferred, I think it would have been much more difficult and, certainly, if the deal had gone through, it would have been a lot more difficult for Blackstone, because Blackstone was able to turn around and sell the Washington assets, the New York assets, the Stanford assets. They have kept the Boston assets –FT: Will they have a hard time unloading the remaining properties?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, they will have time unloading the properties if that’s what they want. I think they are going to keep them for a while, and since they had the staying power, I suspect they will still do very well with them.FT: At what point will we see these issues in the credit markets and the residential property markets starting to have a real impact on the rest of the economy?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, this is very interesting: We’ve had a 22 or 23 per cent drop in new home sales from last year to this year. Now there has been a major drop now in new construction. Normally, that drop in construction would have cost the economy 900,000 jobs. But according to the statistics that we have, it’s only taken out 160-200,000 jobs.Now why the difference? Well, that is a very interesting question. I believe that the vast bulk of the difference is because we have undocumented workers, as they call them, or illegal people, who are here without – basically illegal immigrants, who are here working in these jobs, and so this is sort of a flexible cushion to the economy, because these people, if necessary, will go back to their homes.FT: So it’s the hated illegal immigrants who are the secret strength of the American economy?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, they are certainly the secret strength of a part of the American economy. In my judgement they strengthen the American economy and, in a sense, because they absorb this kind of shock, it’s another strength that they bring to the American economy.FT: Thank you very much.MR ZUCKERMAN: You are very welcome.FT: And now Mort Zuckerman places his bets on long/short. Okay, Mr. Zuckerman, now we are going to play long/short – are you ready?MR ZUCKERMAN: I’m trying, I’m trying.FT: US interest rates?MR ZUCKERMAN: I believe the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates and I think short-term rates and long term rates will continue to go down. Less long-term rates but certainly short term rates.FT: Sam Zell?MR ZUCKERMAN: Sam Zell is one of the most talented business people I have ever encountered. He’s got one of those remarkable talents that is not atypical of a lot of Americans. He just gets his feet on the ground and understands the way things work. So I think he will do as good a job as possible in making the Tribune Company able to sustain good journalism.FT: Manhattan commercial real estate?MR ZUCKERMAN: Manhattan commercial real estate is still the best investment in real estate that anybody could make. We are thrilled with Manhattan real estate, we are starting two new buildings, each of around a million square feet, and the demand for that space is extraordinary. So I think, for as far as the eye can see, it’s extraordinarily strong.FT: The Canadian Dollar?MR ZUCKERMAN: I think the Canadian Dollar is going to continue to be strong because it’s still a natural-resource economy, and relative to the rest of the world, those are the economies that have done well and whose currencies have done well.FT: Cure for cancer?MR ZUCKERMAN: Oh boy, that is a tough one! What I think will happen, if it is properly funded over the next decade, we will make enormous progress in the cure - there is no such thing as cancer, there are so many different kinds of cancers. But we will make enormous progress in terms of using stem-cell research to redefine what kinds of cancers there are and how to treat them. We are just at the beginning of that.FT: The Wall Street Journal?MR ZUCKERMAN: The Wall Street Journal I think will be a larger-circulation newspaper than it is now. It will expand its coverage into politics and culture to a considerable degree, and it will be a long time before it justifies the investment.FT: Jimmy Cayne?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well Jimmy Cayne is a wonderful man and an unbelievably talented man, and as a CEO of Bear Stearns, he is about the last CEO of a major investment banking firm that I thought would have gotten into trouble over risk management. But that is, of course, the trouble they got into, in part because everybody else got into it.FT: So – short?MR ZUCKERMAN: So, do I think it’s a short now? No, I -FT: Are you short on Jimmy Cayne?MR ZUCKERMAN: No, I’m not short. I’m long on Jimmy Cayne. Jimmy Cayne has taken a lot of very decisive steps to re-shape his top management, and I’m sure they will deal with those problems as effectively as possible. They’ll take a hit but they’ll be back in the business and doing well.FT: US Dollar?MR ZUCKERMAN: The US Dollar, in my judgement, has been weak, it’s lost probably, 35-40 per cent over the last half dozen years, I think it’s going to continue to be weak.FT: Portfolio Magazine?MR ZUCKERMAN: Portfolio Magazine, you know, all business magazines are having great, great difficulties. Their advertising is not flowing. What they are trying to become is the Vanity Fair of business. So in effect, they are going to become a magazine about people. And if they do a particularly brilliant job, I think they have a chance to make it. But it’s going to be a tough sledding.FT: Matisse paintings?MR ZUCKERMAN: You know, I tell you something. I would buy any Matisse painting that I could, if I could afford it. There is no way that the value of those paintings is going to go in any direction except up. There are a lot of very, very, very interested buyers in Matisse paintings.FT: Thank you very much.MR ZUCKERMAN: You’re very welcome.FT: That was Mort Zuckerman of Boston Properties and the New York Daily News on the credit crunch and real estate. You can also hear him discussing Murdoch, Bloomberg and the death of newspapers. Next week Brady Dougan of Credit Suisse reviews the news on video for FT.com’s View from the Top.
13;BXP;Boston Properties;2007-08-09T18:39:36Z;View from the Top: Mort Zuckerman on Murdoch, Bloomberg and the death of newspapers;;"Chrystia Freeland, Financial Times US managing editor, interviewed Mort Zuckerman, chairman of Boston Properties. This is a transcript of the interview, which you may watch here. In this segment he discusses Murdoch, Bloomberg and the death of newspapers.FINANCIAL TIMES: Thank you for joining us Mr. Zuckerman.MORT ZUCKERMAN: I’m delighted to be here.FT: Turning to media, the New York Post has now exceeded the Daily News in circulation. Are you still fighting to be top dog in New York?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, you have to understand, circulation isn’t nearly as important as readership. There are many games that can be played, and I wouldn’t be the last. But if you look at the thing that determines what really is important for a newspaper, which is readership, which affects advertising, we are vastly ahead of the New York Post. We’re something like a 1,200,000 readers ahead on Sunday.FT: So you think you’re beating Rupert Murdoch?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, I’m not trying to beat him. I’m just trying to do well with the Daily News, which has done very well while they have lost. We have about [2,100 or] 2,200 pages of advertising. They have 900 pages of advertising. And their circulation revenue is less than half ours because they charge so much less.FT: Is he an uneconomical competitor?MR ZUCKERMAN: He’s a non-economic competitor. But he is prepared, as you know, to lose for a very long time in the hopes that he basically kills off his competition. I don’t believe that’s going to happen. But he’s a very formidable competitor for those reasons.FT: And what about newspapers as a business? Do they have a long-term future?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, I have been saying recently that print business is at the top of the greasy pole of oxymorons. It is very difficult to imagine how these will succeed as business enterprises. Everybody is looking for a business plan that works, and in the news part of the business, newspapers and news magazines, they are all in very deep trouble. You have a real decline in newsstand circulation. You have a real decline in overall circulation, you have a real decline in advertising revenues, and you don’t have any reduction in costs.FT: Which business is in bigger trouble - daily newspapers or newsweeklies?MR ZUCKERMAN: My own view is if you have a monopoly daily newspaper, I would say those are not in as much trouble, even if -FT: Metro dailies?MR ZUCKERMAN: Yeah, metro. But if you look at the decline in the New York Times circulation in New York City, or the Washington Post, or the LA Times, or the Chicago papers, the decline is quite dramatic in their circulation - and in their revenue - and their profits are going down. The Tribune company lost money at this stage of the game, after having been dramatically profitable. The people who bought Knight Ridder’s papers, most of them, their stock has gone down 60% as a result of that acquisition.So I think the economics of newspapers at this point are really quite daunting, and it’s going to be a few years before we see whether or not most newspapers can survive. The fact is that there’s a whole generation of readers coming in who do not read newspapers. They get their news off something called the internet, and they are very comfortable in that, and they talk to themselves about the stories, and talk to their peer groups through the internet and through their websites and through their blogs, and this is having a much greater impact on everything.FT: And what about the speed? Is the decline going to be gradual? Or might newspapers just fall off a cliff?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, right now I think the newspapers are under tremendous pressure, economic pressure. The squeeze on their earnings is really quite dramatic. I would have to say to you that the New York Post is losing $75m to $100m a year. Not too many people are prepared to sustain those losses forever, and I think that’s going to affect it. If newspapers get into that mode, I think the San Francisco Chronicle is a paper that may virtually shut down. Somebody is going to have to support them -FT: So is the only future of newspapers to be owned by rich people who don’t mind losing money?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, even rich people don’t like to lose money. No, I don’t think that is the case. I think whoever owns newspapers is going to have to find a viable business model. And if they don’t find a viable business model, one way or another they’re going to get out of that business. At some point, no matter how much fun it is - and it is really interesting and real fun - people get tired of losing that kind of money.FT: Are you a proprietor of print businesses in part to give yourself a political platform to express your own views?MR ZUCKERMAN: No I didn’t go into it for that. It was a way to really immerse yourself in public policy, which is - if I go to a dinner, or to a luncheon, I spend most of my time with my friends talking about that. So this was a way where - I mean I give you as an example –FT: Not about residential property mortgages?MR ZUCKERMAN: Never. But look, the Daily News, I think has contributed something to New York City. We endorsed Rudy Giuliani when he ran, and mayor Bloomberg. We were the only major newspaper in the city and the only minor newspaper in the city, but for one Spanish language paper with a circulation of 11,000, to support mayor Bloomberg. That endorsement was worth more, in terms of the vote than what his margin of victory was, so you can say it really contributed –FT: You elected Mike Bloomberg?MR ZUCKERMAN: No, I don’t feel that way, I’m just saying - because a lot of other people voted for him as well - but I think without the Daily News endorsement, he may very well not have won.FT: Do you think that’s good or bad for civic society - that someone who’s made a fortune in one business can sort of buy a public voice?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, I don’t know - yeah, well, in my case I think it was wonderful, both for the city, for the country, and for myself. Now, other people may not feel that way.FT: Does it ever help, or maybe hurt, your commercial property activities?MR ZUCKERMAN: They’re completely separate. It’s never helped or hurt them.FT: What is Rupert Murdoch like as a newspaper rival?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, as I say, I think he is a very talented man in terms of his business acumen.FT: What do you think his motives were in buying Dow Jones?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, I am no greater seer of his inner motives as anybody else. I can see where it makes some degree of business sense over the long term, and that is the following. Number one, he is starting a business channel - Fox Business Channel, which is going to compete with CNBC. And that is a real multiplier of the value of attaching the Wall Street Journal credibility and respect to that channel.Two is, I think he sees that the websites of the Journal can be much more profitable, in the short run, and financial information can be much more valuable as a global asset over any kind of period of time, if properly exploited and produced. And I think he sees - believes that he can take that, as, frankly, the Financial Times and Reuters and others have done that, and be competitive in that world.And thirdly, I don’t know if he’s interested in this thing, but he can turn the Wall Street Journal into the most important national newspaper with a conservative voice, and be a huge voice in the public dialogue, beyond what it is already, and it’s already an important voice. It will not - under him, it will not be less conservative. The issue is, will it be less credible because of the way he treats -FT: But maybe it will be more influential? Because more well read, better funding?MR ZUCKERMAN: Well, yes - he’ll fund it, and in the nature of the way our system works, if he adds 200,000 to the daily circulation of the Wall Street Journal, everybody’s going to say it’s a success, no matter what the economics are -FT: Even if it loses money?MR ZUCKERMAN: Even if it loses money. Look, the Post loses a fortune, and he gives away the paper and sells the paper for half the price, and gives away the advertising for a third to a half of the price, and everybody says, well, that’s great, it’s going very well. Nobody really knows how much it’s losing.FT: Do you think the same thing’s going to happen to the Journal? Lots of money poured in?MR ZUCKERMAN: I don’t know, I don’t know.FT: No return expected?MR ZUCKERMAN: I don’t know. He has already paid a gigantic price for it in relation to its earnings. So he either wants it for business reasons or for political reasons. He’s one of the few people who knows how to use his newspapers for his own sort of broader political objectives. And there are many things that you always want from the government when you have as many different media as he has.FT: Is that bad for America?MR ZUCKERMAN: It all depends.FT: On?MR ZUCKERMAN: On who is exercising the influence, and for what purposes.FT: Well, we know that it’s going to be Rupert Murdoch exercising influence.MR ZUCKERMAN: I - that is, as we say in journalism, TK. I do think he has allowed many things to happen with the New York Post that I hope never happens with the Wall Street Journal.For example one of their leading reporters confessed to having accepted money from somebody, some company that he was covering, a restaurant business. He acknowledged this and he didn’t acknowledge it voluntarily; one of his colleagues revealed all of this and many other, shall we say, improprieties. Now, there isn’t a newspaper that I know of in America that wouldn’t have fired this person for taking money from one of the stories that he was covering.Well, can you imagine somebody at the Wall Street Journal taking money from a company that he is covering? What will he do? Will he not apply the same standards? Will he apply different standards? It’s all going to look very, very funny and fishy if that happens. And that’s the problem that he has. He’s going to have to find some way to maintain not just the conservative voice of that newspaper, but the credibility of that newspaper. I have - he’s very smart, and he knows that credibility is crucial, so I suspect he will have no difficulty figuring out what to do in that regard.FT: Who do you think is in the greatest danger from a Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal?MR ZUCKERMAN: The New York Times.FT: Why?MR ZUCKERMAN: Because he can make it into a much more influential national newspaper by expanding its political coverage and other kinds of coverage. And, frankly, most of the country - the New York Time is a very, very liberal newspaper in its orientation editorially, and to some extent the way it presents the news. So, you know - and I think that the, the country basically, and particularly the people who read this kind of newspaper are much more conservative than the New York Times. So he’s got a real advantage in that regard. He’s also… the circulation’s over 2m now and the New York Times have got 1.2m. So if he adds two or three hundred thousand people who are basically in it for the politics of it, it will enormously enhance the power of that paper.FT: Which presidential candidate do you think would be the best for Israel?MR ZUCKERMAN: I don’t know who would be the best for Israel. I know whom I think would be the best in terms of sheer talent. Not the only one who has a lot of talent, but, I think – and I don’t even know if he’s running - which is the Mayor of New York, who is the single most talented public servant that I have ever encountered and a brilliant political executive. He’s done a phenomenal job in New York City, and he’s done it in ways which I believe are replicable on a national scale.FT: And there isn’t a problem with using your fortune to buy office?MR ZUCKERMAN: I, I do not - I do not think so at all. I think he, he will say something to the following effect: “My father never made more than $11,000 in any year. I’ve had a very different experience in this wonderful land of opportunity we call America. And I have tried to recognise that through a lifetime of public philanthropy and public service, but public service of a particular kind in both campaigns for the mayoralty of New York. I paid every penny of those campaigns, so I would not be beholden to any of the financial interests, or other big contributors who had an inordinate sway on public policy.”FT: Do you think he will run?MR ZUCKERMAN: I personally believe he will run, but that’s only my own –FT: Really?MR ZUCKERMAN: Yes, I do believe he will run.FT: If he were to run, isn’t there a danger that he might be a spoiler candidate?MR ZUCKERMAN: Yes, there is that danger, I don’t think he’s going to run to be a spoiler, and I don’t think he’s going to run to lose. So the question is, at that point, does - and that point will be in February of next year, after the primaries, particularly the February 5th primary, have revealed who the Republican nominee is and who the Democratic nominee is. So we’ll know who his opponents are and whether he thinks there is an opening.FT: Thank you very much.MR ZUCKERMAN: You’re very welcome.FT: That was Mort Zuckerman of Boston Properties and the New York Daily News on Murdoch, Bloomberg and the death of newspapers.

14;BXP;Boston Properties;2007-08-09T06:32:49Z;Zuckerman: subprime crisis ‘could worsen’;;Mortimer Zuckerman, chairman of Boston Properties and publisher of the New York Daily News, has warned that financial markets may face more upheaval from hidden problems in the US subprime mortgage market.Mr Zuckerman, who has become a billionaire through his real estate business, said problems in the subprime market were “more serious than I originally thought” and that “nobody knows quite how serious”.Mr Zuckerman, in a video interview with the Financial Times, said residential property prices in the US were “pretty close to the top” but that prices for commercial space in most markets were still going up. Boston Properties is concentrated in office rentals in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Washington DC.Many mortgage problems stem from the way homes are financed, he said, with more than 45 per cent of homes sold in recent years requiring less than a 5 per cent equity stake.“If you begin to have a decline in home prices, you’re going to be in a situation where many of these homes will be worth less than the mortgages. And at that point you don’t know what the occupant will do …there will be a lot of times where they will walk away …the whole system is going to get into a freeze position, because everybody is rushing towards the door at the same time,” he said.Mr Zuckerman said the problems were exacerbated because mortgages are packaged in collateralised debt obligations – complex securities that pool a variety of credits and are sold to institutional investors. “In one sense you disperse the risk, but in another sense the judgment about the risk [has] got to be looser and now we’re finding out that we’re in real trouble.”Mr Zuckerman was pessimistic about the print industry’s prospects as readers switched to the internet and advertisers followed.The Daily News is a rival of Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post. The Post recently beat the Daily News in terms of headline circulation, but the latter continues to dominate in advertising.He said Mr Murdoch, whose News Corp is close to completing a $5bn takeover of Dow Jones and its Wall Street Journal newspaper, was a “formidable competitor”, not least because “he is prepared to lose [money] for a very long time in the hopes that he basically kills off his competition”.

Its shares rose 4.4 per cent to $5.25 after Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the stock by two notches from “underweight” to “overweight”, citing an improved financial outlook.Qualcomm and other wireless technology companies, including Motorola, also benefited from an upbeat new coverage note from Cowen & Co. The broker gave the two companies an “outperform” rating, saying the outlook for the global handset market was positive this year. Qualcomm rose 2.8 per cent to $51. Motorola gained 3.8 per cent to $22.77.Google, which will join the S&P on Friday, rose 4.7 per cent to $394.98. Apple, which is facing a class-action lawsuit that claims iPods cause hearing loss, jumped 6.2 per cent to $62.33 after it released a software upgrade that allows users to set a maximum volume limit on iPods.Red Hat failed to capitalise on the upswing. Its shares lost 2.2 per cent to $28.19 after the Linux computer software distributor’s second quarter guidance failed to meet investors’ lofty expectations.Interest rate sensitive stocks such as financials, homebuilders and industrial blue chips recovered, buoyed by growing expectations that US economic and corporate profit growth would withstand the ill effects of rising interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent higher at 11,231.94 while the S&P 500 added 0.8 per cent to 1,302.89.Elsewhere, news that Boston Properties and Kimco Realty were set to join the S&P 500 index drove shares in the real estate investment funds up 6.9 per cent to $96.87 and 6.8 per cent to $41.40 respectively as fund managers adjusted their portfolios to track the index.“The increased reit weighting in the S&P 500 means fund managers(both in the U.S. and abroad) have to pay additional attention to this once overlooked sector, which should expand valuations in the short-term,” said Steve Sakwa, analyst at Merrill Lynch.The S&P real estate index rose 1.8 per cent, with ProLogis up 2.3 per cent at $54.65 and Vornado Realty up 2 per cent at $97.43, among the other reits to advance.Other movers included General Motors, which fell 2.6 per cent to $22.15 after disclosures in the carmaker’s delayed annual report sparked fresh investor worries and led Standard & Poor’s to say it might downgrade the company’s credit rating further.Ameritrade shot up 9.4 per cent to $20.96 after the online broker raised its quarterly earnings forecasts thanks to surging customer trading volume
