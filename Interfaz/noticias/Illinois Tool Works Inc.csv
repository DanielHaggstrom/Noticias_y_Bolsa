Executives have pointed to a combination of higher freight and labour costs with increased prices for raw materials, some of which has been driven by the Trump administration’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, and by other countries’ retaliatory tariffs on US goods. This was largely offset in the quarter by a robust economy however, boosted by last December’s tax reforms and a strong employment market. “I think there is, overall, very little pushback on price increases,” Michael Larson, chief financial officer of Illinois Tool Works, told a Jefferies conference earlier this month. The price increases stemming from rising raw material costs and tariff effects were “well understood” by customers, he said, and underlying demand remained strong, allowing the company to offset higher costs with increased pricing “dollar for dollar”. Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, also pointed to a strong US economy providing support for price increases at a retailer known for its low-price focus. “Customers tell us that they feel better about the current health of the US economy as well as their personal finances,” he told analysts last week. 2.8%US core producer price rise in year to July 2018Companies that have announced price increases include Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, Stanley Black & Decker and Whirlpool, but not all have yet taken effect. Caterpillar told investors that its price increases came into effect on July and should offset the “material” cost increases and tariff impacts it expects in the second half of the year. Kimberly-Clark said it would raise the price of brands such as Kleenex and Huggies by mid- to high-single digits early next year, to offset higher commodity costs. Newell Brands, the company behind consumer products from Rubbermaid containers to Sharpie pens, announced higher pricing in anticipation of tariffs that could cost it $100m a year, but Michael Polk, its CEO, cautioned: “We don’t know yet how much of the pricing will stick.”The ability to pass on higher costs has allowed companies to protect and in many cases boost their profit margins. “Following the best earnings season since 2010, S&P 500 profit margins have now risen to an all-time high,” Goldman Sachs analysts noted. Second-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 index are on track to increase 24.6 per cent from the same period of last year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Goldman cautioned, however, that margin growth is likely to slow, as the “tailwinds” of tax cuts fade, global growth moderates and wage pressures and interest rates both rise. ADP recorded US wage growth of 3 per cent in the second quarter, and core producer prices rose 0.3 per cent month-on-month in July to stand 2.8 per cent above their level a year earlier.A weak reading on Friday from the University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment survey for August has raised questions about sensitivity to rising prices, particularly among poorer consumers, with the report’s chief economist saying that the fall-off in favourable price perceptions it found was “much larger than ever before recorded”.

1;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2016-06-06T17:29:25Z;US economy: capital punishment;Investors in capital-intensive sectors will hope US data are misleading;Last week Brent crude futures closed above $50 for the first time since November. Sighs of relief all round: how bad can the economy be when fuel prices are rising? Then came the lousy US job numbers on Friday: maybe it can be pretty bad, after all. And the jobs data are not the only sign that the commodity bounce does not reflect strong US output.Data from the Association of American Railroads reveal startlingly low demand for carload and container shipments since the beginning of the year. This can be explained, in some part, by producers’ unwillingness to ship coal and petroleum products at the low prices prevailing earlier in the year. Lower raw material costs should provide a boost to manufacturing and building, though. This does not seem to be working. The Federal Reserve reported in April that the year-on-year increase in total dollars spent for building construction and improvement is among the lowest observed since the financial crisis. The Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index is hovering near post-crisis lows, having dipped below 50 (indicating contraction) five times in the past year.The railway sector has already taken its lumps, although stocks such as CSX and Union Pacific have recovered somewhat since the beginning of the year. Not all sectors that should be sensitive to weak industrial activity have suffered, though. The ratio of prices to historic earnings in the capital goods sector has pushed out to 20, compared with a one-year average of 18.The likes of Illinois Tool Works and Stanley Black & Decker, for example — both sought-after, high-quality stocks with attractive dividends and limited commodity exposure — are up nicely over the past year. This looks odd, if US housing and industrial activity is rolling over. And the economic data are at least consistent with such a slowdown.Economies are devilishly hard to predict. Talk of “leading indicators” is misleading in most every case. Some stock prices, however, look like a poor fit with where the economy appears to be right now.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
2;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2012-08-16T18:27:34Z;ITW in $1bn decorative surfaces sale;;Illinois Tool Works, the diversified US manufacturer, has agreed to sell a 51 per cent stake in its decorative surfaces division to a private equity fund managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice for about $1.05bn.The division, which makes laminates, adhesives and other surfaces, is the latest of a series of disposals by ITW of non-core assets, including the sale of its finishings group to Graco in April for $650m cash. However, it is the first disposal to involve the sale of only a partial stake in the business concerned.David Speer, chief executive, said the decorative surfaces segment had a variety of premium brands and was a valuable asset.“For ITW, the transaction will allow us to focus more resources on our core platforms as well as retain a share in the value of the business as global construction end markets improve over the coming years,” he said.The division will become a standalone company under the name Wilsonart International Holdings after the transaction, due to be completed in the fourth quarter this year.Nathan Sleeper, a CD&R partner, said the transaction created a “very strong foundation” for Wilsonart to deliver continued industry-leading performance.ITW said it expected to use most of the expected $1.05bn proceeds to repurchase shares to offset the transaction’s dilutive effect on future earnings. The division generated $1.1bn revenues and 12 per cent operating margins in 2011.ITW shares rose 3.6 per cent to $59.67.

But the index closed at 1,293.66, a gain of just 0.4 per cent, as financials, which had trended positive in the morning session, finished the day as the only sector in the red.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.5 per cent to 12,482.22, while the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,728.08.Earlier, contrasting results from Citigroup and Wells Fargo had emphasised the diverging fortunes of investment banking franchises and more conventional mortgage lenders.Citigroup ended the day off 8.2 per cent to $28.22, giving up half its gains for the year, as its investment banking arm reported a fourth-quarter loss, and overall net income of $1.2bn came in significantly below analyst expectations.Wells Fargo climbed 0.7 per cent to $29.83, as the largest US home lender reported record fourth-quarter earnings. Deposits at Wells rose 13 per cent during the quarter and residential mortgage lending increased more than a third to $120bn.For much of the day investors had appeared ready to wait for other banks to report their own results, rather than taking flight from the sector as a whole. Bank of America had enjoyed the best opening in the Dow Jones index, while Goldman Sachs was also in the black at midday.But BofA ended the day off 2 per cent to $6.48, Goldman was down 1.3 per cent to $97.68, Morgan Stanley fell 2.3 per cent to $16.25 and JPMorgan Chase, which had disappointed analysts with its own fourth-quarter results on Friday, closed down 2.8 per cent to $34.91.Despite the late sell-off, analysts were optimistic that bank stocks could avoid the large, correlated falls that characterised the second half of 2011.“I think investors are willing to put Q4 bank results behind them, and I think we remain on a general trend of financial stocks outperforming as long as sentiment towards the US economy improves,” said Richard Staite at Atlantic Equities.The day had started positively as US investors focused on positive data from better than expected Chinese gross domestic product and German investor sentiment numbers to offset Standard & Poor’s downgrade of eurozone sovereigns and the eurozone bail-out fund over the long American weekend.“Investors appear ever more convinced that central banks will do what it takes to ensure recovery regardless of downgrades,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial, “but technical analysts will point to low volume and the limited breadth of this equity rally. Volume is oxygen for bulls, and we’re not seeing that yet.”Elsewhere, shares in Sears Holdings surged 9.5 per cent to $36.75 as an analyst suggested Edward Lampert, Sears’ chairman and a big shareholder, may take the troubled department store chain private, buying out other shareholders.Sears’ market capitalisation has halved since the start of November, as the company announced store closures in December. Mr Lampert increased his personal stake in the company last week.Carnival Corporation plunged 13.7 per cent to $29.60 as investors traded shares in the cruise ship operator for the first time since one of its liners ran aground off the coast of Italy on the weekend.Carnival has estimated the initial financial impact of the disaster at $95m.RR Donnelley slumped 15.8 per cent to $12.13 for the worst performance in the S&P 500, as the corporate digital communications provider lowered its full-year 2011 revenue forecast to $10.6bn from as much as $10.8bn in November.Amazon investors brushed off a cybersecurity breach at its wholly owned subsidiary, the online shoe-seller Zappos, as shares closed up 1.8 per cent at $181.66.Saudi Arabia’s decision to target a crude oil price of $100 a barrel, a third higher than its previous publicly stated target, helped US energy companies with proved oil reserves.Denbury Resources climbed 4.4 per cent to $17.82, while ExxonMobil was up 1 per cent to $85.69 and Chevron climbed 0.6 per cent to $106.72. But gas explorers continued to suffer, with Cabot Oil & Gas down 1.2 per cent to $66.36, as US natural gas prices hit new multiyear lows on Monday.Newmont Mining fell 3.9 per cent to $60.94 after the company said copper output would be lower and capital expenditure higher in 2012 compared to 2011.Shares in Boeing climbed 0.9 per cent to $75.24, as European rival Airbus said total aircraft orders will probably drop by more than 50 per cent this year to as few as 600 from an all-time high of 1,419 in 2011.Illinois Tool Works climbed 3.2 per cent to $50.96, after the company said over the weekend it would allow Relational Investors, an activist investment firm, to appoint a board member.

Up to a third of the crude refined by both companies is WTI.The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to 1,229.11, its second worst daily performance this month, after worse than expected house price data, and cautious trading ahead of Wednesday’s eurozone summit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.7 per cent to 11,706.7, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 2.3 per cent at 2,638.42, back into negative territory for the year.Netflix shares plunged more than a third after the movie-streaming and DVD delivery service said domestic users fell by almost 1m during the third quarter – a larger fall than the company had predicted in mid-September.The stock fell 34.9 per cent to $77.37. The setback followed a tumultuous month, after the company increased the price of its joint DVD and streaming service by 60 per cent before announcing and then retracting a decision to divide the two units.Netflix’s market capitalisation has fallen by two-thirds since September 15, when the company first told investors it would lose subscribers.James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities, one of the few analysts who had maintained a “buy” on the stock through its stormy month, downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a “sell”.Goldman Sachs also dropped its “buy” rating on Netflix.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar plunged 25.3 per cent to $43.27 in just a few minutes of extremely heavy trading mid-afternoon, after the company announced the departure of its chief executive without explanation.Quest Diagnostic was the standout performer in the S&P 500, jumping 10.9 per cent to $56.50, after the clinical testing company eked out positive earnings on stronger margins, despite falling sales. That helped Quest’s rival Laboratory Corporation of America rise 1.2 per cent to $84.07.Analogue semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments was down 2.3 per cent at $30.95, after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue estimate disappointed the market.An earnings miss and bleak fourth-quarter guidance from industrial conglomerate 3M hit cyclical industrial and energy stocks. 3M was down 6.3 per cent to $77.04, Cummins was off 5.1 per cent to $93.81, after the engine manufacturer also cut full-year earnings guidance, citing weak demand from China and India, and a strong dollar.Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations Illinois Toolworks fell 5.4 per cent to $45.65, after the company forecast weaker demand from Europe in the fourth quarter.AK Steel Holding shed 13.6 per cent to $7.47 after the company declared a loss of $3.5m or 3 cents a share.Coal miner Peabody Energy ended a volatile day down 3.1 per cent at $39.66. The stock fell as much as 8 per cent at the start of trading after ArcelorMittal pulled out of a joint bid for Australian miner Macarthur Coal, leaving Peabody needing $5bn to fund the acquisition on its own.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Management used an earnings conference call to reassure analysts the company will be able to raise the finance through debt markets, rather than by issuing new equity, leading the stock to rally back towards $40.94 where it closed on Monday, before falling again.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Analysts had spent Tuesday morning debating the breadth of the current rally. Bespoke Investment Group found 90 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 were trading above their 50-day average at the close on Monday. That is the highest level since October 2010 and suggests the rally has extended beyond large-cap stocks, multinationals and high dividend payers, which led the two previous rallies since the August slump.But fund flows into exchange traded funds appeared to suggest the opposite, with $900m withdrawn from funds targeting small-cap companies.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, also played down the strength of quarterly results. Aggregate earnings reported by S&P 500 companies have exceeded consensus expectations by 5.4 per cent. But excluding financials, the margin has been 1.9 per cent, which is below the 5.3 per cent margin in the second quarter and the 6.1 per cent margin in the first quarter.
5;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2011-08-03T18:08:31Z;Bears take aim at Wall St’s two-year bull run;Bruising summer has placed the index on cusp of a breakdown;"There is little cheer on Wall Street. A bruising summer has placed the benchmark S&P 500 index on the cusp of a breakdown that could imperil an impressive bull run that began more than two years ago.The world’s most followed equity index briefly tumbled into negative territory for the year this week. Ominously, it sits below its 200-day moving average and has been testing a bullish trend line that dates back to the market’s nadir in March 2009. These moves come after the market has dropped for each of the past three months. A modest rebound on Wednesday left the S&P down 7.6 per cent at 1,260.34 since the bull run peaked at 1,363.61 at the end of April.Any relief that the US has avoided a debt default has been wiped out by a string of economic reports that cast doubt over a second half economic rebound.Bullish investors, who backed the recovery, are now searching for glimmers of positive news in the hope this will stabilise the market and confirm this week’s sell-off as a temporary dip.For many, the monthly jobs number for July, due on Friday, now looms as a critical event. Further evidence of economic weakness could push the S&P down towards the 1,200 level.“We need a catalyst to change the mindset of investors and a good piece of data would help enormously,” says Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.For the undaunted, the recent weakness is only making stocks look more attractive on a long term horizon. Based on conservative projections for 2011, the S&P p/e ratio is below 13 times, a historically attractive valuation. Dividend yields for many strong companies compare favourably with the 10-year Treasury yield of 2.58 per cent.“Earnings are still robust and valuations are not rich, we don’t think the economy is heading into the tank,” says Jim Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel. “There is just a lot of nervousness and we have a stock market that is stepping back and recalibrating expectations of lower economic growth.”That growing nervousness has pushed investors to look past solid second-quarter earnings to the impact of a deepening crisis in the eurozone and a possible “double-dip” in the US. The attractive valuations on stocks may simply be pricing in the realistic prospect of a halt to the recovery, or worse.“The problem with strong earnings coupled with a weak economy is that investors tend to be less willing to pay up for those earnings,” says Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo. “That could keep valuations low.”Companies have compounded the gloom, some lowering guidance for future earnings and others not providing it as they have become less confident about the third quarter. Out of the 360 companies that have reported second-quarter results, 76 have provided guidance for the next quarter, with 51, or 67 per cent, lowering their outlooks, says John Butters, senior equity analyst at FactSet.Notable examples of companies dropping their third-quarter earnings estimates include Tyco International, Illinois Tool Works, Netflix and Texas Instruments.And, as earnings become more difficult to forecast, investors are placing lower value on future income prospects, which translates into a lower multiple on current earnings.Over the course of the second quarter, analysts cut their third-quarter earnings forecasts for six out of the 10 S&P sectors, led by materials and financials.“The press releases have been overwhelmingly bullish, but the lack of quantitative guidance suggests to me that companies are reluctant to commit to exact expectations in an uncertain economic environment,” says Christine Short, senior manager at S&P Valuation Risk.Adam Parker, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, says: “We expect earnings per share growth in coming years to be more volatile and lower than historical norms, both of which are negative for the multiple.” He has lowered his base case scenario for the p/e multiple on the S&P 500 by the end of 2011 to just 12 times earnings, from the 13.5 times multiple seen last year.Healthcare is among the sector hardest hit, down 8 per cent in the past three months.Technology shares have shown relative resilience, falling 3.5 per cent in the past three months.“Our defensive sectors include technology, or what we call ‘tech staples’,” says Nicholas Bohnsack, strategist at Strategas. “Microsoft is a prime example, as it has a diversified, multi-
billion dollar product portfolio that does not ebb and flow as the market does.”The uncertainty in the market comes as many investors have moved to the sidelines, choosing to stockpile cash.“People are looking at whether they should catch a falling knife or wait for the market to turn,” says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Mr Sarni says: “I view this more in the camp of a buying opportunity. You have three choices at any given time: you can buy, sell or hold . . . We are buyers as what we are seeing is volatility along the way to a long drawn out recovery.”"
6;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2011-07-26T21:04:58Z;New York stocks down on debt worries;;US stocks stumbled for a second straight session on Tuesday as investors waded through a heavy volume of quarterly earnings reports amid continuing anxiety over the US federal debt limit.The S&P 500 stock index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,331.94 in New York.The benchmark was weighed down by the industrials sector, off 1.9 per cent, and materials, which declined by 1 per cent, while technology shares offset the gloom.Illinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, ended the day down 8.2 per cent at $52.34 after profits missed analysts’ forecasts. 3M, which produces goods from Post-it notes to stethoscopes, dropped 5.4 per cent to $89.93. Paccar, the maker of truck brands Peterbilt and Kenworth, fell 10.7 per cent to $45.02 after profits disappointed analysts,United Parcel Service, the global package shipping company, declined 3.3 per cent to $71.59. While second-quarter sales beat expectations thanks to price increases and a continued recovery in its supply chain business, chief executive Scott Davis noted that high US unemployment was braking demand for services and imports.Mr Davis also warned of ill effects from the political stalemate over raising the $14,300bn federal debt ceiling in Washington. The US Congress showed little progress towards a compromise before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.On Monday, Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, and John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, offered separate plans to resolve the borrowing limit issue.The White House threatened a presidential veto of Mr Boehner’s legislation Tuesday.“To move significantly one way or another, we’re going to need news on a deal out of Washington. It’s just another check point you need to get beyond,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis points to 4.284 per cent, suggesting continued demand despite the political uncertainty.Janney Montgomery Scott noted the situation seemed to have strengthened correlations among asset classes. “Given that the traditional safe haven asset class, Treasuries, is the source of capital markets uncertainty, we can expect this relationship between risk assets and Treasuries to remain off-kilter until Washington better wraps its hands around the debt ceiling and deficit problems or the government faces a credit event,” the broker-dealer said.Not every industrial stock lagged. Cummins, the diesel engine maker, rose 3.9 per cent to $110.82 after surpassing profit expectations. Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, rose 1.9 per cent to $80.82 as sales rose and executives raised their outlook for the year.Ford Motor lost 1.8 per cent to $12.94 after announcing a drop in second-quarter earnings. The Detroit-based carmaker said that pre-tax operating profit and cash flow for the year as a whole would be higher than in 2010.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,501.30.Second-quarter results have revealed a “pretty good earnings season so far”, said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems. Through Monday, almost a third of the 500 companies in the S&P index had reported quarterly numbers, and 83 per cent had beaten Wall Street estimates of earnings per share, he said.“The sector where we have seen the biggest surprise is in the technology sector,” he said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite held its ground, closing 0.1 per cent lower at 2,839.96.Broadcom, which makes chips for wireless devices, jumped 9.4 per cent to $38.20, after issuing a positive revenue outlook. Lexmark International, which supplies computer printers, gained 17.7 per cent to $33.93. Texas Instruments rose 0.3 per cent to $31.57, though executives foreshadowed a lacklustre holiday season.However, Netflix, the DVD and online video streaming service, tumbled 5.2 per cent to $266.91 after warning that a recent price rise would prompt some customers to downgrade or cancel subscriptions.The company, which was reporting second-quarter results, also indicated that revenues would “only grow slightly on a sequential basis” following the price change, which separates DVD and streaming into different subscription packages.After the New York market closed, Amazon reported second-quarter net profit of $191m, or 41 cents per share, sliding from $207m, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected the online emporium to earn 34 cents per share.

Unconventional oil and gas drilling in key North American basins boosted quarterly profits.Larger rivals Halliburton and Schlumberger have also reported better than expected earnings on the back of strength in onshore drilling.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, upgraded the energy sector to “market weight”.“Based on our models, earnings growth, margins, return on equity and cash flow for energy have improved markedly in the past several quarters, while valuations remain quite reasonable,” he said.“Our work indicates that the sector typically begins to perform well once earnings growth becomes positive. September 2010 was the first positive reading since 2008.”Cabot Oil & Gas soared 4.1 per cent to $30.16 and Anadarko Petroleum gained 2.6 per cent to $63.16.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,184.38, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,124.62 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent lower at 2,504.84.Investors eagerly anticipated Tuesday and Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve’s open market committee, when many expect the central bank to resolve to deploy a second round of quantitative easing. They also expected a swing to the Republicans in the midterm elections on Tuesday.But analysts at JPMorgan said that although the outcomes of the FOMC meeting and the US midterms should help support stocks in the near term, the longer-term sustainability of the equity rally will rely on growth.“It is encouraging that the third-quarter reporting season has delivered another positive surprise in earnings growth, for the seventh quarter in a row,” they said.“[But in 2011] companies will have to rely more on revenues to generate earnings surprises. And this is becoming already more difficult,” they added.The S&P 500 industrials index rose sharply after data showed US manufacturing rose to a five-month high and the Chinese purchasing managers’ index beat expectations. But it finished the session up just 0.1 per cent.Caterpillar gained 0.9 per cent to $79.27 and Illinois Tool Works climbed 1.2 per cent to $46.23.In healthcare, Humana raised its earnings forecast for the current financial year and beat expectations in its third quarter. The health insurer benefited from lower medical and administrative costs and strength in its plans serving Medicare recipients.But the company would not project a detailed outlook for 2011 before the US government finalises new requirements for spending on medical costs.Humana’s shares, which have risen 16.3 per cent in the past month, were up 0.7 per cent at $58.68. Rivals also gained with Cigna up 0.6 per cent to $35.38 and WellPoint gained 0.7 per cent to $54.72.McKesson, the pharmaceutical distributor, rose 2.9 per cent to $67.88 after it said it planned to buy privately held US Oncology. The deal, valued at about $2.16bn, will help McKesson expand services in the fast-growing area of cancer care.Elsewhere in earnings news, Corning rose 1.2 per cent to $18.50 even though both profit and revenue missed analysts’ estimates.Its display technology division suffered after demand for flat-screen
televisions weakened but the company was upbeat about demand in the fourth quarter.Intel rose 2.6 per cent to $20.48 after the chipmaker’s price target was raised at Macquarie, and the broker upgraded the broader US semiconductor sector.Apple rose 1.1 per cent to $304.18 after it said it had counter-sued Motorola, alleging the mobile phone maker violated patents. Shares in Motorola dropped 1.7 per cent to $8.02."
8;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2010-10-04T21:47:00Z;US suppliers widened customer bases in downturn;;Smaller US companies that make components for big manufacturers broadened their customer bases during the recession, strengthening their competitive position at a time of economic stress, industry executives say.Subcontractors are moving into new sectors, as well as seeking new customers, because of fears that big manufacturers could fail or scale back orders.“While diversification has been a longer process, it’s really accelerated over the past 18 months in response to the recession,” said Richard Rubin, president of Maxi Container, a maker of industrial packaging for customers such as Campbell Soup, BASF and Ford. At the same time, big manufacturers such as Boeing, Caterpillar and Ford have moved to streamline their supply bases, which increases the pressure on such companies to keep their suppliers healthy.David Speer, chief executive of Illinois Tool Works, a US conglomerate that owns hundreds of suppliers to industrial manufacturers, said the result is that the recession has “led to a more rational approach” to supply-chain relations. “When you see some of your suppliers go out of business because they can’t make money, it’s a wake-up call,” he said. “If I really want viable suppliers I’ve got to work with them.”A survey of more than 3,000 manufacturing executives released on Monday by ThomasNet, an online marketplace for manufacturers and suppliers, found that the leading concern of small and medium-sized US industrial businesses is that the companies they supply could go bankrupt. Suppliers such as Keats Manufacturing, a metal stamper in the Chicago suburbs whose customers include Delphi, Siemens and Emerson, have gone as far as rejecting opportunities to expand for fear of growing overly concentrated.“Some of my competitors had one customer as 50 per cent of their work. That’s too big a risk,” said Matt Eggemeyer, vice-president. “We actually shied away from certain products to avoid that.” When orders slowed in 2007, Keats began supplying defence companies and medical-device manufacturers. “Because I was diversified I didn’t get hit as hard as some of my competitors,” he said.Tim Hanley, industrial products leader at Deloitte, the consultancy, said the downturn has “encouraged companies to think increasingly hard about whether they had too many eggs in the same basket”.
9;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2010-06-28T03:12:42Z;Obama’s export drive is ‘misdirected’;;The head of one of the US’s biggest industrial groups has attacked the Obama administration’s initiative to double exports within five years, saying it does not reflect how manufacturing works in the global economy.President Barack Obama outlined his National Export Initiative in March with the aim of creating 2m jobs – about the same number that the US manufacturing sector shed during the downturn.His administration said earlier this month that exports had increased by 17 per cent in the first four months of 2010 and that the US was on track to hit the export target.However, David Speer, chief executive of Illinois Tool Works, a large diversified manufacturer widely seen as a bellwether for the sector, noted that most big industrial companies have spread their manufacturing operations around the world, making the focus on exports a poor reflection of the health of the sector.The export drive “is very misdirected”, Mr Speer said in an interview with the Financial Times. “You often hear the politicians say: ‘those are US jobs that went overseas, they should be here.’ Well, most of the jobs go overseas for rational reasons – that’s where the growing market is.”“We’re not going to be any better off by saying: ‘we’re going to ship our product to China from the US’,” Mr Speer said.“We can’t do it. It won’t work. We won’t be able to compete – for lots of reasons, the smallest of which is the wage rates. It’s logistics, it’s the duties, it’s the closeness to the customer end-market that you can’t service remotely.”The ITW chief’s comments reflect a view expressed in private by many industrial companies that the export drive is unfeasible and gives the false impression that lost manufacturing jobs in the US will be replaced.Even supporters of the export drive have criticised the US government’s approach. Jim McNerney, chief executive of Boeing – one of the US’s biggest exporters – and chairman of the President’s Export Council, said this month that the Obama administration was not moving fast enough to secure Congressional approval for bilateral trade agreements.Mr Obama’s export goals would not be met, Mr Mc­Nerney said, unless the US finalised trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.Travis Sullivan, director of policy and strategic planning at the US Commerce Department, said the initiative focused on small and medium-sized companies “that frankly haven’t really been into the export game”.He said producing in end-markets was “one of several business models” and noted that 27 per cent of the US’s 3.7m manufacturing jobs are supported by exports.About 58 per cent of ITW’s revenues come from international sales and 55 per cent of its production is outside the US.The company is highly diversified, with more than 800 business units in 57 countries making products ranging from laminate countertops and professional ovens to car-door handles and welding equipment.For a company of its size, ITW is unique in that decision-making is highly devolved down to its individual businesses.Although the company has a very aggressive acquisition strategy, it typically buys small, private manufacturing companies that can benefit from its global presence, but insists on giving each autonomy.“Our average factory has 75 people in it. If you talk to our peers, they think anything under 1,000 can’t be efficient,” Mr Speer enthuses.“Our average factory is 40,000 sq ft. They’d be looking at 500,000 sq ft. We’re the opposite. We segment, segment, segment, to the point where we know what we’re good at and not good at. Then we try to pay attention to what we’re good at.”This philosophy produced an unusual approach to the downturn. Where some manufacturers cut jobs across the board, the managers of each of ITW’s businesses took their own decisions about how to restructure.Mr Speer says he only stepped in to prevent some units from cutting too deep. He insisted that every company in the group leave at least 15-20 per cent spare capacity so as to be prepared to ramp up production when the recovery came.“To cut to the bone and not be ready to respond when demand turns is not where we wanted to be,” he says.That attitude reflects the fact that ITW has many short-cycle businesses, which can take minutes rather than months to make and ship products. For that reason, the group as a whole is sensitive to economic changes across the world, making it an excellent bellwether of the strength of the industrial economy.Mr Speer is dismissive of the possibility of a “double dip” in the US. “The question now is how steep the curve looks in 2011 and my view is that it won’t change much in the US,” he says.He is less confident on Europe, although he says industrial markets remain relatively strong.“It may be too early to see what’s going to happen in Europe,” he says.“Talking to our European colleagues, things are still looking strong but who knows what will happen to consumer sentiment as this euro crisis continues.”
10;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2010-06-13T20:18:56Z;Johnson Controls cools on Visteon;;Johnson Controls has warned that it could drop its $1.25bn bid for Visteon’s interiors and electronics business if Visteon’s management presses ahead with a plan to exit from bankruptcy as an independent company.In an interview with the Financial Times, Steve Roell, Johnson Controls chief executive, indicated that the bid could hinge on whether the auto supplier remained in Chapter 11 protection.Asked if he would still be interested in a deal if Visteon emerged from bankruptcy, Mr Roell said: “It depends. Not as much as we’re interested in them now.“There are some economics that make it attractive now that don’t make it attractive in a post-bankruptcy world. There’s a window right now [for a deal to be done].”Visteon, one of the world’s biggest auto suppliers, this month rejected the bid from Johnson Controls, a large diversified manufacturer, saying it “would negatively impact our creditors” and prolong its bankruptcy.On Monday, Visteon will seek approval to go to its creditors with a plan to exit Chapter 11 as the property of either its banks or its bondholders.The company refused to comment on Mr Roell’s remarks.Mr Roell’s comments reflect the view among many industrial groups that as the recovery takes hold, the opportunities for buying distressed companies may be diminishing, because valuations for takeovers are being pushed up as the competition intensifies for bigger mergers and acquisitions.David Speer, the chief executive of Illinois Tool Works, another large diversified US manufacturer, said in a recent analyst call: “Some of the deals that have started to emerge . . . [have] multiples that remind me more of 2007 than 2008 . . . There’s a few deals we’ve looked at that did not get into our price line because the pricing was clearly outside of anything we thought was comfortable.”A central factor driving up valuations in the industrial sector is the large cash reserves companies built up during the downturn.Cash currently accounts for some 7 per cent of the assets of non-financial companies in the US – the highest level for almost 50 years.Deals in the capital goods sector will “increase significantly” in the second half of 2010 after two years of stagnation, according to analysts at Fitch.With private-sector hiring in the US remaining modest, Mr Roell forecast that manufacturers could see a “war for talent”, with some companies finding themselves unable to increase production for lack of skilled employees.“As the economy recovers, the ability to attract and recruit talent’s going to get more difficult,” the Johnson Controls chief said. “If you wait too long, you could end up not being able to take advantage of some of the opportunities that exist.”
11;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2010-01-27T19:15:21Z;US industrials offer cautious outlook;;"Some of the largest US industrial companies on Wednesday sounded a cautious note in their outlook for this year, saying they were seeing signs of recovery but suggesting prospects for real growth were uncertain.Caterpillar, Boeing and General Dynamics, three of the US’s biggest manufacturers, all projected full-year earnings below Wall Street’s expectations. Illinois Tool Works also issued earnings guidance for the first quarter that fell short of analysts’ estimates.The forecasts suggest that the manufacturing sector, which many economists have predicted will lead a US economic recovery this year, may find the going tougher than expected.Shares in Caterpillar dropped 6.6 per cent to $52.17 by midday trading in New York on Wednesday after the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment and heavy-duty engines said it expected full-year profits this year of about $2.50 per share, below analysts’ average forecasts of about $2.71 per share.The company said it would depend on China and other emerging economies for growth this year, saying the economies of North America, Europe and Japan “remain weak and have not rebounded as quickly as developing countries”.For the fourth quarter of 2009, Caterpillar unveiled net profit ahead of analysts’ expectations, although revenue fell short of predictions. The company’s net profit was $232m, or 36 cents per share, although excluding redundancy costs net profit was 41 cents per share. However, they exceeded average analysts’ forecasts of about 28 cents per share.As expected, the results were well down from the previous year, when Caterpillar made a net profit of $661m, or $1.08 per share, in the fourth quarter. Revenues fell to $7.9bn, down from $12.9bn last year and below expectations of about $8.1bn.Boeing, the world’s second-biggest aircraft-maker, said it expected revenues for 2010 of $64bn-$66bn, down from $68.3bn last year. It forecast full-year earnings per share of $3.70-$4 – below the $4.25 analysts were expecting.However, the company also said it expected revenues to rebound in 2011, boosted by its 787 Dreamliner. The aircraft is now in flight testing, albeit more than two years behind its original schedule, with first deliveries projected for the fourth quarter this year. The longer-term outlook helped propel Boeing’s shares 5.3 per cent higher by midday at $60.78.Boeing made a net profit of $1.3bn, or $1.75 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to a net loss of $86m, or 12 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier and well ahead of analysts’ expectations of about $1.36 per share.Revenue was $17.9bn, up from $12.7bn a year earlier, broadly in line with Wall Street forecasts. Fourth-quarter results in 2008 reflected the impact of a damaging two-month-long machinists’ strike and a writedown on the 747 programme.General Dynamics, which makes tanks and submarines for the US military as well as business jets, said earnings for 2010 would be $6.40-$6.50 per share, below analysts’ average forecasts for earnings of about $6.53. The company’s shares were 2.1 per cent lower at $67.27 by midday.Boeing, which generates half of its revenues from its defence unit, and General Dynamics both face the uncertainty of the forthcoming US defence budget and Quadrennial Defense Review, which will be released on Monday.Boeing said it expected a “reduced scope on army modernisation and missile defence programmes” this year, while Jim McNerney, chairman, president and chief executive, said the company would look to “further reposition our defence, space and security business”.After almost a decade of strong growth, US defence companies are bracing themselves for a more challenging outlook. The budget is expected to indicate
modest increases in 2011 spending on research and kit while confirming long-term declines.The Quadrennial Defense Review, the Pentagon’s long-range planning document, is likely to reaffirm the Department of Defense’s recent efforts to shift spending towards current conflicts such as Afghanistan and away from expensive platforms designed for conventional wars.Illinois Tool Works, the industrial conglomerate, also disappointed Wall Street, saying it expects first-quarter profit from continuing operations of 48-60 cents per share, below analysts’ average expectations of about 63 cents per share. Its shares were 2.5 per cent lower at $44.06 by midday in New York.United Technologies, another industrial conglomerate, reaffirmed its earnings guidance of 7-13 per cent growth this year, but cautioned revenues would pick up more slowly.The company said its Carrier unit, which sells heating and air conditioning systems and is exposed to early cycle businesses, was seeing a recovery in residential housing orders, but its aerospace businesses had yet to turn.Its shares fell 1.7 per cent to $67.33 by midday."
12;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Consumer spending data weigh on Wall St;;US stocks finished the week on a muted note, managing to hold on to most of Thursday’s impressive gains, but failing to build on them.Investors took the news that personal incomes rose much higher than expected in May as a negative, as it failed to translate into a similar rise in spending.“It is very disappointing,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “The rise in spending is very, very weak. People don’t want to spend. They are worried about rising gas prices and unemployment.”Even figures from the University of Michigan showing that consumer confidence has probably risen more than expected in June failed to spark a rally.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 918.88, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 8,438.39. The Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.5 per cent, however, to 1,838.22.Somes analysts said that the buying on Thursday lacked conviction and was fuelled by money managers’ buying recently improved stocks to boost their portfolios before revealing their positions at the end of the quarter, a practice known as “window dressing”.That rally had come after a poor week for equities, which struggled to recover after a sharp sell-off on Monday. The day’s selling was caused by increasing fears over the possible pace of economic recovery after the World Bank downgraded its growth forecasts.The lack of any sustained rally meant that only the Nasdaq ended the week in positive territory, with a gain of 0.6 per cent. The S&P was down by 0.3 per cent and the Dow by 1.2 per cent. This was the second consecutive week of losses for both the S&P and Dow, the first time since the rally began in March.Palm provided support for the Nasdaq after the company reported a much smaller loss than expected.Investors were reassured by the level of demand for the company’s Pre smartphone, which has been the catalyst for its recovery this year. Its shares jumped 15.7 per cent to $16.22, the highest price in more than seven years.The other leading operators in the smartphone market also advanced.Apple, which produces the iPhone, climbed 1.8 per cent to $142.44 and Research in Motion, the Blackberry maker, rose 2 per cent to $70.66.That lift for the technology sector was counterbalanced, however, by disappointing results from Micron Technology, which makes computer memory chips. The company slid to its 10th straight quarterly loss and its shares gave up 3.8 per cent to $5.10.Energy stocks weighed on the markets as oil prices gave up some of Thursday’s impressive gains. Chevron lost 1.4 per cent to $65.95 and Exxon Mobil fell 1.2 per cent to $69.05.Boeing kept the Dow under pressure as Qantas, the Australian airline, announced it had cancelled or deferred orders for 30 of the company’s Dreamliner jets, the launch of which was delayed this week.Boeing dropped more than 9 per cent in the sessions following the announcement of the fresh delay and the stock fell a further 1.5 per cent to $41.88 on Friday.The industrial sector was a strong performer early on, led higher by General Electric, after Jeff Immelt, chief executive, said that the company’s financial arm is undervalued and could be worth up to $20bn.But the shares later dropped as the sell-off accelerated and, finished the day 0.9 per cent lower at $11.75.The sector received support from Illinois Tool Works, which makes food packaging. The shares gained 2.6 per cent to $37.45 after Wachovia said the company’s internal restructuring plan could improve profit margins.KB Home fell 9.1 per cent to $13.42 after reporting a wider loss than expected, though it echoed words from rival Lennar that it saw signs that the housing market was stabilising.
13;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2009-01-29T22:18:38Z;Wall St falls on glum data and earnings;;"Insurers were among the biggest losers on Wall Street on Thursday as a sharp retreat led by financials ended the market’s four-day winning streak.State regulators late in the session voted down a proposal to loosen capital requirements on life insurers, sending the sector down 11.1 per cent overall and contributing to a 8.4 per cent decline in financials overall.Allstate did particularly badly among non-life insurers, hurt by worse than expected earnings that led Standard & Poor’s Equity Research to downgrade its view of the stock from “hold” to “sell”. The shares sank 20.7 per cent to $23.50, also hurt by fears that the dividend was at risk.Economic data that were worse than expected prompted investors to take profits from the market’s longest run of gains since the government rescued Citigroup in November.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 3.3 per cent at 845.14 points, near the session low and back beneath its 50-day moving average, a key technical level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.7 per cent lower at 8,149.01 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 3.2 per cent weaker at 1,507.84 points.Banks had enjoyed a strong rally over recent sessions amid mounting hopes that Washington would set up a so-called bad bank to take on their toxic assets and thus avoid outright nationalisation.But the financial sector – which had climbed 28.1 per cent since hitting its lowest level since 1995 last week – was the worst performing on Thursday.“There are only so many times you can rally the market on the same piece of news,” said David Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch.“Just like the Tarp [Troubled Assets Relief Program] last fall, which induced a couple of huge relief rallies before recession realities and their implications for corporate profits sank back in, we are seeing the market give back part of the hard-fought gains.”Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo were off 7.1 per cent to $3.90, 8.3 per cent to $6.78 and 11.4 per cent to $18.78, respectively.The sell-off was broad-based and all 10 main economic sectors finished in the red. Telecoms was among the worst performing sector outside financials, down
3.8 per cent overall after downbeat earnings in the week.AT&T lost 4.6 per cent to $24.71 after JPMorgan analysts cut their price target to $24 and reiterated their “neutral” view.Homebuilders tumbled 9.9 per cent after US Commerce Department data showed new homes sales fell to the lowest level on record.Weighing heavily on the wider market, separate figures showed continuing claims for unemployment benefit rose to the highest level since records began in 1967, while durable goods orders fell more than expected.Among energy stocks to do badly, ExxonMobil lost 2.8 per cent to $77 after Goldman Sachs removed the company from its Americas “buy” list. The wider sector tracked the oil price lower to finish 3.8 per cent lower.A profit warning from Nintendo put video game stocks under additional pressure. GameStop, the retailer, fell 6.5 per cent to $26.32.3M, the diversified manufacturer that makes Scotch tape, was a bright spot among losses in the industrial sector.The shares added 2 per cent to $56.55 after the company unveiled a fall in profit that was not as much as expected, along with plans for a 30 per cent cut in capital expenditure.Elsewhere in industrials, tool stocks lost ground on a host of downbeat results.Among the most high profile, Illinois Tool Works fell 3.2 per cent to $33.80. Black & Decker tumbled 20.9 per cent to $30.65.Aerospace stocks came under pressure after Standard & Poor’s cut its outlook on Boeing from “stable” to “negative” a day after the aircraft maker disclosed a big order cancellation. The shares lost 5.9 per cent to $40.71.The technology sector was off 3.2 per cent overall. Dell dropped 8.6 per cent to $9.95 after Standard & Poor’s downgraded its view of the stock from “buy” to “hold”.Defensive stocks in the consumer staples, utilities and healthcare sectors outperformed the market as investor risk appetite abated."
14;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2009-01-29T18:43:15Z;US factories to cut spending;;US manufacturers said on Thursday that they plan to slash capital spending this year as they try to conserve cash in the face of the worsening global economy.3M, one of the US’s biggest diversified manufacturers, said it was cutting its capital spending budget for 2009 by 30 per cent and halting its share repurchase scheme, while Textron, the world’s biggest corporate jet maker, said it was reducing capital spending by 42 per cent this year.US industrial production declined at an annualised rate of about 15 per cent in the last three months of 2008, although regional surveys suggest manufacturing activity recovered a little in January.Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, announced 20,000 job cuts this week and warned that it could make a loss in the first half of this year. Boeing, the world’s second-largest aircraft manufacturer, also announced 10,000 job losses and cut its revenue forecast for this year.A string of smaller US manufacturers such as Illinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, Kennametal, an industrial toolmaker, and Timken, a bearings and speciality steelmaker, also issued poor quarterly earnings results and profit warnings. Oshkosh, the Wisconsin-based truck maker, withdrew its 2009 profit forecast completely.George Buckley, 3M chief executive, said the economic climate in the fourth quarter of last year “was different from any pattern we’ve ever seen before”. 3M’s profit in the fourth quarter was $536m or 77 cents a share, down from $851m or $1.17 per share in the same period a year earlier.Lewis Campbell, Textron’s chief executive, said 2009 was “setting up to be the most challenging year ever for most manufacturing companies”.Textron is braced for a sharp decline in demand for corporate jets, which have become a symbol of executive profligacy. Citigroup cancelled a jet order this week after widespread criticism, while Starbucks said it would sell two of its three jets.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just shy of the psychologically significant 9,000 level, up 3.5 per cent at 8,934.18 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 4.1 per cent to 1,571.74 points.“The sketchy plans were broad enough in scope to help send equity values skyrocketing,” said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers, of the market’s reaction to the stimulus proposals.The materials sector led the advance, up 7.7 per cent overall. Dow Chemical jumped 7.2 per cent to $20.37 after the group disclosed plans to cut 5,000 full-time jobs in a move expected to save $700m in annual operating costs by 2010.There was mixed news in the media sector. The Tribune Company, publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But Gannett, publisher of USA Today among other titles, gained 2.7 per cent to $9.16.Energy stocks were other big winners as US crude prices rebounded from their sharpest weekly retreat since 1991.Leading the gains, Chesapeake Energy soared 24.4 per cent to $14.08 after Aubrey McClendon, chief executive, sought to quash rumours that it could have liquidity difficulties. Joseph Allman, JPMorgan analyst, welcomed the update and upgraded his recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “overweight”.Devon Energy was helped by a note from Jefferies, which upgraded its recommendation from “hold” to “buy” and set a $100 price target. “Devon is well positioned to pursue opportunistic acquisitions in a tight credit and depressed commodity price environment,” the analysts said. The shares rose 6.6 per cent to $65.32.However, profit warnings from 3M and Illinois Tool Works limited gains among industrials.The former was one of the day’s key losers, down 4.1 per cent at $57.38 in spite of a move to shed 1,800 jobs. However, Illinois finished the session up 1.4 per cent at $32.84. Homebuilders extended some of last week’s spectacular gains, up 3.2 per cent overall.McDonald’s, off 2.9 per cent to $60.92, was among the main losers in the consumer sector, in spite of a reasonable like-for-like November sales performance. Oppenheimer cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast due to the earnings risks presented by the strengthening dollar.In financials, MetLife lost 2.4 per cent to $30.03 after the insurer forecast profit for the fourth-quarter and next year below analyst predictions.The decline came even after the company became the latest in the sector – after Prudential Financial and Hartford Financial last week – to state that it was well capitalised.NYSE Euronext was among the strong gains in exchanges, up 22.5 per cent to $26.21, after reports over the weekend that it had been in talks with Deutsche Börse about a potential tie-up.The talks ended without an agreement.The US economic stimulus package is likely to include additional spending on internet broadband infrastructure and the technology sector stood 5.2 per cent higher
overall.Yahoo gained 4.6 per cent to $12.20 on renewed hopes that the company could reach a long-awaited deal with Microsoft, which was up 5.7 per cent at $21.01.Apple gained 6.1 per cent to $99.72 on reports that Wal-Mart would sell its iPhone for as little as $99. Shares in the retailer, among several defensive stocks to come under pressure, lost 1.1 per cent to $57.56."
16;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-12-08T21:43:45Z;Manufacturers’ grim outlooks spark new fears;;Large US manufacturers could unleash a wave of bad news in coming weeks after two of the biggest diversified companies in the sector lowered their profit forecasts on Monday, underlining the depth of the problems facing the industry.3M, one of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, said it was cutting its earnings forecast for this year by about 6 per cent and issued guidance for next year well below expectations, while Illinois Tool Works, the engineering group, slashed its fourth-quarter earnings outlook by about 40 per cent.Other industrial companies could follow their lead. United Technologies and Danaher are due to give forecasts for next year on Thursday, while Honeywell, General Electric and ITT are due to issue their expectations for earnings next week.US factory orders fell by the most in eight years in October, according to US government data released last week that also recorded the third consecutive month of decline.Citing the “turbulent global economy”, 3M dropped its guidance for earnings-per-share for 2008 from $5.40-$5.48 to $5.10-$5.15 and said profits for 2009 would be $4.50-$4.95 per share, behind analysts’ forecasts of about $5.39.The company said it had already cut 1,800 jobs in the US, western Europe and Japan – saving $170m – and indicated that more redundancies were likely. “During these difficult economic times, we will continue to aggressively manage our costs,” said George Buckley, chairman, president and chief executive. “We are prepared to implement additional restructuring as economic conditions dictate.”3M said it was expecting a 10 per cent decrease in organic volume in the fourth quarter and a fall of between 3 per cent and 7 per cent in 2009. The company said currency translation would reduce sales by 6 per cent to 7 per cent next year.Illinois Tool Works said the downward revision of its earnings forecast “reflects significant further weakening in North American and international end markets, the negative impact from currency translation and higher than originally anticipated restructuring costs”.The company said it expected fourth-quarter earnings to be in the range of 44 cents to 52 cents per share, compared with the 74 cents to 82 cents it advised in October.“This new forecast assumes a total company revenue decrease of 7 per cent to 9 per cent,” ITW said.● Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, said on Monday it planned to cut about 1,400 jobs in the US, will not fill 250 vacant positions and will eliminate 415 contractor jobs. The company said the redundancies will incur pre-tax expenses of about $197m.
17;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-10-07T20:48:14Z;Wall St slides despite Fed liquidity plan;;US financial stocks on Tuesday fell to their lowest level in 11 years after another afternoon sell-off pushed the S&P 500 below 1,000 for the first time in five years, in spite of the prospect of lower interest rates.The retreat came even after the Federal Reserve announced plans to create a commercial paper funding facility and its chairman signalled that the authorities stood ready to cut rates.Financials fell 11.5 per cent as money markets remained in paralysis. Morgan Stanley sank as much as 39.9 per cent on speculation that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s planned $9bn investment may not materialise, though later rebounded to close down 24.9 per cent at $17.65 after Morgan said the deal was on track.Other financials to sustain heavy losses included Merrill Lynch, down 25.6 per cent at $18, and real estate investment trusts such as General Growth Properties, which slumped 41.9 per cent at $4.50. Bank of America lost 26.2 per cent to $23.77 after the bank became the first Dow component to disclose quarterly results for the new reporting season. After the close of the previous session, the bank said it would raise $10bn in capital and halve its dividend.General Electric and American Express – among the largest direct issuers of commercial paper, according to Bloomberg – had been among the biggest winners from the Fed’s move to intervene in the commercial paper market, widely used by large companies to raise short-term finance. Yet by the close even they stood lower, down 5.1 per cent lower at $20.30 and 6.1 per cent lower at $28.25.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply below the the psychological 10,000 barrier breached in the previous session after a four-day run of heavy losses.A sharp sell-off towards the close left the Dow down 5.1 per cent at 9,447.11 and the S&P 500 5.7 per cent lower at 996.26. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 5.8 per cent to 1,754.88.The index compiled by Bloomberg of stocks placed on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s short-ban list fell 8.3 per cent. Regulators were due to to lift the ban after tomorrow’s session.In technology, Google fell 6.8 per cent to $346.01 after Stifel Nicolaus cut its price target on the internet search group from $600 to $525.The energy, industrial and material sectors had earlier helped put a lid on the declines.

18;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-07-01T22:17:56Z;Enodis chief defends premium;;Dave McCulloch, chief executive of industrial catering equipment maker Enodis, has defended the heady premium agreed by US suitor Manitowoc for the business following an auction with rival Illinois Tool Works on Monday.Manitowoc secured Enodis with a 328p-a-share offer valuing the deep-fat fryer and pizza-oven maker at £1.02bn ($2.03bn) compared with the 294p offered which had been recommended in May before plans for the competitive auction were announced.Mr McCulloch, a longstanding employee of Enodis who became chief executive in 2003, is expected to receive £10m following completion of the deal.Mr McCulloch, along with finance director David Wrench and executive vice-president Robert Eimers, have agreed to stay on with the company as the sale is completed and through a “transitional phase” of integration.Enodis, whose shares were languishing at 30p when Mr McCulloch’s appointment as chief executive was announced in April 2003, has since returned over £1bn including dividends and share buy-back based on the winning bid, according to the company.Illinois Tool Works, which saw its own 280p-a-share bid first recommended then spurned, will walk away with £10m under break-fee agreements. The scale of its final bid on Monday has not been disclosed.Mr McCulloch said the price paid by Manitowoc, though at a ratings premium to many peer UK-listed engineering groups with US exposure, was a fair price for a company which had delivered 37 per cent revenue growth and 50 per cent profits growth over the last three years.Based on consensus earnings per share forecasts for 2009 of 15.15p, Enodis has been sold at a rating of around 22 times.“A lot of UK engineering companies because of the economic situation – and particularly with exposure to the US – have been unfairly battered,” said Mr McCulloch.“But we think this price reflects the intrinsic value of the company.”Glen Tellock, Manitowoc’s president and chief executive, said the company had pitched a full price in the auction.But he also said Manitowoc was acquiring a strong research and development operation based at Enodis’s operational headquarters in Florida which has attracted customer interest from groups such as McDonald’s and Wendy’s hamburger chains.
19;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-07-01T19:46:21Z;Experience and good judgment pay off at Enodis;;Any industrial company with solid-sounding brands such as Convotherm, Ice-O-Matic, Tecnomac and Frymaster commands respect. But we should still pay formal tribute to the Enodis board for squeezing 328p a share out of Manitowoc of the US, two years after the UK catering equipment manufacturer was first put in play.That price – settled after a final auction between Manitowoc and rival bidder Illinois Tool Works on Monday night – is a full 11.5 per cent higher than the US industrial group’s previous agreed offer. When Middleby, another American suitor, unsuccessfully tried it on with Enodis in 2006, its sighting shot was a mere 195p.There aren’t many bids around these days – global M&A was down by nearly a third in the first half – but the Enodis saga offers a few lessons for target companies’ boards.1) Know the value of your company, bid or no bid. Enodis was unswayed by approaches from a range of potential bidders over a two-year period. But insisting on independence is mere stubbornness unless you believe you can create the same value through a standalone strategy.2) Negotiation is not capitulation. Enodis was prepared to open its books to Manitowoc during their first round of discussions. Allowing a competitor to dig into the data can compromise commercial confidentiality. But (Bradford & Bingley, please note) many directors now seem to believe that allowing due diligence is the same as agreeing a bid. It isn’t.3) Experience, maturity and continuity count. These days “veteran” is applied to executives with a mere decade or so in business. When in 1986 David McCulloch, chief executive since 2003, joined a company that later became part of the group, Enodis was still S&W Berisford. The youngest member of the Enodis board is 54 and the directors have served at least four years each. That breeds familiarity – a condition governance zealots sometimes confuse with complacency – but it also ensures people keep their heads under pressure. No wonder Manitowoc has agreed to take on Mr McCulloch and his two top executives.No platform for successOn the other hand, there are serious questions about governance and management of once-fêted Tanfield, the Aim-traded maker of elevated platforms and electric vehicles, founded by Roy Stanley.Tanfield’s wider message to industrial companies is a grim one: the credit crunch has arrived. It caught up swiftly and shockingly with banks and builders in March, just as they thought they had found a way through the first squeeze. For industrial companies, the point of impact was last month. Tanfield was caught by surprise when customers of its powered access division started delaying and cancelling orders, or found themselves unable to pay for them. But the picture is also reflected in Tuesday’s official figures indicating that UK manufacturing activity weakened sharply last month. That this coincided at Tanfield with supply chain problems and higher raw material prices looks like bad luck. But the board and management’s judgment also looks flawed.Since May, Tanfield has been under pressure to pull in its horns, strengthen its board, reshuffle its advisers and improve communications. For evidence that Tanfield’s infrastructure was underpowered by comparison with its vaulting ambition, look at its reaction to last week’s shock profit warning from Oshkosh, its US-based rival. Oshkosh is better resourced in investor relations and governance. But for Tanfield to wait four-and-a-half days to explain its own problems was unforgiveable.Mr Stanley – former chief executive, now chairman and, like at least two of his board, a luminary of the north-east business community – took much credit for Tanfield’s aggressive expansion. The group itself describes him as a “visionary entrepreneur” with a “can-do” attitude. His vision having failed him, he can do one thing now: take the blame.Wouldn’t wish it on a dogIngrates! HMV’s stock closed down 13 per cent on Tuesday, despite the company having met its target of a 25 per cent rise in profit before exceptional items. Simon Fox, chief executive, might justifiably complain about mistreatment by the markets, although the relative decline of other retail stocks had left HMV standing out on a toppy double-digit prospective price/earnings ratio for 2009, a premium to the sector.In any case, if Mr Fox started to gripe, where would he stop? The structural change in the sale of recorded music was already on his list of challenges, but the chief executive never signed a contract that said two-thirds of his planned turnround strategy would have to be rolled out during years of deep economic retrenchment. A lesser man might howl like HMV’s trademark dog. Given what may be to come, Mr Fox is wise to save his breath – perhaps to murmur “I told you so” when he’s done.andrew.hill@ft.comTo comment, visit www.ft.com/lombard
20;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-06-28T04:00:12Z;Bidding to avoid winner’s curse at all costs;;Executives and advisers of the two rival bidders for Enodis, the industrial catering equipment maker, will have their work cut out this weekend in preparation for Monday’s “one shot, sudden death shoot-out” auction.The single-bid procedure between Manitowoc and Illinois Tool Works – agreed with the Takeover Panel – is designed to bring to a conclusion a bidding war that began in April and has taken the value of Enodis to £1.02bn ($2.03bn) following the recommendation of Manitowoc’s 294p-a-share offer.Both companies are obliged, should they bid, to submit an offer 5p higher than the highest offer by end of play on Friday. ITW has agreed to bid an odd-numbered price while Manitowoc must bid an even figure to avoid a tie.But is the single-bid auction system the most rational for the vendor and bidders? Under the first-price sealed bid auction, each bidder must calculate the economic worth of the target to itself, but also take a view of the likely worth to its opponents. The bidder must also calculate his opponent’s view of his own likely bidding strategy and resolve how low to bid without allowing the other to prevail.Both will be aiming to minimise so-called “winner’s curse” – the margin by which their own bid wins.Alternative auction systems exist, all of which offer different pros and cons to bidders and vendors, and involve a different set of economic and behavioural calculations.Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker, was also auctioned under the Takeover Panel’s auspices in January 2007 in a system akin to the English, or open ascending price auction.Tata Steel and CSN of Brazil took eight hours of competitive bidding in which each decided whether to go 5p-a-share higher at each stage. Tata, which originally offered 455p in October 2006, eventually won with a bid at 608p, in effect trumping CSN’s maximum price, valuing Corus at £6.2bn.Following the auction Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata group, admitted to the potential dangers of becoming too bound up in a quick-fire auction when he said Tata had paid “very close” to its top price. “On the one hand, you want to do the right thing by your shareholders, on the other hand, you do not want to lose.”Paul Klemperer, an expert on auction systems who designed the UK’s 3G auction and is an adviser to the Bank of England, says auctions need to be specifically tailored to individual circumstances to ensure the correct economic value is placed on a sale.Mr Klemperer has written extensively about the sale of 3G mobile telecoms licences across Europe at the beginning of the decade, dubbed “the most expensive auctions in history”.While the UK and German auctions succeeded in raising full prices for licences for the public coffers, fiascos occurred in other countries. In Austria, for example, six telecoms companies, led by Telekom Austria, co-operated – quite legally then – in not bidding against each other to depress the price for 12 licences.Key features in running successful auctions are ensuring competition through sufficient participation – and preventing participants from colluding to depress prices.The sealed bid auction of ITV broadcast licences in 1991 generated a home-grown fiasco. This much-criticised system – since abandoned – saw Central Television and Scottish Television offer a mere £2,000 a year to secure lucrative franchises until 2002 after confidently predicting no rivals would compete. Fellow incumbent Thames Television, which lost its licence to Carlton Television, was forced to bid high – at £35m a year – in the knowledge it faced well-financed counterbidders.Sealed, first-price auctions “create more uncertainty about who will win” as opposing bidders try to double-guess each other’s strategies, according to Mr Klemperer.But they can also potentially raise more than an ascending price auction where the price at which goods are sold is, in effect, determined by the second-highest, rather than the highest valuation the successful bidder would be prepared to offer.One-round shoot-outs also have the potential to cause embarrassment.“There’s been many a case where bidders have red faces in these auctions if the gap between the winning and losing offer is large,” Mr Klemperer says.
21;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-06-25T03:21:34Z;Rival suitors facing one-bid Enodis auction;;"Rival US suitors for Enodis, the industrial catering equipment maker, face a “one shot, sudden-death, shoot-out” after the close of trading next Monday if the company remains in play by 4.30pm on Friday.A one-bid auction between Manitowoc and Illinois Tool Works, one of only a handful of auctions arranged under the Takeover Panel’s direct auspices in recent years, should bring to an end a protracted tug-of-war for Enodis, which has switched its recommendation to shareholders back and forth since Manitowoc’s conditional approach in April.Enodis, which supplies catering equipment to clients such as McDonald’s and Starbucks, accepted an offer of 280p a share from ITW in early May before backing a 294p-a-share counter offer from Manitowoc on May 19, which valued Enodis at £1.08bn ($2.13bn).That offer, however, did not close the door on ITW making a counter bid. Manitowoc, which supplies cranes and ice-making machines, has delayed posting out documentation to shareholders for the scheme of arrangement. The delay came as talks between suitors, Enodis and the Takeover Panel, aimed at bringing the battle to a decisive end, continued.A decision to allow just one round of offers contrasts with the procedure agreed with the Takeover Panel during the bidding for Corus by Tata and CSN of Brazil. After eight hours of bidding in 2007, Tata emerged the victor by offering 608p a share, or £6.2bn, for the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker.The Takeover Panel stated on Tuesday that there should be “only one round in the auction procedure”, with each side required to offer 5p in excess of any previous highest bid.To prevent a tie, ITW has agreed to bid an odd-numbered price; while Manitowoc must pitch an even-numbered price.Agreement between all parties contrasts with the protracted battle for Expro, the oil services company, which had its court hearing to confirm a scheme of arrangement purchase by the Candover-led Umbrellastream consortium adjourned on Monday.That hearing reconvenes on Wednesday after submissions by Umbrellastream’s rival bidder Halliburton, which has complained over Expro’s decision not to entertain a possible improved offer last Friday that would have required further delay in a sale of Expro. Hedge fund Mason Capital is also seeking a ruling from the court that the sale of Expro be delayed in the hope of prompting an auction.Mark Curtis, M&A partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons, and previously a secondee to the Takeover Panel, said the Enodis arrangement appeared a sensible way forward for all involved parties.Shares in Enodis closed down 1p at 316p on Tuesday, a 22p premium to the current recommended price."
22;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-06-11T23:26:27Z;Enodis bidders await Takeover Panel verdict;;Manitowoc and Illinois Tool Works have put their battle for Enodis on hold as they wait to hear whether the UK Takeover Panel will advise the restaurant equipment maker to establish a more formal auction process.Enodis’s board, after receiving an initial takeover bid from US-based Manitowoc in April, has been forced to flip-flop its recommendation to shareholders several times, endorsing whichever bid has been highest.After ITW won the board’s support in early May with a bid of 280p per share, Manitowoc regained its favoured position on May 20 with a 294p offer, through which it would pay $2.1bn (£1.07bn) in cash and assume Enodis’s net debt of $245m.Over the past week, shares of Enodis, which sells fryers and other equipment to McDonald’s, Starbucks and other restaurants, have traded just shy of 310p on expectations that ITW might make a higher offer.ITW is evaluating a renewed proposal, according to one person close to the situation. But while ITW is still interested, the lack of clarity over how the bidding process will unfold may keep ITW in a holding pattern.With proposed schemes of arrangement for a takeover of Enodis filed by both Manitowoc and ITW, the Takeover Panel could decide within weeks whether to recommend the company set up an auction, according to the person close to the situation.An auction would let Enodis entertain bids from interested parties without having to issue confusing board recommendations that alternately favour one offer over another.Manitowoc also decided this week – with the Takeover Panel’s consent – to delay posting documents on its frontrunning offer, which could otherwise have moved the process forward. It referred instead to another pending announcement.Ahead of the panel’s decision, it may not make sense for Manitowoc to file documents on its latest bid. Any higher bids by either party could only serve to raise Enodis’s price expectations if an auction does occur.Enodis had no comment. ITW and Manitowoc did not respond to requests for comment.
23;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-06-04T16:46:44Z;Housebuilder losses knock FTSE;;There was no respite for Barratt Developments on Wednesday as its shares dropped to a near 14-year low in heavy trading.Traders pinned the sell-off on a research note from UBS, one of Barratt’s brokers. Analyst Mark Stockdale told clients that housebuilders would be looking for ways to save cash with mortgage approvals and pricing trends still deteriorating.He said: “We think dividend cuts are inevitable in the current environment and are logical given focus on cash generation, the need to prevent refinancing at large spreads and in the context of potential capital raising,” he saidMr Stockdale no longer thinks Barratt will pay a final dividend this year and has reduced his forecast for 2009 from 38.3p to 12.2p. As for Taylor Wimpey, he forecasts a payment of 5.25p this year and next.Shares in Barratt closed 8.2 per cent lower at 143¾p, while Taylor Wimpey lost 5.2 per cent to 78p. Elsewhere, Bovis Homes lost 5.6 per cent to 388p, while Redrow retreated 4.1 per cent to 214p.Overall it was a poor day for the London market. With heavyweight oil stocks under pressure as the crude price retreated, the FTSE 100 ended 87.6 points, or 1.5 per cent, lower at 5,970.1 – the first time it has closed below 6,000 since April 17. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 slipped 10 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 9.976.9.There was another day of heavy trading in Royal Bank of Scotland. More than 290m shares changed hands as investors continued to position themselves for the close of the bank’s £12bn rights issue tomorrow. Traders also noted that Morgan Stanley had upgraded from “underweight” to “overweight”.“We think RBS is more diversified than it gets credit for, and now that its capital base has been strengthened and the valuation depressed, the risk to the downside has greatly reduced,” analyst Michael Helsby said. RBS rose 1.9 per cent to 249½p.Meanwhile, Alliance & Leicester added 3.1 per cent to 412½p on hopes that a private equity group might approach the mortgage lender with an offer to buy a stake.On the downside, Barclays shed 2.3 per cent to 352p, while HBOS lost 3.2 per cent to 340½p after the UK’s biggest mortgage lender finally outlined the timetable for its £4bn rights issue.Traders expect HBOS shares to remain weak through the ex-rights trading period (which will be the middle of July) in anticipation that a significant amount of unwanted stock will have to be placed with institutions.“In our view, this risk is higher for HBOS given its significant retail shareholder base – we estimate 15-20 per cent, compared with less than 4 per cent at RBS. In the near term, therefore, we expect little support from valuation in the face of technical pressure on the shares,” Cazenove said.London Stock Exchange was marked 4.5 per cent lower at 918½p as traders picked up trading volumes figures from Germany’s Deutsche Börse. These showed daily volumes on its Xetra platform had declined sharply during May.On a more speculative tack, Royal & Sun Alliance, off just 0.4 per cent at 137.3p, was supported by rumours that it could be a takeover target for Australian insurer QBE.Takeover rumours were also swirling round International Power, up 0.1 per cent to 446¾p, with Energias de Portugal mentioned as a potential buyer.Smith & Nephew added 3.8 per cent to 581½p on talk of a 700p a share bid from a Japanese medical devices group.Among the mid caps, Punch Taverns fell 3.1 per cent to 510p after the pub company withdrew a proposal to amend the redemption terms on £900m of bonds secured against Spirit, its managed pubs business.“Abandoning this proposal for the time being puts a sale of Spirit on the back burner, and as the company will not be paying much if any tax for several years, there is no particular incentive for it to seek Reit status for its leased division,” Kate Pettem, an analyst at Landsbanki said.Enodis, the catering equipment group, improved 1.1 per cent to 309¾p on rumours that Illinois Tool Works was set to return with a 310p a share counter offer.
24;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-05-20T06:55:08Z;Enodis backs revised Manitowoc offer;;The board of Enodis switched horses on Tuesday, announcing it would now recommend Monday’s improved bid from US engineer Manitowoc.That offer values the UK catering equipment manufacturer at almost £1.1bn.Having recommended Manitowoc’s April cash bid of 258p a share plus a 2p dividend, the UK catering equipment maker’s board then opted for a 280p a share, plus 2p dividend, offer from Illinois Tool Works.But on Monday Manitiwoc raised its bid to 294p, plus the 2p dividend, assumption of £125m of debt and reinstatement of a $50m termination fee relating to anti-trust clearances in the US.A timetable for the implementation of the offer has yet to be issued.On Monday, Enodis shares rose 2.4 per cent to close at 305p, well over double the level they were trading at before the first bid in early April.Manitowoc said it had reconsidered its bid and decided there were sound strategic reasons to continue to pursue Enodis after the ITW offer was recommended. ITW said on Monday it was considering its position.
25;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-05-19T22:11:03Z;Interest in UK is far from running out of steam;;It is more than 230 years since the British-developed steam engine kicked off the global industrial revolution – and companies such as Spirax-Sarco are still world leaders with steam control systems used across many industries.But the Cheltenham-based specialist is among a dwindling band of UK-quoted engineers – many of which have fallen prey to US takeover in the past decade.Enodis looks set to be the latest to end up in US hands, though the protracted battle for the catering equipment maker took a further twist on Monday as Manitowoc, based in Wisconsin, returned to the table to trump a previously agreed offer from Illinois Tool Works with an offer valuing the company at £1.08bn.Expro International, the oil services company, is the subject of an approach from Halliburton of the US, which could lead to an offer that gazumps an agreed £1.8bn bid including £200m of debt from a Candover-led buy-out consortium.Such deals follow a developing tradition of US groups swooping on UK rivals. In 2004, UTC bought fire protection specialist Kidde for £1.4bn and Danahar beat off US peer Illinois Tool Works to buy printing equipment maker Linx for £85.7m. A year later, filtration specialist Domnick Hunter was bought by Parker Hannifin for £250m after US rival Eaton Corporation withdrew from the ring. In 2006, crash-test dummy and sensor maker First Technology was bought by Honeywell for £290m following a tussle with Danaher.Deals have typically been at substantial premiums – a pattern that has continued, with the competing offers for Enodis pitched at more than double the level of its 52-week low of 124¼p.David Larkam, longstanding analyst of the engineering sector at Arden Partners, blames scant analyst coverage of the dwindling UK market. This, he argues, perpetuates the relatively low valuations of UK engineering companies, some of whose p/e ratios struggle to get into the double figures – making them ripe for opportunistic takeovers.Ulf Henriksson, chief executive of Invensys, one of the UK’s biggest engineering groups, says US takeovers can make sense – especially from a management point of view. While some European and UK engineering companies tend to act more as “holding companies”, US rivals can be more operationally focused, seeking synergies and quick integration of acquired companies, he says.“A major difference is on getting things done and not waiting for tomorrow – making sure things are happening – directness, with not necessarily politeness or niceness.”In return, an acquired UK company, like other European targets, can offer a springboard to global expansion for a US group.“A US company has the scale – but not necessarily expertise – on how to act globally,” Mr Henriksson says. “European companies can relate better to emerging markets – Europeans have a better start here.”So expansive have some of the Britain’s remaining independently owned engineers become that it is hard to describe the likes of Invensys, Charter, Spirax-Sarco and Weir Group as truly British, observers say.“[Many British engineering] companies are international now,” Arden’s Mr Larkam says. “The percentage of business they have in the UK is pretty small.”So does it matter, then, if the numbers of quoted UK engineers are in decline?Although the CBI has no detailed data on what proportion of UK manufacturers is domestically or foreign-owned, the UK has emerged as being relatively successful at attracting foreign investment compared with other European countries, says David Wilkinson, senior policy adviser on manufacturing at the CBI.A fall in the numbers of London-listed companies does not reflect a decline in the strength of British manufacturing and engineering, Mr Wilkinson says.“Britain has achieved manufacturing value-added growth of 31 per cent since 1990,” he says. “People talk about a decline in manufacturing, whereas manufacturing has only declined in its share in national income because of service sector growth. UK manufacturing is not in distress – it’s a growth sector.”
26;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-05-19T18:54:40Z;Manitowoc raises offer for Enodis;;Manitowoc, the US engineering group, on Monday attempted to regain the initiative in the tussle over Enodis, the catering equipment maker, increasing its offer and asking the board to co-operate.The new bid of 294p a share values the equity at £1.08bn ($2.1bn), with Enodis shareholders due to receive a 2p interim dividend. Enodis also has net debt of £125m, which Manitowoc would take on. Enodis shares opened firmer, up 4½p at 302½p, moving above the value of the offer.Manitowoc initially offered 258p a share and a 2p dividend. Enodis’s board recommended the offer in April but earlier this month switched its approval to a rival offer from Illinois Tool Works, which offered 280p a share and a 2p dividend. Before the initial bid Enodis’ share price was 141½p.Manitowoc makes ice-making machines, commercial refrigerators and has a substantial crane business. It wants to add Enodis’ expertise in making ovens and deep-fat fryers for customers such as McDonald’s and the Royal Navy. It has offered to dispose of some ice assets in the US to satisfy any antitrust concerns.Glen Tellock, Manitowoc chief executive, said the group had reconsidered its options after the ITW bid and decided “there is significant strategic merit in bringing these two strong organisations together”.The company wants to implement the bid by way of a scheme of arrangement, which requires Enodis to co-operate. “Manitowoc encourages Enodis to co-operate and encourages the Enodis directors to recommend unanimously that Enodis shareholders vote in favour.”Manitowoc said it had secured funds to finance the higher offer through an amendment to its original credit agreement with a group of banks led by JPMorgan Chase. ITW said it would consider its position and issue a statement in due course.Mike Blogg, analyst at Arbuthnot Securities, said Enodis offered “strategic value for both sides”, but ITW might have the upper hand in that it did not need to make divestments to meet competition authorities’ concerns.He said there would be some pressure on the Enodis board to recommend the new Manitowoc offer, though it could wait to see the response from ITW or even the possibility of a third bidder emerging.However, Mr Blogg cautioned that “the numbers are starting to get reasonably rich now”, so there might not be much further for Enodis’ shares to go.

That trumped an earlier bid of 260p from Manitowoc, another US group.Enodis rose 3.1 per cent to 298p on Friday on turnover of 16.1m shares on rumours that Manitowoc was set to return with a knockout bid of 330p.Traders said they would not be surprised if Manitowoc came back but questioned whether it could afford the rumoured price.In the wider market, leading shares closed above 6,300 for the first time since mid-January.Lifted by strength in heavyweight oil stocks as the crude price hit another record, the FTSE 100 settled 52.5 points, or 0.8 per cent, higher at 6,304.3. The FTSE 250 advanced 115.4 points, or 1.1 per cent, to 10,454.3.Over the week, the blue-chip index gained 100 points, or 1.6 per cent, while the mid-cap index rose 17 points, or 0.1 per cent.London Stock Exchange was one of Friday’s biggest risers, rising 5.1 per cent to £11.43.

News that Warren Buffett had pulled out of the bidding for its insurance businesses also weighed on the stock.ENRC dipped 0.8 per cent to £14.44, after Mehmet Dalman, a non-executive director, declared the sale of 135,000 shares.Tate & Lyle, the sugars and sweeteners group, slipped 1.4 per cent to 499p after Morgan Stanley reiterated its “underweight” recommendation, citing concerns about the company’s hedging arrangements.“Although visibility on the timing of hedges is poor, Tate will ultimately have to try to pass the higher corn costs on to its customers, which may prove difficult given the magnitude,” the broker said. Tate reports annual results on Thursday.Moneysupermarket.com, the price comparison website, led the FTSE 250 higher. It shares rose 6.9 per cent to 127¼p.

The broker sees house prices falling 6 per cent this year and 8 per cent next. Bellway, which Goldman cut to sell, fell 2.3 per cent to 706½p, while Taylor Wimpey eased 1.4 per cent to 127¾p.
28;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-05-13T15:47:22Z;Fast food boom lifts Enodis;;Enodis, the catering equipment maker that last week turned its back on an agreed offer from US rival Manitowoc in favour of an improved £1bn offer from Illinois Tool Works, saw interim profits slip as it absorbed restructuring costs in its US and European operations.But underlying profits before exceptionals resulting from its cost-cutting programme rose 9 per cent to £32.9m (£30.3m) on revenues that rose 8 per cent to £395m (£365m) amid resilient, if slowing, growth in its core US market.The company, whose deep-fat fryers, pizza ovens and latest generation smoothie makers are supplied to customers ranging from McDonald’s and Starbucks to the Royal Navy, said it continued to benefit from the global trend of people eating and drinking “on the hoof”.Dave McCulloch, chief executive, said: “The beauty of this industry is people still have to eat and drink and the market for food and beverages [catering equipment] has been growing considerably. In the US, gross domestic product growth is at 1 per cent, but our industry is growing at 4 per cent, and we have been outperforming the industry.”Mr McCulloch declined to comment on whether or not Manitowoc might come back to the table to trump ITW’s 282p a share agreed bid, pitched ahead of Manitowoc’s previously agreed bid of 260p.Shares in Enodis, which has seen its share price double since April 8, the day before it first came under offer from Manitowoc, closed down ¾p at 285¼p, reflecting slender hopes that an improved counterbid may yet emerge. Manitowoc has declined so far to make its intentions clear.Pre-tax profits for the half year to March 29 fell 16 per cent to £22.2m (£26.3m) following exceptional charges totalling £9.6m, including £5m of restructuring costs.The company said it expected to save £8m this year, and £4m next year, as a result of job losses and restructuring across the US and Europe.Earnings per share fell more sharply to 2.6p (4.3p) as the company absorbed a write-off on deferred tax assessments resulting from the offers for the company.Enodis has already declared a special 2p dividend, in lieu of an interim dividend, following the Manitowoc offer.FT CommentThe board and shareholders of Enodis deserve credit for holding their nerve over the two years of bid speculation. Approaches in 2006 from US competitors Middleby – at 195p – and then Manitowoc – at 220p – were followed by one from UK rival Aga Foodservice at below 200p. All were spurned as undervaluing the company. Last year saw Enodis’s shares fall from 220p to below 140p as bid speculation receded. With 282p a share in the bag, and a slender upside of an improved offering, those with a stake in the maker of deep-fat fryers can finally look forward to cashing in their chips.
29;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-05-08T21:46:50Z;ITW in agreed counterbid for Enodis;;Illinois Tool Works launched a counterbid for Enodis on Thursday, disrupting what had appeared to be a done deal with Manitowoc, its US rival.The catering equipment maker recommended an offer of 282p a share from ITW, including 2p in lieu of dividend – 12p higher than the amount it advised its shareholders to accept two weeks ago. The offer values Enodis at about £1bn, more than double its market capitalisation on April 8, the day before it first came under offer from Manitowoc.Enodis is the latest engineer to be involved in transatlantic takeover talks, with Expro, the oil and gas technology specialist, likely to be bought by Halliburton, and First Technology, the testing specialist, sold to Honeywell in 2006.David Speer, chairman and chief executive of ITW, said: “It’s a full price, which we’re offering because it will help us compete in the global food equipment market.”Manitowoc said it was considering its position, with some analysts not excluding the original bidder to come back, or another company to join the fray.“It would be most unusual for a first offer to be pitched at the upper limit of what an offeror is ultimately willing to pay,” said Mike Blogg of Arbuthnot Securities. “Like many British engineering companies, this is a focused company with international market leadership, which is something people pay for.”Enodis shares closed up 44¾p to 288¼p, an 18 per cent jump and well above ITW’s offer price. ITW was up slightly in midday trading in New York. Manitowoc was up 4 per cent.Enodis has long been seen as a takeover target as it has expanded its US operations. Middleby, another US engineering group, was the first to table an offer in May 2006, which was rejected at £800m.It has also been seen as a potential target for other groups including UTC of the US and Sweden’s Electrolux. Aga, the maker of exclusive range fires, also proposed a cash-and-share offer before selling its industrial equipment division.ITW management said it did not expect to run into regulatory issues, unlike Manitowoc whose original proposal to Enodis floundered over concerns anti-trust regulators would force it to divest assets.The ease of the deal was mentioned by Peter Brooks, Enodis chairman, who said the board had given its unanimous support to ITW’s approach. “This higher offer underlines the regard that Enodis has built in the global food service industry.”
30;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2008-05-08T10:48:34Z;ITW trumps offer for Enodis;;The long-running takeover battle for Enodis, the catering equipment supplier, took a fresh twist on Thursday after Illinois Tool Works trumped an earlier agreed offer from Manitowoc, the US engineering group.The agreed cash offer of 282p a share from FNI Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITW, values Enodis’s share capital at £1.03bn and represents an 8.5 per cent premium to the earlier agreed deal.The offer, which is conditional on the two companies achieving antitrust clearance from the US and European competition authorities, is expected to be completed by the end of August.The offer price includes a proposed 2p interim dividend and represents a near 100 per cent premium to the undisturbed share price of April 8, the day before Enodis announced it had received an indicative offer from Manitowoc.It also represents a 55.9 per cent increase on the average closing price of 179.6p for the 12 months before 8 April.Enodis shares initially surged to 288p, above the offer price, as investors hoped a higher offer would emerge before falling back. In mid-morning trading the shares were 40½p or 16.6 per cent higher at 284p.“This higher offer underlines the regard which Enodis has built in the global foodservice industry,” said Peter Brooks, chairman of Enodis.Mr Brooks said the Enodis board had given its unanimous support to the ITW approach.“Having considered carefully all aspects of the offer from ITW, including transaction certainty, from an anti-trust perspective, and the higher price which this offer provides, the Enodis directors have decided unanimously to recommend the offer from ITW to shareholders.”Manitowoc said it was considering its options on Thursday following the earlier announcement by ITW and Enodis.As well as making food equipment for the commercial food industry, ITW also designs decorative surfaces for flooring and kitchens, fasteners for tool equipment, polymers and sealants and packaging for the food industry.It started out making pumps and tool products for the US military before the first world war and now employs more than 60,000 in 52 countries.“The collective businesses will have a significantly enhanced product portfolio in addition to greater scale to compete even more effectively and successfully in the global food equipment industry,” said David B Speer, chairman and chief executive officer of ITW.He added that he intended to run Enodis, which supplies McDonald’s, Starbucks and Subway with food making equipment, as a standalone business.Enodis has long been seen as a takeover target as it has expanded its US operations. Manitowoc has made several offers in the last couple of years of up to £900m, but they were rejected as too low.Middleby, another US engineering group, also tabled an offer. It has also been seen as a potential target for other groups including UTC of the US and Sweden’s Electrolux. Aga, the maker of exclusive range fires, also proposed a cash-and-share offer before selling its industrial equipment division.
31;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2007-05-07T20:51:17Z;One click away from internet fortune;;In 1992, I’m afraid, I was an addict. It got to the point where I was losing my friends and family, and it was harming my job performance. My only friends were my fellow addicts.Specifically, all day long, every day, I would play chess online: one-minute games where my opponent and I would take one minute each to make all our moves. Whoever ran out of time first (or was checkmated first) would lose. My opponents were from Norway, Israel, South America, even Russia. I would walk to work with my girlfriend at the time and I would tell her “today I won’t play chess at all”. Then I would get to work and tell myself “well, one game won’t hurt” and I’d log on to what is now www.chessclub.com and play a game or two.If I was on a roll then I couldn’t stop. And if I was losing, I’d have to keep playing until I started winning again. I’d have intermittent breaks for “meet­ings” with people who thought they were my co-workers. I’d keep playing until midnight, 1am, 2am, all night sometimes, and stumble home just to change clothes. It was ugly and I was scared.Scared because the truth finally hit me. It was never going away. It’s not as if this internet chess club was a temporary thing. This was here for ever and it was only going to get worse.Finally, a friend of mine helped wean me off the online chess server. He showed me a piece of software called Mosaic, which could download and format images and text off the internet. Also audio, but only if you wanted to wait two hours for a download. The worldwide web was just starting and there were maybe a few hundred websites at the time.During this period, I would take the occasional bathroom break from my chess games and I’d see another guy wandering the halls around midnight or so. He told me he was working on something that could read text and catalogue it and he was testing it out by retrieving pages from the few websites there were. He was hoping for government funding so he could work on his little hobby during the day.“Yeah, right,” I thought to myself as I locked my office door behind me for another session of one-minute chess. “Good luck with that.”He went back to his computer, which was named lycos.cs.cmu.edu and eventually became the computer for the search engine he created, Lycos. It helped his net worth top 9 figures by 1997.This brings me to my point: what happened to Lycos? It was a multibillion-dollar search engine. It became Terra Lycos. Then it was absorbed into Telefónica, Spain’s biggest phone company. And what happened to Excite? It was sold for pennies to what became Ask Jeeves, which was bought by InterActive Corp for $1.85bn.And what’s becoming of Yahoo? The rumour is it will be bought by Microsoft. AOL, of course, went to Time Warner. All the internet stock that flooded the market in the 1990s is being bought, privatised, consolidated and sucked out of the market, leaving only a few megacap survivors such as Google, Ebay and Amazon.As in any market, the prices of internet stocks are ruled by supply and demand. Without supply, and with demand increasing because of the flush of liquidity driven by potential acquisitions of Yahoo, Dow Jones and Reuters, the prices of internet stocks would rocket. But where are all the internet stocks?The good news is, they are in hiding. Many old-school companies are quietly transforming themselves into the next generation of internet players. JC Penney, for instance, is one of my fav­ourite internet companies. E-commerce is the fastest growing part of its business. Its store just made it into the top 10 internet retailers, with $1bn in revenues. E-commerce sales are rising 27 per cent year on year and represent 44 per cent of catalogue business.With e-commerce moving from 1 per cent of total US retail sales in 2000 to 3.3 per cent in 2006, and with JC Penney having one of the fastest growing e-commerce sites, this will become incr­easingly important.Then there is an internet company that is in a very hot sector: selling junked vehicles for their scrap metal. Copart is an intermediary in the salvage vehicle business. Quietly, it has become one of the largest and most profitable retailers on the internet.Almost all its business is conducted through online auctions. It had revenues last year of $547m and earnings before depreciation, interest, taxes and amortisation of $236m. It has $319m of cash in the bank and no debt and trades at a forward price/earnings ratio of 17.Lack of space prevents me from describing more but check out my absolute favourite internet company, Illinois Tool Works, which recently acquired Click Commerce.Do I still play chess online? Of course! But I try to keep it balanced. That said, if you ever call me on the phone and it sounds as if I’m not really paying attention it’s almost a guarantee I’m about to get checkmated.james@formulacapital.com
32;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2006-07-03T18:49:01Z;Stalkers given deadline to bid for Enodis;;The Takeover Panel on Monday gave the two US engineering companies that are stalking Enodis, the UK food equipment maker, two weeks to make a formal bid.The panel has given Middleby, a smaller rival of Enodis, and Manitowoc, a conglomerate best known for making construction cranes, until noon on 17 July to make their intentions clear.The “put up or shut up” order by the panel follows a request by Credit Suisse, Enodis’ advisers, amid mounting speculation last week that Middleby was on the verge of returning with a higher bid.The order requires both companies to give a firm indication of their intentions either way and prevents them from making another approach for six months after the deadline expires.The move comes seven weeks after Enodis first confirmed it had rejected an approach from Middleby, which valued it at £782m ($1.4bn) or 195p per share.Early last month, it emerged that Enodis had also rebuffed an approach from Manitowoc at 210p per share, which valued the company’s equity at £850m.Both approaches were informal, however, and Enodis was growing impatient with the lack of any concrete moves by either of the US suitors. Enodis shares have been trading above the 210p mark for much of the last two weeks with hedge funds becoming increasingly active in the stock.Analysts and investors have predicted that other potential suitors could yet emerge, such as Illinois Tool Works and UTC from the US, or possibly Sweden’s Electrolux.Enodis is one of the world’s leading suppliers of food equipment, offering products ranging from fryers and cookers to drink dispensers and refrigeration. In a highly fragmented market, it is estimated to have a 6 per cent market share.Investors have speculated that Enodis may be more receptive to bids in the 220p to 230p range but recent selling by some of the bigger shareholders suggests they fear a higher bid may not come. Harris Associates, which had previously stated Enodis was worth at least 250p, sold down its stake in Enodis from 11 per cent to 7 per cent in June at trades no higher than 209p.
33;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2006-05-12T16:05:28Z;FTSE 100 suffers worst one-day fall for two years;;The FTSE 100 endured its worst day for two years as resources stocks and dollar-earners endured a sharp sell-off.Unnerved by a big overnight fall on Wall Street, which continued on Friday, the FTSE 100 closed 129.9 points, or 2.15 per cent, weaker at 5,912.1, a two-month low, with heavyweight mining stocks taking the brunt of the selling.The FTSE 250 slumped 263.6 points, or 2.6 per cent, to 9,811.8, also its biggest one day percentage fall since May 2004. Over the week, the FTSE 100 and the mid cap index both lost 2.9 per cent.Angus Campbell, head of trading at Finspreads, said: “The delayed sell-off following Wednesday’s Federal Reserve decision is causing a continued hangover and the dollar’s decline has also really put pressure on equities.“It would seem the previous few weeks of consolidation have indeed led to increased volatility. Even in the auction after the close the bears sharpened their paws as the index fell a further 9 points.”The mining sector was badly hit. Anglo Americanslumped 4.8 per cent to £24.25, Antofagasta slid 4.6 per cent to £24.42, Rio Tinto gave up 4.2 per and Kazakhmys fell 4 per cent to £13.35.In the mid-caps, Randgold, a gold miner, slumped 11.6 per cent to £11.96Energy companies joined the downward trend, with BG Group down 3.6 per cent to 74½p and British Energy down 2.9 per cent to 665p.Steel producer Corus lost 4.6 per cent at 87½p on concerns that the current round of pricing negotiations could result in higher than expected iron ore prices.With sterling rising above $1.89 against the dollar for the first time in a year, companies that generate a large chunk of their earnings on the other side of the Atlantic came under heavy selling pressure.Anglo-American fund manager Amvescap lost 3.4 per cent to 571p, while Rolls-Royce fell 3.9 per cent to 443¼p, and building materials group Wolseley shed 3.7 per cent to £12.89.However, fund management group Schroders was one of just three FTSE 100 companies to close in positive territory.Its shares rose 2.2 per cent to £11.53 after Huw van Steenis, the Morgan Stanley analyst recently voted top stock picker in the financial services sector, drew investors attention to industry data that suggests Schroders saw a material inflow of retail money - perhaps as much as £750m - in the first quarter of 2006.“We think the shares worth looking at ahead of Schroders’ trading statement on Tuesday next week,” Mr van Steenis said.Traders noted that Citigroup had also turned positive on Schroders on Friday.However, one stock with significant exposure to the dollar managed to buck that trend. Enodis shot up 6.2 per cent to 175 ½p amid talk the industrial catering group will shortly being on the receiving end of a 200p-a-share bid.Speculation centred on Illinois Tool Works, although traders reckoned private equity could not be ruled out.Clothing retailer Next put in a resilient performance, easing just 0.06 per cent to £17.50 after Deutsche Bank predicted Wednesday’s trading update would reveal a stronger sales trend.In mid-March, Next said underlying sales in the seven weeks to March 18 were down 9 per cent. However, since then Deutsche analyst Rod Whitehead believes trading has improved with like-for-like sales down just 3 per cent.“Improving newsflow has proved a powerful tonic for many retail sales in the last month, and given its low valuation we think Next’s shares will rise usefully over the next few weeks,” he said , setting an increased target price of £19.50, up from £18.Elsewhere, in the retail sector, Wm Morrison fell just 0.26 per cent to 190½p also supported by talk of improved trading.Tumbling carbon credit prices hit power generators British Energy, off 2.9 per cent at 665p, and Drax Group, down 3.1 per cent to 823½p. Carbon credit prices hit their lowest level for a year yesterday after a report, mistakenly published on a German website, showed the country’s 2005 carbon emissions had come in substantially below expectations.Away from the blue chips, MFI Furniture Group, which have risen 70 per cent in the past three months, lost 4.2 per cent to 114½p after Deutsche Bank advised clients to “sell” ahead of next week’s trading statement.Whilst business may have improved since MFI’s last trading update in February, Deutsche analyst Jamie Isenwater believes the company will still struggle to improve on last year’s £58m loss.“With the full property review likely to take some time and a delay to the adoption of the new reporting structure, we still have little clarity on the medium term outlook,” he continued.Rank, the leisure conglomerate, firmed 2.4 per cent to 220½p as traders took the view that the decision of chief executive Ian Burke to take control of its gaming division might be a sign that its Hard Rock Cafe business will shortly be put up for sale.888 Holdings lost 6.8 per cent to 215p as four operational heads sold stock worth £2m.In the small caps, Plant Health Care rose 7.3 per cent to 110p after announcing a US distribution partner. City traders are very excited about the company’s Myconate product, which improves crop yields. In a recent research note, Evolution claimed that Myconate could be a “blockbuster” and predicted the company could be a takeover target.Independent Media Support Group rose17.6 per cent to 10p as Peter Gyllenhammar, the Swedish value investor, took a 14.4 per cent stake in the supplier of access services to the media.Connaught, the property services group, edged 0.1 per cent higher to 950½p despite news that chairman Mark Tincknell had sold 850,000 shares at 950p.
34;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2006-04-24T13:18:34Z;Upbeat Caterpillar lifts earnings guidance;;Caterpillar said on Monday that higher selling prices for its trademark heavy construction and earth-moving machinery could boost full-year earnings by almost a third in 2006.The enhanced outlook was accompanied by optimism that the current upswing in its cyclical markets would last longer than usual, driven by demand from the energy and mining sectors and buoyant worldwide infrastructure needs.“Strong underlying fundamentals are in place, and we believe this is a business cycle that has staying power,” said Jim Owens, chief executive, in a statement accompanying the US group’s first-quarter results.Caterpillar had struggled in recent quarters to keep up with the pace of demand as supply-chain problems and higher raw material costs hit margins. However, Mr Owens has expressed confidence in recent weeks that manufacturing issues were being resolved as it adapted relationships with key suppliers and took on new staff.The company boosted its 2006 guidance for earnings’ per share from $4.65-$5.00 to $4.85-$5.20 after reporting profits of $4.04 a share last year. The outlook for sales was left unchanged at $40bn, with most of the earnings’ lift coming from improved selling prices as higher input costs swallowed much of the expected advance in revenues this year.Caterpillar’s new guidance mirrors recent upgrades across much of the export-orientated US manufacturing sector, including higher guidance last week from 3M and Illinois Tool Works.However, some analysts caution that the current buoyancy is typical of a mid-cyclical bounce and expect the first half of 2006 to be more profitable than the second.The impact of price increases over the past 18 months and flat raw material costs helped Caterpillar to lift net profits in the three months to March 31 from $581m to $840m, while sales rose 13 per cent to a record $9.4bn. Earnings’ per share rose 13 per cent to $1.20, well above the $1.05 consensus among analysts.
35;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;3M sends bullish message on sales;;"3M on Thursday said first-quarter profits and sales would be higher than previously indicated, strengthening the buoyant investor expectations for US manufacturers ahead of the quarterly reporting season.The diversified group is viewed as an important bellwether for US industrial sentiment, though analysts said it was playing catch-up amid the positive business conditions elsewhere in the Midwest, the core of the US manufacturing base.The upgrade from 3M adds to last month’s pre-announcement of higher full-year earnings from Illinois Tool Works, a key supplier to the motor industry, and a strong January quarter performance from Joy Global, a maker of mining equipment benefiting from the boom in global commodity prices.Analysts said the first-quarter reporting season would be watched closely for more concrete signs of confidence. However, Eli Lustgarten at Longbow Research noted there had been surprisingly few upgrades, with most companies using investor meetings to reaffirm
current guidance.The cautious outlook reflects uncertainty among some companies about a US domestic slowdown and the impact of the dollar’s continued resilience on exports.“Industrial America is very robust in the first quarter,” said Mr Lustgarten, noting that 2006 would be a transition year to the mid-point of the business cycle.ITW’s upgrade highlighted the upside of foreign motor manufacturers’ continued sales gains at the expense of domestic rivals, which helped lift motor output in the Midwest by 1.1 per cent in February.However, analysts also believed the continued weakness in the farm equipment sector contributed to Thursday’s announcement of a slowdown in February orders from Parker-Hannifin, another diversified manufacturer.3M lifted its first-quarter earnings per share guidance from $1.10-$1.14 to $1.15-$1.16."
36;ITW;Illinois Tool Works Inc;2006-01-20T20:44:49Z;Lombard: Why UK minnows appeal to US giants;;The playbook – as the Americans would call it – for US bids for UK industrial companies is pretty well-thumbed by now, and Danaher, which on Friday trumped Honeywell’s bid for First Technology, has written a couple of its chapters.First principle of interest to investors: keep a close eye on undervalued European companies sitting on valuable technology.Honeywell, Danaher and others seem to be making a habit of bolting on companies active in complementary areas. Second principle: do not assume that the opening offer – or even the counter-bid – will be the last word.Danaher, a Washington DC-based manufacturer of industrial tools, instruments and components, has been here before. In 2004, it exercised second-mover advantage over a compatriot by stepping in with a successful counter-bid for Linx Printing Technologies, a UK manufacturer of high-speed printing equipment that had previously accepted an offer from Illinois Tool Works. Danaher’s bid was pitched at a 17 per cent premium to ITW’s.Its offer for First Technology, which makes gas sensors and crash-test dummies, is 20 per cent higher than Honeywell’s.First Technology, like Linx, had a summer marred by a profit warning and then a winter of bid talks. Its fragile financial state is one reason why this bid is unlikely to follow the pattern of last year’s takeover battle for Domnick Hunter, the UK filtration technology company.Shareholders there found themselves in the middle of a contest between Parker Hannifin and its American rival Eaton, which only finished after six price increases had added a further 16 per cent to the original offer and left Parker with the prize. But Domnick Hunter was in better shape than First Technology.While shareholders would be wise to sit tight for a possible Honeywell counter-offer, they should not expect this fight to last many rounds.Managers that disappoint their shareholders are inviting trouble. Managers that disappoint repeatedly are inviting execution.The saga at SkyePharma, the pharmaceuticals company, is turning into a case study in how not to handle a company in the admittedly choppy waters of drug development.Analysts think Flutiform, Skye- Pharma’s asthma treatment, has promise. But by failing last year to get a licensing deal for the drug and then launching a deeply discounted rights issue to self-fund the product through the next stage of trials, management sacrificed the confidence of a group of large shareholders. Their disgruntlement was whipped into dissent by the disappearance both of a formal offer and then the much-touted alternatives last week and, finally, by the management’s attempt to appoint two new executives, allegedly without consultation. Now, dubbing themselves the Requisitionists, the dissident shareholders have launched a plan to oust Ian Gowrie-Smith, chairman.Activism sometimes has a bad name. But this attempt is more than mere self-interested interference.The shareholders say they have lined up Bob Thian, an experienced pharmaceuticals executive, to replace Mr Gowrie-Smith. He would presumably move quickly to appoint a new chief executive. SkyePharma has the products. Now what it needs is an injection of experience and a transfusion of new blood.Business often depicts itself as sinking in a swamp of regulation, assailed by acronyms. Last year’s pan-European Thomson/Extel survey of investment professionals indicated marked concern – particularly on the part of UK quoted companies – about the difficulties of communicating the effect of the switch to International Financial Reporting Standards and the degree of change that the new regime was likely to inflict.But once IFRS are bedded down at British companies, the new standards – combined with European regulation to improve transparency and voluntary adoption of an operating and financial review – should provide opportunities for companies to explain themselves better.Investment relations directors who gathered at a conference organised by Real IR magazine this week said they had spent much of the past year simply educating shareholders about the changes imposed by IFRS.But in due course, the improved comparability of accounts should mean that investors and analysts come to meetings better-informed about the nuts and bolts of company performance.Rather than laboriously having to unpick historical numbers, companies should be able to spend more time explaining what they are doing and why. Of course, shareholders are unlikely to let any IR director get away with peddling flim-flam in place of hard data – but it is at least heartening to hear business talking in positive terms about what may lie on the other side of the regulatory swamp.

The FTSE 100 was up 0.1 per cent at 4,728.7 while the FTSE 250 index was 0.4 per cent higher at 6,661.5. Volume was 2.8bn shares.Equities traded within a tight range of just 24 points, with dealers fearing that slower Christmas activity had come early. Consequently market rumours developed more importance and momentum than at busier periods.Others spoke of the prospect of a short squeeze on the market next week up to December 17, when triple witching, a term used to describe the expiration of three different options and futures contracts.“We've got a few trades on up to the 17th. It's actually quite late year, and a lot of the other banks say the same,” said one global portfolio trader. “There is a fear of a short squeeze but, essentially people know it's window dressing.”Aviva retreated 5½p to 608½p after Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock after its recent strong run. The stock has risen 30 per cent over the past 12 months, outperforming the FTSE All-Share by 19 per cent.Goldman cut its rating from outperform to “in-line”, saying that although Aviva had been one of the best insurance sector performers this year, the stock was now close to its fair value estimate of 650p.Deutsche likewise downgraded Aviva from buy to hold for similar reasons, saying the stock has closed the valuation gap to the insurance sector as investors have reassessed its balance sheet flexibility and profit outlook. It put a sum-of-the-parts value on the stock of 633p.Bid speculation surrounded Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, the UK's second largest ports operator, on Tuesday.The company was up 3.2 per cent at 934p after the company's largest shareholder Peel Ports, part of property group Peel Holdings, bought 1.9m shares at 900p per share to take its stake in Mersey to 11.7 per cent. The disclosure intrigued observers, since Mersey is already in negotiations with CVC, the private equity house, which made an approach in early November. Peel, which owns Clydeport, the Manchester Ship Canal and Liverpool Airport, has often been linked with a bid for Mersey. Indeed, many observers speculated it was the bidder behind the November 10 statement before CVC came forward. Observers compared Peel's move to its strategy for acquiring Clydeport in December 2002, when it slowly built up a stake before offering a small premium when it tabled a bid. Traders speculated an offer was not far away, and Peel was likely to win a bidding war as it had far greater experience in both property and ports.The rest of the sector also moved higher on hopes for further consolidation. Forth Ports added 4.8 per cent to £13.95 and AB Ports was 1.4 per cent higher at 475¾p. PD Ports rose 4.8 per cent to 92¼p as it said it planned to move to the full list from Aim.Friends Provident, the insurance group, was down 2.1 per cent at 155p as investors debated Monday's late news that Merrill Lynch had placed 48.5m shares at 155p on behalf of Lombard International, the Luxembourg-based life insurer which Friends bought six weeks ago.
