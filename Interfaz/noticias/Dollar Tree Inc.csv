0;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2019-11-03T05:00:46Z;Dollar stores: buck country;Bargain hunting is cool with shops doing their bit to attract middle-class consumers;The US is a country where people regularly raise money on charitable website GoFundMe to pay their medical bills. It should come as no surprise there is a massive market for deep discount stores.Dollar outlets, or “poor people’s stores”, as Texas songwriter Kevin Russell calls them, are booming. The two largest — Dollar General and Dollar Tree (which also owns the Family Dollar chain) — operate more than 30,000 locations between them, up from the 18,000 in 2010. That is more than the total for Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, CVS and Walgreens.But even as dollar stores thrive, department stores like Macy’s and JCPenney are struggling to survive. Looking at their diverging fortunes, it is tempting to conclude the American middle class is in its death throes. From this point of view, the rise of deep discounters is a sign of growing income inequality - an alternative to the Gini coefficient calculated by economists.The reality is more complicated. Shares in Dollar General and Dollar Tree have hit regular record highs this year. But so have the equities of Walmart, TJX, Costco and Target. Their success suggests money is not made just by targeting the bottom of the economic pyramid. Rather, retailers that do well are those that know how to appeal to the shopper’s desire for value and convenience.One of the lasting effects of the Great Recession is that it has made bargain-hunting cool. The internet makes it easier than ever for shoppers to compare prices on goods. The problem with department stores is that they all sell apparel brands that can be found more cheaply elsewhere. Some middle-class shoppers buy their clothes at TJ Maxx out of choice. They top up their pantries with trips to dollar stores in the same bargain-hunting spirit.Dollar stores are also doing their bit to attract this breed of shopper. Having built its business on the back of canned and junk food, Dollar General is making a push into fresh produce and healthier offerings.Ironically, while bargain shopping may be on the rise, low-income households are the least likely to reap any real rewards. Instead of selling in bulk, the big dollar stores keep prices low by shrinking package sizes. This means shoppers often end up paying more on a per-ounce or per-item basis. Being poor is an expensive business.
1;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2019-03-06T20:51:17Z;Dollar Tree chops $2.7bn off value of Family Dollar business;The US discount retailer plans to shut 390 stores at chain it bought for $9bn;Dollar Tree, the US discount retailer targeted by an activist investor, is accelerating the pace of store closures at its underperforming Family Dollar business after taking a $2.73bn writedown on the value of the chain.The S&P 500 retail group said it planned to close as many as 390 of its 8,200 Family Dollar stores this year, more than three times the number last year, and also convert another 200 to the better performing Dollar Tree brand, which has 7,000 outlets.The multibillion-dollar impairment charge, which pushed the company to a net loss of $2.31bn in its fourth quarter, shows how Family Dollar has failed to live up to expectations since its $9bn acquisition by Dollar Tree in 2015.Despite the rapid expansion of value-focused retailing across the US, Family Dollar’s financial performance has underwhelmed. Critics on Wall Street say the group has focused too much on expansion at the expense of investments in existing Family Dollar stores, leaving them looking tired.The chain’s underperformance has made Dollar Tree a target for Starboard Value, the activist hedge fund manager. It has called on the company to consider a sale of Family Dollar, which has a foothold in low income inner-city neighbourhoods. Dollar Tree and rival Dollar General, in contrast, focus more on the suburbs and rural areas.Starboard has also called on the company to drop its strategy of selling everything in Dollar Tree for $1 and introduce products at different prices.Responding on Wednesday to the demands, Gary Philbin, chief executive, said: “We have explored introducing multiple price points in the past . . . The fact is, the model works very well.”He added that his shake up of the Family Dollar portfolio would “set the stage for stronger long-term performance”. Stores targeted for closure were not expected to generate “an adequate return on investment” from renovation due to “age, layout, location, unfavourable lease terms or other factors”, he said.The exact number of closures would depend on whether the company can extract rent concessions from landlords.As well as accelerating the pace of closures, Dollar Tree is also moderating the pace of Family Dollar openings to about 200 this year. Instead it is focusing on refurbishments and plans to fix up 1,000 of the chain’s remaining stores this year.The group’s losses per share of $9.69 in the quarter compared with earnings of $4.38 last time. Net sales in the 13 weeks to the start of February came in at $6.21bn, compared with $6.36bn in the 14-week period last time.On a same-store basis, sales increased a better than expected 2.4 per cent in the quarter.The company sank to an annual net loss of $1.59bn last year. Shares rose more than 5 per cent in New York.
2;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2019-02-10T12:00:24Z;Dollar store customers unconvinced by proposed change to pricing;Activist fund says inflation has made the discounter’s $1-an-item strategy untenable;A Manhattan-based hedge fund manager thinks he knows what is best for Dollar Tree. Starboard Value’s Jeff Smith argues the US discount variety chain should stop insisting on pricing every item — from spatulas to sunglasses — at only $1.But 760 miles away in suburban Nashville, customers are unconvinced. “They’d lose a lot of business,” reckons Vicky Lewis, 37, laden with bags in a Dollar Tree car park. “We need more affordable stores, not less.”The nurse returned to the Nashville area recently from a lengthy stint in California and was surprised at the cost of living. She visits the Madison dollar store frequently to supplement trips to Walmart and has just spent $12 on snacks for the family.Demand from customers such as Ms Lewis has fuelled a dollar store boom. The 2008 crisis turned tens of millions of Americans into newly frugal bargain hunters and the businesses have expanded rapidly ever since — in some areas, at the expense of local shops.The rise of discount retailing is a global phenomenon: so-called 100 Yen Shops are doing well in Japan, while the UK has several pound-store chains and the German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl are opening about 100 stores between them each year.In the US, the three largest domestic brands — Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar — now have more than 30,000 outlets, more than double the number of Starbucks cafés. Trump-voting rural towns are a particularly favoured location, although Dollar Tree is popular in the suburbs and the dowdier Family Dollar has a foothold in gritty inner-city areas.The Dollar Tree chain alone is opening stores at a rate of about six a week. Founded in 1986, the parent group now employs more than 56,000 people and is forecast to produce $23bn in revenues this year.Despite the seemingly unstoppable rise of value-focused retailing, Dollar Tree’s recent financial performance has underwhelmed. The company has struggled to revive the fortunes of the underperforming Family Dollar, which it bought in 2015 for about $9bn. Dollar Tree shares have lost 4 per cent over the past year while its rival Dollar General is up more than a fifth.Starboard, a $6bn fund that has pushed for change at other retailers including Macy’s and Staples, took a 1.7 per cent stake last month. Along with his call for the company to explore a sale of Family Dollar, Mr Smith has made his demand for it test differently priced items in Dollar Tree a centrepiece of the activist campaign.Dollar Tree was originally known as “Only $1.00” before it changed its name in 1993, but in contrast to the two other chains it has continued to sell everything for a buck.Its store in Madison, a northern suburb of Nashville, comprises a mix of items from pregnancy tests to batteries, bandages and bin bags. It also sells food. For Valentine’s day, the shop is packed with cards and heart-shaped knick-knacks. Much of its contents has been shipped from China.Starboard argues that inflation — one dollar in 1986 is worth about $2.30 today — has made the pricing strategy increasingly untenable. In a letter to Gary Philbin, chief executive, Mr Smith says the retailer had been forced to cut package sizes, reduce quality or stop selling some products that customers would otherwise buy.Rising world trade tensions only make matters worse by exacerbating inflationary pressures, he writes. In any case, says the Wharton-educated former M&A banker, sales tax means customers do not in practice pay $1 at the checkout. In Madison, customers pay $1.09. He argues the pricing rigidity has resulted in “meaningful underperformance”.So far, the company has been diplomatic in response, saying it welcomes “constructive input from shareholders”. But a fight is brewing. Starboard is pushing for seven directors to be added to the board. Dollar Tree, advised by JPMorgan Chase, says the hedge fund made its demand “without seeking any engagement”.“It could end up being quite nasty,” says John Strong, professor of finance and economics at William & Mary university.He says the activists have a point about the sustainability of the $1 strategy. So far, it has worked in part because the company has become more influential, giving it clout to pressure suppliers to reduce package sizes and otherwise tailor their products. “But at some point they’ll be faced with making that change,” says Prof Strong. “They’ve been trying to push that date as far off into the future as they can.”But Rupesh Parikh, analyst at Oppenheimer, says the company’s real problem is the poor state of Family Dollar stores and points to the risks of a different pricing strategy. “The concept might no longer be as differentiated versus peers,” he says.Back in Tennessee, Dollar Tree regular Noman Abdullah says it is the chain’s simplicity that attracts him: he knows everything will cost $1. “It’s the whole purpose of Dollar Tree.” Asked about Starboard’s “multi-price point” plan, he adds: “Honestly, that’s not a good idea.”Dollar Tree ran a trial more than a decade ago selling differently priced items, but abandoned it. Starboard argues the results were inconclusive and the test was poorly handled. It says Dollarama, a Canadian retailer that diversified its pricing strategy, is an example of how a changed approach can pay off.“There’s no reason to think it can’t also be successful at Dollar Tree,” adds Anthony Chukumba, analyst at Loop Capital.Whether or not the activists are successful, demand for dollar stores is showing few signs of sliding. Even in Nashville itself, which enjoys the lowest unemployment rate of any big city in the country, you need not venture far from the booming downtown area to see why dollar stores are doing a roaring trade.Less than half an hour walk from a glass tower being built to house AllianceBernstein, the asset manager moving its headquarters from New York, Relonna Reid has popped in to a Family Dollar for cigarettes.Despite her job as a phlebotomist, the mother of five says she feels “a pay cheque away from being homeless”.The shop near the Cayce Homes projects in east Nashville is a lifeline for the neighbourhood, she says. The product quality is not the best, but that is to be expected, she says, adding: “You can’t get mad if your broom breaks. You only paid a dollar for it.”
3;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2019-01-07T12:52:48Z;Activist Starboard pushes Dollar Tree to mull sale of Family Dollar;Group unveils nearly 2% stake in US discount retailer;Starboard Value has proposed a potential sale of Dollar Tree’s Family Dollar business, along with other strategic changes, as the activist hedge fund unveiled a nearly 2 per cent stake in the US discount retailer.Dollar Tree has “gone from industry leader to industry laggard” and is “deeply undervalued,” Jeffrey Smith, Starboard chief executive said in a letter to Dollar Tree head Gary Philbin. At Friday’s closing price, the 2 per cent stake was worth about $440m.In the letter, Mr Smith said “significant opportunities exist to create value for the benefit of all shareholders based on actions that are within the control of management and the board of directors.”He suggested Dollar Tree management should explore “all strategic alternatives for the underperforming Family Dollar business, including an outright sale.”Dollar Tree purchased Family Dollar in the summer 2015. Since then, Dollar Tree has generated total returns of 16 per cent, compared with 43.8 per cent for rival Dollar General and 31.6 per cent for the broad S&P 500, according to FactSet data.Mr Smith said Dollar Tree should also consider a “multi-price” strategy at its namesake brand, ditching the concept that has been in place since the group’s founding of pricing all items at $1.He added that “change is needed” on Dollar Tree’s board to “ensure true independence of thought” when approaching Starboard’s proposals.”Starboard said:We have selected candidates who have directly relevant experience and skill sets in areas that we believe would be of substantial value to the Board, including expertise in dollar store and broader retail operations, integration and restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, strategic transformation, and public company governance.Dollar Tree responded in a statement, saying:Dollar Tree is focused on ensuring our brands are the premier shopping destination for value and convenience, taking the right actions to solidify our leadership position in value retail and leveraging our resilient business model, disciplined approach, clear customer focus and unique positioning to deliver growth and strengthened performance for the benefit of all stakeholders.Dollar Tree’s Board and management team welcome constructive input from shareholders about ways to further create value for all Dollar Tree shareholders. While we appreciate Starboard’s investment and will evaluate any suggestions they may have as we would with any investor, we note that Starboard’s nominations for a majority of the board were made without seeking any engagement or making any communication to the company.Starboard said on Monday it holds a 1.7 per cent holding in Dollar Tree. That would place it on the list of top-10 holders of the stock, FactSet data show.
4;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2018-11-29T17:09:56Z;Dollar Tree latest to be hit by higher freight costs;;Dollar Tree has become the latest US company to be hit by higher freight costs, with the discount retailer cutting its full-year outlook amid mounting shipping and logistics price pressures.The company, which runs over 15,000 stores across the US under the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree brand, said it now expects net income of between $4.86 and $4.95 per diluted share for the fiscal 2018 year, down from its previous guidance of $4.85 to $5.05 and below the $5.47 that analysts are forecasting.Dollar stores and other discounters have been among the biggest winners in the US retail sector in the wake of the global financial crisis, with cash strapped and deal-hungry consumers loading up on cut-price cleaning supplies and groceries.But the sector has seen its blistering growth rate slow in recent quarters as shoppers, flush with more cash from steady wage gains and lower taxes, splash out on more expensive goods.Adding to the sales pressure has been rising transportation costs. The tight jobs market, which has resulted in a dearth of truck drivers, and higher fuel costs have been driving up trucking rates since late last year.All this comes as Dollar Tree continues to struggle to turn round sales at Family Dollar, which it acquired for nearly $9bn in cash and stock back in 2015.The confluence of these challenges were underscored by Dollar Tree’s latest quarterly results.For the third quarter that ended on November 3, net sales came in at $5.54bn, a 4 per cent rise from the prior year period. Within this same-store sales rose just 1 per cent, falling short of analysts’ estimate of 1.4 per cent and compares to the near 6 per cent growth rate the gauge was clocking just three years ago.Gross margin meanwhile suffered a 110 basis point drop to 30.2 per cent amid “higher domestic freight, shrink, markdowns, distribution, and occupancy costs.”Still, net income for the quarter jumped more than 17 per cent to $281.8m, or $1.18 per diluted share, in line with estimates thanks to sharply lower corporate taxes compared to last year.Dollar Tree is not the only company to have sounded the alarm over increased transportation expenses. In recent months, companies from toymaker Hasbro to food companies such as Kellogg and General Mills to consumer goods producer Procter & Gamble have all pointed to soaring shipping and supply chain costs as an area of concern.Shares in Dollar Tree, which had been down about 5 per cent ahead of the bell, bounced 5.8 per cent higher in morning trade however after the company reassured investors during a call with analysts the continued US-China tariff wars would have minimal impact on operations.Like many discounters, Dollar Tree imports a portion of its goods from China. President Trump’s latest threat to raise tariffs from 10 to 25 per cent on $200bn worth of Chinese goods next year had raised fears that could add even more cost pressure for the retailer.But despite Thursday’s gain, Dollar Tree shares are still down more than 17 per cent since the start of the year.
5;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Dollar Tree biggest decliner on S&P 500;;Dollar Tree led the decline on the S&P 500 on Thursday as investors gave the bargain chain’s quarterly results and revised full-year outlook a cold reception.Shares in the company, whose brands include Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, slid 13 per cent to $82.03 taking its year-to-date slide to more than 23 per cent.Consolidated same-store sales rose 1.8 per cent in the second quarter, just below analyst estimates for 1.84 per cent according to Thomson Reuters data. At Family Dollar, which the company snapped up in 2015, same-store sales were flat and continued to underwhelm investors, while they rose 3.7 per cent at the Dollar Tree banner.Net sales rose 4.6 per cent from a year ago to $5.526bn, just shy of analyst estimates for $5.53bn.Dollar stores typically outperform during the recession when consumers are more frugal, but big box retailers like Walmart and Target have been benefiting from strength in the job market, higher consumer spending and their investments into online operations.Net income rose to $273.9m or $1.15 a share, up from $233.8m or 99 cents a share in the year ago quarter. That was just in line with expectations, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.The results followed rival Dollar General, which earlier this morning reported upbeat revenue growth but said a measure of profitability ticked lower.Dollar Tree on Thursday also lowered the high end of its outlook for full-year sales to between $22.75bn to $22.97bn, down from its previous projection for $22.73bn to $23.05bn.Dollar Tree now expects to report earnings of between $4.85 and $5.05 a share, down from its previous outlook for between $4.80 to $5.10 a share. The company pointed to the Commerce Department’s anti-dumping duty on certain ribbon purchased from China and it expects to incur a 4 cents a share charge in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in its updated outlook.On the company’s earnings call, chief executive Gary Philbin said the company will act to mitigate impacts from US tariffs on Chinese goods. The US has already implemented tariffs against $50bn in Chinese goods and is considering tariffs against an additional $200bn. Mr Philbin said the company could try to negotiate price concessions, change product sizes or even look at alternative sources outside of China.The company also said it expects higher domestic freight and diesel costs to continue and this is reflected in its new guidance.
6;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Dollar Tree, Dollar General sales chilled by cold spring;;It was a rough quarter for dollar store operators. Shares in sector leaders Dollar Tree and Dollar General are down sharply on Thursday after an unusually cold spring hit sales growth at the two discount retailers and prompted the former to cut its full-year outlook.Dollar Tree skidded 12 per cent — the most in more than two months — to $84.99, while Dollar General dropped 7.4 per cent to $89.28, putting it on track for its biggest one-day decline in 21 months.The moves come after Dollar Tree said same-store sales, a gauge of performance in stores open at least a year, rose 1.4 per cent in the three months to May 5. That is lower by nearly half than the consensus estimate for a 2.6 per cent rise. While revenue rose 5 per cent to $5.55bn during the period, it also undershot Wall Street’s forecast of $5.57bn. Net profit fell by a fifth to $160.5m as higher freight costs and a sharp rise in interest and refinancing expenses related to its $5bn debt pile ate into its bottom line. The company, which runs nearly 15,000 stores across the US under the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree brand, said it now expects full-year earnings to be $4.80 to $5.10 per share. That is down from its previous forecast of between $5.25 to $5.60 a share and well below the average analyst estimate of $5.64 a share.“We expect higher freight and diesel costs to continue,” said Kevin Wampler, chief financial officer, in a call with analysts. “These costs are trending higher than our original guidance, and we reflected that in our updated outlook.”Mr Wampler also flagged up higher wage costs as another cost pressure. Across the US, employers are struggling to fill positions amid a tight labour market and steady wage growth.Having bucked the general malaise that has roiled the wider brick-and-mortar retail sector over the past couple of years by focusing on budget-conscious Americans, some are wondering if the sector’s era of strong growth could be coming to an end as consumers, flush with more disposable income, splash out on more expensive goods.Concerns over slowing growth were heightened by results from rival Dollar General. Same-store sales at the Tennessee-based group rose 2.1 per cent during the first quarter, below the 3.24 per cent growth expected by analysts.Dollar General blamed the miss on “unseasonably cold and damp weather”, which weighed on demand for spring clothing and gardening supplies. It maintained its full-year sales and earnings targets. Revenue came in 9 per cent higher at $6.1bn thanks to new store openings. Net income was 30 per cent higher at $364.8m as the company reaped the benefit of lower corporate tax rates in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s reforms.Photo credit: AFP/Getty Images
7;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2018-03-07T17:04:42Z;Soft forecast deals a blow to Dollar Tree;;Dollar Tree shares are sliding towards their worst day in almost a decade on Wednesday as a weaker-than-expected outlook for this year took the shine off of solid holiday sales.Shares of the Virginia-based bargain retailer — which operates the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar chains — were down 15.4 per cent in early trading on Wednesday to $88.27, putting them on track for their biggest one-day drop since February 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data.The drop comes after the company reported a 12.9 per cent jump in net sales to $6.46bn during the fourth quarter. Net income, boosted by an extra week in the quarter as well as the benefits of US tax reform, jumped from $321.8m a year ago to $1.04bn. Diluted earnings per share were up 221.3 per cent year-over-year to $4.37.But same-store sales growth — a key industry metric — fell short of analysts’ expectations. Its Dollar Tree line saw same-store sales growth of 3.8 per cent, while Family Dollar was up just 1 per cent. Analysts were looking for a 3.99 per cent gain at Dollar Tree and a 1.46 per cent climb for Family Dollar.Company executives said that Dollar Tree’s fourth quarter was boosted by a “terrific holiday season” with its Christmas assortment leading the pack, along with categories including candy, snacks, baby products and eyewear. At its Family Dollar stores, meanwhile, the best performers included refrigerated and frozen foods, bedding and school and office supplies.“Dollar” stores like Dollar Tree — which has about 6,600 stores — and Family Dollar — which has around 8,100 — along with rival chains like Dollar General, have managed to buck a general slump in retail by appealing to budget- and convenience-conscious consumers overlooked by the ecommerce wave led by Amazon, and who live too far from a major retailer like Walmart to make it a part of their regular shopping.That has helped them to thrive in brick-and-mortar settings, even as other retailers shrink their physical footprints in order to focus heavily on online offerings.But Dollar Tree’s 2018 forecast left investors questioning whether the trend is hitting its stride or reaching a stumbling block.For the current quarter, Dollar Tree is looking for net sales between $5.53bn and $5.63bn, a low single-digit increase in same-store sales across both lines and diluted earnings per share between $1.18 and $1.25. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.31 a share and sales to hit $5.6bn, according to Thomson Reuters.In fiscal year 2018, it estimates that sales will range from $22.7bn to $23.12bn, with a low-single digit increase in same-store sales, and profit of $5.25 to $5.60 a share. Analysts had pencilled in earnings per share of $5.90 and sales of $23.1bn, per Thomson Reuters.The company’s executives acknowledged the varied and sensitive pressures that can influence its target shoppers’ habits, ranging from higher gas prices and pricier rents on one hand to wage increases and low unemployment trends on the other.“The [ever changing] retail environment….provides both banners opportunities to take advantage of our customers wants and needs,” chief executive Gary Philbin said in a call with investors.Our management team has demonstrated over the years the ability to be nimble and deliver results when challenged by the external environment.”The doubts about dollar retailers’ future weighed on shares of Dollar General, as well, which is down almost 4 per cent to $89.79.After rising 39 per cent last year, Dollar Tree shares are down 17.6 per cent so far this year, including Wednesday’s drop.
8;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2018-03-07T15:17:34Z;US stocks down after Cohn’s resignation;;US markets were on the back foot on Wednesday with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower for the first time in four days following news that Gary Cohn, chief economic adviser to President Donald Trump, has resigned.The S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent to 2,711.87 in a broad-based decline, with all 11 sectors on the benchmark index in the red. Consumer discretionary and consumer staples were the worst off, down 1 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively.Dollar Tree was the biggest single decliner on the S&P 500 with shares down 15 per cent after the budget store posted disappointing quarterly results and issued a downbeat forecast. The update also weighed on shares of rival deep discount retailer Dollar General, one of the other largest fallers on the benchmark index, alongside Ross Stores and Oreo-maker Mondelez.Meanwhile, Treasury yields were lower, and the dollar was also down modestly for the second day in a row.The market moves came on the heels of Mr Cohn’s decision to step down as President Trump’s chief economic adviser late on Tuesday after losing a heated White House battle over tariffs that has prompted fears of a full-blown trade war.Mr Cohn’s departure, the latest in a string of high-profile exits, has also raised concerns about chaos in the White House and the role it could play in distracting from the administration’s economic agenda.Investors were also digesting mixed economic data that shower the US labour market remains healthy even as US trade deficit widened raising some concerns about a potential drag on growth.
9;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
10;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2017-11-21T13:38:46Z;Futures point to another upbeat day for US stocks;;There’s not much on deck to jolt US equities out of their small but steady gains ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.Futures tipped a 95-point gain, or 0.41 per cent, for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, to 23,490, while the S&P 500 was poised to pick up 8.25 points, or 0.32 per cent, to 2,590.25 after the opening bell. The Nasdaq 100 was looking to tack on 28.25 points, or 0.46 per cent, to 6,344.25.Wall Street is thinning out ahead of Thursday’s holiday, with little on the economic calendar set to tip markets one way or another. There is a smattering of retail results, including earnings from home-improvement chain Lowe’s, jeweler Signet, bargain chain Dollar Tree and soup-and-snack maker Campbell.Elsewhere, the dollar and oil were treading water, while the yield on the 10-year US Treasury ticked slightly lower to 2.36 per cent.
11;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2017-08-24T20:42:41Z;Dollar Tree and Burlington Stores show strength;Better than expected results from retailers underline economic pressure to find bargains;Americans’ love affair with bargains helped power Dollar Tree and Burlington Stores shares sharply higher on Thursday before they lost momentum later in the day.Dollar Tree climbed as much as 10.7 per cent before closing the day 5.6 per cent higher at $78.50 while Burlington had gained more than 9 per cent before ending 1.4 per cent up at $86.11 after both reported better than expected sales and profit growth for the second quarter and lifted their full-year earnings outlook.For the three months to end of July, Dollar Tree saw same-store sales rise 2.4 per cent as consumers — including higher-income customers and deal-hungry millennials — loaded up on cut-price cleaning supplies and groceries.Net sales across the group’s 14,581 Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores rose nearly 5 per cent to hit $10.6bn. Net income came in at $233.8m, a 37 per cent increase from the year-earlier period and topping expectations for a smaller rise to $207.8m.As a result of the outperformance, Dollar Tree said it now expected net income per diluted share for 2017 to come in at between $4.44 and $4.60, up from its previous guidance of $4.17 to $4.43.“Consumers continue to view Dollar Tree and Family Dollar as stores that provide great value and convenience,” said Bob Sasser, chief executive.Dollar stores and off-price chains like TJ Maxx and Marshalls that sell brand name goods for less have all been posting solid sales growth in the otherwise crisis-stricken retail sector.The view that the future of US retail is likely to belong to those that best cater to Americans’ bargain hunting instincts was further underscored by Burlington.The company, best known for its Burlington Coat Factory discount chain, reported a 3.5 per cent rise in same-store sales in the quarter ending in July. That gain was all the more noteworthy given that it came on top of a 5.4 per cent increase recorded in the prior-year period.Net sales were nearly 9 per cent higher at $1.36bn while net income more than doubled to $46.9m.Burlington, whose business model is centred on buying brand name goods through closeouts and reselling them at a fraction of their full retail prices, said it now predicted full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $4.11 to $4.18, up from its previous guidance of $3.86 to $3.96.At a time when department stores such as Macy’s have seen their margins hit by aggressive discounting, both Dollar Tree and Burlington have managed to grow theirs — by 50 basis points and 110bp, respectively.Underscoring how Burlington is reaping the benefits of the turmoil taking place in the wider retail sector, the company attributed the margin increase largely to “increased merchandise margin”.This means that as ever more retailers shutter shops and liquidate inventories, Burlington is paying ever less for their products.The desire for deals also extends to the more refined world of diamonds and baubles. Signet Jewelers, the company behind Kay Jewelers and Zales, soared 16.7 per cent to $60.54 after it too reported a 1.4 per cent rise in same-store sales. This is in contrast to its more upmarket counterpart Tiffany, which reported a 1 per cent drop in same-store sales.The wider market was in retreat on Thursday as investors turn their attention to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, awaiting remarks from key central bank chiefs, including Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent at 2,439, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1 per cent to 21,783 and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.1 per cent to 6,271.
12;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2017-08-24T14:00:27Z;Bargain hunters power Dollar Tree sales boom;;Americans’ love affair with bargains has helped Dollar Tree deliver another blow-out set of results during the second quarter.The company, which operates 14,581 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores across the US and Canada, saw its shares jump as much as 10.7 per cent after it reported better-than-expected sales and profit growth and lifted guidance on full-year earnings.For the three months to end of July, same-store sales rose 2.4 per cent as consumers – including higher-income customers and deal-hungry millennials – loaded up on cut-price cleaning supplies and groceries.Net sales rose nearly 5 per cent to hit $10.6bn.Dollar stores and off-price chains like TJ Maxx and Marshalls that sell brand name goods for less have all been posting solid sales growth in the otherwise crisis-stricken retail sector.And while department stores like Macy’s have seen their margins hit by aggressive discounting, Dollar Tree said its gross margins rose 50 basis points during the quarter thanks to lower merchandise and freight costs and less markdowns.The margin gain helped boost net income by more than 37 per cent to $233.8m, topping expectations for a smaller rise to $207.8m.As a result of the outperformance, Dollar Tree said it now expects net income per diluted share for 2017 to come in at between $4.44 and $4.60, up from its previous guidance of $4.17 to $4.43.“Consumers continue to view Dollar Tree and Family Dollar as stores that provide great value and convenience,” said chief executive Bob Sasser.Shares in Dollar Tree, up 6.6 per cent so far this year, were up 7.6 per cent at $80, giving the company a market value of $19.4bn.
13;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Dollar Tree puts focus on value as it attempts to beat retail slump;;Dollar Tree on Thursday played down concerns about the ongoing slump in the wider retail industry, saying its focus on value goods should shelter it from the turbulence that has hit rival retailers.Shares in the Virginia-based company rose 2.7 per cent after reporting upbeat earnings despite diverging fortunes at its banner Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores.For the three months to end of April, comparable store sales, a key industry metric, increased 2.5 per cent at Dollar Tree stores, while Family Dollar-brand locations saw a 1.2 per cent decrease. As a result, consolidated same-store sales grew just 0.5 per cent, missing estimates of 0.9 per cent, according to Consensus Metrix.The company is in the midst of rebuilding its Family Dollar locations — which are mainly in Texas and sell slightly more expensive items than the Dollar Tree — through renovations, developing its private label and investing in refrigerators. It has also been leveraging the size and scale of Dollar Tree to provide higher-value deals that customers respond to.The company acknowledged increased healthcare costs and delayed tax refunds were creating uncertainty for its customers, who are primarily low- to middle-income. But the company said it was still “well-positioned and in most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth”.Underscoring its confidence, the company raised its full-year sales guidance. It now expects net sales for fiscal 2017 to be between $21.95bn to $22.25bn compared to the previous estimates of $21.94bn to $22.33bn, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and additional store openings.Total revenue for the quarter increased 4 per cent to $5.3bn over the period in the prior year. Net income, through increased investments, fell 13.8 per cent to $200.5, or 85 cents per share. Analysts had expected 99 cents.
14;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2016-11-22T14:04:41Z;Dollar Tree rises on cheerier holiday forecast;;Dollar Tree shares rose about 8 per cent in early trading on Tuesday after the bargain retail chain announced that its same-store sales grew more than expected during the past quarter and boosted its profit outlook for the upcoming holiday shopping season.The company – which operates nearly 14,300 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar bargain stores across the US and Canada – said on Tuesday that same-store sales rose 1.7 per cent over three months to October, ahead of Wall Street’s forecast for a 1.36 per cent boost. Dollar Tree said the growth – its 35th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales – was attributable to increasing customer count and the size of the average ticket.Dollar Tree revised its estimates for diluted earnings per share the coming quarter – which will include the critical holiday shopping season between Thanksgiving and Christmas – to $1.24-$1.33 a share, up from its previously guided range of $1.21-$1.30. It also said it expects same-store sales to keep posting gains in the low single digits.Chief executive Bob Sasser said the results indicated a “solid performance” in its Dollar Tree segment, “continued meaningful progress” towards its integration of rival chain Family Dollar, which it acquired for $8.5bn in 2014, and paying down its outstanding debt, including a 9 cents-per-share expense related to debt refinancing that it took during the quarter.Relief over the company’s outlook for the upcoming holiday season appeared to be enough to help offset any misgivings that investors might have over the company’s weaker-than-expected third quarter sales and lowered guidance for the full year.Dollar Tree’s revenue for the quarter ticked up just 1.1 per cent from the prior-year period – which had included sales from 325 Family Dollar stores that have since been divested – to $5bn, just shy of the $5.06bn analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted.Earnings per share came in at 72 cents per diluted share on net income of $171.6m – roughly double the amount from the same quarter last year as revenue.And despite a rosier fourth quarter outlook, the retailer lowered the top end of its outlook for the full year, projecting earnings per share of $3.67-$3.76, compared to the previous guidance of $3.67 to $3.82, and lowered its full-year net sales forecast to $20.67bn-$20.77bn, compared to the previous forecast for $20.69bn-$20.87bn.Dollar Tree’s stock has risen 17.9 per cent compared to a year earlier, as its low-priced items have helped to buffer it from some of the headwinds facing other retailers.
15;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2016-05-26T21:32:27Z;US discounters rise on robust earnings;Shares in Dollar Tree and Dollar General gain on higher customer traffic;Dollar Tree and Dollar General shares climbed to all-time highs on Thursday after the US discount chains logged better than expected quarterly earnings, suggesting demand held up even as the American economy struggled early in the year.Dollar Tree, which closed its buyout of Family Dollar Stores last July, said its net profits rose to $232.7m in the quarter to the end of April from $69.5m in the same three-month period in the previous year. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items, clocked in at 89 cents a share, topping Wall Street estimates of 81 cents.The group also lifted its full-year earnings per share forecast to $3.58-$3.80, from $3.35-$3.65.Dollar Tree added that its like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, increased by 2.3 per cent on a constant currency basis, propelled by increases in customer transactions and average ticket prices, in spite of what chief executive Bob Sasser described as a “challenging economic environment”.Rival Dollar General also benefited from higher customer traffic and sale prices, saying on Thursday that its like-for-like sales in the quarter to April 29 rose 2.2 per cent. Meanwhile, net income climbed 16.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $295.1m. Earnings per share of $1.03 beat analyst expectations of 95 cents.The bullish performance by the dollar stores is in contrast to a tough first quarter for department stores such as Sears, Macy’s and Nordstrom, which have come under pressure from e-commerce groups like Amazon and off-price retailers.Dollar Tree’s shares rallied 12.8 per cent to $88.37, while Dollar General rose 4.6 per cent to $88.01.Elsewhere, US Foods, the private-equity backed food distributor, climbed in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.The group priced 44.4m shares at $23 each late on Wednesday, raising $1.02bn in one of the biggest initial public offerings of the year. US Food’s shares climbed 8.3 per cent to $24.91.The S&P 500 utilities sector, which has struggled in recent days as Federal Reserve commentary has prompted investors to bet that a rate increase may come this summer, climbed by 1.1 per cent on Thursday.Consolidated Edison, a power company, climbed 1.3 per cent to $72.73, while Duke Energy also advanced by 1.3 per cent to $77.96.The broader market was mostly unchanged as investors reassessed their positions after two days of solid gains for US equities. At the close, the S&P 500 was flat at 2,090.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1 per cent to 17,828.3 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 4,901.8.The S&P 500 is back in the black for 2016, but some market strategists have warned that the US economy may need to show more signs of improvement for the rally to be sustainable. Indeed, a report on Thursday showed orders for capital goods excluding certain volatile components, seen as a gauge of business investment, missed expectations in April.“In order to reach a sustainable higher level of growth, business investment will need to increase, taking some of the growth burden off of the consumer. So far there are scant signs of an increase in capex spending,” said Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI.
16;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2016-04-15T20:31:43Z;Poundland: going cheap;Shares should recover despite troublesome 99p Stores takeover;Everything a pound. Including the shares, if things do not turn round soon. Should this week’s swoon continue, it will not be long before Poundland’s shares hit that symbolic level. On Friday, they traded at 139p, having floated in 2014 at 300p.Poundland cites the protracted nature of its takeover of rival 99p Stores as the main reason for a drop in same-store sales, which fell 5 per cent in the last quarter. Its management struggled to run 600 of its own stores while jumping through the hoops thrown in their path by the competition authority, before the deal was finally waved through last September. As the lame-duck management at 99p did paperwork, trading at its 252 stores fell away.This excuse has merit, but will start to look thin if sales do not perk up soon. In the US, Dollar Tree’s acquisition of Family Dollar took even longer to complete, involving both a rival bid and a Federal Trade Commission investigation. It too was followed by weaker trading, although Dollar Tree’s share price has held up better. But this is a larger business in a structurally different market — bigger stores with lower rents.The 99p Stores estate is largely converted and integrated now. That has left the odd town with three Poundlands, but overlaps will be eliminated as leases come due. Analysts expect £70m of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in 2016/17. Poundland’s enterprise value is about four times that. Contrast this with 14 times ebitda for larger rival B & M. A bargain indeed.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
17;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2016-03-10T21:47:35Z;Dollar General buoyed by upbeat results;Main indices lower as traders take in latest ECB rate cut;Dollar General was the best performing stock on the S&P 500 on Thursday after the budget retailer reported better than expected fourth-quarter profits as sales of sweets, food and tobacco jumped.Shares in Dollar General advanced more than 10.5 per cent to $83.21 after the retailer said profits climbed to $376.2m, or $1.30 a share, compared with $355.4m, or $1.17 a share, in the year ago period. That topped estimates for earnings of $1.26 a share.Net sales climbed 7 per cent to $5.3bn, in line with forecasts. Meanwhile, same-store sales advanced 2.2 per cent, ahead of estimates for a 1.9 per cent gain.The Tennessee-based company provided a long-term outlook for 7 to 10 per cent sales growth and 10 to 15 per cent earnings growth. Fiscal 2016 sales and earnings growth are expected to arrive at the high end of their respective ranges.Dollar General, which lost a protracted battle with rival Dollar Tree to acquire Family Dollar last year, also said it was targeting a 2 to 4 per cent same-store sales growth over the long term, with comparable sales expected to be near the middle of that range this year.The shift to longer-term guidance made sense, said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, due to “what we sense is an increasing shift towards ‘profitable growth’ as opposed to being hyper-focused on market share gains and total top-line growth”.“Given investor concerns regarding Dollar General over the last few quarters, we believe this outlook is highly favourable and should help ease some of that investor anxiety,” he added.Shares in Dollar General have advanced more than 17.7 per cent since the beginning of last year, compared with a 3.4 per cent decline in the S&P 500.More skiing on the slopes and greater spending on food at Vail Resorts, the owner of the most famous ski resort in the Rocky Mountains, wasn’t enough to lift its share price.Its shares dropped 4 per cent to $127.60 on a day in which the wider market saw choppy trading. Vail Resorts generated 20 per cent more revenue from lift passes than a year ago, helped by better snowfall at the Tahoe resort in California.Overall, revenues for the second quarter climbed to $599m in the quarter to the end of January from $463m a year earlier. Profits edged up to $117m from $115.7m.However, the resort warned that, while demand from US skiers was buoyant in the quarter, appetite from Brazil, Canada and the UK weakened. The drop in the company’s stock comes after a period in which it’s strongly outperformed the US stock market.Vail Resort shares are up 40 per cent since the start of 2015.Elsewhere, shares in mobile payments company Square fell 6.1 per cent to $11.30 after the company said its net loss widened in the fourth quarter, even as sales climbed above analysts’ expectations.US stocks were flat as traders digested the latest decision by the European Central Bank to cut its benchmark interest rates to a fresh low and boost its quantitative easing programme.At the close, the S&P 500 was level at 1,989, as was the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 16,995, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent lower at 4,662.

That topped Wall Street’s estimate of $1.26 a share.Dollar General, which last year lost a protracted battle with rival Dollar Tree to acquire Family Dollar, said it’s targeting 2 to 4 per cent same-store sales growth over the long term, with this year’s number expected to be in the middle of the range.The shift to a longer-term guidance makes sense according to Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, who said “given what we sense is an increasing shift towards ‘profitable growth’ as opposed to being hyper focused on market share gains and total top-line growth”.Dollar General and other discount retailers have done well since the financial crisis. Shares in Dollar General have advanced more than 15 per cent since the start of last year.

That compares with a 21.4 per cent drop the previous month.The news pushed shares of Wynn Resorts 2.3 per cent higher to $84.35. Las Vegas Sands climbed 5 per cent to $50.67, while Melco Crown Entertainment rose 6.1 per cent to $16.75. MGM Resorts gained 5.1 per cent to $19.90.A slowdown in the Chinese economy coupled with Beijing’s crackdown on corruption has hurt revenue in Macau but the lunar new year holiday helped lift spending.After revenues fell for 21 consecutive months, the latest figures show a sharp slowing of the decline, boosting sentiment on casino stocks.In the retail sector Dollar Tree shares fell sharply in pre-market trading on Tuesday after a disappointing full-year earnings outlook and lower fourth-quarter sales than expected.

They also noted that the sector is better insulated from the threat posed by online shopping.Vincent Sinisi, an analyst at Morgan Stanley said:Given greater likelihood of low or negative growth macro scenarios (positive for the Dollar Stores), with a decreased likelihood of high macro growth, we now see more favorable risk/reward skews for the stocks.Comparable sales at dollar stores climbed in 2008 as economic conditions were worsening and peaked at 10 per cent in 2009. As the economy began to recover in the years after, same-store sales in the industry began to moderate.Shares in Dollar General, climbed 4.6 per cent to $73.70 on Tuesday after the analysts upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “equalweight” and lifted their price target on the stock to $95 from $80.Meanwhile, shares in Dollar Tree, which last year won a long-drawn battle with rival Dollar General to acquire Family Dollar, rose 4 per cent to $78.38 after the retailer was upgraded to “equalweight” from “underweight” and its price target was raised 38 per cent to $90.

Gross margin was 46.8 per cent for the quarter and was weaker than expected.After fluctuating between gains and losses early on Thursday, US stocks regained their footing later in the session.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,952.29 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.5 per cent to 16,330.40.

26;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2015-06-25T16:28:15Z;Discount retail: no passing fad;The enduring appeal of US ‘variety’ stores should settle nerves around the UK’s pound stores;"Yours for a quid: a set of five screwdrivers, a ball of purple wool, a pair of sunglasses, or a traditional pint glass with a handle. These are some of the most popular items this week at discount chain Poundland.The past few years have been good for pound stores. As supermarkets over-invested in big out-of-town sites, Poundland, Wilkinson and Poundstretcher moved into the high street slots vacated by general retailers such as Woolworths. Hard-pressed consumers poured in. Poundland and B&M floated last year and are opening new stores while supermarkets retrench. Their shares trade on above-average earnings multiples.But Poundland recently reported slowing sales growth. It blamed timing issues and unusually strong comparatives — but its shares were marked down and are not far above their IPO price. Some wonder whether the novelty of cheap has worn off, especially for consumers whose wages are finally rising again.The experience of the US, where the “variety store” sector has a long history, suggests it is premature to write off the sector as a passing fad. The big three — Dollar Tree, Dollar General and Family Dollar — together own 24,500 stores, more than McDonald's and Starbucks combined and roughly one for every 12,900 Americans. The penetration of the main UK operators is half that.US chains have also been public companies for a long time. Their stock prices display little correlation with economic output or wages. They prosper during recessions, but have also grown during boom times, and they tend to have higher returns on capital than their UK peers.Variety stores have moved into grocery, tobacco and alcohol retailing. There has been consolidation, too; Dollar Tree is acquiring Family Dollar. The same is now happening in the UK, where Poundland is acquiring 99p Stores. In the world of £1 sunglasses, no one wins by standing still.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
27;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2015-05-17T21:23:42Z;Investors look for clues in bank minutes;Spotlight on data from US, Asia and Europe in week ahead;After a deluge of economic data sent the euro soaring over recent days, investors will be keeping their gaze on central bank minutes and commentary due out of Asia, Europe and the US in the week ahead.Here’s a preview of what to expect.Fed MinutesOn Wednesday, investors will be looking over the latest minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s April meeting, which are expected to reflect concern about near-term data.“The April meeting minutes will probably indicate that policy makers will want to see firm evidence that the economy is recovering from the first-quarter soft patch,” said Joseph LaVorgna, US economist at Deutsche Bank.Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen, who will speak on the US economic outlook in Providence, Rhode Island, on Friday, “may provide further clues as to how the Fed views the latest data released after the April meeting”, added Mr LaVorgna.Investors will also be watching for signs of inflation as the labour department offers the latest read on consumer prices. Economists on Wall Street expect inflation to rise 0.1 per cent in April from the previous month, with core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, projected to rise 0.2 per cent.UK parliamentThe UK parliament will convene on Monday for the first time since prime minister David Cameron’s Conservative party won a sweeping majority in the general election. The House of Commons is expected to elect a speaker and members of parliament will take an oath ahead of the formal start of the parliamentary year on May 27.Bank of Japan decisionThe Bank of Japan, which recently abandoned an informal timeframe to lift inflation to its 2 per cent target, will reveal its monetary policy decision on Friday followed by an expected press conference with governor Haruhiko Kuroda. The Japanese central bank is not expected to increase the size of its current stimulus measures.First-quarter gross domestic product figures are also set to be published in Japan, with economists forecasting that the economy expanded 0.4 per cent from the previous quarter.Central banks’ minutesA week after the Bank of England trimmed its growth outlook on the UK economy, the central bank will publish the minutes of its meeting in which it left benchmark interest rates unchanged at 0.5 per cent.The European Central Bank is also due to release minutes from its April meeting. Mario Draghi, the central bank’s president, has promised that the ECB will fully implement its €60bn-a-month asset purchasing programme, despite signs that inflation trends are improving.EarningsAs US earnings season winds down, 24 S&P 500 companies are slated to report earnings over the coming week. The list includes Home Depot, Walmart, TJX Cos, Etsy, Target, L Brands, Salesforce.com, Dollar Tree and Best Buy.The Week in four chartsTraders betting that the US dollar was on a one-way path to parity with the euro have been left licking their wounds.The euro continued a rally it began in the middle of April, touching a high of $1.147 to the greenback on Friday as investors and traders shifted out of the dollar. The common currency has now advanced more than 8 per cent since touching a low earlier this year.Much of the sell-off in the dollar was put down to a string of disappointing economic figures out of the world’s largest economy, fuelling expectations that the Federal Reserve will wait to lift its benchmark interest rates until September. A report showed retail sales flatlined in April, missing analyst expectations, while consumer confidence deteriorated at the start of May.Economic data out of China also proved lacklustre, with both industrial output and retail sales falling short of economist expectations, underlying the difficulty policy makers have had at spurring activity. The figures added to disappointing trade and inflation numbers out earlier this month that point to a weak start to the second quarter.Shares in door-to-door cosmetics company Avon Products surged and then fell back after an $8.2bn buyout offer made through an SEC filing proved to be a hoax.

28;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Dollar store M&A: breaking the buck;Family Dollar deal shows cash is not always king;"Cash is king; top dollar wins. These are the hard rules of commerce. The US discount retailer Dollar General may soon learn that they have painful exceptions.Last summer its rival Family Dollar announced a sale to another discounter, Dollar Tree (creative names are not necessary in the discount retail sector). Dollar General was shocked, and argued that it did not get a fair shot at its own deal with Family Dollar. However, better late than never, Dollar General showed up with an $80 per share cash offer in September. At least financially it exceeded Dollar Tree’s initial $74.50 deal in cash and shares. But instead of what might have been a clear victory for Dollar General, a deciding shareholder vote on the Dollar Tree deal awaits on January 22. The highest price will not necessarily be the winner.Family Dollar and Dollar Tree have kept their deal intact because Family Dollar does not believe a tie-up with Dollar General would survive antitrust scrutiny — regulators would worry about pricing power of retailers serving those of limited means. Dollar General has offered some comfort by saying it is willing to divest 1,500 stores if asked, and pay a $500m break-up fee.Yet Dollar General has still not offered the most compelling form of risk mitigation: a so-called “hell or high water” provision in the merger contract. That would bind it to close a deal whatever the size of divestitures regulators demand. Without such a feature, Dollar General effectively has a $500m option to decide later if it wishes to complete the transaction.Family Dollar shares now trade above $78. Dollar Tree’s cash and stock offer is worth just $77. So the market is betting that one or both suitors will sweeten its bid to claim decisive victory. A more interesting question than simple price, however, is whether the sweetener will come in the form of more shares, more cash, or better deal terms.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
29;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-09-05T17:10:59Z;US utilities shine as investors go defensive;US jobs data temper hopes over economy;Utility stocks shone on a lacklustre trading day on Friday, as investors turned defensive following weaker than expected US jobs growth.The labour market report, which showed 142,000 jobs created in August, fell far short of Wall Street expectations and tempered some recent enthusiasm that had lifted stocks tied to an accelerating economy.Electric and gas utilities were buoyed by the figures, extending the sector’s rally. Several economists argued the data would moderate any hawkish shift at the US central bank.Since January, the S&P 500 utilities index has lagged behind only the healthcare sector, rising 14 per cent.The payroll figures moderately lowered expectations that the US central bank would increase rates by March next year, as eurodollar futures for the date rose.“While the data is a significant disappointment, most participants will want to place the numbers in the context of a string of strong numbers,” Alan Ruskin, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said. “Nonetheless, this is the kind of data that staves off risks of a more hawkish Fed at the September Federal Open Market Committee.”Barclays strategists note the utility sector is the most negatively correlated sector to higher interest rates. Investors tend to use utilities as a proxy for the bond market as most companies in the sector have stable dividend yields, Barclays says.NRG Energy climbed 2 per cent to $30.99, Xcel Energy rose 2 per cent to $32.41, PG&E advanced 2 per cent to $47.90 and American Electric Power increased 1 per cent to $53.68. In afternoon trading, the 30 utility stocks on the S&P 500 were all higher.Strategists with RBC Capital Markets added the strong August rebound, which sent stocks to record heights, was showing evidence of a peak. The benchmark S&P 500, for instance, has struggled for direction over the past four days and has ended lower on most.“Rapid sector rotation is likely to remain the dominant technical theme within the equity market, consistent with the pattern of the last few years,” RBC’s Robert Sluymer said.Michael Kors shares were under pressure after it said Sportswear Holdings would sell its remaining stake in the company.Sportswear was the largest shareholder with a 52 per cent stake when Michael Kors first went public.Michael Kors shares fell 4 per cent to $76.67, although analysts with Wells Fargo said the sale could benefit the company if it chose to purchase its Chinese licensing rights, which are jointly held by Sportwear, Michael Kors himself and chief executive John Idol.“There are fewer conflicts of interest, and it seems less likely the price paid will be biased [to be too high],” Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Gap followed Michael Kors lower, declining 5 per cent to $44.29, after the retailer said same-store sales at its Old Navy, Banana Republic and namesake chain missed Wall Street forecasts in August.Overall, same-store sales fell 2 per cent, compared with expectations for a 1.7 per cent gain. The company blamed its Gap brand for the weak results, where comparable sales fell 6 per cent – more than offsetting an improvement at Old Navy.Analysts with FBR Capital Markets warned increased clearance items could weigh on margins, despite new autumn apparel arriving in stores this September.Rival mall-based retailers also declined on Friday. Urban Outfitters fell 2 per cent to $39.27, American Eagle slipped 2 per cent to $14.16 and Abercrombie & Fitch declined 1 per cent to $40.70.US discount retailer Family Dollar slid after it said it had rejected a sweetened $9.1bn bid from rival Dollar General, citing competition concerns.Shares in Family Dollar fell 1 per cent to $79.01, Dollar General declined 3 per cent to $62.67 and Dollar Tree rose less than 1 per cent to $55.26.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,000.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 17,088.09.

30;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-09-02T20:47:33Z;Biotech stocks buoyed by bullish broker UBS;US equity markets waver following Monday holiday;US biotech stocks were buoyed on Tuesday after brokerage UBS lifted price targets for a swathe of companies in the sector on its view that new medications and potential merger and acquisition activity will boost earnings.The investment bank said it remained bullish on the sector, despite a 22 per cent advance by the Nasdaq biotech index this year, ahead of the release of new trial data this autumn.If successful, analysts with the bank say it could “trigger price-to-earnings multiple expansion” as expectations are currently low.“We continue to see new product cycles and mid to long-term growth as a strong basis for valuation despite relative outperformance of large-cap biotech over the past few years,” Matthew Roden, an analyst with UBS, said.Mr Roden added large biotech groups, flush with cash from recent drug hits, would aid shares of smaller companies in the sector.“We are more bullish on mergers and acquisitions given the inflection of cash flows in large-cap, coupled with the need for large-cap to address toughening growth comps by 2016-17, and because mid-caps have done a good job in value creation,” he said.The sector’s advance this year has been in fits and starts, cooling after US politicians, as well as officials at the World Health Organisation, voiced concerns over the price tag of a successful Hepatitis-C treatment.Strong sales results from the Gilead medication alleviated some of those concerns. Several analysts on Wall Street predict first year sales of the treatment will near $10bn.UBS increased its price target on Gilead to $125 from $115, Achillion to $15 from $11, Regeneron to $360 from $320 and Amgen to $155 from $129.Regeneron shares climbed 3 per cent to $359.50, Achillion rose 6 per cent to $12.27 and Gilead advanced 2 per cent to $109.36.Tuesday offered another lesson for investors in biotech: disappointing trial data can cut short a stock’s rally, as was the case with Exelixis.The company, which is engaged in prostate cancer research, said it would lay off 70 per cent of its staff after an experimental drug failed a late-stage study, sending shares 55 per cent lower to $1.85.Family Dollar, which has agreed to sell itself to Dollar Tree for $8.5bn, said it would review a new $80-a-share offer presented by Dollar General, lifting all three companies.In a short statement it said that its board “has not changed its recommendation in support of the merger with Dollar Tree”.Family Dollar last month rebuffed Dollar General’s first, $78.50-a-share bid, arguing that the chief obstacle was its concern that US competition regulators would quash a deal to combine the country’s two largest discount chains.Dollar General said it would divest more stores in an attempt to gain regulatory compliance.Family Dollar shares rose nearly 1 per cent to $80.22, Dollar General increased 1 per cent to $64.36 and Dollar Tree advanced 2 per cent to $54.46.Norwegian Cruise Line agreed to pay $3bn in cash and shares for smaller rival Prestige Cruises, which operates the Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Sea Cruises brands.Kevin Sheehan, the chief executive of Norwegian, said that the acquisition would provide for a “solid accretion to earnings per share and drive long-term shareholder value”.Analysts with Stifel Nicolaus said the deal “makes sense” considering Prestige’s position in the luxury cruise market.“Luxury has been the one area of cruise which has been relatively stable over the past couple of years, whereas the contemporary brands have been more impacted by economic events while also being impacted by negative press headlines about the cruise industry,” Steven Wieczynski, an analyst with Stifel, said.Shares of Norwegian soared 11 per cent to $36.99.Overall, US equity markets wavered following a Monday holiday. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,002.28 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 17,067.56. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 4,598.19.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
31;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-08-21T17:35:42Z;Family Dollar discount store rejects Dollar General takeover bid;;The battle to consolidate the US discount retail market turned bitter on Thursday, after Family Dollar rejected a takeover offer from Dollar General and accused its larger rival of lying about previous talks between the two companies.Family Dollar, which has agreed to be taken over by Dollar Tree for $8.5bn, knocked back Dollar General’s rival $9.7bn bid, citing antitrust concerns about a deal that would bring together two of the country’s top three discount stores.The rejection is the latest twist in a takeover scrap that could reshape the discount shopping market at a time when changing consumer habits are increasing pressure on retailers across the country.Family Dollar, which has been under pressure from activist investors, including Carl Icahn, for months, agreed to sell itself to larger rival Dollar Tree last month. The deal surprised many in the market, who had been expecting a takeover offer to come from Dollar General, the largest of the cheap retailing trinity.All three retailers sell discounted goods spanning a wide spectrum of uses, from cell phones to baby wipes, cookies to car wax.After launching its counterbid earlier this week, Dollar General wrote a letter to Family Dollar’s board on Wednesday night accusing the company of being mendacious in earlier merger discussions between the two.Rick Dreiling, Dollar General’s chief executive, said in the letter that Family Dollar had not indicated that any deal was pending with Dollar Tree when the two companies met earlier in the year and, as such, gave Dollar General no incentive to rush into a bid of its own.The letter added: “Regrettably, as a result, we are now forced to factor a $305m break-up fee into our offer – consideration that could have been better used to maximise value for the Family Dollar shareholders.”Mr Dreiling also suggested Howard Levine, his counterpart at Family Dollar, might be in favour of the Dollar Tree offer because it offered him a greater role in the combined company.In formally rejecting the Dollar General offer on Thursday, Family Dollar slammed Mr Dreiling for penning a letter that “contained blatant mischaracterisations and did nothing to address the antitrust issues in Dollar General’s proposal”.Dollar General has claimed it would extract annual cost savings of $550m to $600m by combining with Family Dollar, almost double the $300m Dollar Tree has said it would get from merging.One explanation for the higher savings expectations is the similarities in the business models of Dollar General and Family Dollar. Both retailers price goods cheaply, but are not wedded to only selling at $1 or less. Dollar Tree, by contrast, sells everything in its stores for $1 or below.Many US retailers have struggled in recent years, as they battle against the dual pressures of rising store rents and the increasing propensity of shoppers to buy online.
32;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-08-18T17:08:38Z;Dollar stores: no knockouts;Dollar General’s vacillation has led to a pricey bidding war;“Everyone’s got a plan . . . until they get punched in the mouth,” said Mike Tyson, a noted expert on the topic. Dollar General seemed to have planned on independence. Family Dollar, its wobbling competitor in US deep discount retail, looked like a juicy acquisition target. But Dollar General looked like it was going to take a pass. Its respected chief executive Rick Dreiling announced his retirement in June after a six-year reign. But then, three weeks ago, Dollar General took one right on the kisser. The second-leading dollar chain, Dollar Tree, stepped in and signed a deal to pay $74.50/share for Family Dollar.On Monday, Dollar General picked itself off the canvas to submit an all-cash $78.50 offer (20 per cent of Dollar Tree’s was in shares). Dollar General’s shareholders are left to wonder if the company’s early hesitation led to an unnecessary and costly bidding war.The company’s enterprise value of $20bn gives it the firepower for a generous, all-cash bid. If it had bid a month ago at, say, $75.00 that could have intimidated Dollar Tree enough to keep it out of the ring. The difference between a $75.00 bid and the $78.50 offered today is about $400m. Given a $305m termination fee must also be paid to Dollar Tree, $700m may have just slipped away.And do not look for $78.50 to be Dollar General’s last bid. It estimates up to $600m in cost savings by joining forces with Family Dollar. Dollar Tree estimated its deal benefits at $300m. That gap should be worth much more than the implied 5 per cent premium to Dollar Tree’s deal. And Dollar General’s shares today are up a 10th, another sign of how much more Family Dollar could extract from it.It is easy to conclude that Dollar General complacently let its gloves drop. But Family Dollar may have showed some science of its own by getting Dollar Tree to enter the ring. Retail is blood sport. Consolidation is rarely done on the cheap.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
33;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-08-18T17:01:17Z;Dollar General bids $9.7bn for Family Dollar;;Dollar General has joined the battle to consolidate America’s discount retail market, placing a $9.7bn cash bid to buy Family Dollar less than a month after its smaller rival agreed to merge with Dollar Tree.Dollar General’s offer, which eclipses the $8.5bn cash and stock deal put together by Dollar Tree, would marry two of the US’ largest discount stores at a time when changing consumer habits are increasing pressure on retailers across the country.Tennessee-based Dollar General, the largest of the country’s cheap-retailing trinity, said that it was prepared to sell up to 700 stores to win regulatory approval for the deal and also pay a $305m termination fee to Dollar Tree should the board of Family Dollar switch its recommendation.Rick Dreiling, Dollar General’s chief executive, said his company’s proposal was “financially superior to the current transaction agreement with Dollar Tree and would provide Family Dollar shareholders with a substantial premium and immediate liquidity for their shares”.Mr Dreiling added that Dollar General would be able to extract annual cost savings of $550m-$­600m by combining with Family Dollar, almost double the $300m Dollar Tree said it would get from merging.One explanation for the higher expectations is the similarities in the business models of Dollar General and Family Dollar. Both retailers price goods cheaply, but are not wedded to only selling at $1 or less. Dollar Tree, by contrast, sells everything in its stores for $1 or below.All three retailers sell discounted goods spanning a wide spectrum of uses, from cell phones to baby wipes, cookies to car wax.Analysts at Wells Fargo said they expected Family Dollar’s management to favour Dollar Tree, as a merger between the second and third-largest players in the discount retail market would face fewer integration risks.News of the $78.50 a share offer sent Family Dollar’s shares up 5 per cent to $79.81, implying the market expects an improved offer. Dollar General rose 10 per cent to $63.23, while Dollar Tree fell 2 per cent to $54.48.The emergence of Dollar General as a counter-bidder provides an unexpected twist in a long running saga to sell Family Dollar. The smallest of the three discount retailers has been under pressure from activist investors Nelson Peltz and Carl Icahn to sell itself for months.After Dollar Tree made its offer last month, Mr Icahn said he expected better offers to materialise. He then sold some of his stake, however.Many US retailers have struggled in recent years, as they battle against the dual pressures of rising store rents and the increasing propensity of shoppers to buy online.
34;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-08-04T13:03:51Z;Managers should ask themselves: what would Carl Icahn see?;Businesses should practise thinking like activist investors before they are attacked themselves;Carl Icahn makes more money between sips on his outsized Martinis than most mortals make in a lifetime. Last week, the activist investor earned roughly $175m on a three-month-old stake in American discount chain Family Dollar. Another investor, Nelson Peltz and his Trian fund, had been doing the heavy lifting for four years, pressing Family Dollar into a sale. But Mr Icahn’s arrival seems to have been a US Cavalry moment, precipitating the acquisition by Dollar Tree.It seems almost too easy for him these days. Rising markets and an investment approach honed over decades have met with spectacular results. In October, he cashed in around half his 9 per cent stake in Netflix for an $800m profit, after holding it for 14 months. Since he began acquiring a large stake in Apple, the company has followed his advice to increase its stock buybacks and dividends. The mere sight of his dorsal fin in the water sends corporate managers hurtling to shore, begging to do what he wants.He may be, in the words of his fellow activist investor T. Boone Pickens, “as smooth as a stucco bathtub”, but his returns speak for themselves. Corporate managers may not like activist investors such as Mr Icahn, who can embarrass them, but they would do well to understand how these investors think before they are attacked themselves.Mr Icahn explained his investment strategy in an essay in Forbes magazine last year. It is to find opportunities not just in his favour, but dramatically in his favour. Activist investing creates these dramatic opportunities. The reason is that many companies are mismanaged and consequently undervalued. Ordinary shareholders can buy the undervalued shares, yet they have no power to change the management.“But,” Mr Icahn wrote, “if you are able to purchase the stock knowing you have the ability to mount a proxy fight or tender offer, and/or get control or force the board to make positive changes, the odds turn dramatically in your favour, and you may have an A+ investment.” Since corporate democracy is mostly a fiction, managers tend to be unprepared when a shareholder roars up from the deeps.Slanging matches ensue. But the knife to the throat focuses the mind of flabby-thinking managers.Some activists are trying to reduce the animosity towards them by calling themselves “suggestivist”. Presumably as in when a pirate suggests his prisoner walk the plank. Mr Icahn is not given to such euphemising.Ideally, managers will do all they can to ensure they are delivering the best possible return to shareholders, thereby thwarting the activists. They will, at times, examine the company with all the scepticism of a used car buyer. They will ask themselves, “what would Carl Icahn see here that I’m not seeing?” If necessary, they hire an outsider to do this for them.One of the best known stories of a company reinventing itself from the inside is Intel. In 1985, Andy Grove, then chief operating officer, and Gordon Moore, chief executive, were anxious that Intel had become obsessed with internal bickering over whether to stick with its highly profitable memory chips business or switch to microprocessors. According to Mr Grove he finally asked: “If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?” Mr Moore shot back: “He would get us out of memories.” The decision was made.In a recent interview in McKinsey Insights, one of the consultancy’s directors, Larry Kanarek, says management often overreacts. They become defensive in the face of the activist’s criticism. Emotion grips both sides and escalates, and it is usually the investor who comes better prepared for a fight, more willing to go to the brink for a deal.A better approach, Mr Kanarek suggests, would be to invite investors to present their analysis. It will usually be well done. Then take your time. Activists usually allow this if they get a proper hearing. Try to discuss criticisms constructively.This seems to be what Apple’s Tim Cook did when Mr Icahn was badgering him for stock buybacks. But I can’t help thinking that for lesser prey, by the time an activist smells blood, the time for constructive discussion is over. Either management have done their work and maximised the value of their shares, or they are shark bait.
35;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
36;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Dollar Tree / Family Dollar: value deals;Cautious estimates of cost savings may leave some upside;"After the financial crisis, investing in retail was simple: avoid the middle. Companies that provided value to the strapped, or the fairy dust of exclusivity to the rich, did well. Anyone in between got abandoned by the newly price-sensitive middle class. For a while, the lower end of this strategy worked perfectly for the US dollar discount stores. In the four years that ended in October of last year, Dollar Tree returned 250 per cent to investors; Family Dollar, 190 per cent. Since then, though, the two discounters have lost ground in a rising market. Competitive pressure gets to everyone eventually.So Dollar Tree’s $9bn enterprise value purchase of Family Dollar makes sense. When it is hard to grow sales, cost cutting is the next move, and size (the deal more than doubles Dollar Tree’s store count) helps on this front. All the more so when the target looks – on the surface – much less efficient than the buyer. Dollar Tree managed operating margins of 12 per cent over the past year; Family Dollar, 5 per cent. Returns on invested capital at Dollar Tree are much higher as a result. And aggressive expansion at Family Dollar (nearly 450 stores built in the past year, on a base of 7,800) has led to cash burn in the last two fiscal years. A prudent approach could turn that round.It is odd, then, that Dollar Tree sees $300m in cost savings from the deal – 3 per cent of Family Dollar’s cost base. This is low for a retail deals, as Neev Capital points out. If $300m were simply taken out of Family Dollar’s costs, its margins would still be well below Dollar Tree’s. This may reflect differences in the two businesses: Family Dollar sells items priced over the $1 level, unlike Dollar Tree.Still, the hoped-for savings are enough to justify the premium paid. If the synergy target is simply conservative, that leaves some upside for thrifty investors.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
37;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-07-28T17:13:50Z;Dollar Tree to buy Family Dollar for $8.5bn;;Dollar Tree has agreed to acquire Family Dollar in an $8.5bn cash and stock deal that will marry two of the US’s largest discount stores at a time when changing consumer habits are heaping pressure on retailers across the country.The deal comes after Family Dollar faced calls from activist investors Carl Icahn and Nelson Peltz to sell itself. Mr Icahn, who amassed a 9.4 per cent stake in the company over recent months, had also been threatening to replace the retailer’s board of directors.Mr Icahn said the deal validated the “activist investment philosophy”.“While we continue to believe there are a handful of potential buyers who could realise greater synergies through a combination with Family Dollar and are hopeful that one or more of them will surface . . . we are extremely pleased with Dollar Tree’s intention to acquire Family Dollar,” Mr Icahn said.Mr Peltz’s Trian hedge fund said it was “fully supportive of this combination and has entered into voting agreement in support of the merger”.Merging the companies will create a 13,000 strong network of so-called “deep-discount” stores and a company with combined sales of $18.4bn. The deal would also appear to put paid to long-running speculation that Dollar General, the largest member of America’s cheap-retailing trinity, would buy Family Dollar.The deal price of $74.50 a share includes $59.60 in cash and $14.90 worth of Dollar Tree shares, representing a 22.8 per cent premium over Family Dollar’s Friday closing price. News of the agreement sent Family Dollar shares soaring 25 per cent to $75.74 by close of New York trading, while Dollar Tree rose 1 per cent to $54.87.Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree’s chief executive, said the acquisition would help extend the company’s “reach to lower-income customers”, while allowing it to pursue its goal of becoming the nation’s “leader in value retailing”.Mr Sasser will lead the enlarged company, with Family Dollar’s chief executive, Howard Levine, taking on a yet to be announced role. Dollar Tree said the deal would generate annual cost savings of $300m three years after the merger is completed, coming mostly from savings in the sourcing, procurement and distribution of goods.Dollar Tree and Family Dollar will continue to operate as separate brands.In spite of targeting the same market, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar operate slightly different business models. The former sells everything in its stores for $1 or less, while Family Dollar has a more varied pricing model based on the notion that its products, while not necessarily in the sub-$1 price range, will be cheaper than rival retailers.Both sell discounted goods spanning a wide spectrum of uses, from cell phones to baby wipes, cookies to car wax.Many US retailers have struggled in recent years, as they battle against the dual pressures of rising store rents and the increasing propensity of shoppers to buy online.
38;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-07-28T16:57:48Z;First Solar shines on rivals’ tariffs;;US solar manufacturers were buoyed by new Commerce Department duties targeting rivals in China and Taiwan that will see tariffs set as high as 165 per cent for some companies.The preliminary decision, which is the latest in a long-running back and forth between the US and China, seeks to close a loophole some companies used to import solar panels and components into the US without duties by shifting manufacturing to Taiwan.Commerce department officials said the move followed its findings that components manufactured in the world’s second-largest economy had been subsidised in a way that damaged American counterparts.The department estimated more than $2bn of crystalline silicon photovoltaic products were imported from China and Taiwan last year.Analysts with Credit Suisse said the new tariffs would likely pressure manufacturers to shift production out of Taiwan and into mainland China, where costs are lower.The investment bank added the anti-dumping duties were higher than expected and could benefit US manufacturers.“First Solar and SunPower stand to gain the most from the sustained elevated pricing since they are not subject to the duties, especially during the utility procurement cycle under way ahead of the Investment Tax Credit step-down,” Patrick Jobin, an analyst with Credit Suisse, said.Shares of First Solar climbed 2 per cent to $65.53 while SunPower advanced 3 per cent to $38.56.Chinese rival Yingli Green Energy fell 3 per cent to $3.40 while Trina Solar rose less than 1 per cent to $11.40 after declining initially.Gintech Energy and Solartech Energy, which are both based out of Taiwan, fell 7 per cent to NT$29.00 and NT$22.60, respectively.US homebuilders were under pressure after new figures showed pending home sales, a measure of sales in process that have yet to be completed, slipping unexpectedly in June.Pending sales fell 1.1 per cent in June from May, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday, lagging estimates of a 0.5 per cent increase.Stagnant housing activity is a concern for the Federal Reserve, which has already been forced to cut its forecasts for US growth this year.Pending sales have been in decline since September as rising prices and higher mortgage rates curtail demand.Shares of Lennar fell 2 per cent to $37.62, DR Horton declined 1 per cent to 21.49, PulteGroup slid 1 per cent to $18.54 and KB Home slipped 2 per cent to $17.06.A spate of deal announcements on Monday provided momentum for several companies, including those in the discount and dollar retail sector.Dollar Tree agreed to buy rival Family Dollar in a mixture of cash and shares that valued the chain at $9.2bn, including debt, as the industry consolidates amid intensifying competition.Investors in Family Dollar will pocket $59.60 in cash and $14.90 of Dollar Tree shares.The agreement comes less than two months after billionaire investor Carl Icahn took a stake in Family Dollar and urged its chief executive, Howard Levine, to sell the chain of just over 8,000 stores.An aggressive expansion plan by Mr Levine and slowing sales of some of its higher-margin items has knocked Family Dollar, which is already grappling with competition from the likes of Walmart and Target.Dollar Tree advanced 1 per cent to $54.87 while Family Dollar climbed 25 per cent to $75.70.Rival Dollar General fell less than 1 per cent to $55.55 and Big Lots inched 1 per cent higher to $44.27.Zillow agreed to buy Trulia for $3.5bn in an all-stock deal to consolidate its grip on the online real estate advertising market in the US.Trulia shareholders will receive 0.444 shares of Zillow’s class A common stock for every share they own, and will own about a third of the combined company.Zillow registered 83m unique users in June, while Trulia counted 54m, but in a statement the two companies said there was “limited consumer overlap”.Although already very popular in the US, the two companies combined revenues represent less than 4 per cent of the $12bn the real estate industry spends on marketing their services to consumers annually.Trulia shares advanced 15 per cent to $64.64 while Zillow rose 1 per cent to $160.32.Overall, US equity markets were little changed. The S&P 500 rose 0.03 per cent to 1,978.91 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.13 per cent to 16,982.59.

39;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-06-27T16:13:29Z;DuPont falls on trimmed profit outlook;UBS analysts say company hurt by shift from corn to soyabeans;DuPont, one of the largest US chemicals companies, was under pressure on Friday after the company trimmed its profit outlook for the full year amid weak sales within its agriculture business.The Delaware-based company said it was forced to take larger than expected seed inventory writedowns as corn sales moderated.DuPont now expects operating earnings between $4.00 and $4.10 a share in 2014, lagging analysts’ estimate for $4.29 and DuPont’s own earlier prediction between $4.20 and $4.45 a share.“While 2014 is a transition year in agriculture, the revisions to the outlook we made today do not meet the expectations we set for our agriculture segment or for the company,” chief executive Ellen Kullman said.DuPont’s agricultural division is by far its largest, generating two-fifths of the company’s $10.2bn of sales in the first quarter of the year.Fuelled by its acquisition of Pioneer Hi-Bred in 1999, DuPont has tapped into rising global demand for pesticides and hybrid seeds as the world’s growing population drives demand.Analysts with UBS noted DuPont was hurt by a shift from corn to soyabeans by farmers, lagging Monsanto.“DuPont pesticides are also more exposed than Monsanto to early season weather, which was unfavourable. The magnitude of these known issues was larger than expected, but should be temporary,” analyst John Roberts said.Shares declined 3 per cent to $65.44, while rivals Dow Chemical fell 1 per cent to $51.61 and Monsanto slipped 1 per cent to $125.Manitowoc rose 11 per cent to $32.93 after investment firm Relational Investors urged the company to spin off its food business, which makes refrigerators and ovens used in commercial kitchens.Manitowoc said on Friday that it had retained Goldman Sachs as an adviser and has already spoken to Relational.Manitowoc’s food equipment division is a smaller part of its overall business, generating $383m of revenue in the first quarter of 2013. That compares with the $467m in revenue from its crane business.“While there is no change in our fundamental thesis that cranes are a late cycle opportunity we believe that the entry of an activist places a floor on the shares,” Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said.Nike was among the top performing stocks on the S&P 500 after the maker of athletic gear reported an 11 per cent rise in sales last quarter, topping forecasts.Meanwhile, profits climbed 5 per cent to $698m, or 78 cents a share. Analysts had predicted earnings of 75 cents a share.Although Nike was hit by a drop in emerging-market currencies earlier in the year, the US company said it enjoyed rising sales in every major market other than Japan last quarter.Future orders also eclipsed Wall Street’s forecasts. Excluding the effects of currency changes, orders for the period from June to November are $13.3bn, up 12 per cent from the same period a year earlier.Nike shares climbed 1 per cent by close Friday to $77.68.Shares of Michaels, the crafts retailer taken private by Bain Capital and Blackstone in 2006, were little changed in their debut on Friday.The Texas-based company sold 27.8m shares at $17 apiece, raising $473m. It had hoped to sell shares at between $17 and $19, which would have raised as much as $528m.Dollar General led the S&P 500 lower after the company announced its chief executive would retire.Shares fell 7 per cent to $57.19 on the news Rick Dreiling would leave in May 2015. The company will begin a search for new leadership amid potential industry-wide consolidation. Family Dollar shares declined 2 per cent to $66.84 and Dollar Tree fell 1 per cent to $53.35.Tencent, the gaming and social media conglomerate based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, said on Friday it will purchase nearly a fifth of 58.com for $736m.Tencent said it would integrate 58.com’s services into its online offerings. 58.com expects to use part of the proceeds to repurchase 27.6m shares from pre-IPO shareholders.Shares of 58.com were choppy in New York trading, falling as much as 4 per cent to $48.59 before rebounding to $54.90 by close.Overall, US equity markets continued to drift sideways despite better than expected consumer confidence figures.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,960.96 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 5.7 points to 16,851.84.

40;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-06-09T20:54:24Z;Time Inc shares receive cool first day reception;US publisher falls as much as 7% before paring losses;Shares of Time Inc, the publisher of People, Sports Illustrated and its namesake magazine, received a cool reception on its first day of trade, falling as much as 7 per cent before paring losses to close 1.21 per cent down at $23.20.The company, led by chief executive Joe Ripp, was spun off from Time Warner as the former parent focuses on faster-growing and more lucrative businesses like pay-TV channel HBO and its Warner Brothers studio.In its debut, Time carried a market capitalisation of roughly $2.5bn. The company generated sales of $3.35bn in 2013, a 2 per cent decline from a year earlier, while profits tumbled by more than a fifth to $201m.The results were a concern for some analysts after the company levered itself up with debt to pay a one-time dividend to Time Warner. Time said it expected to carry $1.4bn in debts after the split.“The publishing industry is in secular decline. Time’s circulation and advertising revenue has been decreasing, competition is intense and continues to increase – strategic initiatives may not result in growth,” Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan warned.The business is one of only a few available for investors seeking entry to standalone print publishers. In 2013, News Corp separated its publishing and entertainment assets. Shares in the publishing side, which includes the Wall Street Journal and HarperCollins book publisher, have climbed 17 per cent since last July.Wells Fargo offered a more optimistic view on Time, initiating coverage with an ‘outperform’ rating and $27 to $29 price target. Analyst Eric Katz noted much of the restructuring Time would need to complete was behind it and its digital businesses offered a growth opportunity.“Digital makes up 15 per cent of total advertising [revenue] today and is growing at a mid-teens pace,,” Mr Katz said.Rivals Condé Nast, which owns the venerable Vogue and Vanity Fair titles, and Hearst are both privately held.Time Warner shares closed up 1.25 per cent to $68.99.US discount chain Family Dollar may not be a natural shopping destination for a Wall Street billionaire, but a disclosure by Carl Icahn late on Friday of a 9.4 per cent stake in the company lifted shares 14 per cent to $69.08. They closed on Monday up 13.37 per cent at $68.62.After flourishing in the four years after the recession, Family Dollar has faced increased competition and scepticism over its expansion plan.Mr Icahn, one of the best-known activist investors, said that he would push Family Dollar’s management for changes. In response, Family Dollar disclosed it had adopted a so-called poison pill designed to deter any shareholder from securing a stake of 10 per cent or more.The prospect of a change in strategy at Family Dollar also helped buoy shares in rival discounters. Shares of Dollar General rose 7.35 per cent to $62.25, Big Lots climbed 2.77 per cent to $44.88 and Dollar Tree advanced 0.65 per cent to $55.50.Investment bank Jefferies upgraded Family Dollar and Dollar General to ‘buy’, citing potential cost savings of as much as $1.2bn if the two were to merge.“This upgrade is based on a potential acquisition of Family Dollar or in the absence of a combination, a material change to operations aimed at running the business better and closing the sales productivity and profitability gap with Dollar General,” analyst Daniel Binder said.The US continues to strike a sour note for McDonald’s, sending shares in the fast-food chain 0.57 per cent lower to $101.38.The company reported a 1 per cent decline in same-store sales in the US last month, underlining the struggle chief executive Don Thompson is having in the company’s biggest market. Analysts had expected US sales to rise 0.1 per cent.Alongside an uneven economic recovery that has hit its customers hard, McDonald’s is grappling with tougher competition from the likes of Yum’s Taco Bell which are pushing into the breakfast market.Apple shares also stood out in a dull trading environment, rising 1.60 per cent to $93.70 as the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis.Overall, markets were relatively tame to start the week. The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.09 per cent to 1,951.27, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.11 per cent to 16,943.10.

41;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2014-05-22T18:27:44Z;Dollar Tree buoyed by consumer polarisation;;A polarisation of the American economy, which has been supportive of top earners but pushed many middle-income earners into more cautious buying habits, was on display as retailers catering to both to high- and low-income spenders outperformed those focused on the middle.Shares of Williams-Sonoma, the upmarket maker of furniture, and Dollar Tree advanced after reporting better than expected quarterly profits.The results contrasted with figures from Sears, the beleaguered department store, which continued to struggle through the spring selling season.It is an investment idea pushed by former Citigroup analysts, who nicknamed it the “hourglass theory”, where retailers at both ends of the spectrum benefit as middle-market chains are squeezed.Citi analysts noted higher income brackets tended to have lower unemployment and higher consumer confidence, lifting stores serving the market.That has helped Williams-Sonoma, the operator of its namesake and high-end Pottery Barn and West Elm stores, which forecast 5 to 7 per cent same-store sales growth in the second quarter.The company lifted its earnings guidance for the full year to between $3.07 and $3.17 a share compared with Wall Street estimates of $3.17.For the three months to May 4, sales rose 10 per cent from a year earlier to $974.3m, ahead of expectations. Profits climbed 17 per cent to $46m or 48 cents a share.Analysts at Goldman Sachs, who increased their price target to $72, said the company’s positioning in the market remained “exceptional”.The results echo those from high-end jeweller Tiffany & Co on Wednesday, which also saw strong same-store sales growth.At the other end of the market, Dollar Tree said sales jumped 7 per cent to $2bn while profits rose 4 per cent to $138.3m, or 67 cents a share. Earnings were a penny ahead of Wall Street expectations.Sears did not fare as well. A lack of appetite for televisions and other consumer electronics weighed on the company’s results. Same-store sales at its Kmart division fell 2.2 per cent in the quarter.Overall, the company’s loss widened to $402m, or $3.79 a share, in the quarter to May 3 from $279m, or $2.63 a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenues fell to $7.9bn from $8.5bn.Williams-Sonoma shares climbed 9 per cent to $69.49, a record high, during midday trading Thursday. Dollar Tree shares increased nearly 7 per cent to $53.31 by close and Sears shares increased 4 per cent to $38.10 by close.Shares of JD.com, the Chinese online retailer, surged by as much as a fifth in their debut on Thursday, in an indication investor interest in the Chinese e-commerce market remained robust.JD.com on Wednesday raised more than expected from its Nasdaq initial public offering, pricing its shares at $19. The company is a cleaner echo of Amazon than Alibaba as it operates its own warehouses and sells goods directly to Chinese consumers.After the sharp rise in JD.com, shares pared their gains, advancing 10 per cent to $20.90 by close of trading.Another Chinese-tech company listed in New York was not as fortunate. Shares of Weibo, the Twitter-like service spun out of Chinese internet group Sina, slid 11 per cent to $18.05 after its quarterly loss widened from a year earlier.In its first set of results since an initial public offering in New York in April, Weibo said revenues more than doubled to $67.5m, matching Wall Street’s forecasts, as sales of display adverts on the social network rose.The company’s loss, however, widened to $47.3m, or 31 cents per share, from $19.2m a year earlier. Weibo put that down to higher taxes as well as increased spending on marketing and staffing.Overall, US equities drifted higher as a report showed rising claims for unemployment benefits, although they remained at historically low levels.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,892.49 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.1 per cent higher to 16,543.08. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6 per cent to 4,154.34.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @EricGPlatt
42;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2013-04-10T21:06:38Z;US stocks hit new record high;;US stock markets rallied, reaching record highs in spite of signs from the Federal Reserve that it might be ready to slow asset purchases in coming months.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.2 per cent to 1,587.73, surpassing both its previous closing and intraday high, reached in October 2007.Investment banking stocks led the rally, with Morgan Stanley shares up 2.2 per cent to $22.22 and Citigroup adding 2.7 per cent to $45.06, while Goldman Sachs rose 2 per cent to $149.46.The S&P 500 financials index, which has gained more than 23 per cent in the past 12 months, was up 1.1 per cent on Wednesday.The latest record came shortly after the Fed released the minutes from its most recent policy meeting several hours early following an accidental leak. The minutes showed several Fed members were ready to slow the rate of asset purchases due to signs of improvement in the labour market.However, the weakness of employment growth in March, if it proves to be the start of a weaker trend rather than a blip, would disrupt that timetable, according to Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.“Markets are extended at this point, but the rally has been led by defensive stocks, and any bad news, such as last Friday’s jobs data, will give investors incentives to take profits,” said Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.“We believe overall fundamentals are good and that the Fed will not slow the quantitative easing programme prematurely. Once the economy is truly improving and the stimulus is gradually withdrawn, markets will still be supported by positive growth,” he added.Broad-based gains were led by financial, technology and healthcare stocks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 per cent to 3,297.25, led by sharp gains in its biggest component, Apple.Shares in Apple rose 2 per cent to $435.69, but shares are still 18 per cent lower than they were at the start of the year.

43;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2013-03-13T20:32:22Z;US shares buoyed by economic optimism;;US stocks edged higher on Wednesday, bolstered by two well-received economic reports that suggested to investors the country’s economy was strengthening.The S&P 500, which traded lower for much of the morning session, rose 0.1 per cent to 1,554.52 in New York.The gains came as investors weighed economic reports, which showed US business inventories grew at their fastest pace in January since May 2011.Data released earlier in the day showed that retail sales in February rose strongly.Analysts at Barclays said the retail sales report “struck an unmistakably strong tone” about the health of the US economy.But they warned that rising gas prices and the impact of tax increases on most Americans, taking effect from the start of the year, may cause sales to slow in the coming months.Five of 10 major industry groups on the benchmark traded in positive territory with the consumer discretionary sector rising 0.5 per cent to lead the way.Walgreen, the US drugstore chain, was a top riser on the benchmark after its shares were upgraded to “buy” from “hold” by analysts at UBS.Walgreen climbed 4.2 per cent, touching a 12-month high, to $42.78 as the analysts said they thought the stock was undervalued.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, rose 0.1 per cent to $73.65 while shares in discount stores such as Dollar Tree, which was 0.9 per cent higher at $45.05, fared slightly better.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed fractionally higher to 14,455.28, marking the first time that the blue chip index has risen in nine consecutive sessions since 1996.Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer and Dow component, gained 0.7 per cent to $84.75.The losses for Boeing came as the main US aviation regulator gave the go-ahead to test its grounded 787 fleet.Refiners remained in focus during the day with shares in Valero Energy losing 4.7 per cent to $43.42 to rank among the worst performing on the S&P 500.Valero and other US refiners, such as Western Refining and Tesoro Corp, have come under pressure in recent trading sessions as the price of credits generated by the production or import of renewables has risen. Western Refining dropped 6.1 per cent to $35, while Tesoro declined 3.1 per cent.Companies in the sector often rely on the purchase of those credits since they are required to blend a certain quota of renewable fuel into gasoline under US law.Analysts at Citi said the surging prices in the credits could lead gas prices to rise, which may have the knock-on effect of catching the attention of policy makers and causing them to consider altering regulations.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.1 per cent to 3,245.12. Shares in Netflix rose 5.6 per cent to $192.31 after the internet streaming and home DVD delivery company said it had signed an agreement with Facebook that would allow customers the ability to link their accounts.Shares in the social networking company, meanwhile, slipped 2.6 per cent to $27.10.Shares of Silver Spring Networks, the US software services company, jumped 29.4 per cent to $22.00 on its first day of trading.The company raised $81m after pricing shares in its initial public offering at $17.Coach, the leather goods retailer, moved 1.8 per cent higher to $49.67 as Citigroup analysts raised their rating on its shares from “hold” to “buy”.Oliver Chen, Citi analyst, said: “Coach stock has transitioned from a growth stock to value. We are upgrading [Coach], as we believe the stock appropriately prices in caution and has good upside potential.”
44;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Discount retailers boost Wall Street;;Discount retailers stormed into fashion among US investors on Wednesday with advances from Dollar Tree leading stocks across Wall Street higher.The S&P 500 climbed 1.3 per cent to 1,515.99 and recorded its best single day of trading since January 2 as investors rotated back into riskier securities.All 10 main industry measures on the benchmark were in positive territory for the day, with cyclical sectors tied to the global economy performing the best.Defensive sectors, such as telecoms and consumer staples, which have been in vogue among investors in recent days, were the leading laggards and underperformed the broader market.The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.5 per cent. Shares in Dollar Tree gained 10.5 per cent to $45.39 after the discount retail goods operator said it saw record customer traffic and sales in its latest sector. Rivals Dollar General and Family Dollar shared in the gains, rising 3.6 per cent to $46.56 and 2.5 per cent to $57.68 respectively.Oliver Chen, analyst at Citi, said investors were bidding up shares in discount retail operators on expectations that the payroll tax increases from the start of the year were hurting consumer spending. He said: “Consumers feeling a pinch in their incomes could be trading down and looking for better deals, bolstering the sector.”TJX Companies, which owns the low-price Marshalls and TJ Maxx chains, climbed 2.5 per cent to $44.75. The company, which has seen its shares rise 24.4 per cent over the past year, reported stronger quarterly results than expected and said it would open more stores both in the US and internationally.Mr Chen added: “TJX has seen continued customer traffic because consumers are looking for good deals in a cautious economy and the company is the premier off-price retailer.”Meanwhile, US retailer Target lost 1.5 per cent to $63.12 as it said weak sales over the holiday shopping period hurt its latest quarterly results.The day’s gains also came as fresh economic data showed that demand for long-lasting durable goods slipped last month because of a decline in aircraft orders. Despite the data, shares in aircraft manufacturer Boeing climbed 2.3 per cent to $77.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 per cent higher at 14,075.37.Elsewhere, housing market data showed that pending home sales rose to their highest level in three months. The data helped shares in builders, including KB Home, which rose 3.4 per cent to $19.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1 per cent to 3,162.26. Shares in the tech-heavy index’s largest constituent, Apple, fell 1 per cent to $444.57.The iPhone maker held its annual investor day on Wednesday, with one third of shareholders declining to back the company’s executive compensation.Groupon, the struggling daily deals group, plummeted almost 22 per cent to $4.71 in after-market trading as it reported earnings below analysts’ forecasts in its latest quarter.Earlier in the day, shares in the company had risen 7.8 per cent to $5.98.Coach shares were 2.8 per cent higher at $47.82 as investors considered rumours that the luxury leather goods retailer was exploring a sale.Solar-panel maker First Solar dropped 13.8 per cent to $27.04 as the company, which has struggled with a decline in panel prices, said it had swung to a fourth-quarter profit after reporting net losses in the same period a year before.Industrial sector stocks were also up strongly on the day, rising 1.9 per cent. Shares in Joy Global climbed 5.8 per cent to $63.45 as the mining equipment company reported quarterly results that were slightly ahead of analysts’ forecasts.
45;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2012-08-05T04:37:39Z;Wait and see position pays off;Rathbone’s Global Opportunities fund is 20% in cash;As economic turmoil continues to result in short, sharp investment cycles, Rathbone’s James Thomson has allowed his fund’s cash position to reach almost 20 per cent of its portfolio.The manager of the £165.6m ($257.3m) Rathbone Global Opportunities fund says slowing global growth and a wait-and-see attitude in corporate spending has given him a less optimistic outlook for 2012.“The second quarter certainly doesn’t look as good [as the first], and we have hit an air pocket of growth. Everything has just hit the pause button, [and] discretionary spending has been reined back, so I’m more cautious.“I’ve been allowing my positions to build up, waiting for other opportunities to emerge, but we don’t know what they are going to be, and it is going to be very frustrating in a world where we like trends. It is going to be a stop-start economy for years.”Mr Thomson argues that in allowing his weightings in cash to increase he is positioning the fund for a variety of economic scenarios. He admits this will detract from the fund’s ability to deliver outstanding returns but should limit any losses.“Investors really need to think of long-term horizons of three years plus. It’s the only way to make money.”For a portfolio that exploits a narrower range of “global opportunities”, this kind of shift into cash might seem disconcerting. So far, however, moves like this have worked well for Mr Thomson. Since taking over the fund in July 2005 he has delivered a return of 87.7 per cent, outperforming his FTSE World benchmark by 35.5 percentage points.Mr Thomson says these gains have resulted from a focus on the beneficiaries of times of hardship.“I’ve added to my weatherproofed companies, which are reliable, predictable and not exposed to economically sensitive parts of the market. Associated British Foods in the UK or Dollar Tree in the US, for example, are very much what the consumer wants – bargains, no fun and games, nice and simple.”ABF, which owns discount clothing store Primark, makes up 2.3 per cent of the fund. The Dollar Tree, in which every item costs $1 (64p), makes up 2.5 per cent.Visa is the fund’s second largest holding at 3.5 per cent, but amid an ongoing financial crisis the manager has no exposure to banks or insurers.“I’m always looking for something different about my companies, a bit of innovation. When you match innovation with banking, it is usually illegal,” he jokes. “[Banking] is a zero weighting for me. It is easier that way.”On a regional basis, Mr Thomson boldly states that southern Europe is “uninvestable for the next decade”. While Europe as a whole – mainly positions in Scandinavia – makes up 10 per cent of the fund, he doesn’t expect this to increase any time soon.Mr Thomson is, however, optimistic on the outlook for the US.“Everything is slowing, but I still believe the US looks the best placed. They are further along in rebalancing, have strong balance sheets and a stabilising housing market.”In spite of this, however, the manager will not be making significant changes to the portfolio until he sees a number of broad economic catalysts.“It will have to be an amalgamation of more positive noises coming from corporates, better than expected economic data and leading indicators and inflation – lower inflation,” he says.Jenny Lowe is features editor at Investment Adviser, a Financial Times publication
46;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2012-03-28T22:20:37Z;US dollar stores: in for a dime ...;The best reason to own shares is their defensive characteristics;It was no surprise how well the dollar stores did in the crisis. Looking back, owning Dollar General, Dollar Tree or Family Dollar during the recession was an obvious trade and it paid. From the equity market’s peak in 2007 to its trough in 2009, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar outperformed the S&P 500 by 50 and 70 percentage points respectively. (Dollar General was owned by private equity for much of that period.)The performance in the recovery has been more surprising: since late 2009, all three stocks have whipped the S&P again. Consumers, apparently, picked up thrifty habits that persisted. Same-store sales growth at all three chains has remained in the mid-single digits, outshining many other retailers. What to do with the shares now? The temptation is to follow the consumer, and bargain hunt.Family Dollar reported a sound fiscal second quarter on Wednesday and set the expectation that same-store growth would be in the 5-6 per cent range for the full year. At 16 times this year’s earnings, shares are at a premium to the market as a whole but a discount to peers. There is a reason for this discount, though: sales growth at Family Dollar has been the lowest of the three, as has sales per square foot, and it has suffered gross margin pressure in recent quarters not evident at the other two. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Group has been agitating for changes that would close this gap, and the company is shifting its sales mix towards food and other consumable goods, and refurbishing stores. If this approach works, the upside could be meaningful.But the best reason to own the dollar stores is their defensive characteristics, should the recovery go sour. If the downturn does come, though, it will pay to own the ones that are executing well, not the one that is trying to refashion itself.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
47;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Big US chains begin to ‘shrink’ their stores;;American shops are getting smaller as retailers seek to reach consumers through new compact formats in the face of a stagnant economy, demographic shifts and a growing demand for convenience.Retailers including Walmart, Office Depot and Best Buy are introducing smaller stores in urban areas, a departure from the “big box” stores on which they built their success at out-of-town sites in the past three decades.Tesco, which has forged into the US with stores that are smaller than traditional supermarkets, is shrinking its format further with convenience stores that might be dubbed “micro-boxes” by US standards.“The cookie cutter, one-size-fits-all doesn’t seem to work that well any more,” says Ira Kalish, director of global economics at Deloitte Research, who links the shrinking of stores to the diversification – or fragmentation – of consumer profiles and preferences.But the convergence of so many retailers on small formats is creating stiff competition and exacerbating the difficulties of operating on expensive and unfamiliar plots, squeezed between the offices, car parks and apartment blocks of big cities.Walmart, the discounter that dominates US retail, has opened three Walmart Express test stores in recent months and says it wants to open 15 to 20 by the end of next year.At about 15,000 sq ft, the Walmart Express stores are just 8 per cent the size of Walmart’s trademark Supercenters, which are 185,000 sq ft and cover the same ground as two-and-a-half standard football pitches.Tesco of the UK began its move into California under the Fresh & Easy brand with stores of between 7,000 sq ft and 10,000 sq ft. But to push deeper into urban areas it plans to open stores as small as 3,000 sq ft, roughly the size of a UK convenience store.“We are always looking at different sizes of stores,” says Tim Mason, chief executive of Fresh & Easy.The shrinking of stores is partly borne of the “age of convenience”, says Ken Berliner, president of Peter J Solomon, a boutique investment bank. “Consumers want more choices. Retailers need to offer whatever the consumer wants to buy, however they would like to buy it, whether in stores, through a catalogue or online.”Cash-strapped shoppers are also less willing to fund long drives to big boxes given high gas prices.That helps explain the post-crisis popularity of small-format dollar stores – Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and 99 Cents Only – which between them already have more than 20,000 stores. They, too, are building more.Consumers’ expectations for convenience have been raised by online shopping, an option that has harmed Best Buy, the US’s biggest traditional electronics retailer.Part of its response has been to create small-format Best Buy Mobile stores, which sell telephones and tablet computers and will expand in number this year by 150 to 325.Target, a Walmart rival, is next year planning to open five experimental City Target stores, which will be between 60,000 sq ft and 100,000 sq ft, compared with the typical 135,000 sq ft.The downsizing also signals that retailers are adjusting to a higher concentration of people in urban areas – one result of the housing bust, which emptied new developments in the Sunbelt states of the south-western US.John McIlwain, senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute, says two deeper demographic trends are also at play.First, people in their 20s and 30s are living in urban areas longer than previous generations because they are marrying and having children later.Second, baby boomers are moving back into city centres because they want to be able to walk to shops and entertainment.But, in spite of retailers’ plans, city-centre stores are “typically not their first choice”, says Mark Keschl, national director of retail at Colliers, a property agency.Retailers can run big-box stores off a single blueprint for inventories, staffing and fixtures.But in each city location, they must adapt to a different set of constraints, ranging from narrow lanes for their trailer trucks to the existence of labour unions, he says.Some retailers are not keen on the idea. Safeway, a grocery chain whose typical stores are half the size of a Walmart Supercenter, has two small shops in California but they are “a labour of love”, says Melissa Plaisance, head of investor relations.“We are profitable in both, but it’s very hard … Hard to do enough volume to cover the costs.”
48;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2011-08-01T22:30:40Z;Poundland to expand in Europe;;"Poundland, the discount retailer that has grown rapidly on the high street in recent years, is poised to become the first of the UK’s growing ranks of pound stores to expand abroad.The retailer, which has 347 stores in the UK, is to open six stores in the Irish Republic in a €2m ($2.8m, £1.7m) deal, which it says will form the stepping stone to a potential network of several thousand stores to span mainland Europe.In Poundland’s UK stores, everything from toothpaste to sandwiches and Shakespeare DVDs is sold for £1. However, the fixed-price format will be adapted for its European stores, which will trade as “Dealz”. Shunning the obvious choice of “Euroland”, the new name gives the retailer flexibility to vary price points.“Research we’ve conducted with consumers in Ireland and Europe shows the name Dealz transcends the language barrier,” said Jim McCarthy, chief executive of Poundland.Describing the Irish stores as “the logical first step”, he added: “We will go into mainland Europe, and we’re currently researching which countries would be most suited to our retail proposition. There are countries in eastern and western Europe which test ­positively.”The first four Irish stores will open by early October, with two more to follow by next March, creating 120 jobs. Mr McCarthy said there was potential for “four figures of stores” throughout Europe in due course.Poundland claims to have a 14 per cent share of the UK’s £36bn discount general merchandise market, making it the largest player in a fragmented sector.Reporting an 81 per cent rise in operating profits last June to £21.5m on a £510m turnover, it is on course to report record results this month.The potential for the discount store model to work over a wider territory has been shown in the US, where three chains – Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree – have 20,000 outlets between them.In Europe, discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl perform well, but European “pound shop” equivalents tend to be localised businesses which operate much smaller stores offering a limited range of products.Poundland’s rapid expansion has been fuelled by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, which took a 75 per cent stake in the company in a £200m deal last year. The retailer’s strong cash generation has enabled it to self-finance its expansion with low levels of debt.“The discounters Poundland, Home Bargains and B&M Retail are among the most impressive, entrepreneurial retailers we have in the UK at the moment,” said Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital. “If the proposition is right, there’s every reason to believe they could have a go at France, Benelux and Spain.”Noting Germany’s high exposure to discount supermarkets, he disputes that this could be a barrier for Poundland in the same way it has been for supermarkets Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour, who are notably absent. “Primark went into Bremen last year, and the Germans are organising coach parties to visit the store,” he added.Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Arden Partners, added; “Pound stores aren’t just a UK phenomenon”.“Even the more affluent economies like Germany have a big discount sector, and the Aldi carparks are famously full of Mercedes cars. Poundland performs strongly in the north and Midlands, yet upmarket Twickenham is one of its best-performing stores. Considering where consumer spending and the retail property market is heading, it is bound to be a successful sector,” he said."
49;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2011-05-19T21:38:20Z;US retail: shopaholic investors;For those who like growth, there are dynamic companies in the group;A dozen prominent American retailers displayed their financial wares last week, from big boxers (Walmart, Target) to hip clothiers (Abercrombie & Fitch, Urban Outfitters) to niche sellers (Petsmart, Williams-Sonoma). While the results were not quite celebratory, they were hardly funereal. On average top lines were up five per cent year-on-year, while same-store sales came in around 2 per cent. Operating margins for the 12 companies on average expanded a bit. The biggest stores (Home Depot, Walmart, Target) had a hard fight against market saturation and the law of large numbers, but most managed to produce some kind of growth. Guidance was middling. With a few exceptions (looking at you, Staples) there were no awful surprises.If the retail results this week were so pedestrian, however, why do investors seem to treat the sector like shoppers with unlimited credit? The share prices of the 12 companies trade at an average prospective price-to-earnings ratio of 17 times (excluding Sears, whose lack of earnings inflate the ratio). At that price, same-store sales growth lagging nominal output growth looks decidedly less attractive. For a similar or lower valuation investors can have Apple, which grew 80 per cent last quarter, or SABMiller, whose exposure to emerging markets any American retailer would give their eye teeth for.Still, for those who like growth, there are some dynamic companies in the group. Abercrombie’s naughty ads must be working to generate double-digit same store sales to go along with improved profitability. The firm’s p/e ratio, at 45 times, is less of a turn-on. Investors who insist on retail exposure would do well to shun glamour and look to humble Dollar Tree, which has sales approaching Abercrombie’s level, a sector-average valuation, and a strategy – really, really cheap products – that make sense even if the shopping habit remains subdued.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
50;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2011-05-19T21:06:02Z;Economic data offset LinkedIn debt surge;;Shares in LinkedIn more than doubled on their first day of trading following the company’s initial public offering, while the wider markets edged a little higher after a mixed set of data on US employment and manufacturing.The business-focused networking website was up 109.4 per cent to $94.25 after pricing on Wednesday night at $45 a share, which was already at the top-end of its projected range.The stock reached an intraday high of $122.69, up 173 per cent.“This is what I would call a speculative frenzy, and it is not going to end well,” said James Dailey, the chief investment officer at Team Financial Managers.LinkedIn has received a huge amount of attention as the first US social networking and web 2.0 company to go public, ahead of its Facebook, retail services company Groupon and social games service Zynga.Many commentators have been asking whether the lofty valuations put on some of these point to the emergence of a technology bubble, akin to the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s.“This is a very rich valuation, which is reminiscent, to say the least, of the year 2000 exuberance,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief investment strategist at YCMNET Advisors, a wealth management firm.But Mr Dailey said it was too early to talk about a bubble in the technology sector. “There has been a bubble in the use of the word bubble,” he said.The strong first day from LinkedIn had little impact on the wider technology sector, however, which was led lower in the session by chipmakers after Goldman Sachs cut its view on the sector from “neutral” to “cautious”.The investment bank’s rating on Intel was reduced from “neutral” to “sell” sending shares in the chipmaker down 1.4 per cent to $23.54.Applied Materials, which was also downgraded, lost 1.2 per cent to $14.33 while Nvidia fell 1.4 per cent to $17.78.That left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 0.9 per cent and S&P technology index up 0.1 per cent.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 added 0.2 per cent to 1,343.50 after better-than-expected employment data outweighed a disappointing number from the Philadelphia Fed on manufacturing.Employment numbers showed that the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits had fallen by 29,000 last week to 409,000, lower than the 420,000 economists had been expecting. But the figure was still above the 400,000 mark, which is the point at which economists conclude the economy is adding jobs.But the Philadelphia Fed’s reading on mid-Atlantic manufacturing activity tumbled to 3.9, indicating very little expansion. This was a sharp fall from the 18.5 reading in April and lower than the 20 points that economists had been expecting.“There is still some worry that labour market gains may be faltering a bit,” said Joshua Shapiro chief US economist at MFR.Separately, data showed that sales in previously occupied homes had fallen slightly in April, in another sign that the US housing market remained depressed.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4 per cent at 12,603.81 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.3 per cent higher at 2,823.24.The retail sector was again in focus after another raft of mixed earnings reports and the S&P retail index was down 0.1 per cent.Shares in Advance Auto Parts fell 10.2 per cent to $63.48 after the spare-part retailer’s earnings missed analysts forecasts.The company said earnings in the first quarter were $1.35 a share on $109.6m, short of the $1.38 a share expected.Sears Holdings was down 2.6 per cent to $73.86 after the retailer reported a disappointing loss in the first quarter.The owner of Sears and Kmart posted a net loss of $170m, or $1.58 a share, compared with a net profit of $16m, or 14 cents a share, in the same period in 2010Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, lost 3.9 per cent to $40.80 after reporting slightly better than expected earnings, but giving a current-quarter forecast that fell short of expectations.Dollar Tree, the discount retailer, saw a 59 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, exceeding expectations and sending shares in the company up 2.9 per cent to $63.11.Big Lots, another discount retailer, was down 10.6 per cent to $33.74 following reports that it had decided not to put itself up for sale.
51;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2011-05-01T17:40:30Z;Discount sector still in vogue;;"A year on from Warburg Pincus’s surprise £200m swoop for Poundland, the UK discount sector is still attracting private equity attention.In the past week, 99p Stores has appointed advisory firm DC Capital Partners to explore the possibility of a sale, which analysts think could fetch £60m-£80m. Founder Nadir Lalani controls 50 per cent of the business, which has 133 UK stores, and Barclays Ventures has a 25 per cent stake.Many of the discount chains remain a family affair. Wilkinson, the discount hardware chain, is now in its third generation of family ownership but this has proved no barrier to expansion and it now trades from 335 UK stores.Poundworld, controlled by the family of former market-stall trader Chris Edwards, has 104 shops with turnover of £135m.Rival Poundstretcher has greater ambitions to expand, recently appointing property advisers to take it from 320 to 500 stores by 2012. However, its financial record has not always been strong; parent company Instore delisted from the stock market in 2009, after branding mistakes and distribution problems caused profit warnings.Property consultant CB Richard Ellis says the discount retail sector is one of the fastest-growing areas of the UK retail market, but analysts dispute whether the cheap and cheerful expansion can continue for much longer.“The discount sector can’t keep growing exponentially, and has to reach saturation point,” says Helen Dickinson, head of retail at KPMG. “There is very little that differentiates these retailers, and there’s a danger that they will cannibalise each other.”However, others look at the long-term success of US discounters such as Dollar Tree.“It is still a relatively underpenetrated retail segment, compared to the US,” said one banker. “There is a lot of M&A potential.”When it comes to expanding the more successful UK formats, consolidation is likely to be the way forward. But there is also scope to grow businesses by investing in transactional websites and expanding into Europe.“Discount stores have many different formats from one country to another. The question is, can you grow them outside of their home territory?” says Michel Paris, chief investment office of PAI Partners, which has been involved with a number of retail transactions in the discount sector.If the private equity houses have their way, perhaps thrifty shoppers on the Continent can look forward to the arrival of Euroland, Eurostretcher or 99 Cent Stores."
52;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2011-02-16T03:26:21Z;Peltz makes buy out offer for Family Dollar;;Trian, the investment group headed by Nelson Peltz, has made an offer to acquire Family Dollar, the US neighbourhood discount store chain, that values the retailer at up to $7bn.News of the cash offer of $55 to $60 per share sent the company’s shares soaring in after-hours trading in New York. The shares were trading at $55.35, up 25.9 per cent.In a regulatory filing, Trian said it had contacted Howard Levine, chairman and chief executive of Family Dollar, on Tuesday and advised him that it beneficially controlled 8 per cent of the retailer’s shares, which it believed made Trian the company’s largest shareholder.Trian said it had also “offered Mr Levine the opportunity to participate as an investor” in the proposed buy out, which follows a series of smaller deals for US speciality retailers including Jo Ann Stores, Gymboree and J Crew.But Trian also said that it believed a decision on whether or not to accept an offer should lie with the company’s shareholders.Mr Levine is the son of the founder who launched the chain in 1959.Trian, whose partners include Peter May and Edward Garden as well as Mr Peltz, said it may seek board representation.Family Dollar has more than 6,800 small stores in 44 US states targeting mainly low income customers. Together with rivals Dollar General and Dollar Tree, it saw its sales largely outperform mainstream retail competitors during the depths of the US recession, and it was one of the strongest performers on Wall Street last year, with its shares rising more than 60 per cent.After peaking above $50, its shares had lost ground this year, closing at $43.96 on Tuesday before the Trian announcement.Trian first disclosed a 6.6 per cent stake in Family Dollar in July last year, saying it believed the shares, then trading less than $40, were undervalued.Trian focuses on consumer investments and has in the past used its stakes to push for strategic changes at companies including Kraft, Cadbury Schweppes and Heinz, the food companies, as well as engineering the merger of Wendy’s and Arby’s fast food chains. It is the largest shareholder of the combined group.Dollar General, Family Dollar’s larger rival, was taken private by investors led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity fund, in 2007 in a $7.3bn deal, including debt. KKR sold a portion of its shares in Dollar General in an IPO last year.Both Family Dollar and Dollar General have been pursuing similar strategies aimed at improving their performance, including increasing the share of packaged groceries and other consumables that they sell, introducing refrigerators for milk and other products, expanding private label offerings, and refurbishing stores.Family Dollar, which operates stores of about 10,000 sq ft in neighbourhood shopping plazas, says that 55 per cent of its customers have annual incomes of less than $40,000, and about a quarter have incomes of less than $20,000.
53;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Cut-price retailers take the limelight;;"Dollar stores, hard discount supermarkets and “off price” clothing stores have long lived in the shadow of America’s top retail names.But just as Walmart supercentres and big box “category killers” such as Best Buy rose to national prominence in the 1990s, so stores such as Save-A-Lot, Big Lots and Dollar General are becoming the new stars of a rapidly changing retail environment.“I do believe that there is a new consumerism,” says Rick Dreiling, chief executive of Dollar General, which operates more than 9,100 small hard discount general stores in 35 US states. “People are conscious about saving money.”At a time when mainstream retailers have slowed growth in the long months of the recession, or stopped it altogether, the value-focused retailers have continued to expand.By the end of this year the three leading “dollar store” chains – Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree – will have opened about 1,000 new locations this year, with an annual square footage growth rate of 5 per cent that exceeds Walmart, Target and Kmart, their far larger rivals whose growth rates are either flat or below 3 per cent.TJX Companies and Ross Stores too, “off-price” stores that sell seasonal leftovers and end of line brands, have maintained their pre-recession annual growth rates, sometimes moving into retail spaces vacated by bankrupted businesses including Circuit City, the electronics business, and Mervyn’s, the west coast department store chain.“Hard discount” grocers, which offer a highly limited selection of foods dominated by their own private label brands, are also far outstripping the rest of the supermarket business.The US unit of Aldi, the hard discount grocer, plans to expand this year at just under 10 per cent a year, adding another 100 stores to its 1,100 strong chain. Save-A-Lot, a US hard discount supermarket owned by Supervalu, is growing at a similar rate, but wants to double its store network to 2,400 stores by 2015. On the West Coast, the UK’s Tesco has continued to open up more locations for its fledgling Fresh & Easy stores, also a hard discount format.Bill Shaner, Save-A-Lot’s chief executive, says his company’s ambitious expansion plans reflect the view that it is “perfectly positioned in today’s economy”, with an Aldi-like high percentage of private label food goods, and stores with low overheads stocking a limited collection of about 1,800 product lines, including fresh items. This compares with a supermarket industry average of 48,750 product lines, according to the Food Marketing Institute.Executives at all three types of store claim they are managing to hold on to customers they acquired during the recession, and are continuing to see sales growth. Both Dollar General and Family Dollar have been remodelling stores and revamping their own label food brands, in a bid to change perceptions of what to expect in their aisles.Mr Shaner says that the Save-A-Lot stores, which are aimed at households earning less than $45,000, “are seeing new faces”.“I think that is really our opportunity, to communicate a great shopping experience …so that we do manage to keep them when the economy does get stronger.”Dollar General’s Mr Dreiling says the recession sales success of the dollar stores has also helped change perceptions among suppliers, who may initially have been loath to see their brands on the shelves of a dollar store. “When we started our journey there were a lot of people who were looking at us and raising an eyebrow,” he says of the days after the company went private in 2007.But that changed as the recession gathered momentum in early 2008, “when we began to seriously start clocking some serious sales growth”.“Tell me another retailer that’s in a mature channel in a mature business that has basically raised their average store sales volume by 25 per cent over 3 years.”US hard discount grocery sales have room for more growth, currently accounting for less than 2 per cent of total national grocery sales; in Europe market penetration for the same segment ranges from the high teens to about 44 per cent in Germany.Todd Hale, head of retail and shopper insights at Nielsen, the consumer research company, includes the growth of low-cost grocery stores as one of his predictions for changes in the retail landscape by 2015. “Consumers have fundamentally changed their habits,” he said recently.Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree chief executive, says that his chain is “positioned squarely in the cross hairs of what consumers are looking for today”, combining both low costs and accessible local stores. “Middle America is seeking value, and we are the destination.”"

The carmaker raised $20.1bn in the largest American IPO, allowing the US government to reduce its stake.The offering priced at $33 a share, higher than the initial range of between $26 and $29. GM also increased the size of its offering from 365m to 478m shares. A high volume of shares were traded.Shares in rival US car company Ford, which have surged 67 per cent this year, fell 3.4 per cent to $16.12.Trading in the two carmakers accounted for about 5 per cent of total volume.“It’s quite fascinating that GM was able to raise such a large amount of money,” said Steven Roge, portfolio manager at RW Roge & Co. “The market is just itching to get money invested. When the Treasury yield is 1 to 2 per cent people want something with the potential to grow over time and distribute dividends.”The S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent to 1,196.69, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.6 per cent to close at 11,181.23 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.6 per cent higher at 2,514.40.

58;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Booming sales spur TJX into expansion;;TJX Companies, the low-price US retailer whose sales have boomed during the recession, said on Wednesday that it planned to accelerate stores growth, citing a “paradigm shift” in US consumers’ spending habits.TJX operates more than 2,700 “off-price” stores in North America and Europe, including the TJ Maxx, Marshalls and TK Maxx chains, selling excess branded clothing lines sourced from manufacturers and other retailers.Carol Meyrowitz, chief executive, said TJX planned to add 130 new stores in 2010, on top of 91 new stores last year, saying she was confident the company could hold on to the new customers it attracted last year. “We believe that there has been a paradigm shift among customers to value,” she said. “Regardless of whether the economy is weak or strong, value is not going out of fashion. If some of our newly-acquired customers go back to shopping at their favourite high-end department stores …that does not mean they’ll stop shopping with us.”TJX’s upbeat view of the new value-conscious consumer was supported by a survey from Booz & Co, the retail consultant, that says the recession has shaped consumption patterns “in ways that will persist even as the economy rebounds”.The survey of 2,000 US consumers found that nearly two-thirds said they would shop at different stores with lower prices even if it was less convenient for them. Only 18 per cent said they intended to spend at pre-recession levels on clothing and shoes.Bob Sasser, chief executive of Dollar Tree, whose local ultra-low-cost stores have also gained customers during the recession, said on Wednesday he too expected to retain new customers as the economy revives.“We believe that as the economy recovers that we’re going to have stickiness,” he said, as the retailer reported a 6.6 per cent increase in fourth quarter same store sales.TJX reported a 58 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings to $395m, or 94 cents per share, on Wednesday, on a 12 per cent increase in same-store sales.Total revenues increased 7 per cent to $20bn in 2009, as its sales growth outperformed mainstream stores and discounters including Walmart and Target.TJX plans to increase capital spending to $750m in 2010, including investment in store remodelling. It also plans to open a new store concept in the US that it expects to expand into a 90-100 chain.The expansion underlines the surging fortunes of value-focused retailers. Dollar Tree is adding 245 new stores this year, while Dollar General, its rival, plans to open 600 new stores.Ms Meyrowitz said TJX, which has also expanded into Germany and Poland, could eventually double in size.

Declining oil prices also weighed on commodity-based stocks.Although the S&P 500 edged into positive territory in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve reduced its unemployment forecast, the benchmark index finally closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,105.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 10,433.71 and the Nasdaq lost 0.3 per cent at 2,169.18.“Thanksgiving week, despite typically having low volumes, normally ends up being a very positive week,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab. “When the preliminary GDP number came out it was a surprise to the market that it was so strong and I think there was an expectation there would be a revision.”A series of corporate results also dragged the market lower.Strong international sales helped Warner Music, the world’s third-largest music company, posted higher revenues for its fourth quarter than analysts had been expecting.However, restructuring costs eroded profits and the group made a net loss for the period. The company also warned declining CD sales were likely to reduce future revenues, pushing the shares down 12.2 per cent to $6.20.Barnes & Noble dropped 5.4 per cent to $22.25 after the largest US bookstore chain reduced its full-year forecast. Borders, the second-largest bookseller also posted a larger-than-expected quarterly loss on Tuesday, sending its shares 13.4 per cent lower to $1.74. Both retailers have faced greater competition from online booksellers such as Amazon.Hewlett-Packard posted a 14 per cent rise in quarterly profit thanks to surging demand from China and aggressive cost-cutting at home. But the computer maker’s total revenue was still down from the previous year and the shares dropped 1.6 per cent to $50.19.Discount retailers, however, continued to out­perform the sector.Dollar Tree, which sells items from magic tricks to cleaning fluids at heavy discounts, posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit.Earlier this month, Dollar General, one of its biggest rivals, launched the largest initial public offering in the US retail sector for more than 12 years. Retailers operating at the very bottom of the discount market have thrived in the recession. Shares in Dollar Tree rose 4.5 per cent to $51.33. Dollar General gained 0.4 per cent to $23.50, trading almost 7 per cent above its offer price.DSW, the footwear chain, said it had doubled its profits in the third quarter, sending its shares 10.6 per cent higher to $22.71. The retailer, which sells branded shoes at discount prices, has experienced strong demand in the recession and has also cut costs.Heinz, the consumer group, posted a lower quarterly profit due to falling sales in North America and Europe. The company has faced increasing competition from cheaper brands in the recession. But Heinz still raised its full-year profit forecast, saying it was confident that shoppers would continue to cook at home. The shares were up 0.1 cent at $43.23.American Eagle Outfitters, the clothing chain that caters to teenagers, posted higher-than-expected quarterly sales and said it expected to see conditions continue to improve next year. The shares climbed 3.2 per cent to $15.01.In the technology sector, Brocade Communications Systems denied previous reports that it was putting itself up for sale, sending

60;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2009-07-08T17:52:40Z;Customers flock to US discounter;;The strong performance of low-cost discount chains – or so-called “dollar stores” – during the US recession was underlined on Wednesday by third-quarter results from Family Dollar.Shares in the discount retailer rose more than a tenth after it said the number of customers had increased, as had spending per visit.The retailer, which operates more than 6,000 small stores mostly in neighbourhood plazas, reported a 35 per cent year-on-year increase in net earnings to $87.7m, or 62 cents per diluted share.Comparable sales of consumable items, including food and household goods such as soap and paper towels, increased by about 11 per cent during the quarter.It had previously reported an 8.3 per cent increase in overall sales in the quarter ending May 30 to $1.84bn, and a 6.2 per cent increase in overall comparable store sales. The increases contrast with the low single-digit or negative sales growth experienced by leading US supermarkets, but are in line with the robust growth reported by Wal-Mart and by its rivals Dollar General and Dollar Tree.Family Dollar’s core customers are poorer households with an income of about $40,000 a year. But Howard Levine, chief executive, said there had been particular growth in sales to customers with incomes of up to $70,000.The retailer has invested substantially in improving the layout and look of its stores, while also increasing the amount of food it sells, including installing equipment to process electronic food stamp benefits.Mr Levine said in a call with Wall Street analysts that “we believe we have a unique opportunity to increase our market share as value becomes a strong driver of shopping trips among customers of all incomes”.The retailer also reported a 2 per cent increase in comparable sales in June, better than analysts expected, given that sales last year were boosted by customers’ spending federal tax rebate cheques.In contrast, comparable June sales at leading chain stores and department stores are expected to be down sharply when an­nounced on Thursday.Bad wea­ther in the north-east and mid-Atlantic states added to economic pressures on retailers during the month, on top of the difficult comparison with last year’s tax rebate spending.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, says the consensus of analyst estimates points to a 6.6 per cent decline in its monthly index, excluding data from drug store chains and from Wal-Mart, which no longer reports monthly sales numbers.
61;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2009-06-02T20:54:47Z;Shoppers lift sales 13% at Dollar General;;Dollar General, the ultra low-cost US store chain owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, reported a 13.3 per cent increase in its comparable sales during its first quarter, underscoring its position as one of the success stories of the US recession.The retailer operates 8,460 small neighbourhood stores that sell an assortment of foodstuffs, household goods, clothes, toys and other items.A quarter of its stock sells for $1 or less, and most of the rest of it is priced below $10.In a regulatory filing the company said that “during this challenging economic period, value-conscious customers are relying on our stores for value and convenience more than ever”.The strong performance compares with the negative sales numbers being reported by most US retailers and to the flat to low growth seen by leading supermarkets. Wal-Mart, the largest US mass discount retailer, reported a 3.3 per cent increase in comparable store sales in its first quarter.Dollar General’s overall sales for the three months ending May 1 rose 15.7 per cent to $2.78bn.Sales of “highly consumable” items such as food and household goods were up by more than 18 per cent, as it increased its offerings of convenience foods, drinks and expanded its low-cost private-label brands.The recession has encouraged leading consumer goods companies to seek an ever-closer embrace with Dollar General and other low-cost dollar stores, which they once largely shunned.The retailer’s current weekly newspaper advertising insert, for instance, is dominated by special sale offers on food brands from companies such as Kraft, and on brands from Procter & Gamble, including Tide detergent, Olay hand-wash and Gillette razors.While other retailers have been cutting back on capital investment, Dollar General opened 104 new stores during its first quarter, and expects to open more than 400 by the end of the year, while also remodelling 400 others.Rival dollar store Family Dollar, which has been investing in remodelling its 6,600 stores and expanding its grocery offering, reported a 6.4 per cent increase in comparable sales in its most recent quarter.The retailer, which describes its core customer as “poor to just getting by” and earning less than $40,000 per year, says it has also seen an increase in visits from more middle-income customers.Dollar Tree, which has more than 3,600 stores selling everything for less than $1, last week reported a 9.2 per cent increase in comparable sales in its first quarter.
62;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2009-05-13T19:05:10Z;Macy’s online sales rise 16% despite store woes;;Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, on Wednesday underlined the increasing lure of online sales to embattled US retailers, as it reported a 16 per cent increase in quarterly sales on its website, even as store sales fell 9.5 per cent.The retailer stepped up investment in its online business over the past two years, after ending an initial online partnership with Amazon. Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said that in the future more of Macy’s capital expenditure would be directed online as expansion of its 840-strong network of physical stores slows.“In the future as we project out, more of the capital resources will go in that direction . . I do think over time new stores, and new mall construction sites, are going to take longer to become a reality,” he said.Macy’s online sales grew by 29 per cent last year, even as its overall sales fell 7 per cent. It did not give a total for its 2008 online sales, but industry estimates put them at about $1bn.David Fry, founder of Fry, a web services company, notes the recession has seen increased variation in the online performance of retailers, who could previously count on double-digit growth from their online business.JC Penney, for instance, reported flat year-on-year internet sales of $1.5bn in 2008 as its comparable store sales fell 8.5 per cent. But Gap, the clothing retailer, saw a 14 per cent increase in direct sales, to $1bn, while its comparable sales fell 12 per cent.This month, Amazon, the largest US online retailer, said its North American sales had increased by 21 per cent during its first quarter. Wal-Mart has also reported strong sales online.In addition to providing growth opportunities for retailers with a large physical store presence, such as Macy’s, industry consultants say they are seeing a surge of interest in retailers expanding online operations.Janet Hoffman, a retail consultant with Accenture, said she had seen increased interest from retailers in combining online presence with physical stores through initiatives such as store delivery for online purchases.“When you look at the capital expenditure required for new stores …clearly it makes sense to extract value from your existing investments,” she said.Eddie Lampert, CEO of Sears Holdings, highlighted his company’s online strategy at Sears and Kmart department stores at the company’s annual meeting last month. Sears is currently testing a new online service, called Mygofer, and has opened a pilot store in Illinois focused on providing physical delivery of goods ordered on the internet.In an indication of the widening appeal of online business, Dollar Tree, one of America’s hard-discount dollar stores, recently launched online bulk sales of its household and office goods, with free store delivery.A recent survey by Shop.org and Forrester found that almost half of the 117 retailers surveyed had no plans to cut online marketing, despite the recession.
63;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2009-05-08T00:02:08Z;US retailers have cause to raise earnings call;;More than a dozen US retailers raised their earnings guidance on Thursday, after releasing April sales data that showed battered US shoppers displaying renewed interest in purchases of clothing and other discretionary items, while continuing to frequent low-cost stores.Companies raising guidance included the three largest US department store chains – JC Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s – as well as Target, the mass discounter.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales numbers, said its overall index for April showed a 1.5 per cent increase, supported in part by sales around Easter, which fell in March last year.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said the figures were better than expected and had been “aided by rising consumer confidence from improving market performance” as well as extra cash from lower tax payments and mortgage refinancing.Janet Hoffman, managing partner of Accenture’s North American retail practice, said “the overall picture is for a baby step towards [a] positive [environment]”.“I think we are definitely on the path towards moving out of the depth of the underperformance in consumer-facing retail,” she said.In a sign of resilience in the middle of the market, JC Penney said its strongest performing divisions had been women’s and children’s clothing, although overall comparable sales, against last April, were still down 6.6 per cent. Kohl’s, with comparable sales down 6.2 per cent, also reported strong children’s clothing sales as it raised its earnings guidance by over 10 cents a share.Target said its same-store sales increased by 0.3 per cent, adding that it had been able to avoid price-cutting and had seen better-than-expected profit margins. The retailer said it expected its first-quarter earnings to be “well above” the current $0.52 per share forecast by Wall Street.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, continued to benefit from budget-focused shoppers, reporting a stronger-than-expected 5 per cent increase in comparable store sales and gains in customer traffic. The company, which also announced that it would no longer issue monthly comparable sales data, said last week it had seen renewed strength in discretionary spending.Other low price retailers continued to fare well, including Dollar Tree, Ross and TJX. But luxury department stores Saks and Neiman Marcus continued to struggle.
64;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2009-02-05T19:36:26Z;US retailers report grim January;;After the toughest Christmas season in decades, US retailers on Thursday reported grim January sales figures that underlined the intensity of their struggle for survival.Gap’s Old Navy stores delivered one of the worst performances, with comparable sales down by more than a third. Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 23 per cent drop, echoing the 24.4 per cent drop at Neiman Marcus announced this week.Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, the youth fashion stores, also reported sales down by more than 20 per cent, while JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores, saw mid-teen percentage drops.In contrast, Wal-Mart, the low-cost retailer, again outperformed rivals, with same-store sales up 2.1 per cent for the month, ahead of its own expectations.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart USA, said comparable sales for the past 52 weeks were three times higher than the previous year. “Clearly, our stores are performing very well,” he said.The retailer reported strong sales growth in groceries and healthcare but also said it outperformed the market in sales of home and entertainment products.The comparative strength of discount stores was underlined by Dollar Tree, the chain that sells items for only $1, which reported a 2.2 per cent increase in comparable sales in its quarter ending January 31.In contrast, Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket rival, reported a 3.3 per cent fall in same-store sales, and said it had seen a decline of more than 20 per cent in sales of women’s clothing. The retailer lowered its fourth-quarter earnings guidance.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly sales, said its index of same-store sales from leading retailers fell 1.8 per cent for the month, the fourth consecutive month the index had fallen.Retailers have announced several thousand job cuts this year, including 1,100 jobs at Saks and 7,000 at Macy’s. Most have also indicated that they are sharply reducing inventory levels.Chris Donnelly, a retail consultant at Accenture, said: “The name of the game is to focus on cash, keep inventories low, and try to ride this thing out.”But he also noted that retailers faced the challenge of managing cutbacks while trying to maintain the customers’ experience of their stores.“Can retailers manage cuts without damaging the customer experience? It is a fine balancing act, so that people don’t feel that they are either going out of business, or are a frustrating place to shop.”
65;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2009-01-01T16:55:04Z;Dollar shops are at heart of consumer sentiment;;Rick Dreiling has had a good year since taking over in January as chief executive officer of Dollar General, the 8,000 store, hard-discount variety chain.Amid the pervasive gloom, Dollar General reported a comparable sales increase of 10.2 per cent in its third quarter – more than three times the 3 per cent growth reported by Wal-Mart, the largest US discounter.“We’re seeing pretty consistent growth in every region we are in …we are seeing really, really solid performance everywhere”, Mr Dreiling told investors last month. “We are seeing new customers and old customers coming in more often.”Dollar General, taken private by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2007 in a $7.3bn deal traces its roots back to 1939. Its stores stock packaged foods, health and beauty items, toys and household items with an average price of about $10. The product mix, 25 per cent of which sells for less than a dollar, includes its own private-label brands and leading national names such as Tide, Pepsi and Crest.With sales of more than $9bn annually, it leads the rapidly transforming US extreme discount sector.Family Dollar, Dollar General’s closest rival, has annual sales of about $7bn from more than 6,600 similarly sized and similarly focused local stores and reported a 2.1 per cent increase in comparable sales for its third quarter.Dollar Tree, the smallest member of the national dollar store trinity, takes an even more extreme approach to pricing, selling everything at its stores for less than a dollar. It delivered a 6.2 per cent increase in comparable sales in its last quarter.All three retailers were already expanding their food selection before the economy worsened over the summer, introducing freezers into their stores to sell milk and eggs, products that drive customer traffic. Dollar Tree has also moved into frozen food, selling products such as Hormel sausages and Green Giant frozen vegetables for a dollar a packet.Bob Sasser, chief executive, told investors this month that Dollar Tree had found itself “squarely in the bull’s eye of consumer sentiment”.Dollar General and Family Dollar reported strong increases in sales of consumables such as packaged foods and toothpaste, which were up 13 per cent at Family Dollar, and 16.6 per cent at Dollar General.Mr Dreiling at Dollar General argues that its strong performance in the downturn is also strengthening its ability to negotiate promotional deals with the leading consumer packaged good companies.
66;DLTR;Dollar Tree Inc;2008-10-09T19:56:09Z;Consumers forced to rethink buying patterns;;"For much of the past century, there has been no better place to live comfortably than the US. In the world’s richest economy, air conditioners, microwaves and refrigerators that spit out ice cubes are common household goods, seen more as necessities than a luxuries.But as the country teeters on the edge of recession, life is becoming harder for the average American. With the purchasing power of the US dollar in sharp decline – it takes $2.66 to buy the same amount of goods that $1 would have bought in 1980 – and household incomes dropping, Americans are being forced to cut back on some of the products that have made life good. In western Europe, consumers are in a similar quandary, with France last week becoming the first large economy to acknowledge it had fallen into a recession.But in Asia, eastern Europe and South America, where many economies are still growing, life has been getting better for emerging middle class consumers, as more people than ever can afford to buy basic consumer products such as toothpaste, televisions and shampoo.“In developed markets [such as the US] consumers are still trying to preserve their buying power, which is all about trading down,” says Jeffrey Palma, an equity strategist at investment bank UBS. But in emerging markets the story is different,” he adds. “Incomes are rising…the phenomenon of trading up is still very much in place.”In the US, people are changing the way they shop as makers of branded household products and packaged foods put their prices up to recoup higher transportation and raw material costs. Last month, Jeff Rein, the chief executive of Walgreens, one of the largest US drug stores, noted that there had been a slowdown in the growth of the number of prescriptions being issued in the US.“We believe the biggest impact has been the very tough economy,” said Mr Rein, noting that a July survey by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners found that 22 per cent of Americans are reducing visits to the doctor to save money. Eleven per cent were found to be scaling back on medication.Sales of discretionary food and drink items, including bottled water and non-carbonated juices, and other drinks, are also dropping. Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, said recently that consumers who might have previously left a screw top bottled drink unfinished, now finish it off. Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola’s largest bottler, has reported falling sales of larger, more expensive 20oz bottles of Coke that are a staple at petrol stations.But sales of cheap foods, such as cold, sliced meats as well as soups and frozen vegetables, are rising as people take thier lunches to work and look for cheap alternatives to fresh fruit and vegetables.US consumers are consolidating shopping trips to save money and spending more time at big stores that sell lots of different products at relatively cheap prices. These include: Wal-Mart, the low-cost chain; Costco and BJs, so-called “club” stores that charge membership fees; and discount chains, such as Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Consumers are also buying more so-called “own brand” goods.In Europe, consumers are cutting back on grocery purchases in all countries except Denmark and Norway, according to research group Nielsen, which tracks supermarket sales. “The second quarter revealed a clear and present pullback in consumer consumption,” the group says.To stop consumers “trading down” to cheaper own-label products, companies have begun making cheaper versions of their core products. In France, dairy group Danone has recently put a new kind of yoghurt into supermarkets. Labelled the “Eco Pack”, shoppers get six yoghurts for one euro. The yoghurt tubs weigh 115g each, compared with the 125g tubs the company usually makes, and Danone has also used less packaging, launched fewer flavours and spent less on marketing to keep the price down.But while companies are having a tough time making money in the US and western Europe, doing business in emerging markets has been getting easier. Whereas inflation is rising faster than wages in western markets, in emerging markets it’s the other way around. “In most emerging markets consumers are seeing increases in their real purchasing power, despite higher rates of inflation,” Clayton Daley, Procter & Gamble’s chief financial officer, told an investment conference last month .P&G, like other multinational western consumer goods companies, has been able over the past year to use strong demand in emerging markets to offset slowing sales in the US and Europe. In 2001, P&G’s emerging market sales were some $8bn annually. Today, they are $25bn, and the fastest-growing part of the company’s business.However, there are some initial signs that consumers in India, China, Russia and Brazil will not be immune to events unfolding in the US and Europe.At the end of September, Pepsi Bottling Group, which bottles and distributes PepsiCo products, was one of the first US companies to point to signs of the slowdown in the developing world spreading – as it blamed macroeconomic issues for a slump in sales over the summer in both Russia and Mexico.In Russia, Eric Foss, Pepsi Bottling Group CEO, cited “some near-term uncertainty and financial market volatility” that had led to the soft drinks market’s annual growth slowing to the range of 3 to 4 per cent, down from the low double digit growth rates seen previously. But he stressed the company’s belief that Russia “remains an attractive place for PBG to play over time”.In China and India, which have lower levels of income per head than Brazil and Russia, a big swing to upmarket brands has yet to happen outside of the countries’ biggest cities. But economists are confident it will.India has a lower gross domestic product per capita than Russia, Brazil or China, with less than 20 per cent of homes owning a microwave, refrigerator or washing machine compared with more than 50 per cent in China and nearly 100 per cent in Russia.But with India on track to have more people than any other country in the world by 2030, and incomes rising, consumption is expected to rise at faster rates than other countries.Meanwhile in China, companies say there is plenty of room for growth. Although people still spend just one-thirtieth the amount of money per head on P&G’s products than they do in the US, the time will come when the amount of money they spend will be the same, according to Bob McDonald, P&G’s chief operating officer. “It’s irrefutable.”"
