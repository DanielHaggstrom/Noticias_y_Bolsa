The mood is merry in the rest of Silicon Valley. Even after recent volatility, equity prices are through the roof.Spare a thought for the poor M&A bankers. Global technology M&A in the three months to July is on course for the lowest level in 11 quarters, according to Dealogic data: $93bn of deals compared with double that in the same period last year.Private equity firms have dry powder aplenty but their buyout spreadsheets keep generating error messages thanks to the valuations. Even if they wanted to gamble with more debt, regulators caution banks against providing loans of more than six times a company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That rules out some old debt-laden companies.Amazon filled its trolley with Whole Foods on Friday but the largest tech companies are not buying within their own sector, even though they are flush. The problem is that the expected tax break on repatriating offshore cash has not yet arrived.Is there a bargain bin to consider? Not every tech stock has become dearer in the past 12 months. Take Palo Alto Networks, the cyber security company, which traded at 16 times sales a year ago and is now at seven times. Happily, it also has net cash. Less happily, its enterprise value of $12bn on forecast ebitda of only $500m would rule it out for all but the most spendthrift tech company.Tableau Software is another heavily discounted stock: it has fallen from 10 to five times sales in 12 months. Tableau was on the shopping list of Salesforce. But its profits are even more meagre: just $60m of ebitda supports an enterprise value of $5bn. Servicenow, also on the Salesforce list, has seen multiple contractions and is trading at a lower, although still steep, 34 times forecast ebitda.There are pockets of relative value elsewhere. Micron Technology, the largest US memory chipmaker, makes real money, about $10bn of ebitda estimated this year, with an enterprise value of $43bn, including a rather chunky $8bn of debt. The list of potential advisers is limited. But a deal is conceivable and would finally let M&A bankers join the fun.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
1;NOW;Servicenow Inc;2012-10-02T00:15:41Z;Morgan Stanley seeks vindication with Workday;;The hotly anticipated IPO of Workday could help to advance Morgan Stanley’s rehabilitation in the wake of the Facebook fiasco. But given the way other recent tech deals led by the bank have been structured, it is still too soon to pass a verdict on its performance – or to tell how much long-term damage the debacle surrounding the Facebook offering will do to its business in Silicon Valley.Morgan Stanley has already led three tech IPOs since the Facebook debut in May, all of which have done well in the after-market.The question is: have they performed too well? And will the investment returns hold up when lock-up provisions preventing insider shares sales are lifted?Investors in the IPOs of Kayak, Palo Alto Networks and ServiceNow, all of which were led by Morgan Stanley, saw first-day pops of between 21-38 per cent over the summer. Those gains have continued in the weeks since, with the shares of the three companies now registering gains of 37, 44 and 103 per cent, respectively, compared to the IPO prices.This points to the “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” dilemma of IPO pricing. Trying to finesse a sale to leave only a modest premium for investors can backfire – as Facebook, which was also advised by Morgan Stanley, found to its cost. But leaning too far the other way leaves Wall Street investors pocketing profits that should belong to a company’s early shareholders.Mistakes either way only serve to underline the uncomfortable truth: that the science of IPO pricing can look like anything but a science, raising doubts about whether the banks really earn the big fees they are paid.Adding to the uncertainty is the small share float in each of Morgan Stanley’s three summer tech IPOs. The offerings involved less than 10 per cent of the shares of each of the companies – only around half the traditional float from such deals, and in line with the narrow share sales from companies like Zynga and Groupon, which proved highly volatile. The success of deals like this can only be assessed after lock-up restrictions have been lifted and supply and demand can reach a more stable equilibrium.So where does this leave Workday? With 14 per cent of the stock up for sale, it won’t be as narrow a deal as the others – in fact, the business software company is on track to raise more cash from its deal than the three others combined. But at the top end of the price indicated on Monday, the shares would be priced at 19 times trailing 12-month revenues of around $200m – certainly not cheap (there’s no point talking about multiples of earnings because Workday doesn’t have any: like other SaaS companies it is betting on future stable subscription revenues making up for high up-front marketing and development costs now).Whatever happens, it will be too early to conclude that Morgan Stanley’s Facebook troubles are behind it. As with the other transactions over the summer, the advisers for Workday’s IPO were lined up before Facebook even got to market.It will only be with future mandates that Morgan Stanley’s position as top dog in the Silicon Valley IPO business can be assessed. But a smooth outcome will certainly help its cause.
2;NOW;Servicenow Inc;2012-10-01T22:56:57Z;Workday eyes $3.8bn valuation in IPO;;Workday, a lossmaking US business software company, has paved the way for the biggest technology IPO since the troubled Facebook listing, as it announced plans for a stock sale that would value it at up to $3.85bn.Workday’s arrival on Wall Street marks a swing into favour for business technology IPOs after the bumpy ride of consumer companies like Facebook, Zynga and Groupon, while also rekindling one of the most bitter personal rivalries in the software industry.Dave Duffield, Workday’s co-founder, lost his last company, PeopleSoft, to a hostile takeover by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison in 2004. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Mr Duffield, who had spent nearly 20 years building PeopleSoft into the biggest maker of software for human resources managers, vowed that he would never expose any of his businesses again to take over by Mr Ellison.Along with Aneel Bhusri, another PeopleSoft executive with whom Mr Duffield shares the chief executive title, the 72-year-old software entrepreneur will control 67 per cent of the voting power in the company after it goes public.The arrangement echoes other recent tech IPOs that have left founders like Mark Zuckerberg in full control of their companies after listing. The arrangement flies in the face of standard Wall Street practice but has won strong support in Silicon Valley, where it is seen as a way to give founders breathing room to build their companies without fear of hostile acquisitions or attack from activist shareholders.Though it has become one of the leading names among the new group of so-called software-as-a-service companies, which sell access to their technology over the web, Workday warned in a regulatory filing that it did not expect to earn a profit for the foreseeable future. The company reported sales in the six months to July 31 of $119.5m, up 118 per cent compared with a year before, while its net loss rose to $46.9m from $36.3m.Despite the losses, Wall Street has grown increasingly comfortable in recent years with tech concerns like Workday which rely on subscription income rather than upfront sales of software. The arrangement forces them to defer some revenues to later years, making them unprofitable during periods of rapid growth since sales costs are reported immediately.The Workday IPO will give Wall Street investors a chance to bet on a sector that has already attracted high valuations from corporate buyers. Last December SAP bought Workday rival Success Factors for $3.4bn while Oracle paid $1.9bn for Taleo, another rival, in February.In one sign of potential investor demand, ServiceNow, which uses cloud computing to help companies manage resources, has seen its stock price nearly double since its offering at $18 a share in June.Workday said it plans to sell 22.75m shares at between $21 and $24 each, raising up to $546m for the company. The company is backed by Greylock Partners, and has listed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as lead underwriters for the offering
3;NOW;Servicenow Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
