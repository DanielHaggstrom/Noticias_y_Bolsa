Concern is growing not only among US presidential candidates but also among emerging market governments and development campaigners.There are now nearly 3,000 bilateral investment treaties (BITs) between countries worldwide, designed to protect foreign-owned companies from discrimination, arbitrary nationalisation or other unfair treatment by the host country government.The tribunals that settle disputes between investors and authorities are generally modelled on ad hoc commercial arbitration panels rather than public courts. The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), one of the world’s most prominent arbitration panels, operates out of the World Bank in Washington.Argentina has been hit by dozens of arbitration cases since its financial crisis in 2001-02, when Buenos Aires forcibly changed contracts from dollars into pesos and froze utility prices to cushion the impact on Argentine consumers. Foreign companies including Mobil, France Telecom and Vivendi have won a string of rulings against Argentina at the ICSID, awarding them hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation for lost earnings.But Argentina has so far declined to pay any of the awards, and has argued that the financial crisis was an emergency that gave it permission under international law to breach contracts.The ICSID is also embroiled in a controversy involving Bolivia, which last year became the first country to announce its withdrawal from the ICSID’s jurisdiction. Bolivia lost a prominent case to Bechtel, the US engineering and construction company, after cancelling a water supply contract. It has argued that the tribunal should ignore cases filed after Bolivia gave the foreign investors notice to withdraw.Meanwhile, ExxonMobil is claiming billions of dollars in compensation from Venezuela at the ICSID after walking away from an oil project following government attempts to take control.Development campaigners say the tribunals violate national sovereignty. A recent petition from 863 campaign groups including Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club called on the ICSID to stop hearing cases against Bolivia. Sarah Anderson of the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies said: “The global petition reflects growing concerns around the world about a system of investor rights that undermines democracy and human rights.”And as Mrs Clinton suggested, even the White House and Congress were surprised and disturbed when the US ended up being on the end of several high-profile claims under Nafta. With companies from emerging markets like India and China investing abroad, the rich countries could find themselves increasingly targeted by litigation.Nonetheless, the system of international investment arbitration continues to expand its reach. European and American business lobbies, often dominated by service sector companies like telecommunications, retailers and banks that invest abroad, are keen on new investment treaties and on adding investment rules to broader trade deals.The US is pursuing BITs with the “Brics” (Brazil, Russia, India and China) group of emerging market countries. A US trade official says that Washington’s model for BITs deals with some of the problems encountered under Nafta by including rules against frivolous claims, along with consolidation procedures allowing multiple claims to be considered simultaneously rather than clog up the system. But the official adds: “It is inconceivable to think that we would sign a [BIT] without provisions for investor-state litigation.”That aspect may prove a sticking point for some. Brazil, Latin America’s largest recipient of foreign direct investment, has traditionally been suspicious about investment treaties. A senior Brazilian foreign ministry official said recently that the Argentine example was “very politically visible” and that it would be enormously difficult to get investor-state arbitration through the country’s congress.One Washington trade lawyer says: “The US business community clearly still likes BITs. But why Brazil or any other country would agree to sign one after looking at Argentina defeats me.”……………………………………………Argentina case shows panel’s flawsArbitration panels such as the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) aim to operate quietly – critics would say secretively – and quickly.An ad hoc arbitration panel convened from practising lawyers rather than a regularly sitting court with permanent judges, ICSID has a review committee with limited powers rather than a formal appeals process.Such a committee recently looked at one of ICSID’s rulings against Argentina – a $133m award to CMS, a US energy company – and concluded that, while the original panel had made “manifest errors of law”, it lacked the power to overturn the judgment.Luke Peterson, editor of Investment Treaty News, a widely read briefing service, says: “Such a curious outcome has infuriated Argentina, at the same time as it has stoked debate amongst observers as to whether [ICSID] needs an overhaul – including perhaps an appeals court with greater powers to correct any mistakes.”The involvement of governments in the rulings raises the political stakes, particularly for a country such as Argentina in which politicians have repeatedly blamed foreign investors and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund for the country’s periodic crises.A Washington trade lawyer says: “When the [ICSID] challenge committee says that a decision is flawed but still has to be enforced, they essentially make it politically impossible for the government of Argentina to pay.”But for many lawyers, introducing an appeals procedure would defeat the whole object – to provide swift and binding decisions without recourse to sometimes slow, biased or corrupt national court systems. “In an ad hoc arbitration process, it makes no sense to have an appeal,” says Robert Volterra at the law firm Latham Watkins, the lead attorney for Bechtel in the Bolivia case.“It is just one ad hoc group of lawyers evaluating the same facts and law as another ad hoc group of lawyers has just done.”

It said it would now promote the loan service to contractors who use its network of more than 900 stores across the US.Jim Stoddart, president of Home Depot Supply, declined to speculate on possible opposition to the bank aquisition, noting that EnerBank had a “regulatory sound” business model.“EnerBank deals with hundreds of contractors, and we do business with hundreds of thousands of contractors. So this is a tremendous opportunity for us,” he said.He also argued that the acquisition was part of Home Depot’s drive to expand its services for contractors. In March, it closed its $3.51bn deal for Hughes Supply, which distributes construction, repair and maintenance products.The retailer also insisted that it intended to continue to focus on the bank’s existing business, and had no plans to change other aspects of its credit offerings.In common with other US retailers, Home Depot already offers branded credit cards and loans to individual customers - with 16m proprietary cards issued by Citibank accounting for around a quarter of its store sales last year.The change of ownership requires the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which earlier this year organised unprecedented public hearings to review Wal-Mart’s application for a Utah industrial bank charter.The Wal-Mart bank bid renewed a debate in Washington over the role of industrial banks, which the Federal Reserve and some members of Congress argue undermine federal laws aimed at separating banking and commerce.Wal-Mart has insisted it would restrict the operations of its proposed bank to back-office processing of its electronic payments.FDIC could also choose to open Home Depot’s takeover of EnerBank to public comment.A number of car companies, including Volkswagen and BMW, use their Utah-based banks to issue car and home loans, while Target, the discount retailer, uses its Utah bank to issue business credit cards.Existing banking regulations allow state-chartered industrial banks to issue credit cards, take deposits, and open retail branches.

For now, stocks are stuck in neutral.While awaiting comments from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan this evening in Shanghai and grappling with continued concerns about rising oil prices, Wall Street had little else to chew over during the muted session.By the close of trade, the S&P 500 was fractionally higher at 1,197.51, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 6.06 points to 10,467.03, and the Nasdaq Composite drifted 4.33 points higher, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,075.76.The indices are coming off a modest sell-off on Friday but have been on a solid path that has lifted the Nasdaq Composite more than 10 per cent since April 21. “Are we about to roll over, or is this a pause?” asked Tobias Levkovich, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. He believes it is a short-term pause.Others are not so sure. Richard Bernstein, quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch, notes that the stock and bond markets are behaving quite differently, with bond markets betting that economic growth is going to slow and equities reviving animal spirits on hopes that growth will continue and the Fed is almost finished raising interest rates.Mr Bernstein says: “Which one is going to be wrong? History suggests equities.He also notes that the leadership in the latest stock rally has come from speculative quarters, much like late-cycle rallies in 1989, 1994 and 2000, “which shouldn’t necessarily make people feel very sanguine about the stock market right now”.Shares in Apple, last year’s big winner, fell 32 cents, or 0.8 per cent, to $37.92 despite news that the consumer-technology company plans to shift its Macintosh PC line to Intel chips next year.Shares in Intel declined 16 cents, or 0.6 per cent, to $27.17. Intel’s competitor Freescale Semiconductors shed 49 cents, or 2.4 per cent, to $20.25 on the news, while its rival IBM fell 79 cents, or 1 per cent, to $75.00.Steve Wallman, a hedge-fund manager who owns Apple stock, said: “If we’re reaching the point where chip horsepower is peaking, then it makes sense for Apple to choose the low-cost volume producer.”Elsewhere, shares in eBay were up 2.2 per cent, to $38.64 after a Barron’s report suggested the online auctioneer’s stock, which has fallen 35 per cent so far this year, is a bargain.Shares in Teva Pharmaceuticals were off 3.5 per cent at $31.98 after warning that a court ruling against its version of an antibiotic drug would trim earnings.Several energy stocks, the year’s hottest sector, rallied. AES gained 4.2 per cent to $15.00, and CMS Energy rose 4.2 per cent to $14.32.

Dan Bishop of CMS Energy told the FT, “We cannot say much at this time. Our lawyers are analysing the ruling.”Meanwhile, state attorneys were locked in discussions all morning, following an emergency Thursday night meeting between Mr Kirchner, Roberto Lavagna, Argentina's economy minister, and Horacio Rosatti, justice minister. Mr Kirchner said his government would refuse to pay, and would instead file an appeal, according to local press reports.
4;CMS;Cms Energy Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
