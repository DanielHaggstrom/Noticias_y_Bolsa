0;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2019-06-18T07:39:22Z;Facebook and Google join ad agencies and brands in ‘safety’ alliance;Tech groups have come under pressure from regulators over spread of harmful content;Facebook, Google and Twitter have launched the first industry-wide initiative with global advertising agencies and brands to “rapidly improve digital safety”, as tech platforms come under increasing scrutiny from regulators over the spread of harmful content.The tech companies, ad agencies including WPP, Publicis and Omnicom, and global brands such as Procter & Gamble and Unilever, on Tuesday said they wanted more to be done to “address harmful and misleading content” and to develop a “concrete set” of protocols to protect people and brands online.The move towards co-ordinated self-regulation was announced on the second day of the Cannes Lions advertising festival, and comes as social media companies face increasing pressure to crack down on the spread of misinformation and abuse on their platforms. In the UK, members of parliament have called for social media executives to be held liable for harmful content. They have also pushed for the creation of a new regulator to police the platforms that would be financed by a new levy on tech companies. Brands are also becoming increasingly wary of the reputational risk of appearing next to malicious content. Earlier this year, big advertisers including Nestlé pulled spending from YouTube over growing concerns that the video site had been used to facilitate paedophile networks. The Google-owned company also came under fire in March for failing to take down videos of the Christchurch gun attack in New Zealand quickly enough. “There is still too much bad content on [Facebook and YouTube] and they also need to moderate or at least create more civility among their comments,” said Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer at Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods group that is the world’s biggest advertiser. He added that he wanted the alliance to create standards to control and remove hateful content and comments on online platforms. “We need to fix the whole ecosystem, but Facebook and Google are the biggest players across all online media,” he said. Carolyn Everson, vice-president of global marketing solutions at Facebook, said the company was “resolute in our commitment to provide a safe community”, adding: “We’ve made a lot of progress, and this alliance is our next step forward.”The alliance’s first meeting will take place on Wednesday. The group said it intended its work to be “transparent” but did not say when it would share what was agreed.John Montgomery, global vice-president of brand safety at WPP-owned GroupM, said third-party verification of harmful content on social media was one of its goals.“We need better transparency into the platforms in terms of what harmful content exists so we can work out where to better place our advertising,” he said. Facebook, for example, still hosted content related to illegal weapons purchases, he said, adding that technology companies should pool their engineering talent to come up with better ways to wield artificial intelligence to block such content. Damian Collins, chair of the UK’s digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said: “[The] damage posed by harmful material that’s posted online [is] clearly something that advertisers are waking up to as a threat to their products and how they promote them online. “But digital safety has got to be about protecting all users as individuals, not just as brand consumers.”
1;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2018-12-11T16:58:05Z;WPP: sketch show;Mark Read’s plans are good but lack some ambition;Heath Robinson and Rube Goldberg only had one joke, but it was a good one: crazily complex machinery doing a simple job. At its peak, WPP, the UK-based advertising and marketing conglomerate, could have been designed by either cartoonist. Instead, it was founder Martin Sorrell that enlarged the contraption by bolting together endless small agencies. The resulting structure was equally rickety.Newish chief executive Mark Read has employed draughtsman skills to redesign WPP. He unfurled some compelling blueprints on Tuesday, complete with cost cuts and profit targets. The only snag this time may be an dearth of ambition, in place of too much complexity.Even modest improvements are welcome to battered investors. WPP looks oversold. Its share price has declined more than 36 per cent this year. That is far more than the broader FTSE All-Share index and rivals such as Publicis and Omnicom. That makes WPP very cheap at 8 times estimated earnings, close to lows for the decade. Unsurprisingly, short sellers have tuned out.Mr Read plans to cut costs by £275m annually. He is targeting a group operating margin of 15 per cent by the end of 2021, up a fifth from last year. WPP will merge 100 offices, and close another 80.Tot all those cuts up and the plan adds value to the diminished company. Taxed and capitalised, net of severance costs, savings are worth at least £1.2bn, about 12 per cent of WPP’s current market capitalisation. The shares reacted accordingly, soaring as much as 8 per cent on Tuesday.That leaves Mr Read with wriggle room to offer more cuts later on. Given a total overhead of £13.4bn, the annual reductions do not look all that big. Reducing the dividend — which gives the shares a yield of more than 7 per cent — could liberate even more cash flow to put into the creative and technology teams, thinks Liberum. WPP needs to get more out of both areas. As Mr Read concedes, WPP’s real problem is a lack of growth, not high costs.Streamlining should, however, strengthen collective purpose. This is never strong in a federal business and will have been weakened at WPP by the ousting of Sir Martin. Mr Read’s actions should put a floor under the share price. His grand plans should raise a smile, as those of Messrs Robinson and Goldberg did, but with a lower risk of mechanical failure.Lex publishes two popular newsletters for premium subscribers.

2;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2018-07-19T13:38:54Z;Publicis: ad-ing up;The situation is not looking too bleak for chief Arthur Sadoun;The advertising industry is struggling to come up with a suitably creative campaign for its own work. Today’s ad business is a grind of digital data. Multinational clients tend to prefer programmable marketing offered by online platforms. That shift has dented the price to earnings valuations of the big three media conglomerates: Publicis, WPP and Omnicom. Of the three, Publicis should hold up best.This is because the Paris-based company began fighting for marginal gains earlier than its peers. Chief executive Arthur Sadoun took over one year ago with a promise to stop declining profitability in key regions — North America, Europe and Asia. He talked about bringing back growth in organic revenue (ex-acquisitions) too. That last assurance came back to bite him on Thursday. First-half results revealed a poor second quarter. Sales dropped 8 per cent year-on-year. Even adjusting for a weaker dollar against the euro, the fall is significant. The share price fell 7 per cent.On closer examination, however, the situation is not so bleak. Publicis had already warned about a tough comparison with big account wins made in last year’s second quarter. And Mr Sadoun’s effort to move away from low-margin business meant dropping a healthcare contract, which hit revenues. Uncertainty about the effect of new European data protection meant some clients opted to delay campaigns. These factors, and the currency effects, could reverse in the next half of the year. Mr Sadoun certainly seems confident about meeting 2020 targets. These include operating margins rising half a percentage point annually. He has delivered so far. Operating profitability increased by 40 basis points in the first half of the year.The Publicis share price has gone nowhere in the past 18 months. But those of both WPP and Omnicom have performed far worse. Publicis can regain its bloom. Mr Sadoun deserves another six months to prove it.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters.
3;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2018-04-18T04:00:29Z;Advertising’s acquisition carousel is slowing;Sorrell’s departure from WPP makes it harder for creative entrepreneurs to get rich;"Martin Sorrell has resigned from WPP, the marketing group that he founded in 1985, leaving behind many wealthy executives. His largesse is reflected in the 400 companies that WPP lists as subsidiaries, the 43 small agencies that it bought last year alone, and the £13bn of goodwill on WPP’s balance sheet.Wire and Plastic Products, the company he used for the longest acquisition spree in advertising, was not in the business itself. Sir Martin used it to buy everything from J Walter Thompson to Young & Rubicam and to defy the broader trend against holding companies. WPP held any agency going, apart from those acquired by Publicis, Omnicom and other rivals.Many people in advertising regard themselves as creative — there are “creative data analysts, creative media buyers, creative media planners,” Sir Martin explained recently. But they are most creative at rewarding themselves by founding boutique agencies, selling to WPP and others, waiting a few years until their acquisition earn-outs expire, and then starting again.The creative carousel paid for a lot of houses, boats and divorces; Sir Martin did well himself, taking home £48m in 2016 and owning about 2 per cent of WPP. His resignation places the process in peril. WPP is not alone in suffering from the industry downturn; the carousel is slowing and may grind to a halt.That drags on the entire “creative economy” — the ecosystem of little marketing, media, design, public relations and technology companies that have flourished in service sector economies. Ninety per cent of creative businesses in the UK employ five or fewer people — the partners and a couple of others — and many would like to be taken out by an acquirer.It worked like this. Imagine that you and a partner founded an advertising and public relations business that did well and made annual profits of £3m. You could persevere, counting on continued growth and paying yourselves well in cash and dividends, or you could sell to a company such as WPP. You were entrepreneurial by nature but even risk-takers crave some security.The holding group offered £20m for the business, a third of it immediately and the rest paid over four years for hitting targets. Each partner’s £10m capital gain was taxed at 10 per cent in the UK under the entrepreneurs’ relief scheme. This meant two post-tax payouts of £9m, compared with remaining independent and paying 40 per cent or more on income.You gained tax-efficient wealth by selling the business at seven times its earnings, and the holding company raised its value by more than the acquisition price because it traded at double that multiple until recently. When the earn-outs expired, you could demand more money to stay, or leave and start another boutique.It hardly made you into Mark Zuckerberg but it made you comfortable and one can see from the sheer number of companies that WPP and the rest acquired that it appealed. “A lot of this is basically tax arbitrage,” observes one beneficiary of the carousel. The financial details differ by country, but lower capital gains tax rates and incentives for entrepreneurs are common.I do not begrudge them their liquidity events. Being an entrepreneur is harder and riskier than those watching from the sidelines tend to imagine, and houses are expensive in cities where marketing types cluster. The process has driven economic activity in London, New York, Paris and the like.But it requires there to be enough money to finance an ecosystem of high margin businesses, all contributing a small slice of innovation to the whole. That means a lot of intermediaries to support. It is now threatened, both by internet companies led by Google and Facebook controlling the bulk of digital advertising and by big clients cutting their marketing budgets.Sorrell’s departure makes it harder for founders of advertising agencies to become richSir Martin insisted before his departure that WPP’s woes were due more to the latter than the former: it faced a cyclical, not a secular squeeze. In the end, it comes to the same thing. When Marc Pritchard, Procter & Gamble’s chief brand officer, complained recently that creativity was “surrounded by excess management, buildings and overhead,” he described the carousel.This recalls the go-go years of the music industry, before a wave of piracy crimped the high life for hundreds of labels and the tastemakers who wielded influence over bands. Working in “artists and repertoire” was a secondary form of creativity but a primary source of wealth creation.A & R has flatlined — the industry estimates that the sum it invests in discovering and developing bands grew only marginally to $2.8bn between 2011 and 2015. There lies the future of marketing agencies: a prolonged squeeze on the fixers in the middle.Advertising’s entrepreneurs will no doubt apply their creative minds to finding other acquirers. Consulting firms such as Accenture are flocking into the business and Sir Martin noted last month that some US digital agencies were on sale for prices that even he would not pay. But his departure after three decades at WPP removes the biggest media buyer of all.john.gapper@ft.com"
4;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2018-04-17T12:40:13Z;Omnicom holds steady in tough market for advertising groups;;Media group Omnicom eked out revenue growth in the opening months of this year, despite a tough market for advertisers.While global heavy-hitter WPP struggles with shifting trends among clients and digital disruption, as well as the abrupt departure of its chief executive Martin Sorrell, US-listed Omnicom said on Tuesday that its revenues crept up 1.2 per cent on the year to $3.63bn, which managed to squeak past analyst expectations by just $2m. On an organic basis, revenue was up 2.4 per cent year on year. The company noted it received a positive impact from foreign exchange moves, while a switch to a new reporting method was a negative.Profits rose 9.2 per cent year-on-year to $264.1m in the three months ended March 31, which was ahead of the median of $248.3m forecast in a Thomson Reuters survey. Diluted net earnings per share rose 12 cents to $1.14 from a year earlier and 4 cents ahead of forecasts.The group gave little indication in its earnings statement of the outlook for the year ahead, which is of increased interest to investors after a growing number of consumer brands have flagged moving more of their marketing in-house and rival recently said it faced flat organic growth this year.The company saw revenue rise year-on-year across most of its geographic segments, with the exception of its home market of North America, which accounts for more than half of global sales. There, revenues dropped by 7.2 per cent on a reported basis, or down 0.1 per cent in organic terms.Revenue from advertising, which also represents just over half the total among Omnicom’s various disciplines, was down 1.4 per cent year-on-year in reported terms, but up 1.6 per cent on an organic basis.In its 2017 annual report, released in February, Omnicom said it expected revenue to “increase modestly” in 2018.Earlier on Tuesday, Moody’s downgraded its outlook for rival WPP, although it affirmed the company’s Baa2 credit rating. The ratings agency said it noted “the longer-term challenges that WPP and the overall advertising agencies sector is facing, including reduced budgets from some of the largest advertisers, increased competition from consulting firms and smaller ad agencies and data-driven marketing companies as well as the long-term risk of further disintermediation from large tech companies.”Omnicom shares were down 0.9 per cent in pre-market trade on the Nasdaq, but are up 1.7 per cent so far in 2018.
5;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2018-04-16T17:33:02Z;The sudden exit of ad chief Martin Sorrell raises big questions;His departure from WPP, the company he built, demands more explanation;"Over 33 years, Martin Sorrell turned Wire and Plastic Products, a maker of shopping baskets, into an advertising company with a market value of £14bn and 200,000 employees. It is a great success story of British business.That Sir Martin has resigned from WPP after a whistleblower complaint concerning his personal conduct and use of company funds — the nature of which has not been revealed — may seem like a sorry denouement. This is, however, a bigger story than just a chief executive leaving amid accusations of misbehaviour. It involves seismic changes in the advertising industry, and big questions about the governance of companies that are closely identified with their founder/leaders.So far, the WPP board has shared few of the details with shareholders. This will have to change.It is hard to imagine that Sir Martin would be leaving the company if it were leaping from strength to strength. But it is, instead, under acute pressure. The shares have lost more than a third of their value in the past year. In 2017, like-for-like revenue fell slightly; sales growth has been decelerating for three years. The company, along with other publicly traded advertising holding companies, have become a favourite target for short sellers.In the minds of many, the pressure on the advertising conglomerates (WPP also has market research and PR divisions) is due to the rise of digital advertising. Facebook and Google capture most of the profit to be had from online advertising.But they are only part of the problem. The big consumer goods companies, from Procter & Gamble to Unilever to Nestlé, are under pressure from activists and leaner competitors. They are cutting spending, and looking at advertising costs in particular. P&G, the world’s largest advertiser, has cut $750m from its external advertising spending over the past three years, more than 5 per cent of the total, and it is not finished cutting yet. It says that it once worked with 6,000 agencies, now works with 2,500, and aims to cut that figure in half.This, in turn, raises questions about the business strategy that Sir Martin has built into WPP. It is a confederation of companies, where several might bid for a single customer’s business, and where several, with different specialities, might serve a single client. Clients seeking simplicity and efficiency may be tiring of this approach. This is one reason for the speculation that, with its leading light gone, WPP may be broken up, with its data analytics and PR businesses going first.Many analysts suggest that a break-up of WPP could increase the value of the company, by eliminating its “conglomerate discount”. The shares trade at a lower valuation than peers Publicis and Omnicom. Why, then, has the news of Sir Martin’s departure driven the shares down as much as 7 per cent? Part of the answer, surely, is that something deeply consequential has happened at the company and investors have been told essentially nothing. There is no way for holders of the stock to know whether the board handled the whistleblower investigation well or badly, or if Mr Sorrell’s behaviour made his departure inevitable eventually.Perhaps more complete disclosure would be embarrassing to the company. Too bad: when a public company is built around the vision and leadership of one man, and that man suddenly departs, saying nothing is not an option. It is obviously a material event.Silence is also, in the long run, terrible for a corporate reputation. A company that dispenses public relations advice should know as much."
6;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2018-03-07T17:48:40Z;Ad agency shares fall as marketers plan further spending cuts;WPP, Publicis, Omnicom and Interpublic all hit a day after P&G signals more savings;Shares in the world’s biggest advertising companies fell on Wednesday as concerns over how big brands are changing their marketing spending continued to reverberate across the industry.WPP slid almost 4 per cent, while Publicis, Omnicom and Interpublic Group each down almost 2 per cent by late afternoon London time.The share price moves came a day after Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer at Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest advertiser, told the Financial Times that the company would “take back control” of its marketing by moving more of it in-house.Advertising agencies are under pressure on a number of fronts, dragging down growth to its slowest pace since the financial crisis.One key issue is moves by high-spending clients to trim their spending and rethink their relationships with them. They have called on advertising groups to simplify their structures, be more transparent with their billing and deliver more efficient digital campaigns.P&G has cut its agency and commercial production spending by $750m in the past three years and plans to increase that figure to $1.2bn by 2021.Mr Pritchard said that after cutting its roster of agencies from 6,000 to 2,500, he sees room to reduce that by another 50 per cent.That would be a blow to the big advertising holding companies, whose businesses are built around winning big shares of marketing budgets.Many consumer goods groups are under pressure from activist investors to cut costs, with several adopting zero-based budgeting, whereby all expenses must be justified every year.Advertising groups are also grappling with technological changes, as brands increasingly work directly with platforms such as Facebook and Google, which together account for more than 80 per cent of digital advertising revenues. At the same time, professional services firms, such as Deloitte and Accenture, have become competitors by creating marketing for their clients.WPP and Publicis are both undertaking wide-ranging restructurings to adapt their business models to clients’ needs.Global organic growth at WPP, Publicis, Omnicom, Interpublic and Vivendi’s Havas division slowed to 1 per cent last year from 3 per cent in 2016 and 4 per cent in 2015, according to Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research Group.“The trends causing deceleration are real, and the degree to which they persist will impact longer-term growth expectations,” he wrote in a note this week.WPP, the owner of Ogilvy & Mather, Group M and J Walter Thompson, has led losses over the past 12 months, shedding 19 per cent as it issued two sales warnings, reported a drop in 2017 revenues and said challenging conditions would continue in 2018 and beyond.
7;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2017-07-25T18:11:24Z;Interpublic blames political uncertainty for profit woes;Advertising group says confusion over policy and regulation hurts customer spending;Interpublic Group became the latest advertising company to warn that political uncertainty in the US is causing big marketers to hold back on spending.The New York-based advertising group missed Wall Street’s forecasts for second-quarter earnings and revenue on Tuesday.“Our results in the quarter reflect the fact that macro uncertainty and political gridlock are affecting spend, particularly in the US with clients demonstrating caution in terms of releasing budgets,” said Michael Roth, Interpublic chief executive, on a call with investors.However, he added: “We don’t see these as indicators of a broad-based economic downturn . . . This is not 2008 or anything like that.”His comments echoed those of John Wren, chief executive of rival Omnicom, who last week also blamed Washington “gridlock” for dampening spending. Lack of “clarity” on regulation, tax policy and healthcare costs “causes many companies to pause in terms of the investments that they’re trying to make, and advertising and marketing is part of what suffers”, Mr Wren said.Interpublic shares fell as much as 15 per cent in morning trading in New York, but recovered somewhat to trade down 12 per cent at $22.45 in the early afternoon.Ad spending has slowed this year, most notably in North America, putting the world’s “big four” advertising groups on the back foot. As well as political uncertainty, they are wrestling with cost cuts by some of their biggest clients and increased competition from Silicon Valley’s digital disrupters.Mr Roth said Interpublic was hit by weaker spending by big consumer goods companies, which took a toll of nearly 1 per cent on revenue growth. “We think that our clients are overreacting, frankly, in their cuts,” he said, adding that some clients have said they will spend more in the second half of the year.One of Interpublic’s biggest clients is Unilever, the maker of Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise, which is overhauling its advertising and marketing strategy as part of wide-ranging cost reductions. Unilever has vowed to produce 30 per cent fewer ads, and last week said it had reduced the fees it pays to agencies by 17 per cent in the first six months of this year.Mr Roth also pointed to weaker spending in telecoms and tech and financial services in a quarter when it lost business from Sprint, USAA and TD Bank.Interpublic’s revenue fell 1.7 per cent to $1.88bn in the second quarter from a year ago. Organic revenue, the industry’s standard measure, rose 0.4 per cent. Net income dropped 40 per cent to $94.7m, or 24 cents a share, from $156.7m, or 38 cents a share. Analysts had expected earnings of 35 cents a share on revenue of $1.95bn, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.By comparison, Omnicom reported 3.5 per cent organic revenue growth, although top-line revenue declined 2.5 per cent to $3.79bn. Publicis saw organic growth of 0.8 per cent in the quarter.In the US, where Interpublic generates 60 per cent of its revenue, sales dipped 0.7 per cent to $1.16bn. International revenue was down 3.3 per cent to $724bn.The company said it now expected full-year organic growth to come in at the bottom of its projected range of 3 to 4 per cent.Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research, said the second-quarter organic growth was “surprisingly weak” and reduced his year-end price target for the stock to $24 from $25.
8;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2017-04-11T17:30:30Z;Omnicom offloads minority stake in Talon Outdoor;Mayfair Equity Partners takes 17.5% share in outdoor advertising agency;Omnicom has sold its minority stake in Talon Outdoor, the UK out-of-home media-buying agency, to Mayfair Equity Partners, the private equity firm.Although Omnicom declined to comment on the identity of the buyer, people with knowledge of the deal confirmed that Mayfair Equity Partners had bought the 17.5 per cent stake. Further details of the deal were not disclosed.Omnicom’s exit comes as the company is reviewing its investments across its businesses. John Wren, chief executive, told analysts in February that “a likely result for 2017 is we expect disposition revenue in excess of accretive revenue.”Omnicom’s buying arm, Omnicom Media Group, bought into Talon in 2013, as it moved its UK outdoor media buying business, with an estimated spend of £140m a year at the time, to the company.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningWhile other areas of the advertising industry have been shaken up by the rapid growth of the internet and social media, outdoor has remained a steady and attractive source of revenue growth for the big global ad agencies.According to a report by Group M, the WPP-owned media buying agency, outdoor advertising grew by 4 per cent in the UK last year and by 5.1 per cent globally.Other outdoor agencies have also attracted private equity investment in recent times with Bain Capital and Thomas H Lee Partners owning Clear Channel, Platinum Equity controlling Exterion Media and Searchlight capital controlling Ocean Outdoor.
9;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
10;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2017-03-17T21:28:55Z;YouTube revenues under threat over ads alongside extremist videos;Havas joins British government in pulling ad spending from Google and YouTube in UK;Havas, the French media agency, has joined the British government in pulling all of its digital ad spending from Google and YouTube in the UK, after it was revealed that government and corporate advertisements were being displayed alongside videos that advocate extremism. Havas, one of the world’s largest marketing groups, spends about £175m on digital advertising in the UK annually. It said it was also considering a global freeze on YouTube and Google ads. The UK government has also stopped its YouTube spending, which is part of a £60m annual budget for digital advertising, until the problem is resolved. Google has already apologised publicly for the problem, first reported by The Times, which resulted in advertising from the Home Office, the BBC and Transport for London displayed next to hate-inciting and homophobic videos. Havas, whose clients include O2, the telecoms group, the BBC and Royal Mail, said it pulled its ads because Google was “unable to provide specific reassurances . . . that their video or display content is classified [as acceptable] either quickly enough or with the correct filters”.Google said it would change both its technology and its policies to give more control to advertisers on its platforms. Currently it flags and then reviews questionable content, and deals with about 200,000 flags a day. The company says 98 per cent of those are reviewed within 24 hours.“With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right,” said Ronan Harris, Google UK’s managing director. “In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetisation policies. We promptly remove the ads in those instances, but we know we can and must do more.”Group M, part of the world’s biggest advertising group WPP, said it was monitoring the response from its clients before deciding whether to follow suit. But Rob Norman, chief digital officer for Group M, added that Google’s response to the crisis was “not appropriate”.“Google should make it public that this is a flaw in their technology,” said Mr Norman. £20mUK government’s annual spend on automated advertisingSir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, added: “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.”Omnicom, the US advertising group, said it was working with clients “on an individual basis to address the immediate situation” but added that “there needs to be a sustainable solution”.It continued: “We are very specific about what is and what is not an acceptable environment for our clients — this is not open to interpretation. Google offers highly relevant solutions for many marketers, but it must effectively manage its process to maintain advertiser confidence.”Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp, who has been a critic of the digital advertising market, said that “advertisers need to go back to basics to protect their brands from serious damage and to protect themselves from being involved in potentially criminal activity, whether it be supporting extremist groups or funding hardcore pornography”. The UK government, along with a handful of businesses, including the Guardian newspaper and L’Oréal, have frozen their Google advertising accounts after their ads appeared alongside websites run by hate preachers, anti-Semites and white nationalists. “We have placed a temporary restriction on our YouTube advertising pending reassurances from Google that government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way,” a government spokesperson said.Later on Friday, Google representatives were “summoned” to the Cabinet Office. “It is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content — and that message was conveyed very clearly to Google,” the government spokesperson said.In May last year, the Financial Times revealed that Muhammad Jibril Abdul Rahman, an Islamist extremist accused of funding the 2009 Jakarta suicide bombings, had been selling advertising space on his website to international brands including Citigroup, IBM and Microsoft using a service provided by Google. After being contacted by the FT, Google cancelled the account and the advertisers asked to be removed from the site. However, ads for big western brands continued to appear on the site through other intermediaries at the time.Additional reporting by Shannon Bond in New York
11;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2017-02-02T05:01:23Z;Advertising’s old guard face new brand of change;Publicis reshuffle raises questions about succession at WPP, Omnicom and IPG;"A generational changing of the guard at the world’s biggest and most powerful marketing agencies began last week after the head of France’s Publicis, Maurice Lévy, finally bowed out as chief executive after three decades at the helm.Mr Lévy is one of a small clique of rival advertising executives to have steered the advertising world through its transition from Mad Men-like decades of boozy creativity to take in digital disruption from the ad-blocking, algorithms and big data of recent years.Mr Lévy, who will become chairman of the supervisory board of Publicis, and rivals Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP, John Wren at Omnicom and Michael Roth at Interpublic boast a combined total of 92 years at the top. Between them, and their many satellite agencies around the world, they have a strong claim to have shaped what people eat, watch and wear.David Kershaw, who has run London agency M&C Saatchi since 1994, says Mr Lévy’s move has renewed the focus on what rivals do next when it comes to leadership.“Maurice Lévy’s departure was easy to predict,” he says. “It’s much harder to see at WPP but it will inevitably mean more questions will be asked about other companies.”The advertising industry has changed fundamentally during their tenures, and not just in the end of the long lunches that used to define the working day until relatively recently.As technology upends the buying and selling of advertising, there are new questions facing the big four communications groups — and they are likely to be settled not in London’s Soho or on Madison Avenue in New York but in Silicon Valley.Technology is a new tool for creative people. If you’re a painter, it’s like you’re discovering new coloursDigital advertising is growing much faster than spending on television, which is largely flat around the world. In the UK, digital advertising grew from £224m in 2000 to an estimated £10bn in 2016 — half of the total UK spend on advertising, according to the Advertising Association and Warc Expenditure.In the US, digital spending in the third quarter of 2016 hit $17.6bn, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau. But about two-thirds of this total is going to two companies: Google and Facebook.“You have two dominant companies — Facebook and Google — and that will cause extraordinary transformation in advertising going forward,” says Claire Enders, head of media research firm Enders.As an example of the growing power of the online groups, WPP, the world’s largest advertising agency, says that in 2016 it spent approximately $5bn on advertising for its clients with Google, the company’s number one platform by spend.In second place were two companies controlled by Rupert Murdoch — 21st Century Fox and News Corp — with $2.5bn. Facebook was next with $1.7bn.The increasing market power of Google and Facebook has led some media executives to ask whether brands would be better served by dealing directly with the technology companies — and cutting out the agencies altogether.“The concern for some investors is that, in a world where effectively the purchase of advertising is becoming automated, dealing directly with an online group might be better for the client,” says Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst with Citi.The dominance of Google and Facebook could have big implications for media buying groups — the companies that buy ad space on behalf of clients. But the two Silicon Valley companies have shown no sign yet of encroaching into the other side of the ad industry: creating the campaigns that persuade consumers to dip into their wallets.“There is no substitute for brilliant, bold creativity,” says Neil Hughston, chief executive of Duke, an independent agency that has worked for Rolls-Royce and Britain’s Imperial War Museum.Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer at P&G, used a speech at this week’s IAB annual leadership meeting to call for improvements in digital advertising practices, describing some marketing online as “crappy”. His words give strength to the belief that there will always be a central role for creative talent and marketing savvy.Yannick Bolloré, chairman and chief executive of France’s Havas Group, argues that technology has opened up creative opportunities because platforms such as Facebook, Snap and Instagram represent new avenues to bring creative content to consumers.“Technology is a new tool for creative people. If you’re a painter, it’s like you’re discovering new colours. You have a bigger palette,” says Mr Bolloré.This bigger palette may mean that the next generation of industry leader will need a different set of tools, however. Sir Martin, Mr Wren and Mr Roth all come from an accountancy or management consultancy background — perfect for a period characterised by agency acquisitions and deal making.At Publicis the responsibility for grappling with the industry’s digital future now rests with Arthur Sadoun, who is succeeding Mr Levy, having previously headed its creative agencies.The company’s rivals have yet to make public any future plans, even if questions are being asked among investors and analysts.At WPP, in particular, succession is a question that has dogged Sir Martin Sorrell for almost a decade. At 71 and with the added challenge of a new baby to deal with, he has yet to show any sign of slowing down. “I will carry on as long as I can or as long as people will have me,” he once told the FT.The big four holding companies face other challenges beyond succession and digital disruption. An investigation last year by the US-based Association of National Advertisers alleged that US agencies were using “non-transparent” business practices to enrich themselves on the back of their clients’ advertising budgets.Each of the big four holding companies have also been contacted by the US Department of Justice in connection with an investigation into bidding for video production contracts.Mr Pritchard of P&G also used his speech this week to call on the marketing industry to tackle transparency.“We have an antiquated media buying and selling system that was clearly not built for this technology revolution,” he said. “We have a media supply chain that is murky at best and fraudulent at worst.”Whoever succeeds the current generation of advertising leaders, they will have to adapt to a rapidly changing advertising world. And yet for all the digital mayhem, creativity is still key. “What will remain as indispensable are the ideas,” Mr Levy told the Financial Times last week. “The sparkle of an idea that the brain and the heart can generate.”In the 32 years since Sir Martin Sorrell, 71, first invested in the shopping basket company Wire and Plastic Products he has turned the advertising upstart into the world’s largest media and communications conglomerate. With annual revenues of £12bn and a market capitalisation of £23.6bn, WPP now has 200,000 employees in 113 countries around the world and Sir Martin has become one of the UK’s best known — and best paid — chief executives. From his first (hostile) acquisition of J Walter Thompson in 1987 to the purchases of the globe’s biggest media buying agency GroupM and creative networks such as Ogilvy and Mather, WPP has been at the centre of the advertising industry’s two decades long drive for consolidation and scale.The French-Moroccan businessman who transformed Publicis from a French leader to the third-largest advertising agency in the world by revenues will step down as chief executive in May to become chairman of the supervisory board. Although a proposed $35bn megamerger between Publicis and Omnicom eluded him, Mr Lévy, 74, who began his 45-year career at Publicis as computer programmer, is credited with recognising early the value of digital. In three decades of aggressive dealmaking since Mr Lévy took over as chief executive in 1987, Publicis has grown from making €220m in revenues to €9.6bn in 2015, and doubling revenues in the past decade alone.Michael Roth, IPGAs highly acquisitive rivals have left the advertising market increasingly concentrated, Interpublic — the fourth largest of the ‘big four’ agencies — has been tipped as a target. However Michael Roth, chief executive since 2005, has shied away from selling, saying the plan for IPG was “keeping our heads down and delivering”. The bet has paid off: under Mr Roth, 71, IPG has powered a turnround in fortunes, posting 6 per cent revenue growth in 2015, outpacing its competitors. However, sales growth at IPG slowed last year, which Mr Roth, a Brooklyn native, attributes to uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the macroeconomy.As fierce competition has roared between the heads of rival networks, Omnicom chief executive John Wren has stayed on the sidelines. Mr Wren, a 64-year-old former accountant from Brooklyn who took the helm in 1997, has kept a low profile in an industry awash with colourful personalities until, in 2014, coming close to striking a $35bn merger with Publicis that would have put him in pole position to succeed Maurice Lévy. He said after the deal collapsed that it was “never about me or my ego”, but about Omnicom’s 70,000 employees. Instead, Mr Wren has continued to quietly steer the New York-based agency, which makes $15bn in revenues a year, into the digital era, emphasising data and analytics as more advertising migrates online.————–Further readingSpecial report: The Business of Marketing

12;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2016-12-16T20:23:03Z;Omnicom drawn in to DoJ advertising probe;US agency joins Interpublic in being contacted about video production for clients;Omnicom and Publicis have been contacted by the US Department of Justice in connection with its investigation into video production practices, following a probe into Interpublic, a rival advertising agency, last week.In a statement on Friday, Omnicom said two of its subsidiaries received subpoenas from the DoJ’s Antitrust Division “concerning its ongoing investigation of video production and post-production practices in the advertising industry”.Publicis said one of its subsidiaries received a subpoena on December 14.This investigation is looking at whether large advertising agencies have manipulated the bidding process for clients’ video production work, to favour their in-house teams, rather than external companies. Agencies have been increasingly moving production and post-production work for their clients in-house, instead of hiring independent providers.Last week, Interpublic said the DoJ had asked one of its standalone US agencies for documents regarding its video production.News of the probe comes amid growing concern over the transparency of the advertising industry, with big brands pushing for greater clarity over how their money is spent by groups such as Omnicom, Publicis and Interpublic.Some marketing clients in the UK and the US have questioned whether agencies are spending their money but then taking undisclosed “rebates” from media companies that are not passed back to them.These tensions have heightened as technology transforms the way digital media is bought and served. It is now a highly concentrated market, in which six agency holding companies — WPP, Publicis, Omnicom, IPG, Dentsu-Aegis and Havas — control the vast majority of global companies’ media spending.This summer, the Association of National Advertisers — a trade body that represents brands such as Apple and Unilever — funded an investigation that found some agencies used a series of “non-transparent” business practices to boost their profits at the expense of clients.Bob Liodice, chief executive of the ANA, called the DoJ investigation of Interpublic “very disturbing”.“This new development raises even more concerns about trust between advertisers and their agencies,” he said.In April ISBA, the trade body for advertisers in the UK, sent its members a standard contract designed to protect their interests when negotiating deals with media agencies — the first time it has taken such a step in more than a decade.Shares in Omnicom were down 2.1 per cent to $86.18 on Friday, while peers Publicis and Interpublic were down 0.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively, underperforming the broader market.

14;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2016-08-23T04:30:27Z;Why French businessmen dress better;Classic smart look gives them an edge on UK counterparts, reflects Adam Thomson;"For moments during my three years in Paris, I have tried to understand what lies behind France’s male business dress code — from the shakers at the top of the CAC 40 through mid-tier executives all the way down to the suited office workers I see daily on the street.For a Londoner, this is not necessarily easy. Beyond the tailoring of Savile Row, and a heritage in weaving and shoemaking, it is no secret that most English people do not play in the same dress league as their French counterparts.For this Londoner, the task is arguably harder still: for years, I would happily wear the hand-me-down shirts of my 6’4” stepfather even though I’m only 5’ 9”. During my years in Mexico, a bowling addiction sparked a passion for short-sleeved rayon shirts that only died after Ann, now my wife, said that it was her or the wardrobe. After this, it should be clear why I don’t dare to write about female business dress in France.I first noticed how well French male business leaders dress in 2013 when I watched Maurice Lévy, the Publicis chief executive, unveil the ultimately doomed $35bn merger plan between his advertising group and US rival Omnicom.Mr Lévy, a silver-haired industry veteran, strode out on to Publicis’s manicured rooftop garden overlooking the Arc de Triomphe wearing a black suit, crisp white shirt and a black tie. It was understated but elegant and brimming with restrained confidence. In short, it looked sharp.In other circumstances, Omnicom’s John Wren would have looked fine. But next to Mr Lévy, his dark suit with what looked like blue and brown alternating pinstripe came a clear second. Add the blue shirt and gold tie, and you could argue the case for a distant second.The Lévy black-white-black combo, or near-black suit with dark tie, is a classic for businessmen in France, as it is for the country’s male politicians and even for television news presenters.One reason, according to a French colleague at the Paris bureau of the Financial Times, is that it avoids the faux pas of allowing yourself to be judged by the clothes you wear. “In France, it is not the objective to stand out,” he explains. “The idea is to express good dress sense through detail but not through style. You do not want to take that sort of risk.”Equally, he says, you need to convey elegance, which a white shirt does in spades. “A blue shirt will never look as elegant as a white shirt,” he states bluntly.By and large, English people do not know any of this. What constitutes good dress sense is more flexible on the island and it leaves plenty of room for flamboyance: pink shirts are commonplace in London; so are striped shirts with solid-colour collars and cuffs. Such an approach in formal Paris could easily derail an otherwise promising career, my colleague says. “You don’t want to be remembered for what you wear.”Yet I have realised that the biggest difference between French and English men when it comes to business attire is how clothes fit.In Paris, unlike in London, suit jackets invariably hug the shoulders while the body is snug. Remove the jacket of a Parisian businessman, and you will probably see tailored cotton that fits close to the body. Repeat the experiment with an English businessman and the chances are you will discover a spinnaker billowing under his arms. By French standards, even the increasingly popular slim-fit shirt in the UK is roomy.Why is this? Theories abound but mine has to do with the fact that English children are subjected to the regime of wearing school uniforms while the French are not.Choosing what to wear every day for school, albeit under the supervision of parents, makes the French more aware of clothes, combinations and, in particular, fit — all from an early age. It also creates significant peer pressure to look your best.Dressed in a standard uniform, you are never going to look good so there is no point in trying. Everyone is the same, which removes the competition factor.But the biggest effect of the school uniform is that it tends to make English kids used to wearing clothes that are either way too big, as parents try to get value for money by buying on the large side, or way too small, as those same parents try to maximise a blazer’s life.I remember my mother sewing brown leather patches to the elbows of my uniform (a hideous black and maroon-striped blazer) even when I had long grown out of it. Children live out this same experience up and down the country, whether from private school or state school. Little wonder that the average English adult is clueless in this area.So where does all of this leave the Englishman while living and working in Parisian business circles?For those who lack commanding French and a fluid knowledge of local culture, adopting the full-on French style would be as serious a mistake as the US tourist who dons a kilt and sporran on that trip to discover the birthplace of his great, great, great uncle. So play it safe, rein in the colours and, above all, wear a suit that fits."
15;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2016-07-20T14:02:07Z;Publicis expecting ‘more difficult’ third quarter;;Publicis has cited Britain’s vote to leave the EU, as well as “violent events” in the US, France and Turkey, as it described an uncertain environment that could potentially affect advertisers’ appetite to spend.The Paris-based advertising group said it is expecting a “more difficult third quarter” despite a half year that its chairman and chief executive described as ending “very satisfactorily”. The company lost a number of large accounts in the US last year, including Procter & Gamble, which is expected to have a knock-on effect in the third quarter.The group on Thursday said organic revenues grew 2.7 per cent in the second quarter – in line with expectations – although growth on a reported basis was a rather more lacklustre 0.9 per cent to €2.46bn. Over the first half as a whole, revenue rose 2.8 per cent on an organic basis.The French company, which counts Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett among its brands, improved operating margins by 5.1 per cent year over year in the first half as it continued to carry out restructuring efforts hatched in the wake of a failed merger with US rival Omnicom.Maurice Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Publicis, said:The transformation process launched in December 2015 has completely changed our approach to communications and our understanding of the way our clients work in taking on the challenges of the future. This transformation means we can anticipate our clients’ expectations with an “end-to-end” offering that provides them with full access to the Groupe’s resources including our skills in consulting and technology. This initiative was very well received by our clients as it is original, modern and, most importantly, it is a comprehensive solution to the challenges they face. We are beginning to reap the benefits of this new approach.Analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux said before today’s results that the company risks further headwinds in Latin America from near-term political and economic volatility in the region’s key Brazil and Mexico markets. The research group also expressed long-term concerns about the effect of post-Brexit fallout in the ad group’s UK and EU markets.On Brexit, Publicis said:The IMF’s recent announcements underscore the uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment, on top of geopolitical risks. The result of the “Brexit” referendum on June 23, 2016 increases anxiety with respect to the impact of the exit out of Europe could have on the UK but more broadly on to Europe overall. The violent events in the US, France and Turkey add to those uncertainties.Despite this environment and the difficulties in certain sectors of the economy, the good results achieved by Publicis Groupe confirm its previous guidance of improved financial indicators across the board: revenue, operating margin, adjusted diluted EPS, and dividend payout, even though we expect a more difficult 3rd quarter.Shares of Publicis are up 4.5 per cent this year to date while stock in Omnicom has gained 10.3 per cent.
16;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2016-06-07T17:41:44Z;US ad agencies accused of secret deals with media companies;Investigation funded by brands says groups use ‘non-transparent’ methods to make money from clients;US advertising agencies are boosting their profits at the expense of clients by cutting secret deals with media companies, according to an investigation funded by big American brands.The Association of National Advertisers, whose members include Apple, Procter & Gamble and Unilever, said its investigators had found “pervasive” evidence that agencies are taking cash rebates from media companies without their clients’ knowledge.The ANA alleged agencies used a series of “non-transparent” business practices to enrich themselves on the back of their clients’ advertising budgets.The trade body, whose members collectively spend $250bn a year on marketing communications, said the investigation had revealed “a fundamental disconnect in the advertising industry regarding the basic nature of the advertiser-agency relationship”.The ANA did not name which agencies or holding companies were responsible for the various practices described in the report. But the claims are likely to stoke tensions between advertisers and their media agencies.The global media-buying market is dominated by six agency holding companies: WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, IPG, Dentsu Aegis and Havas.Brian Wieser, equity analyst at Pivotal Research, said: “The findings are generally damning of the whole industry, which will probably contribute towards negative sentiment towards the whole group.”While rebates are common in the advertising sector in many countries, the US had long been considered a “clean” market in which agencies made money exclusively from fees paid by their clients.Accepting hidden rebates creates an inherent conflict of interest for agencies, as it encourages them to work with media companies that pay the most rather than those that would best serve the advertiser.The American Association of Advertising Agencies, which represents all the agency holding companies, criticised the report as “anonymous, inconclusive, and one-sided”. It added that “this does nothing to foster a productive conversation or to move our industry forward”.The findings are generally damning of the whole industryAll six agency holding companies have in the past denied any improper behaviour and have said they operate within the bounds of their client contracts.Publicis said that despite it urging the ANA “to include names and sources in its report, the document hides behind suspicions and anonymity rather than encouraging real accountability”.“The unsubstantiated claims are already causing serious damage to the reputation of the industry and endangering the most valuable component of the agency-advertiser relationship: trust.”WPP’s media investment management unit GroupM said: “The report should not be allowed to tarnish the entire industry, nor every company in it. GroupM does not seek, nor accept rebates or hidden revenues in any form from media partners in the US.”The seven-month investigation was conducted by K2 Intelligence, a consultancy founded by Jeremy and Jules Kroll which counts former FBI agents among its employees.The study stated that “non-transparent business practices” were prevalent across digital, print, outdoor and television media, and that such practices were known of and mandated by senior executives at agencies and their holding companies.This does nothing to foster a productive conversation or to move our industry forwardThe findings were said to be based on documentary evidence and 150 confidential interviews. The ANA said that five of the six agency holding companies declined requests to make any of their current executives available to be interviewed.The ANA has asked Firm Decisions, the media auditor that is part of Aim-quoted group Ebiquity, to draw up a list of recommendations for advertisers about how to protect their ad budgets.Mr Wieser of Pivotal Research said that “the low and worsening levels of trust between marketers and agencies will likely contribute towards more aggressive fee-squeezing efforts” by marketers.Media buying is the most profitable activity for marketing services groups such as WPP, and for years has been their main source of growth.The ANA’s revelations come at a time of rapid change in the media and advertising industries. The rise of the internet has led to new ways of trading media and increased complexity for marketers.In April, ISBA, the trade body for advertisers in the UK, sent its members a standard contract designed to protect their interests when negotiating deals with media agencies — the first time it has taken such a step in more than a decade. The trade body told advertisers that obtaining and enforcing wide-ranging audit rights were needed to ensure that any agency acts in their best interests.Tom Denford, chief strategy officer of advertising consultancy ID Comms, said the ANA report “will now push the issue of media right up the boardroom agenda and should be a concern to CFOs and CEOs. The pressure is now on every CMO — around the world — to ensure that they have strong terms of business with media agencies and full transparency over media buying and rebates.”
17;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2016-04-28T05:01:56Z;Big UK advertisers push agencies to be more transparent;Trade body backed by Burberry, Coca-Cola and Unilever seeks clarity on how media budgets are spent;Britain’s biggest advertisers have ramped up their fight to introduce greater transparency into how their media budgets are spent by marketing services groups such as WPP, Publicis and Omnicom.The Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, a trade body whose members spend about £10bn a year on marketing communications, warned that media agencies have increasingly been generating profits through controversial business practices that are not visible to their clients.This week, the organisation sent its 450 members — which include fashion brand Burberry, Coca-Cola and Unilever, the consumer goods group — a standard contract designed to protect their interests when negotiating deals with media agencies. This is the first time in more than a decade that ISBA has taken such a step.“We’re at a tipping point, we’ve got to do something,” said Debbie Morrison, a director at ISBA. “I don’t believe that [the media agencies] have got the best interests of their clients at heart any more.”The UK trade body’s intervention comes just six months after its counterpart in the US, the Association of National Advertisers, hired investigators who specialise in uncovering fraud and tracing hidden assets to probe the practices of media agencies.Advertisers in both the UK and the US have become increasingly concerned that agencies are making money on the back of their advertising spending, such as taking undisclosed “rebates” from media companies that are not passed back to the client.Agency practices have become more complex and opaque in recent years with the advent of new ways of trading digital media. The market has also become highly concentrated, with just six agency groups — WPP, Publicis, Omnicom, IPG, Dentsu-Aegis and Havas — controlling the vast majority of the world’s media investments.ISBA’s 51-page contract is designed to give advertisers a clear view of how their media budget is spent. One of its main aims is to remove the potential for an agency to be tempted by incentives from media owners, which could skew its decision-making.But certain clauses in the contract are likely to meet heavy resistance from media agencies — in particular, those concerning rebates and those giving the advertiser the right to send an auditor to scrutinise not just the agency but also its holding company. ISBA has told its members that obtaining and enforcing wide-ranging audit rights are needed to ensure that the agency acts in their best interests.Paul Bainsfair, director-general of the IPA, the trade body for agencies in the UK, said he had not yet seen a copy of the ISBA contract and could not comment on its content.“However, since the contract has been developed by ISBA for advertisers and solely from their perspective, it is highly likely that it will not be even-handed,” he said. “If this is the case we will not be recommending that IPA member agencies agree to use it.”ISBA’s members are under no obligation to use the contract and have been encouraged to adapt it to their needs.Graham Brown, founder of MediaSense, a consultancy that helped draft the contract, said advertisers that seek to implement the contract in its strongest form may need to pay their agency higher fees as a result.“For every action, there is a reaction,” he said. “If you’re going to close down areas where practices have been less than transparent, you’ll need to have a sensible negotiation about what is the proper revenue structure.”
18;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-12-10T18:06:03Z;Publicis loses L’Oréal US advertising account;Shift of contract to rival WPP comes less than a week after P&G blow;Publicis has lost L’Oréal as a client in North America to its arch-rival WPP, adding to the French advertising group’s woes as it embarks on a deep managerial reorganisation.L’Oréal — whose brands include Lancôme, Maybelline and Garnier — is one of the world’s biggest advertisers, and Publicis’ loss of its digital account to MEC, of the WPP group, represents a further blow to Paris-based company.It comes less than a week after Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest advertiser, shifted almost all of its North American media planning and buying business from Publicis to Omnicom, the French group’s US rival.Nadine Karp McHugh, senior vice-president of omnimedia, strategic investments and creative solutions at L’Oréal USA, said: “L’Oréal USA has selected MEC as its agency of record for integrated media planning and buying of TV, print and digital after an extensive eight-month agency review process.”She explained that MEC brought “a shared vision for the future” and said “we believe that we’ve found the perfect partner to help us co-create the future of beauty along with our media partners”.The main loser in the reshuffle was US-based Interpublic, which currently manages L’Oréal’s TV and print buying.L’Oréal’s North America digital account is worth about 0.1 per cent of group revenues, which were €7.3bn last year. But its loss comes on top of the $50m-$100m hit to revenues that Publicis is likely to suffer after failing to retain P&G’s business.This double loss comes as leading global brands such as Volkswagen and Sony undertake sweeping reviews of their media agencies this year, putting contracts worth $30bn annually up for grabs.Analysts say that, typically, $20bn out of a total of $340bn in worldwide media agency billings come up for review each year.This year’s increased scrutiny of advertising contracts has been attributed to companies’ desire to cut costs — and their mounting concerns over how their budgets are being spent by the big six global agencies: WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, Interpublic, Dentsu Aegis and Havas.Publicis’s SMG lost the P&G account, which will now shift to Omnicom Media Group with support from Dentsu Aegis’s Carat, which has been handling P&G’s Canadian business.Publicis declined to comment about the loss of the L’Oréal contract.Marla Kaplowitz, chief executive of MEC North America, said: “It was apparent from the onset that our two companies share many of the same values and ambitions for growth.”Losing the L'Oréal account comes at a tricky time for Publicis, which last week unveiled a management reorganisation to prepare for chief executive Maurice Lévy’s eventual retirement.This article has been amended since initial publication to clarify the accounts in question.
19;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-12-07T19:17:06Z;Publicis loses most P&G US accounts;Blow to French advertising group as Omnicom snaps up media buying business;Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest advertiser, is shifting almost all of its North American media planning and buying business from Publicis to Omnicom in the latest blow to the French advertising giant.P&G, which owns brands ranging from Gillette razors to Pampers nappies, spent $2.6bn on US media last year and $3.1bn in 2013, according to Kantar Media.The French group last week unveiled a management reorganisation to prepare for Maurice Lévy’s eventual retirement as chief executive. Publicis has yet to find its momentum since its plans for a $35bn merger with Omnicom fell apart last year.The loss of the account could hit Publicis’ annual revenues by $50m to $100m, said people familiar with the matter. “The psychological impact of a loss would be probably higher than the material impact on revenues and earnings,” said Claudio Aspesi, a media analyst at Bernstein.P&G is one of Publicis’ top three clients, and the Paris-based group has had its North America media buying account for at least a decade.P&G, which put its North America media business up for review in May, said the move was part of a broader effort to consolidate its relationships with advertising agencies.Publicis’ Starcom Mediavest Group has been handling US buying for P&G brands, such as Tide washing powder, Head & Shoulders shampoo and Crest toothpaste. That business will shift to Omnicom Media Group with support from Dentsu Aegis’s Carat, which has been handling P&G’s Canadian business.“We’re trying to drive out non-working spending and funnel it toward working spending going direct to the consumer,” said Marc Pritchard, P&G’s global brand officer. “Omnicom and Carat came out with what was a superior and proven performance in data analytics, planning, buying, innovation, talent and, of course, financial value. They’re going to give us better cost and spending on the services they provide and better value in the media they buy for us,” he said.P&G said its Duracell battery brand and cosmetics, fragrances, salon professional and hair colour lines would remain with SMG.Omnicom and Carat came out with what was a superior and proven performance in data analytics, planning, buying, innovation, talent and, of course, financial valueSMG said it was “proud of our partnership with P&G over the years”. It added: “We look forward to continuing to serve as one of P&G’s largest agency partners globally, spanning 41 markets around the world.”Omnicom declined to comment.The consumer goods giant’s decision caps a sweeping round of media reviews this year that has seen contracts worth $30bn annually come up for grabs from top brands including Volkswagen, L’Oréal and Sony. Analysts say about $20bn of $340bn in worldwide media agency billings comes up for review in a typical year.The scrutiny of advertising contracts has been seen as a sign of marketers’ desire to cut costs but also of mounting concerns over how their budgets are being spent by the big six global agencies: WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, Interpublic, Dentsu Aegis and Havas.The P&G switch comes in the midst of a $10bn cost-cutting programme that includes the sale of nearly 100 brands as the company fights to revive sales and defend against calls for a break-up. Some 40 per cent of P&G’s sales come from the US.Publicis guided that revenues from all the accounts it held and that were up for review would account for about 2 per cent of revenues, which were €7.3bn last year.Last week, Publicis, which counts heavyweight names such as Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett among its brands, said that it would regroup its companies into four units: communications, media, digital and consulting, and healthcare.
20;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-12-03T19:18:55Z;Publicis turns structure ‘upside down’ for long-term survival;Struggling French advertising company in biggest shake-up in more than a decade;If there were a single illustration of the upheavals the digital era has forced on advertising, it may have appeared this week as Publicis told the world that it was going to turn its organisational structure “upside down”.The Paris-based advertising group, which started life in 1926 and counts heavyweight names such as Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett among its brands, said that it would regroup its companies into four units: communications, media, digital and consulting, and healthcare.The biggest shake-up in more than a decade will also see the appointment of “chief client officers” to present leading advertisers with a single face to access all the group’s services.“Instead of looking at our organisation through the brands, we decided to look at it through client satisfaction,” says Maurice Lévy, chief executive. “We’ve put our organisation upside down to best serve our clients.”The plan also contained a hint about a central issue hanging over the group: who will eventually replace Mr Lévy. The makeover will give enhanced responsibilities to four of the group leading executives — Laura Desmond, Alan Herrick, Steve King and Arthur Sadoun, all members of Publicis’ expanded executive board — creating a potential shortlist of contenders to replace the 73-year-old after he steps aside in 2017.Few would doubt that Publicis needs a jolt. Poor organic revenue growth over the past year has left many with the feeling that the company did not have a “Plan B” after its much-touted $35bn mega-merger with US rival Omnicom broke down in May last year.In October, the share price suffered its worst one-day fall in seven years, as Publicis slashed its growth target following flat sales in September. It said that revenue in the third quarter was €2.3bn, just 0.7 per cent higher than a year earlier and well below the 2.4 per cent that investors and analysts had expected.At the same time, Publicis and its competitors — all of which reported better numbers — are battling their way through constantly shifting terrain, as the lurch to digital transforms advertising’s traditional business models.Paramount among their concerns is that digital advertising, which promises greater efficiency in targeting consumers, may spell a secular and downward shift in spending by the groups’ biggest clients.“The latest buzzword is ‘zero-based budgeting’,” says Thomas Singlehurst, a media analyst at Citi Research, referring to the idea that managers must justify budgets from scratch every year. “Suddenly, there are a big set of challenges for people who used to sit there acting as intermediaries, taking a chunk of spend that was always growing.”Most analysts have reacted positively to Publicis’s latest plans, pointing out that it follows a wider industry trend to implement a more “client-centric” model.Bank of America Merrill Lynch said: “Other agencies, such as WPP or Omnicom, are already operating under a similar structure and we believe the move will enable Publicis to be more competitive in the media buying space.”One of the most important parts of the overhaul is that the group’s media agencies, such as ZenithOptimedia and Starcom Mediavest, will be united under a single business division.Publicis’s media agencies together rank as the second largest in the world with $79bn in global billings for 2014 according to Recma, the research company, behind WPP’s GroupM at $106bn. While WPP negotiates deals with media owners from a central unit, Publicis’s agencies have historically operated with a much lower degree of co-ordination.Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research, says the former structure meant that Publicis’s units “punched below weight in the media marketplace”. The move towards greater centralisation “should lead to an improved relative position versus competitors”.Publicis is also making a significant strategic change by appointing a number of so-called chief client officers to streamline the way it deals with the biggest clients. These executives will report to Ms Desmond, who has been appointed to the new role of chief revenue officer.But the company is lagging far behind its rivals.The strategy of giving clients a single point of contact to co-ordinate activities is well established at WPP, whose chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell refers to the concept as “horizontality”.Sir Martin says of Publicis’s plans that “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery”. But he adds that a reorganisation is likely not sufficient. “Strategy is not just about strategy, it’s about execution. This is just shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic.”Publicis’s move a year ago to acquire Boston-based digital consultancy Sapient in a $3.7bn all-cash deal, added yet another layer of complexity to the group’s portfolio.“Publicis’s acquisitions have been quite ‘out-there’ conceptually,” says Mr Singlehurst. “It’s, ‘let’s look beyond the media age to where the money coming out of media is going’.”All of that leaves important questions about how quickly the company can get the new structure to start producing better growth.As for succession, Claudio Aspesi, senior media analyst at Bernstein Research, believes that announcing a shortlist just 18 months before Mr Lévy is supposed to step down could bring its own problems.“One has to wonder whether there is enough time to effectively appraise the qualities and potential of each candidate,” he says.He also points out that asking people to compete for the top job while implementing a structure designed to make them work more closely may prove an impossible task.“When human beings see a finish line, they tend to start using their elbows.”Maurice Lévy: an outsider among the business eliteMaurice Lévy has become one of the most enduring and recognised faces of French business. His tall frame, silky French accent and Cote d’Azur complexion oozes charm.But Mr Levy does not share the elite Parisian background of so many of his peers: he was born in the provincial Moroccan town of Oujda and did not graduate from one of the country’s grandes écoles, the default stepping stones for those who end up in the highest positions of power.Instead, Mr Levy studied computer science at New Jersey City University and joined his beloved Publicis in 1971 as head of information technology.He famously got his big break when he saved the company’s computer files from a blazing fire. For Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, Publicis’s founder, it made him a hero — and launched him on the fast track to the top.Since 1987, when he became chief executive, Publicis has snapped up companies through acquisitions and increasing revenues from €479m in 1993 to €7.23bn last year.The proposed merger with Omnicom in 2013 was supposed to be Mr Levy’s fairytale ending, transforming Publicis into what would have been the world’s biggest advertising group by revenue — and providing Mr Levy with a path to retirement.But when the talks broke down last year, that dream shattered and 28 years after being appointed chief executive, Mr Levy is still at the helm.
21;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-12-03T17:58:02Z;Publicis: darker purposes;Ad group’s restructuring is designed to set up the succession to Maurice Lévy;“Meantime we shall express our darker purpose. Give me the map there. Know that we have divided in three our kingdom . . .” So said Lear, setting his downfall in motion. A shame that Maurice Lévy leads his kingdom, the advertising agency Publicis, from France, and will divide it into four. It makes the analogy less tidy. For those who view big ad groups from the top down, however, it still works. In their view the boss matters hugely and the restructuring — which, like Lear’s, sets up a succession — matters hugely.The four parts are communications (the traditional agency business), media, digital and healthcare. Each will have its own boss, and three of those, alongside the newly created chief revenue officer, are the presumptive candidates to succeed Mr Lévy. He is 73 and poised to step down in just 17 months.The argument that leadership is key to shareholder value asserts, first, that ad groups are professional service firms. Like law firms or consultants, they have no factories or research labs. They are just people working for clients, rather than the group. The boss and his team are all that provides direction — the software, if you like. Second, big ad groups are roll-ups. They grow by acquiring smaller companies with exciting new ideas. The boss is the dealmaker and so the value-maker. Finally: schmoozing. Advertising is a game of smoothies and the boss is über-smoothie, whom the CEO of GM can call at all hours.Shareholders who subscribe to this view will hope that the board already has one candidate in mind. In that case the new structure is meant to build a team — rather than set up a competition that could soon resemble a knife fight in a phone booth.Publicis’s shares trade at 13 times this year’s earnings, three points less than WPP and Omnicom. Closing that gap could push the stock up more than 15 per cent. Does the succession drama explain the discount? There is a less Shakespearean explanation. The company has acquired the nasty habit of missing growth expectations, most recently in the third quarter. Solve that problem and the discount melts away. And that depends, on a bottom-up view, on an army of non-executives doing their jobs better than the competition. Publicis shares shrugged on Thursday in response to the plan. Whether the market found it wanting, or simply irrelevant, is hard to say.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
22;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-12-02T21:22:49Z;Candidates lined up to replace Maurice Lévy at Publicis;Ad group’s biggest shake-up for more than a decade;Publicis has taken the clearest step yet towards choosing Maurice Lévy’s successor, in effect naming a shortlist of candidates to replace the man who has led the advertising group for 28 years.In its biggest organisational shake-up for more than a decade, the company will create four divisions — handing greatly expanded roles and responsibilities to four of its leading executives.All four — Laura Desmond, Alan Herrick, Steve King and Arthur Sadoun — are currently members of what Publicis calls its expanded executive board or “directoire +”. It is widely expected that one of them will replace the 73-year-old Mr Lévy as group chief executive.Mr Lévy, who is scheduled to step down in May 2017, told the FT on Wednesday: “This fits extremely well with the succession plan as you have some great people who are extremely talented.” He added: “They will have more responsibilities than they have today and will be able to be on their mettle.”Publicis’ reorganisation sends a strong signal about its future plans after more than a year of uncertainty following the Paris-based group’s failed merger with US rival Omnicom.In addition to creating the world’s largest advertising group by revenue, the $35bn tie-up was supposed to solve the succession conundrum at Publicis, with John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive, considered Mr Lévy’s likely eventual replacement.When the merger was called off, in May last year, Publicis was forced into extending Mr Lévy’s tenure, buying valuable time to come up with a plan B.Under the group’s new structure, Mr Sadoun, CEO of Publicis Worldwide, will lead Publicis Communications, a hub comprising all the group’s creative networks, which include Publicis Worldwide, Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett.This fits extremely well with the succession plan as you have some great people who are extremely talentedMr King, CEO of ZenithOptimedia, will head Publicis Media, which will group brands such as Starcom MediaVest, ZenithOptimedia, Vivaki and others.Mr Herrick will remain in his position as chief executive of Publicis.Sapient, the group’s digital and consulting arm, but with a greatly expanded role. This division will include Sapient, the Boston-based consultancy that Publicis acquired last year for $3.7bn. It will also house the group’s digital and ecommerce specialist brands, such as DigitasLBi and Razorfish.A fourth division, Publicis Healthcare, will cater specifically to the group’s clients in the health and pharmaceuticals industries.Ms Desmond, CEO of Starcom MediaVest, will become the group’s chief revenue officer — a new role designed to co-ordinate with teams of so-called chief client officers. These officers will be responsible for individual clients, offering and co-ordinating the full range of Publicis’ services.Ms Desmond will also be responsible for new business and development.In addition, the group said it would set up a committee, led by a representative, in each of its 20 most important countries by sales — which account for roughly 90 per cent of group revenue — to handle and co-ordinate the full gamut of group services.Ms Desmond has been named as representative for the US committee, the first that Publicis will put in place.Publicis said that other countries would be managed through Publicis ONE, a new structure headed by Jarek Ziebinski, current chairman and CEO of Leo Burnett Asia Pacific.Mr Lévy said of the changes: “For years, the economy of the communication world has been based on silos and we have built some very successful silos. But at the same time, this is now an impediment to seamlessly integrating services for one client.”He added: “Clients today want the whole range of integrated services, led by one person — and with all people working on the same platform and in the same building under one roof.”However, Publicis said the shake-up would not result in brand erosion. “The identity and success of each of the group’s brands will be preciously preserved and nurtured,” it said.Mr Lévy likened Publicis’ resulting structure as “a bit like a smartphone: powered by sophisticated technology but very easy to use”.Even so, the upheavals come at a tricky time for the French group, which has yet to find its footing since the failed merger with Omnicom. In October, Publicis shares suffered their worst one-day fall in seven years after the company reported flat sales and slashed its organic growth target for this year.It reported that revenue in the third quarter was €2.33bn, just 0.7 per cent higher in organic terms than a year earlier. Investors and analysts had expected it to be 2.4 per cent.This poor performance comes amid increased competition between Publicis and its rivals. In October, Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the world’s largest advertising group by revenues, cautioned that brands remained focused on cutting costs, which was putting pressure on agencies.There is also some concern that digital advertising will increase advertising efficiency so much that media budgets will start to grow at a slower rate than gross domestic product.However, Mr Lévy said that it was important to look more broadly. “You have to think about marketing budgets rather than one segment,” he said. “Advertisers will have to combine more means, to combine more data, technology, and all of that has a cost. Overall, it will be extremely difficult for them to reduce their marketing budgets.”
23;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-10-22T16:04:26Z;Publicis shares plunge 9% on back of poor growth;Maurice Lévy’s advertising group slashes organic growth target after flat sales;Shares in Publicis suffered their worst one-day fall in seven years as the French advertising group slashed its organic growth target for this year following flat sales in September.The poor figures raised concerns that the company has yet to figure out its strategy after its failed merger with rival Omnicom.By mid-afternoon, shares had fallen more than 9 per cent compared with the previous day’s close, wiping more than €1bn off the group’s market capitalisation.The fall came as the company, which owns agencies Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi, said that revenue in the third quarter was €2.33bn, just 0.7 per cent higher in organic terms than a year earlier.Investors and analysts had expected it to be 2.4 per cent. On a reported basis, third-quarter revenue was 33 per cent higher than a year earlier thanks to the impact of exchange rates and acquisitions.The Paris-based group led by Maurice Lévy put the lower than expected figure down to “continued modest growth in Europe and North America”, which together account for the vast bulk of total revenues.Revenue from North America was €1.29bn during the quarter, 0.4 per cent higher in organic terms than a year earlier but lower than the 2.5 per cent that analysts expected.In Europe, organic growth during the quarter was 0.6 per cent compared with consensus estimates of 2.4 per cent.Maurice Lévy, Publicis chief executive said that September was flat due to an unusually large number of clients downsizing or even cancelling campaigns.He said that he saw the future “with great confidence”. Yet the latest figures are a clear setback for Publicis and will probably raise questions at a time when rivals Interpublic Group and Omnicom have reported much stronger numbers.Agency clients are scrutinising spending as never beforeRead moreClaudio Aspesi, media analyst at Bernstein described the figures as, “a weak set of results on a standalone basis but a particularly worrying development compared to the overall industry”.Things began to go wrong for Publicis following its failed merger with Omnicom, plans for which broke down in May 2014.Since then, Mr Levy has tried to find his stride by buying Sapient, the digital agency, for $3.7bn in a deal designed to give his group an edge in the digital and technology spheres.But Mr Aspesi said questions remain over the company’s strategy. “Investors are starting to question whether they know what they are doing,” Mr Bernstein said. “The Omnicom deal broke up in May 2014 — 15 months and counting, with no evidence that the organisation knows how to reverse the decline in the growth rate”.
24;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-10-20T15:36:31Z;Media agencies to be subject of US probe;Investigators to look at practices of groups including WPP, Publicis and Omnicom;Major US advertisers have hired investigators who specialise in uncovering fraud and tracing hidden assets to probe the practices of media agencies including WPP, Publicis and Omnicom.The US Association of National Advertisers, whose members collectively spend more than $250bn on marketing and advertising, said on Tuesday that it had selected two companies to perform a wide-ranging investigation of the media-buying supply chain.One of these is K2 Intelligence, the corporate investigations consultancy founded in 2009 by Jeremy and Jules Kroll and which counts former FBI agents among its employees. The other is Firm Decisions, the media auditor that is part of Aim-quoted group Ebiquity.The investigation highlights the sometimes controversial ways in which agencies buy advertising space from media companies on behalf of marketers. The global media-buying market is dominated by six agency holding companies: WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, IPG, Dentsu Aegis and Havas.US marketers have become increasingly concerned that agencies may be making money on the back of their advertising spending in ways that are not transparent, such as taking undisclosed “rebates” from media companies.All the agency holding companies have denied any improper behaviour. John Wren, chief executive of Omnicom, said that he welcomed greater scrutiny of the advertising industry and added that “strict contract compliance” was “fundamental to the essential trust between client and agency that our business is built on”.Bob Liodice, ANA president, said that the trade body, whose members include Procter & Gamble and Unilever, selected the two companies after vetting 26 different candidates. “Each brings a unique perspective and a set of powerful skills and resources,” he said.The ANA is aiming to “demystify” the media-buying landscape and “provide a clarifying perspective on the state of transparency”.In particular, it will probe the “non-transparent behaviour” of rebates, barter, arbitrage, dark pools, inventory management, global transactions, and supply chain media management.The ANA has also been working with another industry group, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, known as the 4A’s, on a list of transparency principles for the advertising business. Those principles are expected to be released soon.“While the 4A’s favoured the continuity and effectiveness of our joint efforts, the ANA has decided to move forward with its solo sponsorship of a fact finding initiative into agency media practices,” said Nancy Hill, 4As president. “The 4A’s will continue to collaborate with ANA on media transparency to the fullest extent feasible.”Tom Denford, joint chief executive of media consultancy ID Comms, said that there was a risk that agencies may choose not to co-operate with the ANA’s investigation. But, he warned: “If the agency community refuses to participate, that itself will send a message to marketers that the agency model is not fit for purpose.”The ANA said its focus on media transparency began three years ago when “undisclosed media rebates were brought to light”. In early 2014, a survey of ANA members indicated rapidly growing concerns about a lack of transparency across a variety of agency practices.In April, Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research downgraded the three biggest holding companies — WPP, Omnicom and Publicis — to “sell” ratings, as a result of intensifying concerns among US marketers that they may have been misled by their agencies.Additional reporting by Shannon Bond
25;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-09-03T13:55:21Z;Advertisers put agency deals on the block in media ‘tsunami’;WPP, Omnicom and others have seen some of their biggest clients launch reviews of their contracts;WPP’s Sir Martin Sorrell last week described it as a “tsunami”, trade journal AdWeek nicknamed it “Mediapalooza 2015”, and others the Mediapocalypse. This year many of the world’s biggest advertisers have launched reviews of which media agencies they should employ. Highly-prized clients up for grabs include Procter & Gamble, L’Oréal, Citi, and 21st Century Fox.With contracts worth $30bn annually put out for tender since January, furious competition has broken out among the six companies that dominate the global advertising market: WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, IPG, Dentsu Aegis and Havas. Each faces an opportunity to steal market share from its rivals, but also the risk of having key clients lured away.Yet, whichever groups emerge victorious, all have cause for concern. For the spate of media reviews is a sign of growing unease among marketers about how their advertising dollars are being spent, and a heightened desire to cut costs. This is worrying for the big six marketing services groups, because media agencies, which buy advertising space for clients, have been their main source of growth in recent years.“Marketers want to drive costs down,” says Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research. “If they smell blood and think they have a chance to renegotiate a better deal with their agency, that’s what they’ll do.”The scent of blood arrived in March. Jon Mandel, former chief executive of WPP’s MediaCom, was making a presentation to some of America’s top advertisers at a conference in Hollywood when he dropped a bombshell. Unbeknown to advertisers, he said, US agencies were taking “rebates and kickbacks” from media companies in exchange for spending their clients’ money with them.All of the holding companies came out with statements defending their transparency. But even so, many of the world’s most prestigious brands soon started inviting media agencies to pitch for their business in competitive bidding processes. In a normal year, about $20bn of the $340bn in media agency billings worldwide is put up for review, according to Mr Wieser. By the end of this year, the figure could reach $40bn.In April, Mr Wieser downgraded the three biggest holding companies — WPP, Omnicom and Publicis — to “sell” ratings, as a result of intensifying concerns among US marketers that they may have been misled by their agencies.Some big accounts have already changed hands. Coca-Cola selected IPG’s UM as its lead media agency in North America, displacing Publicis’s Starcom Mediavest Group. Starcom in turn won Visa’s global media business from Omnicom’s OMD.But many other prize accounts are still in play. Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest advertiser, put its North American media business into review in May. The owner of brands including Pantene and Gillette, spent an estimated $2.7bn in North America last year, using agencies that were owned by Publicis and Dentsu Aegis. Worryingly for the incumbent agencies, P&G said it planned to “significantly simplify and reduce the number of our agency relationships and the costs associated with the current complexity and inefficiency.”How dangerous are the reviews for the big six holding companies?Sir Martin expressed cautious optimism last week when WPP reported its first-half results. It is the incumbent agency in less than a quarter of the media reviews that have been announced, he said, so the group has the potential to win more business than it has to lose.The chief executives of the other holding companies have also put a positive spin on the trend.John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive, told investors in July that the reviews were mainly driven by the fact that “technology has radically changed media planning and buying”, and the media landscape has become ever more fragmented and complex.“With many more media channels and online video available to consumers on so many devices, advertisers want to make sure they have the right strategies in place,” he said.According to this logic, advertisers are focused less on costs and transparency than they are on ensuring that their agency has sufficient expertise in data, technology, and targeting consumers across digital platforms such as YouTube, Snapchat and Facebook.Not everyone is so upbeat, however. The worry is that the winning bidders in the round of media reviews will have to accept lower fees than they enjoyed in the past.“Anything that hurts the media agencies is disproportionately negative to the holding companies,” says Mr Wieser of Pivotal.Media agencies typically make operating income margins of 20 per cent or higher and are much more profitable than other marketing activities such as creative agencies and market research, he says. For comparison, holding company margins range from high single-digits to mid-teens.In addition, Mr Wieser estimates that media agencies have contributed perhaps half of the industry’s profit growth in recent years.Another danger for the holding companies is that the media reviews are just the most visible part of a wider phenomenon, and that an even larger number of contracts are being renegotiated in private without going through a competitive review. If such activity is indeed going on behind the scenes — and if these renegotiations are leading to lower fees — then the scale of the problem is much worse than is widely appreciated.How do media agencies make money? That question is increasingly being asked by their clients, and the answers can be controversial.In markets such as the US, agencies have traditionally charged advertisers on a straightforward and transparent basis: taking an agreed commission of the total media spend, or a fixed fee. Typically, fees range from 2.5-5 per cent of total spending.But in many other markets, including the UK and much of Europe, agencies also make money from “rebates” from the media companies that supply them with advertising space. If these payments are clearly disclosed to advertisers and passed back to them, they are not controversial and are an accepted part of doing business.Yet in many cases advertisers are not fully aware of how their media agency profits from such deals with television companies, newspaper proprietors or website owners. Increasing awareness of these activities is now causing controversy, particularly in the US. In June, the Association of National Advertisers launched an investigation into whether its members were falling victim to rebates, “kickbacks” and other forms of “questionable agency behaviour”.Tom Denford, joint chief executive of ID Comms, a consulting company that is managing a global media review for Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare group, says that trust between advertisers and agencies has fallen to “really quite a low”.The big problem, he says, is that agencies which hide the ways they make money are unlikely to be planning and buying media in the advertiser’s best interests.
26;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-04-28T12:01:52Z;Digital is reshaping the world of advertising;Data from TVs, credit cards, online profiles and loyalty cards redefine industry;When Heineken USA was preparing to launch Desperados, a tequila-flavoured beer, in the southeastern US in 2014, the importer tried out two advertising campaigns.In some states, Heineken bought traditional television commercials, while in others it ran ads only on mobile phones at specific times of day.In the states that received the digital campaign, awareness of the millennial-targeted drink reached 23 per cent — well above the rate in states that only had TV ads. “We were reaching millennials in pre-party occasions,” says Nuno Teles, Heineken USA’s chief marketing officer. “On Friday at 9pm, they are not watching TV. They are checking their phones and social media.”One of Heineken USA’s main motivations for investing 30 per cent of its ad budget in digital platforms this year — up from 20 per cent in 2014 — is this ability better to align marketing spend with outcomes. “We can impact the business significantly through digital,” Mr Teles says.Thanks to the proliferation of providers from Netflix and the BBC’s iPlayer to Facebook and Snapchat, consumers have greater access to more media on more devices than ever before. That is allowing advertisers to tap user data to target their messages precisely to the right people at the right time in their digital campaigns and, increasingly, through traditional media such as TV.“The way consumers are consuming content is becoming more digital,” says Jeff Green, chief executive officer of The Trade Desk, an advertising technology company that automates ad buying.“Ultimately, every advertising format will become digital, whether it’s print, TV, radio,” he says. “The most efficient way to operate is [by being] somewhat electronic and market-driven. And the primary way marketers look at it is: ‘I want to have the most effective marketing that I’ve ever had.’ ”The way advertising is bought, sold and created is being reshaped by the enormous volume of data from set-top TV boxes, credit card purchases, online profiles and retailer loyalty card programmes — and by the technology that allows marketers to access, analyse and implement that data. IDC, the market research group, predicts chief marketing officers will boost the amount they spend on marketing technology to $32.4bn in 2018 from $20.2bn in 2014.Nearly half of marketers surveyed recently by research company Forrester plan to increase their digital budgets this year. Forty per cent said they would spend more on data analytics.30%Percentage of Heineken USA’s advertising budget to be spent on digital platforms in 2015This investment comes as big advertisers face a challenge in “digesting all the different pieces of data they’re getting: loyalty card and customer relationship information, a blitzkrieg of data from social channels, clicks, Facebook,” says Drew Panayiotou, chief executive of BBDO Atlanta, an advertising agency owned by Omnicom, a global communications company.He asks: “How do marketing data intersect with data coming internally through the company, through the chief information officer, or the chief technology officer, or the ecommerce group? We’re seeing clients trying to sort that . . . out internally to make the data useful.”While the rise of targeted advertising has been enabled by data and technology, its proliferation reflects marketers’ demand for evidence that the money they spend is really influencing customer behaviour.Simulmedia, an advertising technology company, is so confident that targeted TV advertising can have measurable business impact that it is guaranteeing that any advertisers who spend $1m for a month on ads aimed at specific viewers will have better results than they would have achieved using their current TV plans.$32.4bnLikely spending on marketing technology in 2018Dave Morgan, chief executive of Simulmedia, says: “We’ve been measuring the outcome of TV campaigns for years. Did they actually deliver? If you measured TV the same way as digital, how would it do? We find it’s doing really, really well.” Companies such as Choice Hotels International, owner of the Comfort Inn and Econo Lodge brands, have worked with Simulmediato target potential clients.Targeting is also valued by marketers as they are under great pressure to show efficiency and make sure they are not wasting valuable ad dollars on people who are unlikely to be customers.“To some extent, the non-targeting is more important,” says Mr Green of The Trade Desk. His company advised a fast-food restaurant chain to stop advertising to anyone who lived more than 10 miles away from its 10,000 locations. “That eliminated 40 per cent of America,” Mr Green says. “Then we focused on reaching those within five miles. We were trimming the fat, so to speak.”The chain agreed to start with a five-figure budget to test it out. It ended up boosting the campaign to more than $10m, Mr Green says, based on its success. “It was exponentially more effective advertising by customising messages based on time of day and proximity [to one of the chain’s locations].”Those in the industry also say that closer targeting can improve consumers’ experiences watching TV or browsing the web by making sure they are seeing ads that are relevant to them.“With targeting, a lot of what we do is focus on the negative space — the suppression of advertising messages to people who are inappropriate,” says Jonathan Nelson, chief executive of Omnicom Digital.However, research suggests there are limitations to how far marketers should take targeting. Lisa Barnard, of Ithaca College, has found that online ads tailored to specific consumers do increase their intent to purchase items. But she also found a negative effect from what she calls “the creepiness factor” of targeted ads that reduces the likelihood to buy by 5 per cent.“Even digital natives were bothered by this. They know they’re being marketed to. And they don’t like it,” she says. “Marketers have made blanket assumptions that the more data we have, the more we should use,” she adds. “But just because we have that information, it doesn’t mean you should just go ahead and use it all the time in all cases.”
27;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Omnicom warns strong US dollar will hit harder than expected;Advertising group reports first quarterly drop in revenue for four years;Omnicom said the strong US dollar would be a bigger drag on revenue this year than it had previously expected as the US advertising holding company reported its first drop in quarterly revenue in four years.Foreign exchange rates will trim 6.5 per cent from sales this year if rates stay where they are, the company said on Tuesday, up from the 5 per cent impact it had forecast in February. Second-quarter revenue is expected to take a 7.5 per cent hit.“While our underlying businesses continue to perform well, the negative impact of foreign exchange continues to create a considerable headwind on our revenue,” said Philip Angelastro, chief financial officer.In the first quarter, revenue fell 0.9 per cent to $3.47bn from $3.5bn a year ago, compared with Wall Street’s expected $3.5bn.John Wren, chief executive, said the company was on track to meet its full-year targets.US sales, which make up 56 per cent of Omnicom’s total, rose 4.6 per cent to $1.96bn, but international revenue fell 7.3 per cent to $1.51bn. The company said currency effects shaved 6.5 per cent from revenue, more than the 5.5 per cent it had expected.But stripping out the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions, organic revenue rose 5.1 per cent.Net income rose 1.8 per cent to $209.1m, or 83 cents a share, from $205.5m, or 77 cents a share. Analysts had expected earnings of 82 cents a share.On a conference call with analysts, Mr Wren said the advertising industry was undergoing a “major transformation as new digital tools and platforms emerge with media and technology evolving at an accelerating pace”.He cited the recent rush of media companies, pay-television providers and technology groups into internet video services, which is disrupting the traditional TV market and the $70bn US TV advertising industry.With audiences fragmenting and viewership moving to digital devices, marketers and media groups are looking to bring the tools of digital media to personalise their TV campaigns for specific viewers. They are also turning to automated, or programmatic, technologies to target customers and buy advertising inventory, sometimes in real time.Revenues from Omnicom’s programmatic business rose 10 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of this year.“We’re moving from marketing to broad audiences to marketing to people,” Mr Wren said.Omnicom shares fell 1.3 per cent to $76.85 in morning trading in New York.Rival Publicis, whose $35bn “merger of equals” with Omnicom fell apart last year, reported first-quarter sales on Tuesday that came in above expectations.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
28;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-03-16T19:10:11Z;Holcim-Lafarge tie-up on shaky ground;Dispute over role of French group’s chief could threaten €40bn ‘merger of equals’;Bruno Lafont’s mission to become the top manager in the cement industry had looked assured until last week, with the 58-year-old preparing to become head of the group created through the proposed €40bn merger of Holcim and Lafarge.But the ground has started to shift under the Lafarge chief executive, with Holcim now attempting to block his appointment to the senior management job at the enlarged group.People close to Holcim say that, like a bucket of cement in danger of being badly mixed, it would not be possible for Mr Lafont, pictured below, to lead the combined company. His personality and culture would not gel with the rest of the management, they add.People close to Lafarge say Holcim’s effort to block Mr Lafont is simply a power play, following a push to renegotiate the financial terms of the deal. Holcim is attempting to turn what was billed as a merger of equals into a full takeover of Lafarge, they add.For Holcim, the price is wrong, but the logic remains rightContinue readingHolcim on Sunday night wrote a letter to Lafarge demanding changes to the merger terms outlined last April when the deal was first unveiled.The transaction involved no cash but envisaged a one-for-one share exchange. In reality, Holcim shareholders would pay a premium for Lafarge.However, to reinforce the idea this was a merger of equals, senior positions at the enlarged group were to be divided equally. Mr Lafont would be chief executive, and Wolfgang Reitzle, Holcim’s chairman, would hold the same position at the combined company.Holcim has sought revisions to the deal to reflect the weak performance of the French company since the deal was announced last April.With the proposal to remove Mr Lafont, Holcim is not just saying that the Swiss company is doing better and should pay less for Lafarge, but also asserting “we want control of the board”, said one Lafarge adviser. People close to Holcim deny this.The question now is if this dispute will scupper the deal. People close to Lafarge say that while the company was willing to negotiate on financial aspects of the merger, it would not reopen governance issues. “This is a deal-breaker,” adds one person.It remains to be seen, however, if Lafarge shareholders will in the end sacrifice Mr Lafont to get the deal done, or perhaps agree a compromise that will see him spend a year or two in Switzerland and then move on.“The chance of a collapse in the entire deal has increased a lot,” says Patrick Appenzeller, analyst at Baader-Helvea.Some analysts have suggested the deal has echoes of the $35bn deal to combine Publicis and Omnicom, which fell apart after the merger of equals turned into a power struggle to control the world’s largest advertising group.At the heart of the dispute between Holcim and Lafarge is the diverging performances of the two companies since the deal was unveiled.Cultural differences prove to be the backstory to cement groups’ troubled deal.Continue readingSince then, analysts’ earnings consensus for Lafarge this year has been cut by 30 per cent, as the French company’s Africa and Middle Eastern operations have been hurt by the lower oil price and political unrest. Holcim’s earnings have been downgraded by 15 per cent.Lafarge counters that it has better long-term growth prospects than Holcim, because of its larger African operations, but analysts started to suggest a few weeks ago that some revisions to the deal would be fair.The rationale for the deal is still the same as before. The transaction is designed to give the enlarged group more pricing power as the world’s largest cement maker, and secure €1.4bn of cost savings.The Schmidheiny family, Holcim’s largest shareholder, said: “The industrial logic of the deal is undisputed.”This comes as the industry has been suffering from chronic overcapacity, particularly in the developed world. Holcim and Lafarge have agreed to sell a basket of unwanted assets worth €6.5bn to Irish rival CRH to settle competition concerns.There are other reasons not to let the deal die. There is a break-up fee of €350m, payable by whichever company pulls out of the transaction to the other.“We still place a higher probability on the deal going ahead than not,” says Robert Gardiner, analyst at Davy Research, who adds the caveat that the financial rationale for the deal may be scuppered by governance issues.Additional reporting by Laura Noonan and Sarah Gordon
29;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-03-16T12:07:40Z;Holcim-Lafarge like other megamergers with huge hidden obstacles;Cultural differences prove to be the backstory to cement groups’ troubled deal;Last April, cement companies Holcim and Lafarge faithfully promised their investors that the deal they had just announced was not like all the other megamergers. They, unlike Omnicom and Publicis, or Glencore and Xstrata, had worked through all the possible problems in advance. The price looked right, they said, for a merger of equals.Senior management positions were divided up fairly, with Lafarge’s chief executive Bruno Lafont set to run the combined group, while Holcim’s chairman Wolfgang Reitzle retained his position. Regulators were to be soothed with intense preparatory work, allowing what looked like huge competitive hurdles in Europe to be cleared with ease.But this deal was, it turns out, a deal like all the others.In theory, the core of the disagreement between the two is price. This always looked better for Lafarge’s shareholders than it did for Holcim’s. Diverging share moves, not to mention performance, since the deal was announced mean that disparity has only grown. But while Lafarge seems to have been prepared to tweak the one-for-one share ratio a bit, its board would not countenance a price that made the realities of the situation clear — that this was a takeover of the French company by its Swiss rival.Once the two groups allowed themselves to disagree on price, the gloves really came off. Now it seems that, yes, there were “cultural” issues between the two companies. Holcim is no longer happy about the idea of Mr Lafont at the helm. And while Lafarge moans about “conservative” Swiss investors failing to focus on the long-term benefits of the deal, Holcim bewails its rival’s inability to be realistic about the financial terms.Behind the scenes, too, there were always huge obstacles to the deal to which the public was not privy. The two boards trumpeted the €41bn tie-up as a way of creating a global cement giant. In practice, it provided both companies with a useful cloak under which to offload underperforming European assets, allowed Lafarge to upgrade its credit rating and Holcim to deal with an undesirable shareholder in the form of Eurocement, headed by Russian Filaret Galchev. Thomas Schmidheiny, Holcim’s former chairman, whose family founded the company, once believed the deal would cement his legacy — but now appears to have changed his mind. Meanwhile, there is no explanation from Holcim as to why Mr Lafont’s position as chief executive was such a good idea last April but has now become a deal-killer.Investors, though, are not allowed to hear the backstory. Instead they have been subjected to months of misinformation. As recently as Friday, both Lafarge and Holcim were pooh-poohing suggestions that the deal was in trouble.The impact of this lack of transparency with the outside world, though, pales in comparison with the money wasted during the whole sorry charade. If the deal does go ahead despite this huge hiccup — and if Mr Lafont’s position is the only sticking point, Lafarge’s board has a duty to rethink it — shareholders may well suffer in the long term, because many mergers and acquisitions destroy, rather than create, value. But they have certainly lost out in the short term, unlike the legions of bankers, lawyers, lobbyists and PRs across the globe who have profited from it.sarah.gordon@ft.com
30;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-03-05T11:38:09Z;Upbeat broker comment cheers ITV shares;Broadcaster tops FTSE 100 for second straight session;ITV shone at the top of a lacklustre FTSE 100 on Thursday as the warm market reception to the free-to-air broadcaster’s full-year results was extended by a series of upbeat broker comment.Shares in the broadcaster — which screens some of the UK’s most watched programmes including Coronation Street and The X Factor — rose a further 3.2 per cent to 242.2p, adding to a rally of nearly 6 per cent over the previous session, when it published its numbers and announced a £250m special dividend.The payout came in part because of the recovery in ITV’s advertising share but analysis from Berenberg published on Wednesday drew attention to some doubts about the outlook for the company in the market.The broker said that ITV’s revenue rebound was rooted in part because of a dispute between its rival, Channel 5, and major advertising buyer Omnicom.“On our estimates, the dispute drove around a quarter of ITV’s 2014 advertising growth, while this year will benefit by around 2.5 per cent of the net advertising revenue for 2014,” said Sarah Simon, Berenberg analyst.“It is therefore hardly surprising that ITV expects to outperform the market as a whole, but what happens if/when Omnicom and Five end hostilities?”Nick Bertolotti, analyst at Credit Suisse, listed a series of factors that looked supportive of the stock, including a forecast that bid speculation could return.“We like the improving, above consensus advertising momentum, cash return prospects, strategic value of their content business . . . and the inevitability of takeover speculation re-emerging.”Liberty Global of the US bought a 6.4 per cent stake in ITV for £481m from Sky in July, stoking speculation that a full bid could follow.Thursday’s continued rally in ITV’s took the stock to its best level since 2000.Overall, the FTSE 100 was muted as traders across global markets waited for details on how the European Central Bank’s €1tn stimulus package will operate.The ECB’s president, Mario Draghi, is expected to flesh out details of how it will work later in the session after the outcome of the central bank’s March policy meeting.London’s main equities index held steady at 6,921.71 in morning trade, within reach of its record high of 6,974.26 in February.Aviva, the insurer, made the best single rise after its annual operating profit rose 6 per cent for 2014, although its chief executive, Mark Wilson, called the results “inadequate”. Its shares rose 5 per cent to 558p.Aviva’s peers took heart from its numbers even as they failed to impress its boss.Its fellow insurers appeared across the leaderboard with Friends Life up 4.5 per cent at 425p and Legal & General up 1.4 per cent at 274p. Direct Line rose 1.4 per cent to 337.1p. Standard Life gained 1.4 per cent to 429p.The Europe-wide FTSE Eurofirst 300 ticked 0.3 per cent higher to 1,562.01 with a weaker euro helping support shares in exporters.
31;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-02-12T13:44:48Z;Publicis’s growth lags behind US rival Omnicom;Chief executive Maurice Lévy admits advertising group suffered ‘patchy’ year;Publicis promised that growth would accelerate to “cruising speed” in the second half of this year, as the French advertising group reported fourth-quarter revenue figures that lagged behind its US rival Omnicom.The Paris-based company said organic revenues, which strip out acquisitions and currency movements, rose 3.2 per cent to €2.15bn in the fourth quarter. That figure exceeded analysts’ expectations but was below the 5.9 per cent organic growth Omnicom reported this week.Publicis, whose brands include Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett, has struggled in recent months following the collapse in May of its planned $35bn mega-merger with Omnicom.Maurice Lévy, chief executive, acknowledged that Publicis had suffered a “patchy” year, though he said that its business was “robust” and would benefit from November’s $3.7bn purchase of Sapient, a digital agency.Mr Lévy forecast that the first quarter of this financial year “will be slow”, but added “the pace will gradually quicken after that and we will hit cruising speed in the second half”.Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum Capital, recommended that investors take the company’s comments about 2015 being a better year “with a pinch of salt”, as its “performance on guidance has not been stellar”.For the full year to December 2014, Publicis reported organic sales growth of 2 per cent to €7.26bn, slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations.Net income fell 9 per cent to €720m, dragged down by costs including the aborted deal with Omnicom and a €72m impairment charge related to underperformance at agencies MSL and BBH. Earnings per share fell from €3.67 in 2013 to €3.22.Publicis, which is the third-largest global advertising holding company after WPP and Omnicom, proposed a dividend of €1.20 per share, up from €1.10 in 2013.Mr Lévy said that he was confident the group would meet the objectives laid out in its 2018 strategic plan. These included increasing organic revenues by two percentage points, on average — higher than the rest of the industry. He also promised to increase operating margins — 16.4 per cent for 2014 — to between 17.3 per cent and 19.3 per cent.The company’s share price was up 4.5 per cent to €70.06 in afternoon trading in Paris on Thursday.
32;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-02-10T16:34:11Z;Omnicom warns strong US dollar to hit 2015 revenues;US and UK spending helps boost ad group’s profits in fourth quarter;Omnicom warned that the strong US dollar would weigh on revenues this year, as it reported higher revenues and profit in the fourth quarter.The US advertising holding company predicted that foreign exchange rates would shave 5.5 per cent from revenues in the first quarter and 5 per cent for the full year if current rates hold, following a 3.1 per cent impact in the final three months of 2014.“FX was negative this quarter across virtually every currency we operate in,” said Philip Angelastro, chief financial officer, citing the euro, the Australian and Canadian dollars, Brazil’s real, Russia’s rouble and the yen in particular. “It is certainly going to pose a bit of a challenge for us from a margin perspective.”However, John Wren, chief executive, told analysts he believed the company would be able to maintain its margins in the first quarter and hoped the impact of exchange rates would moderate through the year. Operating margin rose to 13.8 per cent in the fourth quarter from 13.6 per cent a year ago.Shares fell 0.8 per cent to $75.19 by close on Tuesday in New York.Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research, described the foreign exchange outlook as “a major negative” but “unsurprising given current market conditions”.The warning came as Omnicom reported higher ad spending in the US and UK that lifted revenues and profit in the fourth quarter, capping a strong year despite the collapse of its planned $35bn merger with France’s Publicis.Net income rose 9.7 per cent to $329.5m, or $1.30 a share, from $330.5m, or $1.13 a share, a year ago. That beat analyst expectations of $1.26 a share. Revenue increased 3.4 per cent to $4.2bn, compared with estimates of $4.15bn.Revenue, stripping out acquisitions, rose 5.9 per cent, boosted by 8.5 per cent growth in advertising and a 9.4 per cent lift in its speciality communications business. Revenue, stripping out acquisitions, rose 8.3 per cent in North America and 6.2 per cent in the UK. The company generates 46 per cent of revenues outside the US.For the full year, net income increased 11.4 per cent to $1.1bn, or $4.24 a share, from $991m, or $3.71 a share in 2013, on a 5 per cent gain in revenue to $15.3bn.Omnicom booked $8.8m in pre-tax charges related to the merger with Publicis, which was called off in May after the companies clashed over culture, leadership and tax and regulatory hurdles.
33;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2015-01-28T14:59:05Z;Channel 5 attacks Omnicom in letter to ad group’s clients;Broadcaster urges brands to rethink contracts after agency pulls ads from station;Channel 5 has attacked Omnicom in a letter to dozens of the advertising group’s clients in the UK, urging them to consult media auditors about its decision to halt spending with the broadcaster.The letter, a copy of which has been seen by the Financial Times, was sent to companies including McDonald’s, Sony and Boots and comes six months after the world’s second biggest advertising group withdrew its clients’ budgets from Channel 5 and moved them to ITV.The dispute pits Omnicom against Viacom, the US television group that last year acquired Channel 5 from Richard Desmond for £450m.It also shines a light on the UK’s television advertising market, in which media buyers such as Omnicom, WPP and Publicis act as powerful intermediaries between brands and broadcasters.The letter suggests that Omnicom’s clients should question the “motives” behind its decision to move their spending to ITV.It alludes to speculation by industry experts in recent months that Omnicom pulled its clients’ budgets from Channel 5 to satisfy a commitment it had made to ITV, rather than because doing so was in the best interest of clients.Omnicom declined to comment.Ross Belcher, Channel 5’s trading director, writes in the letter that the broadcaster had represented “tremendous media value versus ITV and Channel 4” in 2014. On average, Channel 5’s ad slots were about 25 per cent cheaper than ITV’s last year, according to Slik Media, an advertising consultancy.“Given the circumstances, it is sometimes difficult for us to connect with Omnicom clients,” Mr Belcher wrote. “So I strongly urge you to take independent advice from your media auditor and ask them how [Omnicom’s] position can be justified and/or beneficial to your business.”He added that Channel 5’s prices had become even cheaper in 2015, and were likely to fall 15 per cent year on year this quarter, while ITV and Channel 4 were expected to see cost inflation of 20 per cent.Channel 5 confirmed it had sent the letter, but declined to comment further.The letter comes after Channel 5 this month launched the latest season of reality television series Celebrity Big Brother, which attracted an audience of 6m on its launch. The programme has a high proportion of young viewers, who are much coveted by advertisers.Neil Spencer, a consultant at Slik Media, said: “For some of my clients who are chasing younger audiences, the fact that they are not allowed to advertise on Celebrity Big Brother is a real issue.”Sarah Simon, analyst at Berenberg, said the strong ratings that Channel 5 was having with Big Brother meant “pressure is likely to mount on Omnicom to resolve the situation” — and would have implications for ITV.Viacom is also intensifying pressure on Omnicom. For almost five years, the US television group had used Omnicom agency PHD to promote its MTV and Comedy Central brands in the UK. But this month it ended the relationship in a move widely seen as a response to the Channel 5 spat.Omnicom, whose agencies including PHD and OMD, is estimated to account for about 14 per cent of UK media spending.Its dispute with Channel 5 is the latest spat between agencies and broadcasters. In 2013, WPP, which accounts for about a third of UK media spending, briefly pulled all of its clients’ advertising from Channel 4 in a row over rates. The move led to spikes in rates at rival channels.
34;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-12-14T13:41:17Z;Maurice Lévy tries to pick up Publicis after failed deal with Omnicom;Head of advertising group squares up to the “digital tsunami”;The latest phrase to enter Maurice Lévy’s vocabulary is “to be ubered” and the head of Publicis Groupe, one of the world’s largest advertising groups, is using it with alarming frequency.“Everyone is starting to worry about being ubered,” Mr Lévy tells the Financial Times in an interview, referring to the car-hailing app that is trying to upend the traditional taxi industry. “It’s the idea that you suddenly wake up to find your legacy business gone . . . clients have never been so confused or concerned about their brands or their business model.”Mr Lévy’s own sector is no exception.The “digital tsunami”, as he calls it, has caused more upheaval to advertising than at any time since the advent of radio and television. The rise of competitors such as Google and Facebook has changed the way people consume information. This has presented huge challenges to the likes of Publicis, whose brands include Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett, as well as interactive agencies such as Razorfish.The failure in May of Publicis’s planned $35bn mega-merger with US rival Omnicom, seen at the time as a logical “size matters” response to the tsunami, has only underscored the scale of the challenge.So how does Mr Lévy intend to survive and prosper in this brave new world? One answer is that he is doing what every other company is: hiring mathematicians and data scientists to help deliver the specific algorithms clients need to reach specific consumers.“We employ geeks, techies and gamers,” he says. “Today, advertising campaigns are so highly targeted that they are often not even seen by the general public.”Another answer came last month when Mr Lévy announced that the group would acquire Sapient, the Boston-based consultancy that specialises in digital but also provides business and technology services to the capital and commodity markets.At the time the deal was announced, Mr Lévy called Sapient the “crown jewel” in omni-channel commerce and consulting. He told the FT that the all-cash $3.7bn acquisition, which he expects to close in the first quarter of next year, would break down the doors of other sectors just as digital is bringing the advertising world closer to the lucrative realms of consultancy and IT.“It gives us a full set of services,” he says.Publicis certainly needs a lift. The Paris-based group, founded by Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet in 1926, has notched up several quarters of disappointing growth. Sales were €1.75bn between July and the end of September — an organic growth of just 1 per cent compared with a year earlier.By contrast, US rival Interpublic reported organic growth during the same period of 6.3 per cent. Even more galling, Omnicom grew at a spirited 6.5 per cent.Mr Lévy says that his group’s poor recent performance is directly related to the failed tie-up. “We involved our people more than they [Omnicom] did, we believed more in the merger, we invested more time and passion,” he says. “We were pregnant with the idea of the merger and so have suffered while they enjoyed good growth.”Mr Lévy says Publicis is reverting to maximising organic growth. Last week, he restated medium-term targets, promising shareholders that revenue would grow two percentage points, on average, higher than the rest of the industry in coming years. He also promised to increase operating margins — 16.2 per cent this year before including Sapient — by between 200 and 400 basis points.But in a world in which most people agree that size matters, analysts are sceptical that Publicis’s planned acquisition of Sapient provides the necessary boost in scale. Sapient’s $1.26bn in revenues last year are small compared with Publicis’s €6.95bn, for example. Contrast all of that with the now-shattered dream of bonding with Omnicom’s roughly $14.6bn in annual revenues.Moreover, Sapient’s business may be mainly digital — boosting Publicis’s overall revenues from digital to more than 50 per cent of the total well before its 2018 target — but it is also highly concentrated in the US. That will do little to expand the group’s footprint in emerging markets, which last year accounted for less than a quarter of the Paris-based group’s overall revenue.Analysts also question whether the convergence opportunities in consulting and technology that Mr Lévy has signalled will materialise. Bernstein Research, for example, recently argued that consulting companies tend to be highly specialised and their deep knowledge of their sector already allows them to provide the value-added services Mr Lévy has identified.The report, entitled “Christmas came early . . . to Sapient”, a reference to the 19.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation at which Publicis’s offer values the company, concluded: “The crossover between financial services and digital marketing is not natural or convincing.”Publicis shares fell on the day it announced the acquisition. The stock is down about 11 per cent since the start of the year. Meanwhile, Omnicom shares are up 4.2 per cent over the same period. Shares in Havas, Publicis’s much smaller Paris rival, are up 13.6 per cent. Of Publicis’ main rivals, only UK-based WPP has seen its shares fall this year — though only by 4.4 per cent.With the verdict still unclear on the Sapient acquisition, there is nevertheless one thing on which everyone agrees: the deal does nothing to resolve the puzzle of succession.A tie-up with Omnicom would have provided the 72-year-old Mr Lévy with an elegant solution, crowning his 27 years at the top of Publicis with the biggest merger in advertising history and gradually handing over the reins to John Wren, his counterpart at Omnicom.As things stand, Mr Lévy has had to buy time to find the right replacement by extending his original retirement date by 18 months until the group’s annual general meeting in May 2017.Sitting in his office, connected by a door to the impeccably preserved room — complete with Picassos and a Giacometti — from which Bleustein-Blanchet used to run things, Mr Lévy says that choosing his successor is a job for Publicis’s board.And it is one that he insists will begin at the end of next year. In the meantime, he says, his responsibility is to ensure that there is an internal candidate ready in time.Has he already started that process?“I have never stopped,” he replies.Digital tsunami blurs the linesThe “digital tsunami”, as Maurice Lévy calls it, has blurred the razor-sharp lines that once separated IT from advertising, forcing the world’s biggest marketing groups to partner with software companies.In September, Publicis announced an alliance with Adobe, the US technology group, to offer a range of digital marketing tools.The “Always-On Platform”, as Publicis calls it, will help clients manage their campaigns across devices as well as to measure their effectiveness. The company says it will also help them to target potential customers more effectively.In the same month, Omnicom announced a strategic alliance with Salesforce.com, the San Francisco-based cloud computing company, to provide customers with a range of customer relations management tools.The alliances do not involve any equity, sending a clear message to investors in the advertising groups that the companies do not intend to sink money into acquiring IT companies.But they illustrate the growing importance of providing digital tools to support the growing demand for targeted, online campaigns. The days of the blockbuster television advertising campaign are not yet over. But it seems clear that the era of digital campaigns that are highly targeted to specific people are here to stay.Back to the top of the page
35;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
36;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-11-03T17:25:45Z;Publicis/Sapient: pay per click;Publicis has paid a whopping premium for Sapient;"The deal is done. Time to find $800m. Publicis has paid a huge premium for the US digital advertising and consulting group Sapient. The deal, announced on Monday, provides for an all-cash consideration of $25 a share, or $3.7bn – a 44 per cent premium to Sapient’s closing price on Halloween. The really scary bit is that Sapient’s shares had an, ahem, unusual increase in the days just before the announcement. At last Monday’s close the shares were under $15. The market rallied last week, but even backing out that effect, the true premium was likely close to 60 per cent, or $1.3bn (Another bidder driving up the price? No, says management). If this is a way to move on from the collapse of the Omnicom merger, it looks like an awfully pricey one.The companies expect €50m ($63m) in cost savings. Capitalised, those are worth, generously, $500m. So there is still $800m in value to be found. There are two ways that this can happen. The two can sell more together than they would have separately; or the market could put a higher valuation on Publicis’ earnings now that it includes Sapient.On the first front, the hope is that Sapient’s special expertise can be sold through Publicis’ larger client network. Sapient’s distinguishing feature is that, on top of digital marketing and advertising services (where it competes with Publicis more or less directly) it sells management consulting with a focus on information technology to financial markets and government clients. This accounts for a third of its revenues. Do Publicis’ clients need those services? If the consulting business does not generate cross-sales, the premium paid looks even larger.Hopes for a richer valuation for the buyer turn on its future growth. And Sapient has grown at double digits in the past few years. It plays purely in digital. As Pivotal Research points out, however, Publicis has made four digital acquisitions since 2006 with a total value of about $3bn (Digitas, Razorfish, Rosetta and LBi). Yet its growth still lags behind that of its peers WPP and Omnicom significantly, particularly in the emerging world and in the crucial US market. This is a bigger deal; maybe it can spark sustainable growth in a way the others could not. The market seems to be sceptical; it pushed Publicis shares down by 2 per cent. Publicis itself has $800m that says that this time is different.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
37;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-10-23T12:23:15Z;Publicis results lag behind rivals;French advertising company is regrouping after failed merger with Omnicom;Publicis reported weaker than expected third-quarter growth as the French advertising group was left counting the cost of its failed merger with US rival Omnicom.Revenue between July and the end of September was €1.75bn, just 1 per cent higher than a year earlier in organic terms compared with analysts’ expectations of 2.2 per cent growth.Admitting that the figure “does not match our expectations”, chief executive Maurice Lévy put the result down to “the fact that management was too focused on other plans and not enough on the short-term performance and growth”.The comment was a thinly veiled reference to the group’s derailed merger plans with Omnicom. Announced with much hype and fanfare last year, the proposed $35bn mega-merger to create what would have been the world’s largest advertising group collapsed in May over deep differences concerning the appointment of senior executives.The failed tie-up has also complicated succession plans at Publicis, one of the world’s largest advertising groups and owner of stable of big names, including Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett Worldwide.Last month, its board of directors said it would extend Mr Lévy’s 27-year tenure by another 18 months to 2017 in a move largely seen as buying the group time to come up with a long-term plan.Publicis said on Thursday that it would provide more details on November 7 concerning a revision to its 2018 strategic plan.On Thursday Mr Lévy said the group was now “at the end of this cycle and very confident of the future”. But he also warned that organic growth for the whole of 2014 “would not be very different from the first nine months” when it was 1.5 per cent.Publicis’s latest trading statement came in well below those of its main rivals, with Omnicom reporting a 6.5 per cent jump in organic growth during the three months to the end of September, and US-based Interpublic reporting growth of 6.3 per cent.Publicis shares were trading at €53.47 in the mid-afternoon on Thursday, 1.2 per cent up on the previous day’s close.The group said digital advertising accounted for 41.6 per cent of total revenue by the end of September compared with 37.6 per cent a year earlier. During the first nine months of the year, digital advertising grew 9.1 per cent while revenue from analogue advertising fell 3.1 per cent.“It has become clear that the transition from analogue to digital is gathering pace,” the group said.
38;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-10-22T17:30:53Z;Interpublic boosted by business ad spending;Global brands show signs of confidence in US market;US businesses picked up their advertising spending in the third quarter, boosting earnings for marketing groups Interpublic and Omnicom.The results suggest that after a sluggish first half of the year, global brands may be feeling more confident about the US market.“The US is a good place to be over exposed to in this world of uncertainty,” said Michael Roth, Interpublic chief executive, as his company reported a near doubling in quarterly profit. With 57 per cent of IPG’s business coming from its home region, he said, “the strength of the US markets is evidenced by our growth in the US”.Omnicom and IPG are the largest US-based advertising holding companies and count consumer groups including PepsiCo, Walmart, McDonald’s, Nissan and Unilever among their clients.But improving growth may be more reflective of the increasingly digital nature of the advertising business than underlying economic trends, said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research.“Digital media requires more labour,” said Mr Wieser. “In a business where you get paid by the hour, digital is good for you.”He said that shift was allowing advertising groups to “decouple their growth trend from the broader economy”.Agencies are reaping the benefit as their clients budget more money for digital advertising to reach consumers who are spending more time online and using mobile devices.IPG had “notable growth from our digital services,” Mr Roth told investors on Wednesday.The day before, Omnicom chief executive John Wren said new digital platforms and data-driven programmatic ad buying technology were contributing to a shift in spending from television to online media.Digital media requires more labour . . . In a business where you get paid by the hour, digital is good for youIPG’s US organic revenue growth reached 7.9 per cent in the quarter, while Omnicom’s was 8.9 per cent. That marked an acceleration at both companies from the previous quarter and the comparable period in 2013.The companies said they were on track to meet or exceed the 4 per cent target they have each set for full-year organic revenue growth, up from the 3.7 per cent each posted in 2013.US advertising spending in the first six months of 2014 was weaker than expected, according to IPG’s media buying and research group Magna Global. It forecast outlays to pick up in the second half, reaching annual growth in core media revenue of 5.1 per cent.Mr Wieser noted that Omnicom and IPG had probably won some business from rival Publicis, the French advertising group whose performance has suffered in the wake of the collapse of its $35bn merger with Omnicom earlier this year. Publicis will report third-quarter earnings on Thursday.In the third quarter, IPG’s net income nearly doubled to $89.7m, or 21 cents a share, from $45.5m, or 11 cents a share, a year ago, in line with Wall Street estimates of 21 cents a share.Revenue rose 8 per cent to $1.84bn, led by strong growth in the US, which accounts for 57 per cent of IPG’s business.Omnicom’s net income rose 25 per cent to $239.5m, or 95 cents a share, on a 7 per cent increase in revenue to $3.7bn. That beat the 90 cents a share analysts had estimated.IPG shares rose 3 per cent to $18.45 by close of trading in New York. Omnicom fell 3 per cent to $66.97.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
39;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-10-21T17:46:22Z;Omnicom says digital ads are stealing share from TV;;Television’s $70bn advertising business isn’t dead yet. So says John Wren, chief executive of Omnicom, one of the world’s biggest advertising companies.But Mr Wren’s message on Tuesday may be cold comfort to network executives who are seeing digital outlets grab more money once firmly earmarked for broadcast and cable.“I believe that trend will continue. I don’t think TV’s dead,” Mr Wren told investors on Omnicom’s earnings call on Tuesday. He is the latest industry executive to acknowledge that the digital ad business is getting a boost from the proliferation of online content and from the valuable targeting data held by companies like Facebook.“When it comes to TV, there has been, I’d say, a shift. . . . [If] you went back a couple of years, there was an urgency on the part of clients to make certain that they didn’t miss out on the programming that they wanted. With all of the various choices how to reach the audiences you need to reach today and our ability to do it, there wasn’t that urgency [this year].”Mr Wren’s remarks follow the first drop in early advertising-buying for fall TV programmes in the US since the recession. TV dollars are “being diverted into other areas,” Mr Wren said, meaning spending is unlikely to pick up during the rest of the season.It may not be entirely bad news for TV network owners, however. With companies including HBO and CBS moving into online subscriptions, television’s old guard is making sure a portion of digital advertising dollars flows back into their pockets.“A great number of the people that own the content that we’re going to want to be able to use to put online is part owned by what you would refer to as the traditional media owners,” Mr Wren said. “So they may not get the money out of TV, [but] they may get it out of some other source.”Omnicom, which oversees about $50bn in global ad spend for brands including Pepsi, McDonald’s and Nissan, has been advising its clients to move up to a quarter of their TV ad dollars to online video. It has struck partnerships with Facebook and others to use valuable data on how people behave online to sell targeted ad campaigns.These moves “are increasingly important as advertisers shift from mass marketing to mass personalisation,” Mr Wren said.Mr Wren’s comments came as Omnicom reported an overall lift in third-quarter revenue and profit and said it would exceed its full-year growth target.Net income rose 25 per cent to $239.5m, or 95 cents a share – better than the 90 cents Wall Street had forecast. Revenue was up 7 per cent to $3.7m on strong performance in the US, which accounts for two-thirds of total sales.The company is projecting 4 per cent organic revenue growth this year. The performance marked a second straight upbeat quarter for Omnicom following the failure of its $35bn merger with Publicis in May.Omnicom shares were up 1.5 per cent to $68.27 on Tuesday.
40;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-09-29T16:39:04Z;Facebook to use its data to target advertising across web;Social network takes aim at Google by targeting ads at its users on third-party sites;Facebook has started to use the vast trove of data it has collected about the 1.3bn people who use the social network to target advertising across the rest of the internet.The company on Monday relaunched Atlas, the ad serving platform it bought from Microsoft in 2013, to enable advertisers to target Facebook users across other websites and mobile apps. Until now, Facebook has only applied users’ data within its own sites, such as Instagram, and to a limited number of third-party mobile apps.The move is Facebook’s biggest challenge in advertising yet to Google, which dominates the market for serving display ads through a subsidiary called DoubleClick.“They are going head to head with Google,” said Tim Webster, chief strategy officer and co-founder of The Exchange Lab, a digital advertising company. “It is good for advertisers because there will be more choices.”Facebook said that Omnicom, the world’s second-largest advertising group, had entered into a partnership with Atlas to use the ad-serving technology across all its agencies. Pepsi and Intel are among the first clients to use the technology.Erik Johnson, head of Atlas, said in a blog post on Monday that the main way that advertisers have traditionally targeted people online, using only small tracking files known as cookies, was “flawed”.Cookies do not work well on mobile devices and in apps, which are becoming an increasingly important way in which people using the internet.By linking people’s ad interactions to their Facebook accounts – which contain data on age, location and interests – Atlas would allow marketers to “reach real people across devices, platforms and publishers”, he said.Facebook accounted for almost 6 per cent of global digital ad revenues in 2013, and is expected to reach nearly 8 per cent by the end of this year, according to eMarketer, the research group.While Google dominates search advertising, the biggest form of online advertising, Facebook has quickly gained ground in the market for display advertising thanks to its huge user base.Facebook surpassed Google in the US display ad market last year, taking almost 19 per cent of the $18bn market, according to eMarketer.Facebook started experimenting with serving ads outside of its own sites in April, when it launched Facebook Audience Network, a mobile advertising network that allows advertisers to buy ads on a limited number of third-party apps that have direct relationships with Facebook.Advertisers are only allowed to buy ads through Facebook Audience Network as an extension of an existing campaign by the social network, and they are limited to using Facebook’s ad formats.Atlas, by contrast, will enable advertisers to deliver almost any type of ad format on almost any site on the internet – using Facebook data to help target a specific audience.One of the big selling points of Atlas will be that it can accurately track people across different devices, as each Facebook user uses the same ID to log in to their desktop, mobile phone or tablet.But Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research, cautioned that Facebook’s relaunch of Atlas was unlikely to lead to a significant increase in revenues immediately. Instead, the move “lays the groundwork to do even more interesting things” and could presage the launch of a demand-side platform, a tool that helps advertisers bid for ads across the internet.In its privacy policy, Atlas said people can opt out of receiving its targeted ads by filling out a special form. But it added that even when someone opts out, Atlas will “continue to collect the same information when you browse the web, see or click on an advertisement that we deliver or measure, or use one of our advertisers’ apps”.
41;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-09-07T17:15:50Z;Mad men get worked up over ad trading desks;;"For the world’s largest marketing services companies such as WPP, Publicis and Omnicom, buying and selling online advertising space has become a lucrative business. But the agency groups face a growing problem: many advertisers are worried that they are being exploited by opaque business practices.A number of advertisers are beginning to question the way agency holding companies make money from selling digital ads, the fastest-growing part of the $500bn global ad market. Specifically, they are questioning the way the big agency groups operate so-called trading desks.Such operations, which sit within the holding groups alongside the media buying agencies, specialise in programmatic ad buying: using computer algorithms and data to deliver targeted ads across a variety of digital media platforms.In a survey published last week by the World Federation of Advertisers, a global trade association whose members include Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson, two-thirds of respondents said they felt that their agency had not been clear about the business model of its trading desk.The survey, based on responses from 43 brands whose annual marketing spend totals $35bn, also found that the use of agency trading desks had declined 15 per cent over the past year. Meanwhile, use of independent trading desks not owned by agency groups had surged.The largest trading desks are WPP’s Xaxis, Omnicom’s Accuen and Publicis’s Audience on Demand.Xaxis is the biggest and has attracted the most criticism as the pioneer of a controversial practice known as “arbitrage”. It buys ad space in bulk on its own account, then sells it on to a client at a higher price, without revealing the size of the mark-up. This model turns Xaxis into a vendor, rather than merely acting as an agent and is thought to be highly lucrative for the advertising group. It also builds technology to target the advertising at specific audiences, using a vast trove of its proprietary data.“It’s like an agency on steroids,” says a rival.This lack of transparency about the margin it makes when it resells that ad space has irked many advertisers.Historically, standard practice within agencies was to provide clients with a clear breakdown of how much they paid for ad space and the fees they charged for providing the service.But Bob Wootton of Isba, a trade body that represents UK advertisers, said that his members are increasingly concerned that WPP and its peers are moving away from a transparent agency model.“In this new world, the intermediaries have become de facto media owners,” he said.Such doubts could become a big problem for agency groups, which have all invested heavily in building their own centralised trading desks. WPP this year estimated that Xaxis was worth $4.5bn based on the market valuation of similar companies.In July, Omnicom revealed that Accuen was also trading as a principal, rather than an agent. It added that the division has become one of the best-performing units of the group.Publicis, the third largest ad group, is marketing its trading desk as being more transparent than those of its rivals. Audience On Demand said it does not engage in media arbitrage. However, Publicis’s rivals believe that it benefits financially from its relationships with media owners and technology companies in ways that are not always fully understood by clients.All the agencies said they are clear with clients about how their trading desks work. WPP, for instance, said that before clients spend any money through Xaxis, they need to “opt in” to the platform and sign a contract that explains its business model.Brian Lesser, chief executive of Xaxis, argued that there is nothing wrong with the company acting as a principal, rather than an agent – as long as it delivers good value for clients. Xaxis “is not an agency and has never claimed to be one, so you wouldn’t expect it to have an agency business model”, he said.“We take risk on our ad inventory and we invest heavily in technology and data,” he explained. “Because of that business model, we don’t disclose our raw material costs.”But many marketers believe that the real problem is that trading desks sit alongside traditional media buying agencies within big ad groups. This creates the possibility of conflicts of interest, whereby a media planner pushes sales to its sister division.“No buying entity should be in a position to buy from itself,” said Brian Jacobs, a consultant and author of Spending Advertising Money.WPP is adamant that its agencies, which include MediaCom, MEC and Mindshare, are free to choose whatever is best for their clients; there is no mandate to spend a certain amount of money with Xaxis.For example, Unilever, the consumer goods group and one of WPP’s biggest clients, chose not to use Xaxis. WPP accommodated that decision by creating a separate trading desk for the company within Mindshare.Xaxis this year accounted for about $750m of the roughly $10bn that WPP clients spent on digital ad space, and accounts for the bulk of the group’s client spending on programmatic ad buying.Yet, while its revenue model is controversial, many people argue that it is justified.Xaxis has argued that by buying media space in bulk using its own money, it is able to negotiate lower prices from media owners and offer innovative products that would otherwise be unavailable.Brian Weiser, analyst at Pivotal Research, said there is “a real risk that incentives may encourage agency practitioners to direct business to sibling entities.But, he added: “If you don’t trust your agency in the first place, why are you working with them?”"
42;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-08-31T14:33:00Z;Yannick Bolloré: a buccaneer’s son at the helm of Havas;The French advertising group’s head on its digital transition;"The world according to Yannick Bolloré consists of two types of people: those who, faced with change, hunker down and try to protect what they have; and those who welcome disruption and use it to spot new opportunities.As chairman and chief executive of Havas, one of the world’s largest advertising groups, Mr Bolloré should know. The digital age has shaken the industry in ways that few could have imagined just a decade ago. Along the way, it has presented opportunities but also huge challenges to agencies unwilling or unable to adapt.So which of the two is the 34-year-old Mr Bolloré? He has only been CEO since the start of 2014 but the French group’s recent performance suggests he has a chance to prove himself as the latter. Second-quarter organic growth was 7.9 per cent higher than a year before, almost double consensus expectations. New clients this year include Disney and Barclays.Sitting in his office, a glass-walled box with a Castiglioni “Arco” lamp, a square rather than a traditional rectangular-shaped desk and no obvious boss’s chair, the tanned Mr Bolloré says that he is “thrilled” with the results.A year ago, things did not look nearly so good. Publicis and Omnicom had just announced their ultimately ill-fated “merger of equals” to create what would have become the industry’s largest player.In a world where competitors had identified size as a necessary condition to fund technology investments and gain access to the technology of other companies at competitive prices, sixth-placed Havas seemed too small to succeed alone.“It was keeping me up at night,” admits Mr Bolloré about his rivals’ plans. “It made me think a lot about scale and it forced us to accelerate the pace of change.”Mr Bolloré puts Havas’s recent success down to two things. The first is that the group has not only grasped digital but has started to run with it. One consequence is that he is now hiring more mathematicians than creatives or media people.“The type of person we are now hiring has changed so much that it has affected the dress code here,” he says. “They dress more casually but also much more geeky.”Education:Studied audiovisual communications at Paris-Dauphine University

Family:
Married to Chloé Bouygues, niece of billionaire Martin Bouygues. Has three daughters and a stepdaughterHavas’s mathematicians create algorithms to turn big data into smart data. “There has never been so much data out there,” says Mr Bolloré, whose fitted black suit, crisp white shirt and black Hermès tie suggest that he has yet to join the geeks himself. “But what is the point if you cannot use it to give business insight to your clients?”He says that the maths whizzes at Havas have developed algorithms that not only enable clients to adapt the way they advertise their products online but are also producing much higher conversion rates of online advertising into sales.The second strategy has been to instil collaboration among the creatives and media teams, but also between agencies – something that he says was absent before. “It was like Game of Thrones,” says Mr Bolloré, tall, engaging and with a thick, slightly wild head of hair. “You would have to get people to leave their weapons at the door.”“Together”, the name of his strategy to foster teamwork within the organisation, may fall short of Havas’s external standards for catchy and clever branding. Internally, though, it seems to have worked. “The atmosphere is now great here at Havas,” says Mr Bolloré. “If you are a family, you need to be able to sit around the same table and have lunch together.”What about size in advertising’s brave new world? After all, there is still a consensus that you need to be big regardless of how happy your staff are. Mr Bolloré agrees. “A group needs to have scale because if you don’t you cannot manage a global client,” he says. “But Havas has scale,” pointing to its 16,000 employees and presence in more than 100 countries.The proposed Publicis-Omnicom transatlantic merger plans finally sank in May this year amid delays in regulatory approval and insurmountable differences over key executive appointments. Strangely, perhaps, Mr Bolloré says that the news did not please him. “I was not happy to see the Publicis-Omnicom merger fail because they would have created an unmanageable monster.”He says it is hard to quantify how much Havas benefited from the wasted effort both of its rivals put into the proposed tie-up. But he adds: “For sure, it disrupted their day-to-day business.”Mr Bolloré, who has three daughters and a stepdaughter, always knew that he would end up in business. That may have had something to do with his own father – Vincent Bolloré, industrialist and occasional corporate raider, whose Bolloré Group owns 36 per cent of Havas and is also the largest shareholder of French media and entertainment group Vivendi.Since Mr Bolloré senior became Vivendi chairman this summer, speculation has grown about a possible tie-up between the media and entertainment group and Havas. Mr Bolloré senior and, most recently Arnaud de Puyfontaine, Vivendi’s new chief executive, have dismissed any such ideas.The family legacy is strong. Mr Bolloré lives in the same house in which he grew up with his two brothers and one sister in Paris’s 16th arrondissement. His office, though remodelled, is the same one that belonged to his great grandfather and to Vincent Bolloré. Located in Puteaux on the western fringe of Paris, it offers an expansive view of the River Seine, the Bois de Boulogne and the Eiffel Tower.He dedicates the little free time he has to playing sport. His talent for tennis has twice won him an annual celebrity competition at Roland Garros, an event that he helped to set up. Last year, he ran the Paris marathon, in four hours and 14 minutes.Mr Bolloré, whose short career has centred on media, says he loves advertising. But for all the seeming inevitability of his passage into the corporate world, he says his father never forced him into it.Instead, Vincent, who in the early 1980s stepped in to save the dying family business of manufacturing paper for cigarettes and bibles, taught more fundamental lessons. “He taught me the value of hard work and the culture of entrepreneurship,” he says.They appear to be lessons well learnt: in spite of coming from one of the richest families in France, Mr Bolloré has been clocking up the office hours. He described a short break over the summer as “the chance finally to meet my 11-month-old daughter”."
43;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-08-26T15:55:39Z;WPP: buying in bulk;Ad agency has stuck to strategy of buying little and often as rivals pursue glitzier deals;How WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell must have enjoyed that Friday back in May. As Publicis and Omnicom scrambled to explain why their merger failed, Sir Martin could sit back. WPP would remain the world’s largest advertising agency by revenues, and his two biggest rivals had been distracted for almost a year by a now-defunct tie-up. And over the 10 months that Publicis and Omnicom fiddled around trying to close the deal, WPP shares outperformed them both. Delicious.Operationally, too, WPP did well in the period. Its first-half revenues (before currency fluctuations) rose 11 per cent, with a decent organic performance and 36 acquisitions. Revenues at Omnicom and Publicis – on the same basis – rose at less than half that rate. WPP won work off both. Organic growth at Publicis was particularly weak. (Of course, just how much of this was down to merger distractions is hard to know).What is clearer is that consolidation in the advertising industry is unlikely to end with the failure of Publicis/Omnicom. The drama now moves to Interpublic, the world number five by market capitalisation, where hedge fund Elliott has taken a 6.7 per cent stake and may push for a sale.Should WPP jump in? There would certainly be scope for savings – WPP made an operating margin of 9.7 per cent in the first half, against 5.3 per cent at Interpublic. With net debt down to 1.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, WPP also has financial capacity – it even managed to increase its first half dividend by a tenth. But the WPP acquisition machine is fine-tuned for smaller deals. The group has taken control of 126 companies since 2009, and those that still report their own results are likely to make a decent return on capital of 12 per cent this year. Sir Martin is better off watching the glitzier deals from the sidelines.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
44;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;RTL buys online video advertising group;;Europe’s largest broadcasting group, RTL, has made an unusual bet on the growth of online video, paying $144m for a majority stake in digital advertising marketplace SpotXchange.The move – which contrasts with other broadcasters’ heavy investments in content– is designed to protect RTL’s advertising business as online ads are increasingly sold through automated systems via complex chains of intermediaries“Long term, we have the risk of being disintermediated” from the process of selling online video ads, said Guillaume de Posch, RTL’s co-chief executive.“We fully understand how to sell commercial spots on TV. But in online video, the world is much more atomised.”Founded in 2007 and based in the US, SpotXchange automates the process by which marketers buy ad slots from online video publishers. It processes more than 1bn auctions for ad impressions each day and claims to reach 335m users a month.RTL is the first TV broadcaster to buy an ad exchange. The deal follows a rush by media, technology and telecoms groups to buy ad exchanges. Facebook last month acquired video ad exchange Liverail, while AOL last year snapped up Adap.tv. Google, Twitter and Telefónica have also bought exchanges in recent years.The acquisition price, which may rise with earn-outs, values SpotXchange’s equity at six times expected revenues of $40m this year.Mr de Posch said RTL invested in the exchange because agencies and other intermediaries were becoming increasingly powerful in the complex business of trading online video ads.“We want to be present in the value chain, not only as a pure publisher [of online videos]”, but also as a seller of advertising, he said.Nonetheless, the deal is likely to raise questions about SpotXchange’s neutrality, given that it will be serving ads for videos owned by RTL as well as those of other broadcasters.SpotXchange’s chief executive, Mike Shehan, said in a statement that the company had decided to sell a 60 per cent stake to RTL, rather than become “one feature in a giant ad tech stack” by selling to a US tech group.“With this deal, SpotXchange reaffirms our commitment to serving publishers’ needs, as opposed to creating any conflict of interest with either the buy side or supply side,” he said.Mr de Posch said: “We’re not gobbling up this platform,” adding that RTL lacked a strong ad sales presence in the US, where SpotXchange is focused.Asked if SpotXchange would be used to serve advertising for all RTL’s short form online videos, he said: “It’s too early to say.”RTL’s focus remains on long online videos, where ads are still sold directly to agencies and brands. However, it has moved into short-form videos, where ads are increasingly traded on platforms such as SpotXchange.Such platforms perform auctions between ad buyers in the milliseconds after an internet user clicks on a particular video.Shares in RTL, which is controlled by German media group Bertelsmann, have risen by one-third since a secondary public offering last April.
45;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-07-24T21:22:01Z;Activist hedge fund Elliott to push for Interpublic sale;;Elliott Management, the activist hedge fund, has acquired a stake in Interpublic Group and plans to push the $8.5bn advertising company to sell itself to a rival such as Publicis, Omnicom or WPP.Following weeks of rumours that it was building a stake in IPG, Elliott disclosed on Thursday that it had acquired a 6.7 per cent interest in the company, which owns McCann, Lowe and Partners and IPG Mediabrands.Elliott, the $24bn hedge fund founded by Paul Singer, said it intends “to engage in a constructive dialogue” with IPG’s board “regarding steps to maximise shareholder value.”According to people familiar with the fund’s thinking, Elliott wants IPG to explore a sale of the entire business to one of its rivals, including Publicis, Omnicom, WPP, Dentsu or Havas.The people added that “all options are on the table” for the company. In parallel with exploring a sale, Elliott believes IPG has plenty of room to run its business more efficiently.IPG shares rose 1.5 per cent to $20.15 on Thursday.Speculation has swirled for years that IPG would be an attractive acquisition target for one of its peers, as the advertising industry consolidated under a handful of large holding companies.France’s Publicis and US-based Omnicom planned to merge in a $35bn deal this year, but the transaction fell apart in May as the two companies could not agree on leadership.“Everyone in the media and advertising ecosystem appears to be in an arms race for scale,” said Christopher Vollmer, at consultancy Strategy&, pointing to Rupert Murdoch’s $73bn overture to Time Warner and pressure from Google, Facebook and consultants such as Accenture and Deloitte.Elliott is betting that any acquirer of IPG would be willing to pay a hefty premium on the basis that there are opportunities to run the group more efficiently and improve its operating margins.IPG last year reported an operating margin of about 9 per cent, compared to an average for its peer group of about 15 per cent.Elliott has yet to meet IPG’s management but hopes to do so in the next couple of weeks.IPG said: “We meet with shareholders regularly and are open to engaging in dialogue with Elliott Management to assess their perspectives.”Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Bernstein, said the most likely buyers for IPG would be other smaller-sized advertising groups “who need scale”, namely France’s Havas and Japan’s Dentsu.Dentsu, which bought the UK’s Aegis in 2012 for £3.2bn, is the most likely buyer for IPG, said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research Group.“It’s been a year [since the Aegis deal closed]. It’s entirely realistic to assume they would be the one bidder to have capacity and the will.”IPG would be a good fit for the acquisitive Japanese group by giving it creative agency networks outside of Japan, where Dentsu is looking to expand, he said. The Japanese company, which has a market capitalisation of $11.5bn, would likely be able to raise the money needed for a “meaningful” offer for IPG.In an interview with the Financial Times this week, Publicis chief executive Maurice Lévy ruled out any future megadeals on a par with its failed merger with Omnicom. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, has also this year played down the need for a big deal with one of its peers.Elliott Management: Feared reputationElliott Management is one of the world’s oldest and most aggressive hedge funds with a feared reputation for its legalistic approach to activist investing.The hedge fund, which has generated an average return of more than 14 per cent a year since Mr Singer founded it in the late 1970s, typically takes stakes in companies it believes are underperforming and then presses their management to take actions to increase their share prices, or to sell the company.Mr Singer has recently attracted attention for his fund’s long-running battle with the government of Argentina over it paying out on defaulted bonds, which has seen Buenos Aires label Elliott a “vulture fund”.While many of Elliott’s campaigns against companies have made the fund large profits, others have not always gone to plan. A battle to force the Swiss pharmaceutical group Actelion to sell itself in 2011 was defeated and Elliott sold its stake in the company.
46;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-07-22T14:34:01Z;Omnicom profits up on advertising growth;;Omnicom eased worries over its failed merger with France’s Publicis as it reported better than expected revenue and profit in the second quarter, boosted by higher advertising spending around the world.The $35bn merger between the two advertising groups fell apart in May amid clashes in culture, power struggles and concerns over tax and regulatory hurdles, and some analysts raised concerns that Omnicom’s business would be disrupted as a result.But Omnicom on Tuesday said net income rose 13 per cent to $318.9m, or $1.23 a share, from $281.7m, or $1.09 a share. Excluding some items including a tax benefit related to the merger expenses, earnings of $1.20 a share were ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1.16.Global revenue advanced 6.4 per cent to $3.87bn, higher than an expected $3.8bn, with domestic revenue up 7.9 per cent and international sales 4.9 per cent higher.Organic revenue – a measure excluding acquisitions, disposals and currency effects that is a closely watched metric for advertising – grew 5.8 per cent. Advertising revenue was 10.5 per cent higher. Omnicom’s clients include big marketers such as Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo, Apple and Toyota.Global ad spending is set to grow 5.7 per cent this year to $545.4bn, according to research group eMarketer, with the US – which accounts for two-thirds of Omnicom’s revenue – rising 5.3 per cent.The results contrasted with Publicis’s second-quarter performance, also announced on Tuesday. The Paris-based group reported lower revenue and earnings in the face of slowness in Europe and emerging markets and a strong euro weighing on its North American business.Omnicom grew organic revenue across its regions, with the strongest increases in North America at 7.9 per cent, Latin America at 7.8 per cent and Asia Pacific at 5.1 per cent.The results included a $1.8m pre-tax charge related to the abandoned Publicis deal, mainly composed of professional fees.Omnicom’s shares were little changed at $71.25 on Tuesday morning in New York.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
47;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-05-23T17:29:37Z;David Abbott, advertising executive, 1938-2014;Copywriter who evoked consumer emotion;"Advertising may often be denounced as dull, irritating or misleading; its practitioners ruthless and cynical. But David Abbott set himself apart from the 1960s types portrayed in Mad Men, although the man who came to be regarded as the most talented British copywriter of his generation began his career at the time in which the US television series was set.Abbott, who has died aged 75, built Abbott Mead Vickers into the UK’s largest advertising agency with a style, wit and humanity that changed the tone of British advertising and helped London to rival New York as a centre for creativity.Through his work for clients including Yellow Pages, Volvo and J Sainsbury, Abbott, along with his partners Peter Mead and Adrian Vickers won the loyalty of employees by never making redundancies during recessions. He also gained wider acclaim for sticking to principles such as refusing to work for tobacco companies.Though quietly spoken, Abbott made a significant contribution to Britain’s cultural and corporate life by demonstrating that advertisers could – and should – treat their audience with intelligence and respect, rather than trotting out exaggerated claims in turgid prose. As Mr Mead says: “He had a warmth and an understanding of the better parts of the human psyche. Yes he was selling things to them, but hopefully he was selling things that didn’t insult their intelligence or hector them or irritate them.”One of his most famous ads was for The Economist. In white lettering on a red background, it stated: “I never read The Economist” – Management Trainee. Aged 42.” For a supermarket chain facing a price war he produced the line: “At Sainsbury’s, if we don’t sell our mince in a day, we don’t sell it.” Until that point, supermarket advertising was all about low prices – but Abbott recognised that consumers also cared about quality.On television, perhaps the most striking was an ad he created for BT starring the actor Bob Hoskins, who died last month. In the telecoms group’s commercial Hoskins says nothing for 30 seconds, thus showing how frustrating it can be to wait for a phone call. He breaks the silence with a short monologue and the line: “It’s good to talk.”Abbott would come up with ads such as these with his feet on his desk, an A3 layout pad on his lap and a blue Artline pen in his hand. “I spend a lot of time fact finding and don’t start writing until I have too much to say,” he wrote in an article for The Copy Book in 1995. Such was his meticulousness, he would sometimes rework a headline 50 or 60 times “to get the thought and balance exactly right”.Born in London on October 11 1938, Abbott won a scholarship to study history at Oxford. But he dropped out after a few terms, after the death of his father. As the eldest child, it fell to him to run the family’s two struggling general merchandise shops in the west London neighbourhood of Shepherd’s Bush. Within two years they closed.Unemployed and unsure what to do with his life, Abbott was browsing the shelves of a bookshop when he came across Madison Avenue by Martin Mayer, which described life in the world of advertising. “Well, that sounds all right,” he recalled thinking. Not long afterwards he found a job in the advertising department of Kodak in the UK. That gave him the experience needed to obtain what he really wanted: a role as a copywriter at an agency. That was Mather & Crowther, now part of Ogilvy.Abbott’s breakthrough came in 1965 when he moved to the London office of Doyle Dane Bernbach, a US firm that, recognising his brilliance, flew him to New York for nine months with his wife Eve; she survives him, along with four children. Exhausted by the move and a heatwave that smothered the city, Abbott was initially overwhelmed. “I walked to the office crying, although it was so hot my tears passed for perspiration,” he recalled in his leaving speech to colleagues at AMV in 1998.Life soon improved. Abbott was taken under the wing of Bill Bernbach, the visionary creative director of DDB, whose mission was to “prove to the world that good taste, good art, and good writing can be good selling”. This was a credo that Abbott took back with him to London, founding AMV in 1977. His reputation was already formidable but it was there that he produced much of his best work. The company, now called AMV BBDO and part of Omnicom of the US, has ranked as the UK’s biggest ad agency for the past 18 years.In retirement he wrote a novel, The Upright Piano Player, which was published in 2010. The story describes a successful businessman whose life unravels after he retires and falls victim to a random act of violence. Abbott was working on a second one when he died."
48;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-05-16T10:53:59Z;Letter from Lex: let’s make a deal;Spring is in the air and M&A bankers are looking forward to a long, busy summer;Readers,Spring is in the air and M&A bankers are looking forward to a long, busy summer. Yes, last week’s collapse of the Publicis/Omnicom merger was a blow. But there is plenty more where that came from.The possibility of a Pfizer/AstraZeneca deal still has the politicians talking (the chief executives of both were hauled before the UK parliament this week). It has also sparked discussion here at the FT, prompting a Lex v Lombard video debate on the merits of government interference.Done the right way, deals add lots of value. But when bankers and executives are excited there is also the possibility that shareholders end up worse off. Investors in BSkyB, for example, might like the idea of the UK satellite TV operator buying its namesakes in Italy and Germany. But the deals could leave its balance sheet laden with debt. And while the combination of bricks and mortar retailers Carphone Warehouse and Dixons might make sense in the face of competition from the internet, the deal structure (a “merger of equals” with few cost savings) leaves much to be desired.Another deal which left much to be desired was the 70p a share acquisition of Essar Energy by its parent, Essar Global. The energy company floated in 2010 at 420p a share, but this week its independent directors “reluctantly” advised minority investors to accept the Essar Global offer.Changes to the UK listing regime due later this month might make this kind of buyout more difficult to achieve, but investors should be wary of excessive legal blocks to dealmaking. This week the French government gave itself new powers to block takeovers in five sectors. And in the US, the use of poison pills by companies to block activist investors has been in the spotlight.It is all enough to make investors wish for a bit of low profile stability. Compass, a UK based contract caterer, has been providing that for years and results this week suggested that it will keep doing more of the same. And Macy’s looks like one of the more stable US retailers, despite a tough first quarter.Have a good weekend.Oliver Ralph, Deputy Head of Lex
49;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-05-15T16:59:58Z;Dixons / Carphone: party line;Combination, like most mergers of equals, looks clunky;Argh. Another “ merger of equals”. The collapse last week of the Publicis/Omnicom merger did not deter UK retailers Dixons and Carphone Warehouse from trying something similar. True, the market capitalisations of the two are similar at £1.7bn. Although Dixons’ operating profit is expected to be 35 per cent larger than Carphone’s this year, the two are also similar at the net profit line. The combination, like most mergers of equals, still looks clunky. There is an excess of senior management – a chair, two deputy chairs, a CEO, a deputy CEO, a CFO and two divisional CEOs: plenty of potential for conflict there. And, in the short term at least, the operating businesses will not be combined.So shareholders should hope for a compelling rationale. That means plenty of cost savings. The two are offering synergies of £80m per year. Half of that is revenue synergies, which are tough to deliver. When it comes to pure cost savings there is no big plan to shut stores, so the two are offering £40m per year, or under 4 per cent of the combined operating cost base. Not a huge amount.Nor is the long-term strategic logic crystal clear. Dixons and Carphone like to talk about the “internet of things”. In the future, your fridge, TV, central heating and jacuzzi will all be connected to the internet and controlled by your mobile phone. Who better to sell, install and service this collection than a combination of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse? Perhaps, although selling internet fridges has been tried before, and failed. The deal looks more like two bricks-and-mortar retailers clinging to each other as the internet invades their territory.Yes, Dixons and Carphone need to react to these changes. But a partnership might have achieved similar ends. This looks like a deal whose rationale is vague, with limited cost savings, wrapped up in a structure that is inherently weak.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
50;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-05-09T18:41:00Z;Publicis-Omnicom entente cordiale ends in recriminations;;The feuding that derailed a $35bn planned merger of Publicis and Omnicom broke into the open on Friday even as the two advertising companies sought to rebrand themselves as having better prospects alone.The two company leaders, who had sealed the deal to create the world’s largest marketing group with a rooftop embrace in Paris nine months ago and had planned to share power as co-CEOs, quickly returned to being rivals.Maurice Lévy, the Publicis chairman and chief executive, said that John Wren, his opposite number at Omnicom, had sought to turn the merger into a takeover by trying to put both his chief financial officer and general counsel in top roles at the combined company.Publicis’s founder Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet would have “turned in his grave” at the prospect of a takeover, he told French television.In an interview with the Financial Times on Friday, Mr Lévy said: “We thought that maybe it is much better to stop before going to the church rather than going to the judge.”From New York, Mr Wren said: “It was better to do what we did than enter a bad marriage.” Omnicom had always foreseen cultural differences, he told a conference call on Friday, “but I know now that we had underestimated the depth of these differences.”There is no such thing as a merger of equals. And there is no Easter bunny, eitherContinue reading . . .He denied the clash had been personal, however. “It was never about me or my ego. It is about the 70,000 people of Omnicom,” he said: “We thought the deal would be done in six months. Nine months later, we still had many of those [merger] requirements outstanding.”If he had to summarise what killed the deal in a 140-character tweet, he added, “it would be, corporate culture, complexity and time. And I would still have 100 characters left.”Each of the issues could have been solved, he maintained, but “it was taking too much time and that certainly did not bode well for running what would be a very large multinational company”.The end of the Franco-US alliance marked one of the largest merger failures in history, and came after fights over senior roles, regulatory obstacles and tax concerns.I’ve been wondering about the most suitable place to commemorate the death of the Omnicom-Publicis deal. How about Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris, where Oscar Wilde and The Doors’ Jim Morrison are buried?Continue reading . . .The two sides agreed that there would be no break-up fee, but the collapse of the deal came at a cost, with Mr Wren estimating that his company alone would see an impact of about $55m to $60m before taxes.Shares in Publicis rose 0.5 per cent to €60.98 on Friday, however, and Omnicom shares were up 1.3 per cent at $67.07 in lunchtime trading after the US group said that it would ask its board to raise its dividend and could start buying back stock as soon as next week.The two companies’ heads issued a cordial joint statement, saying: “We, of course, remain competitors, but maintain a great respect for one another.”But they made clear that they would not rush into any other deal in a hurry.A third competitor was quick to welcome the end of a deal that would have reordered the global marketing industry.Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, which would have lost its leading position in the industry’s billings tables to the planned Publicis Omnicom Group, said that he was not surprised the talks had failed, even if they had fallen apart earlier than he had expected.The deal “seems to have been driven by emotion to knock WPP off its perch and, of course, by French charm”, he said from China: “In the end it was a case of eyes bigger than tummy.”
51;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-05-09T17:08:29Z;Advertising titans call off ‘merger of equals’;;As John Wren stood on the rooftop of Publicis’ Paris headquarters overlooking the Arc de Triomphe last year, he turned to his longtime rival Maurice Lévy and commented on the priceless view.“It can be yours,” Mr Lévy, chief executive of Publicis, told the boss of New York-based Omnicom.That joke set off months of covert meetings between the two titans of advertising land for a $35bn “ merger of equals” announced to champagne toasts in July. The Franco-US tie-up would combine the world’s second and third-largest marketing groups by revenue to create an industry leader designed to compete in a new era of media and advertising increasingly controlled by technology.The deal also shunted nemesis Sir Martin Sorrell’s WPP into a distant second, leaving him uncharacteristically sidelined.Those ambitious plans all fell apart this week. Publicis and Omnicom admitted that, after delays in regulatory and tax approval, and amid insurmountable disagreements between Mr Wren and Mr Lévy, the proposed merger had ended in failure.In calling off the merger, Mr Wren pointed to the complexity of tax, regulatory and cultural hurdles, which created delays. “It was never about me or my ego. It is about the 70,000 people of Omnicom,” he says.But ever since the initial Paris rooftop meeting, the merger was always about the small clutch of personalities at the top of an industry supposedly driven by creative talents several layers below them.“There was lack of any real industrial logic behind the merger other than the egos of each side,” Sir Martin says from Beijing, laughing at the demise of the deal that he had spent the past nine months trashing. “Each side thought that they would be in charge.”The two leaders could not strike a more contrasting profile. Mr Lévy’ s St Tropez tan and effortless charm jars with Mr Wren, a former accountant who keeps a low profile in an industry filled with colourful personalities.Mr Lévy says there had been a “drift” in the talks that had threatened the guiding principle of a merger of equals. The two men had agreed to be joint chief executives for the first 30 months, with Mr Lévy then becoming chairman of the merged group and Mr Wren sole chief executive.But with a board split down the middle, and with symmetry of power binding Mr Wren and Mr Lévy, they were unable to agree on a chief financial officer. “The balance was not being respected,” Mr Lévy says.“He wanted to have his CFO as CFO, and his general counsel as general counsel. So as you can see, the key position of the holding company would have been in the hands of Omnicom people and this was unacceptable.”Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Bernstein, argues that the struggle to appoint the CFO was central because both knew that the appointee would wield tremendous, tiebreaking power. “It was only human for both CEOs to want their trusted staff around them but you can only have one CFO,” he says.Analysts say that life as two separate groups throws up several clear challenges at a time when the world of advertising is changing quickly. One is the issue of scale, after the two companies spent the past nine months trumpeting the benefits of size.As separate companies, Publicis and Omnicom have less bargaining power against distribution platforms such as Google and Facebook, as well as traditional media such as broadcast TV networks. “They are the winners,” says Mr Aspesi.Mr Wren, who estimated that the merger’s collapse would cost Omnicom an estimated $55m to $60m before taxes, emphasised that the advertising group would have a bright future on its own.“We have stated from the very, very beginning that this was a proposed merger of opportunity, not necessity at any level,” he says.Nevertheless, the failure to complete the merger is an embarrassing blow to the two executives. “I have no problem saying that it is very disappointing,” admits Mr Lévy on Friday.It also raises urgent questions about succession at Publicis. Aged 72, and with his mandate expiring in December 2015, Mr Lévy acknowledges that the board will have to start working on a plan “this summer”, but says that he would not be directly involved in the process.“I want a clear and neat solution but it is up to the board,” he says. “I am not designating my successor.”For Omnicom, Mr Wren says the advertising group will continue to evaluate deal opportunities but does not anticipate any material transactions in the immediate future. “I think it would be a very long time before I try to do a merger of equals again,” Mr Wren says.
52;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-05-09T12:04:52Z;Lévy blames takeover risk for Publicis-Omnicom merger failure;;The $35bn merger of Publicis and Omnicom collapsed after the deal to create the world’s largest advertising company started to turn into a takeover by the US group, according to the head of the French group.Maurice Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Publicis Groupe, said that John Wren, chief executive of Omnicom, wanted the merged entity to use both his chief financial officer and general counsel, putting the key roles in the hands of the US company, which would have been unacceptable.“When we have an agreement, we have to keep it,” Mr Lévy said in an interview. “We thought that maybe it is much better to stop before going to the church.”Speaking on French television earlier, he said that Publicis founder Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet would have “turned in his grave” at the prospect of a takeover and that the company would not seek an alternative partner.The failure of the Franco-US alliance marks one of the largest merger breakdowns in history and up-ends expectations for an advertising industry that had been seeking to consolidate in response to the turmoil that companies such as Google and Facebook have wrought on their traditional business.The planned deal had been mired in management infighting, regulatory trouble and tax issues. Both boards have agreed to terminate the proposed deal with no break-up fee.There is no such thing as a merger of equals. And there is no Easter Bunny, eitherContinue reading . . .In a joint statement on Friday, Mr Lévy and Mr Wren said: “The challenges that still remained to be overcome, in addition to the slow pace of progress, created a level of uncertainty detrimental to the interests of both groups and their employees, clients and shareholders. We have thus jointly decided to proceed along our independent paths. We, of course, remain competitors, but maintain a great respect for one another.”Shares of Publicis rose 0.5 per cent to €60.98 on Friday.One person familiar with the situation said: “We think it is better to have each company going back on its own. The risk was too high,” adding that the decision “was neither pleasant nor an easy one to make but it was the necessary one”.Talk has swirled around the advertising world for weeks of frayed relations between Mr Lévy and Mr Wren, and their lieutenants. One person familiar with the matter confirmed there had been a “culture clash”.The termination shatters the two companies’ vision for a communications company that could set a “new standard” for the industry. The collapse will also be a personal blow to executives at both companies, who unveiled the deal with champagne toasts by the Arc de Triomphe nine months ago.Mr Wren on Thursday night told the FT that the advertising group would had a bright future on its own: “We have stated from the very, very beginning that this was a proposed merger of opportunity, not necessity at any level.”He estimated that the collapse of the proposed union would cost the company about $55m to $60m before taxes.I’ve been wondering about the most suitable place to commemorate the death of the Omnicom-Publicis deal.

The deal “seems to have been driven by emotion to knock WPP off its perch and, of course, by French charm”, he said: “In the end it was a case of eyes bigger than tummy.”The merger was promoted as a bet that scale matters in a media and marketing world increasingly controlled by technology. But from the start, rivals and analysts warned that the deal faced client conflicts, regulatory risks and culture clashes. The tensions escalated in recent weeks after Mr Wren told investors that unforeseen tax issues had thrown the merger into jeopardy.The deal was structured so that neither company nor their shareholders would incur tax, but the groups faced challenges receiving approval from tax authorities in France, the Netherlands and the UK.

The list goes on. No surprise, then, that the Publicis-Omnicom “merger of equals” collapsed on Friday, with the former voicing fears that it was becoming a takeover. It always was one.The announcement of the deal last July was accompanied by a 33-page slide presentation detailing the rationale, the combined company’s market position, special dividends for all, and the tax free nature of the deal. The PowerPoint was much shorter on Friday. The statement from the two groups referred vaguely to the challenges to be overcome and the slow pace of progress. Investors in both deserve a much clearer post mortem, given the dollars and human capital that this farce must have cost.What is next? The default position is to carry on as before. Omnicom has plenty of exposure to the US economic recovery. Publicis Groupe has strong positions in digital and emerging markets. All that is lost is $500m of potential cost savings. But last year the two decided that being together was better than being apart. The challenges they faced alone – such as the growth of Google and Facebook – have not changed.The deal might still be on track if the two had done away with the merger pretence and structured it as an acquisition (probably Omnicom, the larger of the two by revenue, buying Publicis). Yes, a premium would have been involved and the deal might not have sounded so cuddly to staff. But at least there would have been no confusion about control. The staff, to say nothing of investors, might have appreciated the honesty.Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but the “merger of equals” set alarm bells ringing from the start. Not even the PR professionals could spin that myth into reality.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
54;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-04-29T16:47:04Z;Tax avoidance: The Irish inversion;US companies are shifting their headquarters abroad to protect growing overseas cash piles;The global headquarters of Endo International is so new that, apart from a few desktop computers, the most visible purchase to date is the Nespresso machine in the kitchen. Located in the basement of a Georgian house in central Dublin, the company, which makes branded and generic medicines, does not even have a brass plate on the door.“We are just getting started,” says Blaine Davis, senior vice-president for corporate affairs, who will run the office with a skeleton staff on behalf of a group with annual sales of $2.6bn.Endo’s arrival in Fitzwilliam Square is part of one of the biggest trends in global mergers and acquisitions – a practice known as inversion. By moving their headquarters to another country, US companies are able to slash their tax rate.This week’s announcement by Pfizer that it wanted to take over AstraZeneca in a £60bn deal that would move its tax domicile to the UK is the latest and largest example of a pattern which is sweeping the pharmaceutical sector and beyond.Dozens of US multinationals have moved their tax base outside the country to escape the high tax rate, global reach and perverse incentives of a system that has encouraged companies to build up a $1tn cash pile trapped overseas.Yet inversions are increasingly contentious, focusing attention on corporate ploys when governments around the world are intent on cracking down on tax avoidance.For the US, the trend threatens billion of dollars of tax revenues and raises “significant policy concerns”, in the words of the US Treasury. In March, President Barack Obama announced plans to slam the door on inversions by the end of this year, a move the US Treasury said would raise $17bn over the coming decade.Inversions also shine a spotlight on the policies of the countries being chosen as the new tax base for businesses wanting to cut their tax bills. The UK led calls for an international crackdown on avoidance. But a series of business-friendly reforms in the UK have made it a desirable tax base for companies that are headquartered elsewhere. This is politically sensitive, as suggested by the delay in winning tax approvals reported by Omnicom and Publicis last week, threatening the $35bn merger to create the world’s largest advertising company.The popularity of inversions is starting to worry the Irish authorities. They fret that the country’s 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate – a pillar of Irish development policy – is being used for purposes for which it was not intended. That undermines Ireland’s insistence that it is not a tax haven, making it more difficult to defend its system in an international climate that is turning sharply against tax avoidance.Ireland began to adopt an active tax policy to lure foreign direct investment in the 1950s. In 1980 it introduced a 10 per cent tax on manufacturing, later changed to an across-the-board 12.5 per cent. This incentive, together with the flexibility of the tax regime, helped attract many pharmaceutical companies. Nine of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies now have operations in Ireland as well as leading technology companies including Google, Facebook and Twitter.Apart from tax, Ireland appeals as a hub for pharma and tech companies because many of their peers are already present. Its legal infrastructure is similar to the UK and the US, and it turned out graduates in record numbers in the 1980s and 1990s.Endo is one of the latest companies to be drawn to Ireland. Six months ago the Pennsylvania-based group, which employs 4,100 people, had no connection with Ireland. Now its global headquarters has arrived in Dublin following its purchase last November of Paladin Labs, a Canadian drugmaker with equally tentative links to Ireland.Besides Endo, recent similar inversion examples include Perrigo, Horizon Pharma, Actavis, Alkermes, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Covidien and Forest Laboratories.…For shareholders, the process is attractive. Cian McCourt, a partner and head of the New York office of A & L Goodbody, an Irish law firm, says inversions provide “a real boost” to earnings per share, retained earnings and cash flow. That has a big bearing on acquisition premiums. “It is bridging valuation gaps for sellers and sometimes exceeding sellers’ expectations,” he says.Endo, for example, is eyeing $75m of annual after-tax savings from “operational and tax synergies” arising from its rebirth as an Irish company.One driver of the deals is the trapped overseas cash of US multinationals, which makes foreign acquisitions attractive even if they do not subsequently relocate their businesses abroad. General Electric’s cash hoard of $57bn is one reason behind its bid to acquire Alstom of France.But inversions offer additional advantages by making it easier for companies to escape US tax on their offshore intellectual property, cutting US tax bills by loading their domestic businesses with debt, and making low foreign tax rates permanent. They halt the build-up of offshore cash. The cash pile is larger for healthcare companies than any sector except technology, accounting for 15 per cent of the $947bn total, according to a recent report by Moody’s.Ireland’s finance ministry argues that many of the factors driving the trend of inversions are “push rather than pull” – that the high rate of US tax rather than the low rate of Irish tax is behind the trend of US companies inverting into Ireland.Many US observers agree. Max Baucus, who chaired the Senate tax committee and is now ambassador to China, said last year: “It would be easy for us to attack these companies by calling them immoral and unpatriotic. But it’s more constructive to step back and ask, ‘what’s motivating these companies to move their headquarters abroad?’”Both Mr Obama and congressional Republicans have proposed cutting the US corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 28 per cent and 25 per cent respectively, and changing the tax treatment of foreign income to cut gaming by multinationals.But the bill has stalled because the White House and Congress disagree over the details. There is little political appetite for slashing business tax breaks and deductions that would help pay for a lower tax rate. Moreover, any reform would likely have to include changing the rates paid by individuals and small businesses as well, adding to the political challenge. The chances of tax reform advancing this year are slim to none, and it may be very difficult to reach a deal during Mr Obama’s administration.Still, Mr Obama and other lawmakers have tried to lay down some markers, including high-profile hearings in the Senate lambasting companies such as Apple and Caterpillar for tax avoidance strategies. Mr Obama sought to make it much more difficult to execute deals involving inversions by raising the threshold of shares needed to be transferred to foreign owners from 20 per cent to 50 per cent when a company moves abroad.That measure is unlikely to pass soon, but even so William McBride, chief economist of the Tax Foundation, a think-tank in Washington, described it as a “Berlin Wall technique” which would do nothing to solve the fundamental problem of an uncompetitive tax system.He predicted that big companies could end up spinning off divisions to get around anti-inversion rules which stop the largest companies from moving. “It is very likely we will see an acceleration of inversions.”Ireland’s finance ministry is becoming worried about the growing criticism. “In relation to transactions that may not involve real substance in terms of jobs and investment in the Irish economy, the [ministry] has concerns and is examining ways to discourage such transactions without damaging legitimate business activity,” says a ministry spokesman.Barry O’Leary, chief executive of IDA Ireland, the inward investment agency, says: “Transactions that rely solely on tax benefits, with no substance behind them, will not bring economic benefits to Ireland.”Deciding which transactions have “substance” could prove tricky, however. Mr Davis says Endo could have re-domiciled to any country because of the way it structured its purchase of Paladin. “We chose Ireland because a lot of pharma companies are based here, there is a big talent pool, and the skill set is very strong.”The demand for “substance” also raises tricky questions about how much of the Irish pharma industry’s profits are actually earned by its Irish operations. The industry has an undeniably big presence in Ireland. It pays more than €3bn of taxes in the country each year and has invested over €7bn in the past decade, according to the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association. But its profitability is out of proportion to its scale, a sign of tax planning that has allowed companies to route profits to tax havens such as Bermuda.The sector employs less than 2 per cent of Ireland’s workforce, yet data published by the US commerce department suggest that Ireland generated profits in 2011 of $21.8bn for US chemical and pharma companies. That is a third of all foreign profits for US companies in the sector, and about 40 per cent of all Irish corporate profits.…US pharma companies paid a tax rate of less than 6 per cent on over $100bn of Irish profits over the past decade, according to an FT analysis. It showed that the Irish subsidiaries of US chemical companies have cut their tax rates far below the statutory rate, from an average of 8 per cent in the seven years to 2004 to 4.5 per cent in the following seven years.The Irish government disputes the relevance of the data. But it faces criticism for facilitating the tax planning that results in very low tax rates for Irish subsidiaries.One tactic is the so-called “double Irish” structure that exploits different definitions of residence in the US and Irish tax codes to move profits from Ireland to Bermuda. This structure allows royalties paid by the Irish manufacturing subsidiary to end up in a company that is not taxable under either Irish or US rules.Tax arrangements of this sort are powerful attractions for US suitors. But they could be under threat. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is considering an overhaul of international tax rules to boost the taxing powers of countries where consumers are based. That would reduce Ireland’s lucrative role as the cornerstone of multinationals’ tax structures.In the US, despite the political deadlock over tax reform, bipartisan support is growing for moves to tax offshore intellectual property, which could erode Ireland’s appeal to US multinationals.Endo’s Mr Davis remains untroubled. “We’re looking to build leadership positions here,” he says over a coffee, stressing that the company will be relocating key personnel in research and development, finance, supply chain management, and support services. Looking around his cramped new global headquarters in Dublin, he adds: “Fitzwilliam Square is just our temporary space . . . But we are [in Ireland] to stay. This is now our global headquarters.”——————————————-Corporate tax rates: Flower pots and double IrishesCall it the ceramic flower pot dilemma. The headline rate of Irish corporation tax is 12.5 per cent, and calculations by PwC and the World Bank show the effective rate of tax levied on foreign company profits in Ireland is about 11.9 per cent.Yet a recent study by Jim Stewart, associate professor of finance at Trinity College Dublin, shows some US multinational subsidiaries operating in Ireland paid an effective rate of tax of just 2.2 per cent on their Irish activities in 2011.Prof Stewart argued that, in order for PwC and the World Bank to compare tax rates across the world, they created a hypothetical company that does not engage in tax planning, and was “small, domestically owned, has no imports or exports and produces and sells ceramic flower pots”. Such a company bears no resemblance to the US multinationals that operate in Ireland, ranging from big pharma (Pfizer, Alexion) to big tech (Intel, Google, Apple, Facebook). One of the big attractions is Ireland’s headline 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate. As recent examples show, that provides a basis for further cutting their global tax bills.Many US technology companies have taken advantage of a contentious loophole in Irish corporate law, known as the “double Irish”, which allowed them to be registered in Ireland without being tax-resident there. For example, Google holds its intellectual property in an Irish company that is tax-resident in Bermuda, which has a zero rate of corporate tax.However, Ireland is starting to yield to pressure to close especially egregious corporate tax loopholes. In the last budget, the government moved to ensure that companies incorporated in Ireland that were in effect “stateless” for tax purposes had to declare a tax residency in another jurisdiction or become liable for the Irish 12.5 per cent rate.In the global debate about corporate tax avoidance, Ireland is anxious to retain its competitive fiscal regime while not being branded as a tax haven. As Prof Stewart says: “Ireland is not a tax haven for individuals. But it does have the features of a corporate tax haven – a low nominal tax rate, light-touch regulation and a very responsive state that is highly sensitive to international tax law.”
55;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-04-25T10:06:12Z;Pending merger of Publicis and Omnicom gives WPP a boost;;WPP has suggested it is already benefiting from the pending merger of its rivals Publicis and Omnicom, saying it has seen a “surge of new business activity” as clients react to changes in the advertising industry.This month WPP agencies won accounts including Vodafone, Marks and Spencer and Comparethemarket, which were previously held by agencies within Publicis and Omnicom.Trade estimates suggest that WPP gained net new business in April worth about $1.5bn in annual billings. That came on top of $1.3bn of net new business in the three months to the end of March, WPP said.Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive, said it was impossible to determine exactly what factors were driving the new business to WPP, but he added: “One or two clients have explicitly expressed unease at the prospect [of the Publicis Omnicom merger], and we’ve benefited as a result.”“When big changes happen in any industry of that nature, people review their arrangements,” he said.The planned merger of Publicis and Omnicom would displace WPP as the largest marketing services company by revenues, but the deal is yet to overcome various regulatory hurdles.WPP said like-for-like revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency fluctuations, rose 7 per cent year on year in the first quarter to £2.57bn, more than analysts had expected.However, that revenue figure was boosted by a change to the way WPP records revenues within Xaxis, its audience buying platform. The change means that the most accurate way to track WPP’s growth is to look at its net sales, according to analysts.On a like-for-like basis, net sales rose 3.8 per cent in the first quarter.Tamsin Garrity, an analyst at UBS, said the figures were a “positive surprise”.In February WPP’s shares fell heavily, after profit margins increased less than analysts expected in 2013. The company does not disclose profits on a quarterly basis.WPP’s biggest rivals have also posted upbeat numbers for the first quarter. Publicis reported a 3.3 per cent increase in organic global revenue and Omnicom reported a 4.3 per cent increase in organic global revenue, compared with the same period in the previous year.The $35bn merger of Publicis and Omnicom, which was announced last July, has been plagued by delays. In the past week, it has emerged that the groups have struggled to get the arrangement signed off by tax authorities in France, the Netherlands and the UK.
56;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-04-22T16:31:02Z;Tax issues threaten Publicis-Omnicom deal;;Unforeseen tax issues have thrown the $35bn merger of Publicis and Omnicom into jeopardy, threatening to torpedo plans to create the world’s largest advertising and communications company by revenues.The deal, which was announced last July, is structured so that neither company nor their shareholders pay any tax related to the merger, but the groups have struggled to get the arrangement signed off by tax authorities in France, the Netherlands and the UK.“There is no plan B. Those things are a requirement to get to a closing,” John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive, said on Tuesday.The French tax ruling approval process is pending and the groups have lodged joint applications with authorities in the Netherlands, where the combined company will be incorporated, and the UK, where it will be a tax resident. The Netherlands has been under pressure to stop allowing shell companies to use its tax regime.Mr Wren said it was “not practical to say exactly when the transaction will close” given the complexity of the deal and the number of issues still to resolve. However, the company added “there was no reason to believe that the structure cannot be achieved”.Repeated delays have cast doubt on the Franco-US deal, which has been attacked by rivals who warn it will result in a series of client conflicts and cultural clashes. Shares in Omnicom were down 1.5 per cent by midday in New York, while Publicis shares closed down 0.7 per cent at €63.44 in Paris.The air of caution surrounding the tie-up is a far cry from the jubilant pitch made nine months ago when Mr Wren and Maurice Lévy, chief executive of Publicis, signed the deal at Publicis’s Paris headquarters overlooking the Arc de Triomphe. The executives promoted the deal as a merger of equals that would lead the way in a new era of technology-controlled media and marketing.“Size will matter,” Mr Levy told the Financial Times when the deal was announced. “What is true today is really not true tomorrow, and we have to be prepared for that.”July 2013: The FT’s Anousha Sakoui looks at the plans for a $35bn Franco-US merger of Publicis and Omnicom.At the time, executives were confident that the deal would close as soon as December – just five months. But the hold-up in winning tax approvals as well as obtaining antitrust clearance from China and working through issues with the US Securities and Exchange Commission have delayed that timeline.Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research, asked: “Can we say we have 100 per cent confidence that they are going to find a way to do a deal? No.“To the extent that these issues were understood at the time of the merger and they assumed they wouldn’t be problematic, clearly that was mistaken.”The failure to close the deal has also spooked some investors who fear the transaction may fall apart.One investor who recently sold its position in Omnicom said that the deal was “a culture clash riddled with tax problems” and suggested that the chance of it completing was being viewed by many investors as only 50 per cent.In the meantime, Publicis and Omnicom continue to operate separately, and their two bosses insist that they will be fine if they go it alone. In the first quarter of 2014, Publicis reported a 3.3 per cent increase in organic global revenue and Omnicom reported a 4.3 per cent increase in organic global revenue, compared to the same year-earlier period.“We believe we are very well-positioned to compete in an increasingly complex dynamic landscape,” said Mr Wren.Mr Levy said last week: “That process will go to its end, and we will end up with a merger, a merger of equals that will give a formidable new player in the industry. And if by accident things don’t happen, life is good for Publicis. Life is good whatever happens.”Additional reporting by Ed Hammond
57;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-03-10T20:54:26Z;Facebook gains on analyst optimism;US equities drift lower on weak economic data out of China;Facebook climbed on Monday as analysts at UBS raised their price target on the world’s largest social networking site to $90, the highest so far from an investment bank.UBS’s optimism comes from signs, the analysts say, that Facebook has the muscle to increase its advertising rates, including a recent deal signed with advertising agency Omnicom worth as much as $100m.“Our first-quarter advertiser channel checks suggest that the pricing strength exhibited in Q4, up 92 per cent year on year, price per ad, has carried over into early 2014 and is likely sustainable for longer than our prior estimates had assumed,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan said.Shares in Facebook, which tumbled in the months after its botched IPO in May 2012, have surged 30 per cent this year and Wall Street has warmed to the company. Today, more than eight in 10 analysts rate Facebook with a buy rating, compared with roughly half one year ago.The company now generates most of its advertising revenue from ads on mobile phones. Rivals such as Yahoo’s Tumblr have adopted its format of showing ads in user news feeds.Mr Sheridan said shares could go as high as $112 in the next year on “faster than expected advertiser acceptance” of new commercial formats, including video and Instagram-centred ads.“In particular, we note the improved quality of advertisers and increased frequency of higher CPM formats – mobile app ads in particular – within the existing ad load,” he said.Facebook shares rose 3.2 per cent by the close to $72.03, a fresh record high.Boeing shares were under pressure on Monday after the company revealed that cracks had developed on the wings of some 787 planes in production.The aircraft maker said the cracks had not been found in planes in service and posed no risk to passengers. Boeing executives did not believe the setback would keep it from delivering 110 of the aircraft this year.Analysts at Jefferies said it was not a “major issue” for Boeing and would not affect the company’s profitability.“The issues are fully understood and can easily be tested . . . The part at issue is in the larger area of the wing and so is easy to access,” Jefferies’ Howard Rubel said.Shares fell 1.3 per cent to $126.89.United Rentals, the largest US equipment rental company, announced it would purchase National Pump for $780m, sending shares 3.8 per cent higher to $91.82.The deal is United Rental’s first move into the industrial pump rental market as oil and chemical companies intensify their focus on harnessing US shale reserves.National Pump, which was founded in 2007, generates half of its sales from upstream oil and gas customers.“This transaction is an important step in our strategy to create a company that delivers strong financial returns through the cycle,” chief executive Michael Kneeland said.Cliffs Natural Resources shares dipped on Monday after it said it had entered talks with Casablanca Capital, the investment firm seeking to replace much of the Cliffs Natural board.Casablanca, which owns 5 per cent of the mining company, nominated six members to the company’s board of directors. Cliffs Natural agreed to delay its annual general meeting originally set for May as it attempts to settle with Casablanca.Shares in Cliffs Natural fell 3.7 per cent to $17.95, taking its losses since the year began to 32 per cent.Overall, US equity markets drifted lower as investors digested somewhat weak economic data out of China that showed lower than expected loan growth and the largest monthly trade deficit since 2012.The S&P 500 nudged down to 1,877.17 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2 per cent to 16,418.68. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite fell slightly to 4,334.45.
58;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-03-09T17:53:06Z;WPP chief Sorrell receives £23m payout;;It’s been a tough 12 months for Sir Martin Sorrell, but £22.7m in shares should help.Sir Martin, the chief executive of advertising group WPP, received 1.78m in company shares last month under the company’s long-term incentive plan, LEAP.In 2012, a shareholder revolt at his annual pay of £17.6m led WPP to scrap the plan, but historic entitlements were not affected.The news comes 10 days after lower-than-expected margins triggered a sharp fall in WPP shares.The LEAP payout referred to Sir Martin’s performance between 2009 and 2013. During that period WPP shareholders saw total returns of about 230 per cent.That was better than the performance of rival Omnicom, whose total returns were 180 per cent, but worse than that of Publicis, whose shareholders’ returns were about 260 per cent.“I find the controversy over my compensation deeply disturbing,” he wrote in the FT in 2012.“The board’s compensation decisions . . . are competitively fair against our big US and French competitors, which we consistently outperform.”A merger between Omnicom and Publicis, which is expected to be completed this year, would displace WPP as the largest marketing services group by revenues.Investors are waiting to see if WPP responds with its own strategic leap. They also are trying to gauge the mood among WPP’s clients, who Sir Martin recently said were “demanding more for less”.
59;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2014-02-11T18:17:12Z;China’s antitrust clearance holds up Publicis and Omnicom merger;;Delays in obtaining antitrust clearance from China for the $35bn Publicis and Omnicom merger, among other complications, are pushing the expected closing date for the deal back about nine months to the third quarter this year.The transaction, which will create the largest advertising and communications company in the world by revenues, has received the green light in all jurisdictions except China, John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive said during a conference call on Tuesday.“This transaction is highly complex and is taking longer than we originally expected,” he said.When the companies announced the deal in July, they were confident that it would close as soon as the end of December, in just five months. Experts found that target optimistic and expected regulators to pay close attention to a deal of such scale and complexity.It is unlikely that regulatory hurdles will kill the merger, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research.In antitrust terms, the combined market share in media buying was expected to raise more concerns than the advertising and marketing side, where barriers are low. The merger was expected to face its toughest challenge in the Americas, where the combined media buying power of the two companies is estimated at a larger than 40 per cent share.Beyond antitrust clearances, the deal also is seeking tax approvals and working through issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Wren said.Omnicom executives noted that while the two companies continue to operate separately, integration teams are working through 70 different topics so that the combined company will be run smoothly the day the deal closes. Rivals have warned that the deal would be rife with client conflicts and culture clashes. Mr Wren said that account activity had not been affected by the pending merger, noting that a couple of outstanding new business pitches had pitted the two companies against each other.The FT’s Anousha Sakoui looks at the plans for a $35bn Franco-US merger of Publicis and Omnicom“It certainly is hard from the outside to distinguish any impact whatsoever of the transaction on the competing holding companies,” Mr Wieser said. “We can point to some key talent moves, but there are always talent moves.”The news comes as Omnicom reported a 2.9 per cent uptick in total revenues for the fourth quarter, reaching $4bn, fuelled by growth in its international business. Net income was $300.5m. The quarter included $13.3m in pre-tax charges related to Omnicom’s proposed merger with Publicis.Publicis is expected to report its fourth-quarter results on Thursday.
60;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-08-29T08:16:19Z;WPP raises its sights on revenues;;WPP lifted its expectations for annual revenue growth for 2013 as the group reported underlying sales up 5 per cent in July amid continuing improvement in the US and the UK, two of the advertising group’s largest markets.The FTSE 100 company, led by chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, said it expected like-for-like sales growth – a metric that excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange movements – during 2013 to come in at “over 3 per cent”, slightly higher than it previously forecast.Shares in WPP increased 4.3 per cent to £12.29 in late afternoon trading in London on Thursday.Sales in the six months to June 30 rose to £5.33bn – up 7.1 per cent from a year earlier, or 5.5 per cent assuming currencies had been constant. Pre-tax profit rose 16.4 per cent on the constant currency metric to £427.1m.Sir Martin indicated he would take steps to counter WPP’s scale disadvantage as a result of the planned tie-up of rivals Publicis and Omnicom, saying WPP would do something “in due course”. The chief executive pointed to its media arm in the US, where it buys ad space for clients, but declined to elaborate further.The group said it had enjoyed constant currency sales increases “in all regions and business segments” – with the exception of the public relations and public affairs division.Like-for-like sales here fell 3.1 per cent, which the company blamed on “continuing client examination of discretionary spending, particularly in mature markets”. WPP said the rate of sales increase in the faster-growing markets of Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and central and eastern Europe had slowed.However, WPP added that this was more than compensated for by advances in North America and the UK in the second quarter.Sir Martin Sorrell has made his views clear.In the wake of the agreed merger between Publicis and Omnicom, which will create the world’s largest advertising group by revenues, the highly acquisitive chief executive of WPP has said he has no intention of following suit.Instead the marketing services company, which reported first-half results on Thursday, will look to pick off clients of the enlarged group who may be worried about potential conflicts of interest due to their rivals also being represented by Publicis Omnicom.Read more . . .WPP said: “Advertising as a proportion of [gross domestic product] should at least remain constant overall, although it is still at relatively depressed historical levels, particularly in mature markets, post-Lehman.”It added: “Advertising should, as a result, grow at least at a similar rate to nominal GDP.”WPP derived 29 per cent of its sales from the faster-growing regions.The group had previously set a target of increasing this figure to between 35 and 40 per cent in the next three to four years and on Thursday lifted the target to between 40 and 45 per cent over the next five years.The first-half figures come amid speculation by some analysts that the agreed deal between Publicis and Omnicom could lead to further consolidation in the sector.However, Sir Martin has previously played down the need for WPP to respond, saying it would still lead advertising markets in Europe and Asia and cautioning about the regulatory scrutiny of the potential merger in the US.On Thursday WPP unveiled plans to raise its dividend by a fifth to 10.56p. This represented a “payout ratio” – the proportion of profits paid as dividends – of 37 per cent. WPP said it planned to increase this ratio to 45 per cent within two years.Diluted earnings per share fell from 21.6p to 21.5p due to the effects of a tax credit the prior year.
61;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-08-12T17:36:58Z;US acquirers cut taxes by relocating to Europe after mergers;;A growing number of US companies are set to save hundreds of millions of dollars in tax by relocating to Europe after completing takeovers on the continent.Some of the biggest mergers and acquisitions so far in 2013 have involved so-called “tax inversions” – where a US acquirer shifts overseas, to Europe in particular, to pay a lower rate. These deals have come at a time when politicians in Washington have been increasing their calls for corporate tax reform.Michigan-based pharmaceuticals group Perrigo has said its acquisition of Irish biotech company Elan will lead to re-domiciling in Ireland, where it has given guidance it expects to pay about 17 per cent in tax, rather than an estimated 30 per cent effective rate it was paying in the US. Deutsche Bank estimates Perrigo will achieve tax savings of $118m a year as a result.Another pharmaceuticals takeover – New Jersey-based Actavis’s acquisition of Warner Chilcott in May – will also result in a move to Ireland, where Actavis’s tax rate will fall to about 17 per cent from an effective rate of 28 per cent tax, and enable it to save an estimated $150m over the next two years.Similarly, US advertising company Omnicom has said its $35bn merger with Publicis will result in the combined group’s headquarters being located in the Netherlands, saving about $80m in US tax a year.Meanwhile, Liberty Global’s $23bn acquisition of Virgin Media will allow the US cable group to relocate to the UK, and pay its lower 21 per cent tax rate of corporation tax.Many US acquirers of European companies have not disclosed their exact tax savings.While tax saving has not been the main driver of these deals, or planned relocations, M&A advisers say the number of companies seeking to re-domicile outside the US after a takeover is rising.“We have seen an increasing number of US inversions in the last couple of years, first on a standalone basis and, more recently, as part of M&A deals,” said Mark Kingstone, a tax partner at law firm Linklaters. “As cross-border M&A activity increases, this trend may continue.”Increased use of tax inversion has coincided with an intensifying political debate on US tax– with Democrats, Republicans and the White House agreeing that the current code, which imposes a top rate of 35 per cent but offers a plethora of tax breaks, is in need of reform.President Barack Obama sought to break the deadlock last month in a speech in Tennessee when he proposed to tie corporate tax reform to new infrastructure spending, but many Republicans were unimpressed.“The only way we are going to get the rate down to where we want to get it is if we include significant anti-base erosion protections on the US tax base,” a US Treasury official said.Frank Aquila, of law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, said: “The interest in tax inversion transactions has clearly increased as US companies have come to recognise that it is unlikely that Congress and the President [will] fix the problem any time in the near future.”
62;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-08-07T14:34:15Z;Emerging markets key to Publicis-Omnicom deal;;Part of the rationale behind the $35bn Omnicom-Publicis tie-up is an empire-building land-grab into emerging markets.Growth in advertising spending in eastern Europe, central Asia and Latin America far outpaces that in developed countries. Marketers are opening their wallets in the hope of luring customers from among the world’s emerging middle class.McKinsey has called consumption in emerging markets the “biggest growth opportunity in the history of capitalism”, and says advertising is essential to make sure a company’s brand is at the top of consumers’ lists.Developing markets are expected to contribute 61 per cent of ad spend growth between 2012 and 2015, with spending in those zones increasing at an average rate of 8 per cent in 2013. That compares with a sluggish 2 per cent growth in developed markets, which continue to feel the drag of stagnation in the eurozone, according to ZenithOptimedia, part of Publicis.In making their pitch for the deal, Publicis and Omnicom executives highlighted the potential to build deeper coverage across fast-growing geographies. In Latin America, Publicis generated $600m of revenues in 2012, with Omnicom reporting an additional $400m. In the Asia-Pacific region, Publicis generated $1.1bn in revenues in 2012 and Omnicom $1.6bn.“Keep in mind that both companies individually have a strong presence in key emerging markets,” said John Wren, chief executive of Omnicom, who will be co-chief executive of the combined company. “Together, we’ll have much deeper coverage of the fast-growing developing markets in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, as well as the Asia-Pacific region.”Advertising groups have steadily expanded their business in emerging markets in recent years and are eager to solidify their positions. The goal is to win business from marketers increasingly interested in broad global campaigns as well as more targeted, region-by-region initiatives.Publicis has built its presence primarily through acquisitions and investments, including three deals in India this year. Omnicom has made small buys, struck partnerships and expanded its agency networks. The group’s BBDO agency works with global clients including PepsiCo, AT&T and Visa, with 281 offices in 81 countries.Ad holding companies, including WPP and Omnicom, have invested in developing technology-driven ad-buying services in regions such as China, but efforts are still at an early stage.Some marketers who work with Publicis and Omnicom said they were interested to know how the consolidation would affect offerings in developing regions. The deal could allow the companies to combine assets to make investments and acquisitions.“Africa, Indonesia, Thailand, Colombia – our next wave of growth is coming from there and we need our agencies to be there,” one client said.The question on this combined scale is: can they establish a new way of working in emerging markets with technology? Nobody has solved it yet, but they have a huge chance to be ahead of the evolution of the media and ad marketThere are hurdles, including cultural and technological differences, government relations and diverse business practices.The payouts can be big. AB InBev, which is out to make Budweiser the “first and only truly global [beer] brand”, is in the midst of a review for the agency it employs to buy ads across several global markets. The review, estimated to account for $600m in spending, includes 10 countries in Latin America, Asia and Europe.Telecoms companies, meanwhile, have been successful by taking marketing campaigns that have worked in one region to other geographies, according to McKinsey.Digital marketing capabilities, especially in mobile and social media, are essential. In China consumers are more likely to trust online recommendations than television commercials, according to McKinsey. In Brazil about a quarter of the population had opened Twitter accounts by 2010. In India mobile devices dominate over traditional media and personal computers.David Kenny, a former Publicis executive who is chief executive of the Weather Company, said his group’s huge growth outside the US had come from mobile apps and the mobile web. A combined Publicis-Omnicom group would have the opportunity to develop industry-first capabilities, he added.“To me, the question on this combined scale is: can they establish a new way of working in emerging markets with technology?” Mr Kenny said. “Nobody has solved it yet, but they have a huge chance to be ahead of the evolution of the media and ad market.”
63;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-08-04T17:45:12Z;Publicis chief puts accent on loyalty;;Maurice Lévy, chief executive of Publicis Groupe, has revealed that the chances of agreeing a merger with Omnicom had become so remote that, as recently as May 29, his supervisory board was ready to proceed with its original plan to move him into the chairman’s role and appoint a new chief executive.The move – which would have seen the 71-year-old Mr Lévy replace Elisabeth Badinter, daughter of Publicis’ founder and biggest shareholder – was later scrapped after Publicis announced its $35bn merger plan with former rival Omnicom last month.But the existence of the plan B– which would also have seen Publicis’ chief operating officer Jean-Yves Naouri become chief executive – provides a fascinating, behind-the-scenes glimpse into the relative lack of optimism within the company as it tried to negotiate the advertising world’s biggest-ever tie-up.“That was the plan,” Mr Lévy told the Financial Times in a recent interview. “And for me on that date [May 29], the likelihood that the merger would happen was remote. I thought that the difficulties were such that maybe this would not come through.”Now agreed, the merger – if it wins the necessary regulatory approvals – will create a group with six creative agencies. However, Mr Levy said speculation that the number would be reduced soon after the merger was wrong.“Merging agencies is something that is extremely complex because of the cultures, because of the people, because of the clients,” he said. “We will maybe look at this in the years to come, maybe never. But it is not in the agenda today.”Mr Lévy said Publicis’ position in the advertising sector today owed much to his relationship with Ms Badinter, who has headed Publicis’ supervisory board since 1996 and, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $1.4bn, is one of France’s wealthiest people. Mr Lévy described the relationship – which has driven strategy and decision making at the group for the past two decades – as “extraordinarily transparent”, and based on a clear division of responsibilities.“We split the roles so that she was the guardian of the legacy and she had to protect the agency, the group from any kind of influence from the outside”, he said. “I had to build the business. That was how we shared responsibility.”And build it he did. According to Bernstein Analysis, the company’s annual revenues in 1993 were €479m, about three-quarters that of Havas, another French advertising group. By last year they had reached €6.6bn, almost five times that of its domestic rival.Mr Lévy’s respect for Ms Badinter’s father, the Publicis founder Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, also recently became apparent to John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive, on a visit to the group’s Paris headquarters.He was shown into Mr Lévy’s office, which consists largely of a desk, a shelving unit full of electrical cables and looks out on to an unremarkable view of Parisian rooftops.However, Mr Lévy then opened a side door, to show him Bleustein-Blanchet’s former office, which still houses two Picassos and sculptures by Giacometti and Maillol. Through the window there, they looked out on to the Arc de Triomphe.“He [Mr Wren of Omnicom] was stunned that we kept the office as it is, and that I am not sitting in his office,” said Mr Lévy. “I said: ‘This is his office. I would never dare to sit there’. It is where Elisabeth Badinter sits when she visits.”Mr Lévy’s loyalty to the family and to the company has been well known, ever since he risked his life to rescue company records on computer tape from a fire in 1972. But he has only now told the story in detail.Mr Lévy said he had a battle with a firefighter as he tried to get into the burning building, and only managed to do so by putting on a fireman’s leather jacket and helmet, which he found in a nearby truck.That was early on a Thursday morning. By the following Tuesday, Mr Lévy and his team had recovered all the data. They were even able to invoice clients on time. “The clients were very surprised,” he said.Thirty years later, his conviction in his decision-making appears as strong. Sir Martin Sorrell – who heads WPP, Publicis’ main rival – has been critical of the Omnicom merger, but Mr Lévy is unfazed.“He is spending so much time harassing analysts, shareholders, clients to explain that this is wrong . . . the more he does it, the more I feel that we are doing the right thing,” Mr Lévy said.

65;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-08-02T17:43:31Z;The joys of going it alone;In almost every medium, it seems independence is finding a way;"At first, when you scan the cultural landscape, it seems like everything is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Times are tough – we all know that: only the strong will survive. For strong, read big. And not just big: huge.How will publishers counter the might of Amazon, which recently reported sales of $15.7bn in three months? By mustering their regiments into one giant army: the merger of Penguin and Random House will mean a single company controlling a quarter of the world’s book market. Last week it was announced that two of the biggest global advertising agencies, Publicis and Omnicom, are considering a merger– which, if it went ahead, would mean the same company trying to sell us both Pepsi and Coke, a conflict that makes the agonies over the Sunkist/Ocean Spray accounts in last season’s Mad Men look like pretty small potatoes.And yet, once you lay these huge tiles out on the table, a funny thing happens: there’s more room to move between them. In almost every medium, it seems, independence is finding a way. Last week I found myself chatting to musician Chris Wood, whose new album None the Wiser is just out. Wood is a star of English folk – and indeed the growing prominence of folk in the music industry, from Mumford & Sons down, speaks of an audience more interested in exploration than the big record companies give them credit for. Wood’s song “One in a Million”, written with Hugh Lupton, won Best Original Song at the BBC2 Folk Awards in 2006; his work on Cold Haily Rainy Night with The Imagined Village helped that win Best Traditional Song in 2008.Wood started his own label, RUF Records, in 1992, then merged it into his wider project the English Acoustic Collective: he controls his own music. “I was courted by various labels when I started out,” he says. “I went to see them with my dad – he couldn’t believe his ears. They were asking for everything and offering a maybe.”That initial refusal to sign, more than two decades ago, was a financial one; but of course it’s an artistic decision too. “Can I get to sleep at night knowing I’ve signed over a year’s work to someone I don’t trust? Obviously the answer’s no,” Wood says wryly.He knows that the business model for the music industry is changing: as with the publishing industry, there is no model but a brave new world. Spotify is great for the consumer but not so great for artists, whose income from streaming can be measured in fractions of cents. We don’t know what the new business model will be, Wood says, “but it will be the artists who lead the way. Adele is off Spotify, Tom Waits is off Spotify: they’ve had a good hard look and seen that it’s not sustainable.”The question is what “sustainable” really means. For huge companies such as Penguin Random House – which now controls nearly 250 separate imprints – sustainable means a very big number indeed: which is in part why David Fickling, founder of David Fickling Books, has chosen (amicably, he stresses) to part company with Random House, under whose auspices he’s worked for the past dozen years.…Fickling, with his distinctive bow tie and determinedly energetic manner, is a transformational figure in publishing, the man who stuck with Philip Pullman for years before the success of his His Dark Materials trilogy brought global renown; the man who discovered Mark Haddon and believed that The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time could be read by both children and adults.A week ago I paid a visit to Fickling’s pleasingly ramshackle Oxford office, where he and his managing director, author and editor Simon Mason were contemplating their new-found independence. On a sunny day among the dreaming spires, it was hard to imagine a better working environment. Fickling’s daughter Rosie was manning the phones; the staff of his reborn comic The Phoenix were beavering away next door.Fickling, with a laugh at his own pretension, is fond of quoting Einstein: “The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant and has forgotten the gift.” That gift, for him, is not the success of authors he’s already championed, but the discovery of new authors, and the ability to stick with them through thick and thin. “If your default position is huge commercial success”, Fickling says, “that’s not necessarily the default position for making good things.”He doesn’t scorn commercial success – far from it – but seeks the success that comes from supporting original talent. In the world of film, consider the trajectory of Fruitvale Station, the true-life drama of Oscar Grant, a young man wrongfully shot by police in Oakland, California. An independent debut from director Ryan Coogler, it was made for less than $1m, and the Trayvon Martin verdict makes it a timely release. It took Best First Film at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, and last weekend screenings were expanded to more than 1,000 screens in the US. It’s already heading past the $5m mark. Readers, listeners and viewers are hungry for independence and originality; increasingly, they know how to seek it out for themselves. A real revolution is well under way.——————————————-Peter Aspden is awayTo hear a podcast of this column, visit www.ft.com/culturecast"
66;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-08-02T17:28:57Z;Better ways to play the merger mania;Big takeovers are back in the news, but what is the best way to profit from them?;"Mega mergers are back. This week, advertising groups Omnicom and Publicis announced a $35bn tie-up. Just a day or two earlier, Irish pharmaceuticals group Elan ended a long courtship by recommending a takeover by Perrigo. Closer to home, engineering group Invensys has recommended an offer from France’s Schneider Electric.The re-emergence of M&A has been long predicted, and there have been several false starts. Companies are sitting on big cash piles, having restructured and refinanced in the wake of the credit crunch, and that money is earning only nugatory returns in cash and other short-term instruments. The global economic recovery might still be slow and uneven, but there are now at least some tangible signs that it is heading in the right direction, giving chief executives the confidence to deploy some of that cash. Valuations in the US might be looking a bit stretched, but elsewhere in the world – especially in many parts of Europe – they are broadly reasonable.Is this good news for investors? There’s a mountain of academic evidence that takeovers destroy value for shareholders in the bidding company, and that the hubris of senior managers leads them to overestimate the benefits of combining one company with another.If you want a practical example, look no further than Rio Tinto’s disastrous $38bn takeover of Alcan in 2007, which was followed by a dividend cut, a $15bn rights issue, a $10-11bn write-off – and a change of chief executive.On the other hand, takeovers are a sign of growing confidence, and institutions generally have to reinvest whatever cash takeovers generate in other shares, which boosts the broader market.And for a private investor, a conventional cash takeover offer should be manna from heaven. You wake up one morning to find you’ve been offered a fat premium and no dealing costs to sell your shares. The only downside is that you might incur a capital gains tax liability on the profits, or face a conundrum when it comes to reinvesting them. Both are nice problems to have.Alas, not all takeovers are of this particular ilk. The lower end of the stock market has been prone to stingy “take private” deals, where a dominant shareholder grows frustrated with poor share-price performance and offers to buy out other shareholders at a miserly price. The minority holders generally accept, through gritted teeth, because the alternative – owning shares in an unlisted company controlled by a majority shareholder – is so unpalatable. Morson, a recruitment company, was taken private in just such a fashion last year.And then there’s the “nil-premium merger of equals”. This is the structure to be used for the Omnicom/Publicis deal, and it was also the basis of Glencore’s takeover of Xstrata. These are often used for big deals because the accounting treatment (“pooling of interests”) avoids the creation of large amounts of goodwill on the balance sheet of the combined company, which might one day need to be written down if the deal doesn’t work out.But nil-premium mergers are not so clear-cut for shareholders. It’s more difficult to evaluate whether you’re getting a fair deal or not; the prices of the two companies move all the time. If the deal involves an overseas company, you might end up with shares in an entity that’s based somewhere else (as happened when Carnival and P&O Princess merged).In a conventional takeover, you get your cash, and all the practical difficulties of integrating two complex businesses are somebody else’s problem. With a merger, you are exposed to all that ongoing risk. Long-term shareholders in Invensys know this only too well. The company was created from the £9.4bn merger of industrial conglomerates BTR and Siebe in 1999. That transaction was followed by years of restructuring and refinancing. Some 14 years later, the Schneider bid values Invensys at £3.4bn.Picking individual takeover targets is notoriously difficult, too. Plenty of companies have been “bid targets” for years but languish on low share-price valuations while they await a suitor. You can leave the job of picking takeover targets to a fund manager – not that I know of any funds with such a precise mandate – but the strategy is essentially the same. You are buying something largely in the hope that one day someone else will buy it off you for more. It’s less investment and more speculation.Two other strategies spring to mind. One is to buy a small or mid-cap fund. That’s because smaller companies are more likely to be taken over, and any bid is more likely to be a straight cash takeover. While you wait, you’re also exposed to a segment of the market that’s on a roll. Since I last wrote about the FTSE 250’s outperformance (and predicted it would continue) it has put on another 23 per cent, against 12 per cent for the FTSE 100. The mid-cap index is full of housebuilders, which are being boosted by the government’s hare-brained lending schemes, and seems set to go on outperforming.Another option is to buy a special situations fund, like the Fidelity UK Special Situations or the M&G Recovery fund. These funds don’t just chase takeovers; they look for any circumstance in which there might be a catalyst for hidden value to be realised.One way for that to happen is via the corporate transaction that never gets the attention it deserves – the demerger. Here’s a back-of-a-fag-packet example: the old Carphone Warehouse was worth £1.7bn immediately before it demerged TalkTalk in March 2010. The two now have a combined value of £3.71bn, an increase of 118 per cent. The FTSE All Share has risen just 20 per cent over the same time. And another: Cookson’s market value was £1.79bn in December. The combined worth of its two successors, Alent and Vesuvius, is £2.17bn, an increase of 21 per cent against a 12 per cent gain in the All Share. Big takeovers get all the attention, but demergers have a far better record of releasing value.jonathan.eley@ft.com"
67;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-08-02T16:58:44Z;Maurice Lévy: not ready to face his swansong;Empire-building Frenchman enjoys being centre stage;"For someone who adores the spotlight, there can have been fewer sweeter moments for Maurice Lévy than when he entered a sunlit room on the top floor of his Paris headquarters on Sunday and told the world of his plans to create the largest ever advertising group.Dressed in a sharp black suit, black tie and the crispest of white shirts, the 71-year-old chief executive of France’s Publicis Groupe said that the $35.1bn tie-up with Omnicom, a former rival from the US, would be “ a merger of equals”. Even if that is true, the announcement itself was anything but: flanked by a press-shy John Wren, Omicom’s chief executive, Mr Lévy dominated the event, cajoling journalists with his warm and easy charm.“Is this a swansong? I don’t know,” he responded in a velvety French accent to a question about the merger and succession. “I know that when the swan sings, he is dying, so I prefer not to think about it.” It was one of several crowd-pleasers that afternoon. Beyond the show, many people wonder if Mr Lévy’s latest deal – by far his biggest – actually makes sense. One fundamental question is whether joining what are, in essence, two large holding companies creates shareholder value. The combined group would have six creative agencies. Is that too many?Then there is the question of whether it is the most appropriate response to a rapidly changing industry, in which the emergence of big new competitors such as Google and Facebook has made the future hard to predict. Publicis’ investors still do not seem to have a clear answer to any of these questions: after an initial spike following the announcement, the share price has settled back down to where it was.For Mr Lévy, however, the deal must seem like a logical continuation of what has been a frenetic expansion since 1987, when he became only Publicis’ second chief executive in the company’s nearly 90-year history. Saatchi & Saatchi, Leo Burnett and Bartle Bogle Hegarty are just some of the icons he has snapped up along the way.An early push into emerging markets and digital – the latter now accounts for about a third of sales – has added Digitas and Razorfish, which Mr Lévy bought from Microsoft in 2009. The group now employs 60,000 people and generates annual sales of about €6.6bn. Clients include McDonald’s, Walmart, General Motors, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Walt Disney, Procter & Gamble, Nestlé and JPMorgan Chase.Charm is Mr Lévy’s calling card. “He gives you the impression when you are with him that only you exist,” says his friend Jean-David Levitte, a former French ambassador to Washington. Even his competitors fall under the spell. A rival at Havas, another French advertising company, remembers when one of the company directors received a handwritten note from Mr Lévy, congratulating him on a deal. “The guy was so pleased that he showed it to everyone in the office,” he recalls. One Publicis employee says that Mr Levy sends a lot of handwritten notes “every day …he’s the most incredible networker”.The personal touch and his easy, sometimes almost self-effacing, side have earned him a reputation as a Monsieur Suave – an image reinforced by his shag of silver-grey hair and Côte d’Azur complexion. But Mr Levy was born on the other side of the Mediterranean, in the provincial Moroccan town of Oujda, to Spanish parents. His father, a Jewish leftwing activist, left Spain for France to escape the fascists, from where he was later forced to flee from the Nazis to north Africa. Mr Lévy is not particularly religious but is passionate about Israel and peace in the Middle East.That upbringing sets him apart from other French business leaders. So does the fact that he is not a graduate of either the Ecole Nationale d’Administration or the Ecole Polytechnique, the default universities for those who end up populating the highest echelons of France’s prestigious institutions.“He is establishment, accepted and respected, and yet he is not one of them,” says a high-ranking industry executive who knows him well. “I think that is one of the things that have driven his absolute determination to succeed.”Instead, Mr Lévy studied computer science at New Jersey City University, joining Publicis in 1971 as the head of information technology. He got a break when he saved the company’s computer files from a fire that ripped through the main office – an act that brought him hero status. In the eyes of Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, the company’s founder and first chief executive, it confirmed Mr Lévy’s commitment to his company.He has been married for 50 years this year, and has three children and six grandchildren. Yet he is private and rarely talks about life beyond Publicis. Unusually, his personal affairs became the target of some press in 2012 after he received €16m in bonuses at a time when France was suffering and François Hollande, then a presidential candidate, was campaigning to tax the rich. Being victimised in public – when he had previously offered to pay more tax – really hurt him, recalls one friend.People who have worked closely with him say that the charm is not a constant. He sometimes shouts. His obsession with work sometimes makes him overly demanding of the people around him. “If you let him bully you, you are finished,” says one. They add that he is autocratic and needs to be centre stage.So what does the future hold? The proposed merger has Mr Lévy and Mr Wren as joint chief executives for the first 30 months. Mr Lévy will then serve as chairman for a further 30. This week, he said the arrangement would let him scale back. “I’m an old man, completely tired, 71 years old, and I’m thinking about going fishing, skiing a little bit without breaking my legs.”But, for all his self-deprecation, few believe Mr Lévy is ready to call it a day; he loves the business – and the attention. Mr Levitte says: “He is in great shape, he is passionate about what he does so I guess he will continue.”The writer is the FT’s Paris correspondent"
68;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-08-02T13:55:43Z;Letter from Lex: a fitting bit of spin;US created advertising colossus, but Asian banks pull out of deal;Big deal. This week was defined by one, as the world’s second and third-largest advertising groups Omnicom and Publicis announced they will combine under a “merger of equals”. This is a fitting bit of spin for a deal between two advertisers. If the combined group can extract the touted $500m in annual synergies, shareholders of both parts will benefit. Then again, advertising is a fast-changing business in which its clients need agents to be nimble. Creating a colossus with $23bn in revenue goes against that.Meanwhile, Perrigo, a US generic drugmaker, announced an agreed $8.6bn offer for Ireland’s Elan Corp, only this deal was more about taxes than cost savings. The $150m of planned synergies will mostly result through Perrigo’s change of domicile from the US to Ireland.In Asia, the opposite was happening. Singapore bank DBS walked away from its plan to buy Indonesia’s Bank Danamon for $7bn. The former now hopes to develop its own local business to tap the potential of the Indonesian market.Elsewhere in banking, Lloyds looks to be out of the doldrums. The UK bank is lending more and doing so more profitably. Although things were not quite as good for Barclays and Deutsche Bank who both need to take big steps to meet new leverage requirements. BNP Paribas has less reason to worry about capital but faces its own problems in terms of slow revenue growth and mounting provisions. At Royal Bank of Scotland, new boss Ross McEwan has a daunting challenge ahead of him as first-half earnings missed expectations.Results from the carmakers suggest they may be over the worst even if the banks are not. Peugeot and larger rival Volkswagen both posted better than expected first-half results this week. Mazda and Fuji Heavy have also performed well – they are both among the top five gainers in Japan’s Nikkei index this year.Meanwhile, a classic Russian spat between Vladislav Baumgertner, boss of potash miner Uralkali, and rival Belaruskali, caused the end of one of the world’s major potash marketing cartels.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
69;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-08-01T11:21:15Z;Publicis Omnicom Group lays out long succession plans;;Publicis and Omnicom have laid out succession plans as part of their $35bn merger plan that could see their current leaders running the new Publicis Omnicom Group well into the 2020s.Maurice Lévy, Publicis chief executive, and John Wren, his opposite number at Omnicom, had already announced an unusual corporate governance plan, in which they intend to share power as co-chief executives for 30 months after the deal is completed, following which Mr Lévy would become chairman and Mr Wren would be sole CEO.In a little-noticed comment to investors at a meeting on Wednesday, however, Mr Wren disclosed that he would succeed Mr Lévy as chairman five years after the new company is formed, once his own succession as CEO is in place.Mr Lévy told the investor meeting in London that the long-term governance structure would give shareholders “five years of tranquillity”. Investors could buy the stock “and you can sleep. We will be taking care of your interest.”Several analysts saw succession-planning as one driver of a deal that few in the industry had expected. Mr Lévy is 71 and Mr Wren is 60. Jean-Yves Naouri, chief operating officer of Publicis, was seen before the deal as the most likely successor to Mr Lévy, who said last year that Mr Naouri “is clearly in a leading position for winning the race”.On Wednesday, Mr Lévy told investors: “That was – we can say it now, the plan. Jean-Yves deserves it.” He added that Mr Naouri had been part of the small team negotiating the merger, and “I hope that Jean-Yves will be happy with what we will be working [on] after the transition period.”Investors, analysts and competitors are paying close attention to which of the two companies’ longstanding chief financial officers – Jean-Michel Etienne of Publicis or Randy Weisenburger of Omnicom – is given the CFO position in the merged company, to see whether one group’s management has the upper hand in the new team.Mr Wren told the meeting: “There will be important jobs for anybody who wants one and we said we would balance it out.”
70;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-31T22:50:46Z;CBS unfazed by Publicis-Omnicom deal;;CBS, owner of the top-rated US broadcast network, has “no great concerns” about the proposed merger of Publicis and Omnicom, it said on Wednesday, despite estimates that the combined group could control 40 per cent of all media buying in America.Chief executive Les Moonves said it was “too early to tell” the likely effect of the deal, but noted that CBS had once been concerned when WPP, the current market leader, was consolidating agencies “and we were able to do a lot of business with them”.His comments on the deal, among the first from a senior media executive, came as executives of the two advertising and marketing services companies fleshed out their plans for their combined media buying businesses at an investor meeting in London.John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive, said media owners wanting to give advertising clients special placement at major televised events such as the World Cup, the Super Bowl or the Grammys “will probably stop at our door before they get to our next biggest competitor”.The two companies’ media buying power has been a focus of analysts assessing antitrust risks facing the deal. Randall Weisenburger, Omnicom’s chief financial officer, said media buying represented only 12 per cent of combined revenues, implying that any disposals demanded by regulators would have a limited impact.Shares in Publicis closed 6.4 per cent higher at €60.64, reversing declines since the deal was announced, and Omnicom rallied 1 per cent to $64.27.Second-quarter earnings from CBS demonstrated the strength of the US television advertising market, showing 5 per cent growth in total ad revenues, led by 11 per cent growth at its core broadcast network. Underlying advertising growth would accelerate in the third quarter, it added.The group’s 6 per cent rise in operating income to $838m was driven by a 22 per cent increase in content licensing and distribution revenues, reflecting licensing agreements with digital streaming services such as Amazon Prime, which makes episodes of its hit show Under The Dome available online days after they air on CBS.Comcast’s NBCUniversal television group reported 13 per cent growth in broadcast advertising revenues and a 5.7 per cent increase in cable network ad revenues.
71;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-31T14:56:02Z;Inside Business: Time for Publicis Omnicom Group’s PR firms to prove their worth;They will have to offer different messages to different audiences;In a 1988 foreword to Confessions of an Advertising Man – his indiscreet romp of an industry rule book – the late David Ogilvy bemoaned “the emergence of megalomaniacs whose mindset is more financial than creative. They are building empires by buying up other agencies, to the consternation of their clients.”In the following year, his eponymous agency was sold to WPP – run by a young Martin Sorrell, who the New York Times dubbed “a financial wizard who has never written a headline, drawn a storyboard or devised a media plan”.Decades of consolidation since then have left clients and newspapers less taken aback by such financial empire-builders. But one wonders what Ogilvy would have made of Publicis and Omnicom’s $35bn advertising and marketing services merger.Ogilvy was once a chef at Paris’s Hotel Majestic, near the Publicis headquarters where chief executive Maurice Lévy signed the deal with John Wren, Omnicom’s CEO. He would no doubt have acknowledged the picture-perfect staging of Sunday’s photo opportunity in front of the Arc de Triomphe. However, since announcing their creation of a global empire with combined revenues of $22.7bn, Omnicom and Publicis have been losing the PR war.As they were busy selling the deal to investors, the chief executives of WPP, Interpublic and Havas were queueing up to bad-mouth it. Led by Sir Martin, they provided a masterclass in competitive mischief-making that is almost unthinkable in any other industry.Ogilvy would have approved. When he started his agency, he spelt out his “insane ambition” over lunch with 10 reporters. From then on, he found himself being asked for comment on every industry issue. “I always spoke my mind, and I was always quoted,” he said.Fittingly, this week’s claims and jibes from the rival admen do not quite live up to reality. WPP, Interpublic and Havas (as well as the more discreet Dentsu) will probably not be overwhelmed with anxious Publicis and Omnicom clients fleeing a bureaucratic behemoth.But it is also worth checking the small print on the merging companies’ claims. The “merger of equals” is an attempt to combine two groups with very different financial, executive and cultural profiles.Their strategic argument that scale will help them keep pace with the likes of Google is a matter of debate. Barclays analysts found no correlation between company size and organic growth. Scale should at least help offset clients’ pressure on fees, though.The cultural and governance questions look harder to answer. Franco-US mergers stir unhappy memories of Alcatel-Lucent and Vivendi-Universal – and this one will have two headquarters and two CEOs.Mr Lévy and Mr Wren intend to be co-CEOs for 30 months. It is some comfort that they have spelt out a medium-term governance structure, with Mr Lévy as chairman and Mr Wren as sole CEO. Nevertheless, in spite of their camaraderie this week, they are very different characters. Mr Lévy is a suave extravert with a taste for splashy digital deals. Mr Wren makes few public appearances, and has focused on organic growth.Both Publicis and Omnicom have small head office teams and, if no serious agency restructuring is planned, culture clashes are likely be confined. But marketing is still a business where egos are sensitive to small slights – as evidenced by muttering within Omnicom about Publicis’s precedence in the new company’s name, and suggestions that the companies could have devised a more inspired brand than ‘Publicis Omnicom Group’.However, their bigger task will be to use their persuasive powers to answer clients’ questions about what, if anything, the merger does for them. The dilemma is that they must offer different messages to different audiences. Investors would really like savings from crunching agencies together, or more bargaining power in media buying. But these are not messages they can convey to nervous staff, squeezed media owners or wary regulators. Not surprisingly, there has been no discussion of closing agencies, nor job losses.Pleasing investors, regulators, clients, staff and media suppliers will be a tricky communications challenge. Mr Lévy and Mr Wren own four large PR companies. If they want to prove the creative power of Publicis Omnicom Group, they could start by taking a leaf out of Sir Martin’s headline-grabbing book.Their longer-term challenge will be avoiding the traps inherent in a transatlantic power-sharing deal between two profoundly different corporate cultures.What could possibly go wrong? Plenty.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times’ media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
72;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-31T11:22:45Z;Top Omnicom shareholders welcome Publicis merger deal;;Market reaction to Publicis and Omnicom’s transatlantic advertising and marketing merger plans has been cool, with shares in both companies declining since Sunday’s announcement, but top Omnicom shareholders say they welcomed the “merger of equals”.John Goetz, co-chief investment office for Pzena Asset Management and a top 10 shareholder in the US based agency owner, said he had hoped Omnicom would get a little more of the valuation in the deal “given that it was a little more undervalued beforehand”, but he was positive overall.Chief among the reasons cited by investors for welcoming the deal were the $500m of cuts that the two companies have promised to extract from their costs should the merger be blessed by shareholders and regulators.“It’s a good deal, mainly because of the synergies. The level and trajectory of margins is pretty good,” said Jason Leder, portfolio manager for Invesco’s Value Opportunity fund, in which Omnicom is the second largest holding at 4.5 per cent of the portfolio.One reason for the slippage in the two companies’ share prices, after a Monday morning burst of market enthusiasm, may be a timescale for finding all those cuts that will require considerable patience: a whole five years. Yet investors said the $500m target was an understatement of the potential to improve margins.“Prior deals have led to much bigger savings,” Mr Goetz said.Explanations for the small decline in the share price since the announcement included the possibility that both sides were slightly disappointed with the terms of the no-premium deal or that investors may be selling shares to invest in other agencies such as Havas or Interpublic that may become targets in any further consolidation.The merger has also been portrayed as a defensive move against the rise of technology rivals such as Google, something that investors say John Wren of Omnicom and Maurice Lévy of Publicis were keen to play down in their conversations with shareholders on Monday.Investors disagreed over the importance of scale. “We’ve always felt that the soft side of advertising is going to be important, but the balance has shifted a little towards data,” said one top 30 investor, who thought the deal would help both groups to “stay competitive”.Mr Goetz saw the benefits of size in different terms, perhaps encouraging detente with the tech giants: “The bigger you are, the more natural partner you are in any natural evolution of the provision of advertising to clients.”He added that greater size would make acquisitions in new areas, for example Publicis’ past purchase of digital agencies such as Razorfish, easier.Investors say that while the chief executives’ personalities helped make a deal happen, the underlying logic behind it was sound, rather than a vanity project. They did however voice some concerns over the plan for the two men to share leadership of the new company for 30 months, a management structure with few successful precedents.The structure of the two groups was seen as a positive in any integration. Both are already international, and each operates as a holding company controlling subsidiaries that operate with significant independence.Publicis is seen as the more centralised, but this gave investors confidence that its cost-saving approach could be applied to Omnicom. Investors also said the dual management structure resolved the question of who will succeed Mr Lévy, 71.“It was pretty clear that John Wren is looking forward to ultimately being the sole CEO. But in the beginning it’s about both being there to tell the teams on both sides to find the best solution,” said Mr Goetz.Overall, the reaction was more of contentment rather than full-blooded excitement. One investor said the deal may improve Omnicom’s operations and balance sheet, but there was little change in his firm’s valuation of the group.
73;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-30T18:20:55Z;Publicis and Omnicom must fight for talent;;Alex Bogusky was the young superstar of adland. Called “Advertising’s Elvis,” the often long-haired creative legend graced magazine covers and led his agency, Crispin Porter + Bogusky, to win the industry’s most prestigious awards for clients such as Burger King and Volkswagen.At the age of 39, he was inducted into the American Advertising Federation’s Hall of Achievement. In 2010, at the age of 46, he shocked the industry and quit the ad business.Since then, a talent war has raged for the next generation of stars like Mr Bogusky. Despite the scale to which advertising’s biggest holding companies have grown – as highlighted by this week’s $35bn tie-up between Publicis and Omnicom – the industry’s top employees are the rainmakers. As with star investment bankers, clients and revenues follow them from agency to agency.For Maurice Lévy and John Wren, who will jointly run the merged Publicis and Omnicom if the deal goes through, one of their greatest business challenges will be retaining such talent, especially in the face of start-ups and tech companies like Facebook increasingly poaching employees from the advertising world.Not only do rivals see the opportunity to poach talented employees but they also think the deal could help lure new business should the Publicis and Omnicom agencies lose focus.“You now have 130,000 people whose focus has been turned off their clients’ business and on to internal politics and gossip and wondering what this means for them,” said David Jones, chief executive of Havas.While the two companies frame the deal as a way to retain talent with new tech-driven opportunities and the chance to work on something bigger, some internal employees and rivals think otherwise. Industry executives were quick to point to the record of senior ad executives who often depart after an ad agency is sold to a larger conglomerate.“Although there is something formidable about the size of the enterprise that they created, I don’t think that in and of itself attracts people,” said Andrew Essex, vice-chairman of Droga5, the independent ad shop. “By definition there is a level of anonymity and matrix-like serfdom. That doesn’t feel special like the entrepreneurial appeal of a small shop.”Publicis and Omnicom executives promised that the deal will lead to $500m in annual synergy benefits, but said that there are no planned job cuts. “This wasn’t done so that we could go in and cut jobs,” said Mr Wren, chief executive of Omnicom. “We wouldn’t have done it if that was the only opportunity or vision . . . That would be no way for neither he nor I to end our careers.”Publicis and Omnicom marketing clients said that they plan to closely watch how the deal shakes out and whether the people who work on their business stay. “They will have to find synergies without killing off the entrepreneurial spirit of the agencies,” said David Kenny, chief executive of the Weather Company who previously was chief executive of Publicis’ digital ad shop, Digitas.Meanwhile, the industry is fighting a much larger battle. Advertising companies not only compete with each other to recruit the next generation of talent but also must fend off tech companies and start-ups that promise stock options, free food and the opportunity to change the world.“Often the best talent is the most inclined to experiment and take risks,” Mr Essex said. “The idea of moving into new industries, where one normally would not have taken gigs, makes [the talent issue] more difficult.”The industry already has some plans under way in attempts to change its benefits to keep employees. In April, for example, Publicis created a bonus and retention programme for 200 of its key executives based on whether the company met certain growth and margin targets in the next three to four years.The deal, in part, created an elegant solution for the talent issue that plagued Publicis at the very top of its ranks. At 71, Mr Lévy, the chief executive of Publicis, is nearing the end of his career and had no likely heir apparent in place.Once the merger is complete, Mr Lévy will serve as co-chief executive with Mr Wren, 60, for 30 months. After that, Mr Lévy will be chairman, Mr Wren chief executive.Questions are swirling throughout the industry over who will take over the yet-to-be determined senior leadership roles at the combined company. Company insiders also are wondering whether the individual advertising creative agencies, tech groups and ad-buying networks within the company will remain separate or if some will be merged and whether that will drive people to leave.Some executives said that they are expecting to receive a wave of pitches from recruiters, who will be eager to lure them away to other advertising groups with positions to fill.
74;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-30T18:20:55Z;Publicis and Omnicom face antitrust hurdle;;For all the breezy talk of a regulatory greenlight for Christmas, Publicis and Omnicom must still navigate an often unpredictable antitrust clearance process across four continents, which could cause delays, force sell-offs or indeed kill the merger.At this stage, the two groups are confident of closing the transaction as soon as the end of December, just five months away, implying fast-track approval from the US, EU and China is likely.Many experts find this optimistic. The deal has not immediately raised red flags among antitrust watchers or members of Congress. But regulators will find it hard to resist paying close attention to a $35bn deal of such complexity and ambition.“Regulators are likely to undertake a thorough review given scope and magnitude of the transaction,” said Jonathan Kanter, of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.In pure antitrust terms, the combined market share in media buying is expected to potentially raise more concerns than the advertising and marketing side, where barriers to entry are relatively low.Market share estimates are contested. But French research group RECMA estimates the combined media buying concentration is greatest in the Americas, with a 41.6 per cent share. This suggests the merger is likely to face its toughest test in the US.By contrast, its presence in the top five national markets in the EU is 30.9 per cent, which remains smaller than WPP/GroupM and below the rough 40 per cent benchmark that triggers intense antitrust scrutiny.Concerns about the tie-up are already being voiced. Stephan Loerke, of the World Federation of Advertisers, said: “We are alert to the risks that excessive consolidation in the advertising market can also lead to a reduction in competition and transparency for our members.”Omnicom and Publicis see the speculation over high market shares hiding more important market trends, which will convince regulators the deal poses no competition concerns.The groups are likely to argue the media buying space is increasingly fragmented, with advertisers buying directly from media groups and digital powerhouses such as Google sapping the buying power of traditional buyers.The chief executive of one smaller rival said he did not expect regulators to block the deal, given that marketing is a business-to-business industry, making it hard for regulators to demonstrate that consumers would be harmed by a more powerful market leader.A US official said it was so far unclear whether the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, which share responsibility for antitrust reviews, will be the lead agency to investigate the deal. The determination will be made once the agencies review the companies’ antitrust filing. Advertising traditionally falls within the purview of the DoJ, however.To date no advertising merger has faced serious problems with the European Commission, the EU’s antitrust enforcer. WPP’s takeover of Grey in 2005 was cleared without conditions in a first-phase review.In the review, the commission defined media buying and marketing services as separate markets at national level – giving an indication of how it would likely examine the Omnicom-Publicis deal.Brussels’ main concern in 2005 was the German market. Officials checked whether the combined group would wield unhealthy clout against media owners, but concluded that the “countervailing power” of television and print groups kept the market competitive.Such big, complex transactions can also create less obvious overlaps that pique the interest of regulators.“My biggest concern is that these companies focus on the strategies of their clients and they give strategic advice, not only about advertising,” said Albert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute.Mr Foer said there was a “potential of co-ordinating strategies” within a large part of an industry if two rivals receive strategic advice from the merged company on issues like product development, placement and pricing.“I don’t think that is healthy. Whether it amounts to an antitrust violation or not, it has to be looked at pretty closely,” he said. “I don’t think firewalls are very persuasive.”By Alex Barker in Brussels, Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Emily Steel in New York
75;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-30T16:51:16Z;A glimpse into the second golden age of advertising;We may soon be watching the moment efficiency became hip, writes Jerry Della Femina;“Google and Facebook are attacking,” came the cry from Madison Avenue. “Circle the wagons,” was the answer from France. And so two of the world’s biggest advertising companies, Omnicom and Publicis, announce they are merging. Now that advertisements are more algorithm than Mad Men, the television series depicting Madison Avenue in the 1960s, the merger is being interpreted as the end of the golden era of advertising. It has been seen by the news media as a move by these two ad agencies to shore up resources in order to compete with the giants of Silicon Valley.The problem with this view, however, is that it makes two flawed assumptions. On one hand, it imagines there is a data-enabled, predictive digital advertising machine that is the inevitable future. Search for tyres and you get an ad for Michelins on sale a mile from your current location. On the other hand, it overly romanticises Mad Men-style advertising virtuosity, in which three suave guys sit back with cocktails and kick around ideas on how to sell you anything from hair-replacement therapy to car insurance.Both caricatures have a kernel of truth to them. But if advertising is to thrive in this wired era, the efficiency of digitally targeted media must embrace the creativity of Mad Men, and vice versa. The organisations that can do this, whether they are conglomerates or boutiques, will usher in advertising’s second golden age. Indeed, in a short time we may be watching a hit TV series (or web series, for that matter) dramatising the moment when efficiency became hip.The fate of the newly formed Publicis Omnicom Group remains to be written, and Maurice Lévy and John Wren, who will serve as joint chief executives, may not make it through the 30 months that they have agreed to serve together. Yet, if this cross-Atlantic merger leads to a better understanding that good advertising manages the synergies between creativity and efficiency, it will have been a transformational moment for the business. There are three things we should look for.First, can digitally targeted advertising also be creative? It is now possible to target adverts to the right person at the right time in the right place. But that is not enough. It is not sufficient to claim that customer segmentation is dead and set up an automatically generated slew of ads based on input. If the adverts are not inspired, they are noise. And they will be ignored. In our quest to tweet, like and trend, we have forgotten that brands can be built through advertising. Ads can generate big ideas that can never be trumped by tactics. That is the magic of an ad, and that is what is missing from many ads today.Second, even creative adverts have to be efficiently produced and delivered so they meet the basic goal of selling products by advancing the brand image. Too often, the decision on the client side is left to people who have little experience and cannot judge a flashy ad from one that will sell. Money is being wasted on adverts that go right over a consumer’s head. They may win awards at Cannes, but they lose at the cash register.The way to fix this is to think about process improvement: how are critical decisions made? Not long ago, it was rare for businesses in the knowledge economy to think along these lines. Today, we are seeing a commitment to greater efficiency across a range of sectors, from manufacturing to professional services. It is time to bring this thinking to advertising.The Google model of targeted advertising is appealing because it claims to cut down on waste. We need to ask how that efficiency can be brought to creative process. Done right, it may even generate greater creativity. Mr Lévy and Mr Wren, along with the chief marketing officers managing our best global brands, should look to the example set by counterparts in manufacturing and supply management.Third, creative teams and assets need efficient management. Teams need to work together in real time so that additional resources are freed to enable the companies to innovate and grow. IBM and Accenture both illustrate the point. Both have highly sophisticated people and resource allocation, and both employ tracking systems to monitor and ensure efficiency. This data-enabled monitoring has proved neither a threat nor an impediment to creativity. In fact, data have enabled a new set of tools leaders can use to nurture creativity among teams.The cross-Atlantic merger has captured our imaginations because it is a global business development rich with personality and sex appeal. Now, the likes of Apple, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola are going to be handled by one big company. But the value of the merger will be tested by whether it ushers in the second golden age of advertising. It can do so only by merging the data and analytics of 21st century invention with the ideas and genius creativity of the first golden age of advertising, enabling efficiency and creativity to thrive side by side.The writer, founder and chairman of Della Femina and Partners, is author of ‘From Those Wonderful Folks Who Gave You Pearl Harbor’
76;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-29T20:27:55Z;Deals fail to lift US stocks;;Deal news was responsible for the two biggest movers on the S&P 500 on Monday, as advertising company Interpublic Group led the benchmark index on news of an industry merger, and Perrigo fell furthest after announcing plans to buy Elan.First, the good news. Interpublic shares rose 4.7 per cent to $16.61 as investors speculated that the merger between Omnicom and Publicis would lead to more acquisitions in the advertising field.However, Omnicom fell 0.6 per cent to $64.75 after plans emerged for a $35bn merger with Publicis, despite opening sharply higher.The companies will be the world’s largest marketing group by revenue and equity value if the deal is approved by regulators.Acquisition news also drove high-end department store Saks higher after news broke that Hudson’s Bay would buy it for $2.9bn, including debt. The luxury retailer rose 4.2 per cent to $15.95.Shares in Saks had already risen more than 50 per cent on the year to date, fuelled by speculation that it was an acquisition target.The bad news was led by speciality pharmaceutical group Perrigo, which fell 6.8 per cent to $125.17 on news that it will buy Elan Corp for $8.6bn.The move will allow Perrigo to re-establish itself as an Ireland-based company and take advantage of lower tax rates, but comes at the cost of significant share dilution. Of the $8.6bn deal, 60 per cent of the offer comes in the form of Perrigo equity.Despite the numerous deals, the S&P fell 0.4 per cent to 1,685.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to 15,521.97, and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 3,599.14.Merger Mondays usually spell a rally in US stocks, but with a week full of market-moving news – including an announcement from the Federal Reserve, a second-quarter US gross domestic product reading, and a non-farm payroll report – investors were in risk-off mood.“Investors’ focus really is on other things even though a whole series of deals is usually positive for stocks,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.The S&P 500 remained up almost 5 per cent in July, providing investors with more downside risk and limited upside in the face of the week’s forthcoming news, she added.“We’ve seen a much better than expected July as a whole,” Ms Warne said. “July was a month of relief and people don’t expect that to last for ever.”US markets traded with a decidedly defensive stance, with telecoms, materials and utilities the only sectors in positive territory.Financials were among the hardest hit, including big US banks, which have recently been among the strongest performers.JPMorgan fell 0.6 per cent to $55.69, Citigroup was off 1.1 per cent to $51.64, Bank of America dropped 1.4 per cent to $14.52, and Goldman Sachs fell 1.3 per cent to $163.17.Losses were tempered by a 1.5 per cent rise for Apple, the heaviest-weighted stock on the Nasdaq. The tech giant has risen 6.9 per cent since announcing earnings that showed better iPhone sales than expected.Facebook also helped the tech benchmark, up 4.2 per cent to $35.43. The social network has risen more than 35 per cent since it reported earnings last week that showed strong mobile ad revenue and rising numbers of advertisers.Caterpillar led the blue chip-focused Dow, rising 1.2 per cent to $83.02. The construction equipment manufacturer announced an agreement to buy $1bn of its stock from Société Générale.
77;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-29T18:42:28Z;PR, an industry with a PR problem;One of its own protagonists is forecasting the death of the sector;It looks like goodbye, public relations people. It was sometimes interesting, and often aggravating, to know you. I am sure we will miss you when you are gone.The last rites (sort of) for the PR industry as we have known it have been read not by journalists, an equally endangered species, but by a PR person. “The writing is on the wall for the traditional consumer-focused public relations model,” says Benjamin Webb, founder of Deliberate PR.“The deluge of badly-written press releases, silly events and photo stunts, “news stories” without news value, and meaningless “campaigns” have come to irk journalists and bore an increasingly cynical general public,” he writes on the BBC website. “If anything, it will be the changing nature of the media that will fundamentally alter the PR industry, weeding out the hapless and the disingenuous.”Hear, hear – but I would say that because I am a journalist. A large part of the PR industry’s image problem may stem from having as its principal target the most cynical of professions. The average journalist’s attitude to PR is, to misquote HL Mencken, that of the dog to the lamp post.Things are not helped by the fact that journalists feel outnumbered. According to Nick Davies, author of Flat Earth News, by 2008, the UK had more people in PR (47,800) than journalists (45,000).For too long, argues Mr Webb, PR people have got away with hoodwinking clients with “peculiar algorithms that link the size of an editorial article on the page with the cost that it would have taken to secure an advert of the same dimensions”. Now the growth of social media has created better ways of evaluating success.This new world is creating problems for the whole advertising and marketing industry, of course – the issue behind the planned $35bn merger of Publicis and Omnicom. But PR, the lowest-paid marketing discipline, has the worst image problem. Associated with insincerity and manipulation, it generates not the cool fictional characters of Madmen but the ridiculous Edina of Absolutely Fabulous and Malcolm Tucker of The Thick Of It.Mr Webb’s musings were provoked by the fact that last Saturday was – I kid you not – PR National Awareness Day. No, I was not aware of it either. The profession could do with stepping back from the limelight and spending more time working out what “credible interactive content”, as Mr Webb calls it, in the digital era might mean.But enough stone-throwing from my greenhouse. I know many PRs who do a fine, unsung job. As we both fight for survival in the digital world, we may never be rid of each other.…Management envyThe UK has 5m managers, 10 times as many as in 1911, says my colleague Lucy Kellaway. Do we need them all?The word “management” was not used in its modern sense until the 20th century. In the industrial revolution there were just owners, gang bosses and overseers. Now we are obsessed with management. In part it is a change of nomenclature: a conductor becomes a train manager, an administrator an office manager, a technician is an IT manager. But executives are obsessed by MBAs and books by management “gurus”, and talk in an impenetrable language of “key deliverables” and “scalable solutions” (I particularly dislike “the piece”, meaning sphere, as in: “it happens right across the marketing piece”).The rise of the manager seems unstoppable. Remember “delayering” in the early 1990s, which was supposed to cut out swaths of middle managers? Not only are they still there, but 800,000 more managers will be needed by 2017 than in 2007, according to the UK Commission on Employment and Skills.I imagine this is part of the “we are all middle-class now” phenomenon and the decline of semi-skilled and unskilled work. In the 20th century, the manager’s title, desk and office were what social climbers sought. Now that there are fewer production line jobs, many occupations have some element of managerial responsibility.So could we do without managers? Probably not. It is too glib to say this would lead to more efficiency, with fewer meetings and memos. But there is something liberating in the fact that the title has become so ubiquitous as to be meaningless.brian.groom@ft.com
78;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-29T18:18:40Z;Contrasting admen team up to tackle digital challenge;;It took Maurice Lévy nearly four decades to build Publicis into the third-largest advertising and marketing services group by revenues, creating and buying ads for the likes of McDonald’s, Walmart, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.On Sunday, the 71-year-old secured his ultimate crown jewel: a “merger of equals” with Omnicom, the world’s second-largest advertising group, which he hopes will lay the foundations for the technology-driven advertising company of the future.“The new chapter we are opening is first and foremost a story of talent and innovation in a world being reshaped by technology,” Mr Lévy said. The $35bn merger, creating the world’s largest advertising company, caps a six-month courtship between two executives who have distinctly different personalities and have deployed very different strategies for building their businesses.In contrast to Mr Lévy’s charisma and proclivity for appearing in the press, John Wren, the 60-year-old chief executive of Omnicom, keeps a low profile. In contrast to Mr Lévy’s multibillion-dollar digital ad agency shopping spree over the past few years, Mr Wren has preferred to strike partnerships with technology companies and build in-house capabilities.What ultimately brought these two executives together in the biggest deal in the history of the advertising industry is a common vision for the future of the advertising business and how it will profit from the vast digital disruption upending their industry. Advertising companies need to invest in technology and striking partnerships with digital companies in order to succeed, they said.“We’ve taken slightly different but not completely different tactics on digital,” Mr Wren said. “I think the differences are complementary and will strengthen us.”There’s a revolution under way in the advertising business, where the decades-old wining-and-dining sales tactics are being replaced with sophisticated new technologies that mimic stock market-like systems for the buying and selling of ads.Meanwhile, creative advertising shops, which historically designed splashy 30-second television commercials, now are tapping data to build personalised internet ads and real-time marketing campaigns for social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook.The new technologies place a huge emphasis on tapping consumer data to target the right ad to the right person at the right time. A dog food marketer, for instance, could use these systems to only show ads to people with pets, while a diaper marketer could show ads solely to new parents.Today, marketers spend $116.8bn on digital advertising, about a fifth of the total global ad market. That portion is expected to expand dramatically in the coming years, as marketers shift more dollars to digital in an attempt to keep pace with the proliferation of media. Global digital ad spending, for instance, is expected to increase 23 per cent this year, while total ad spending is expected to inch up only 2.8 per cent, according to eMarketer.Mr Wren has repeatedly said during the past year that all media, from television commercials to mobile phone ads and digital billboards, will ultimately be bought and sold through technology-driven ad-buying systems. “I think none of us are going to be speaking about anything that isn’t digital three to four years from now,” Mr Wren said. “The state of change is constant.”One of the architects who oversaw the creation of Omnicom in 1986, Mr Wren took over as chief executive of the group in 1997. Under his leadership, Omnicom made investments in digital ad shops amid the dotcom boom, when a crop of new companies with names such as Razorfish and Organic emerged, and promised that the rise of the internet would revolutionise the media and marketing landscapes. Omnicom acquired some of these groups after the internet bubble burst, but since then has made few deals. Instead, the focus has been on building digital capabilities within its traditional creative agencies, such as BBDO and TBWA. It also invested in Annalect, a digital ad-buying and analytic unit in its media buying group.Publicis, meanwhile, has spent billions of dollars in the past couple of years snapping up digital ad shops starting with a $1.3bn bid for Digitas, a specialist in online and interactive marketing, in 2006. In the following years, Publicis completed several similar acquisitions and also built a digital ad-buying and analytic group.Rob Jonas, an executive at PubMatic, an ad sales platform for publishers, said: “When you put Publicis and Omnicom together, you’ve got one who’s strong on the media buying and planning side, and one who’s strong on the technology side. When you put them together you’re going to find a very strong technology-driven business that’s going to look much more like a WPP than the constituent parts that it’s come from.”Rivals questioned the logic of the deal. “If you’re Walmart and you get bigger and bigger, your soap powder gets cheaper and cheaper – but it doesn’t work like that in our industry, brilliant ideas don’t get better or cheaper because you are bigger,” said David Jones, the chief executive of Havas. “In fact the opposite. And because of technology, the scale argument in media is now largely redundant.”Publicis and Omnicom executives said a merged entity would be better able to invest in new technology systems for buying and creating ads, and to strike deeper relationships with tech firms putting it in a stronger position to compete with a new set of rivals. Those rivals include companies from Google to Accenture, which are offering new approaches for marketers to reach consumers.“When this is complete, we will have an offering that nobody else will,” Mr Wren said. “That frees us up to think of the investments that we can make on whatever the next platform is.”Additional reporting by Robert Cookson
79;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-29T18:00:55Z;Publicis and Omnicom face hard sell;;Investors have given a lukewarm reaction to the proposed $35bn merger of Publicis and Omnicom, as the creation of a new Franco-US leader of the global advertising and marketing industry faced scrutiny from clients, regulators, rivals and analysts.The unexpected combination of the industry’s second and third-largest companies by revenue, with a promised $500m of annual synergy benefits after five years but no premium for either company’s shareholders, left shares in Publicis up only 0.25 per cent at €59.50 as trading closed in Paris. Omnicom shares closed 0.55 per cent lower at $64.75 in New York.Rivals seized on the reaction as evidence of investor concerns about a deal that could reshape competition in an industry already grappling with new entrants from Google to Accenture. “The market is saying they’re not convinced of the strategy,” said Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the current market leader by revenues.Sir Martin said he saw no need for WPP to respond with an acquisition of another large agency owner such as Interpublic or Havas, although Interpublic shares closed up 4.6 per cent in New York and Havas closed up almost 5 per cent.Michael Roth, chief executive of Interpublic, wrote in a memo to staff: “As this weekend’s surprising news shows, there’s no telling what might take place, but we don’t see the need for major M&A to keep delivering on our plan to move Interpublic forward.”“There’s nothing about scale that makes for better creative ideas, or leads to better integration of marketing disciplines,” he added.Analysts at Barclays said the combined market share of Publicis and Omnicom in media buying could make disposals necessary but added that they did not see significant regulatory risks. Maurice Lévy, Publicis chief executive, and John Wren, his opposite number at Omnicom, reiterated that they expected the deal to be approved as soon as the end of this year.Some trade bodies raised concerns, however. ISBA, a group representing British advertisers, said the deal raised “significant concerns about market dominance and the restriction of choice for advertisers”.“We have a longstanding concern about the effects of excessive concentration on business. We hope that this news does not signal greater concentration that would raise greater concern among advertisers,” said Bob Wootton, ISBA’s director of media and advertising.Some industry executives said a successful merger of Publicis and Omnicom would be a boon for smaller independent companies, which could provide marketers with an alternative to the massive holding companies.Miles Nadal, chairman and chief executive of MDC Partners, owner of agencies such as Crispin Porter + Bogusky, said the merger was “a brilliant deal strategically for the two firms and their two principals”, but added that smaller competitors could be “huge beneficiaries” by picking up a larger share of some clients’ business.Dominic Proctor, president of Group M, the WPP media investment management arm, cast doubt on the likelihood of the merger creating a successful new media buying leader.“Neither Omnicom nor Publicis was able to bring their investment teams together effectively as individual companies, so it will be fun to see if they can now do it together,” he said: “Media investment management relies heavily on scale, but scale counts for nothing if it continues to be disparate.”
80;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-29T17:54:15Z;Publicis / Omnicom: merger of equals?;Creating a colossus is a risk for both buyer and seller;The Publicis/Omnicom tie-up has been pitched as a “merger of equals”. How fitting for a deal between two advertisers. The term is a classic bit of spin. Yes, the shareholders of each company will own half of the combined entity. But as in any deal, one company is buying the other – Publicis is acquiring Omnicom with shares – and one party is very likely to be getting the better of the other. It is just a matter of figuring out which one.Publicis shareholders will end up owning half of a company with revenues that are two-thirds larger than the French group’s. But look at what they are giving up. Publicis boss Maurice Lévy has focused on fast-growing areas such as emerging markets and digital. The result is that its revenues have grown an average 9 per cent annually over the past five years. Omnicom’s revenues have grown at just 2 per cent. And Mr Lévy runs a lean operation. Publicis commands some of the highest operating margins in the industry – 16.1 per cent in 2012, against Omnicom’s 12.7 per cent.So while Publicis shareholders appear to get more than their fair share of the combined company, the French group’s strengths are being diluted overnight. As for Omnicom, chief executive John Wren has done what he always said he would not do – make a big risky bet on digital.The deal is not a zero-sum game. If the merged entity can extract the touted synergies – $500m per year after five years – both buyer and seller could end up with something more valuable than what they had. And an industry dominated by two big operators – WPP is the other – will have greater bargaining power with clients and suppliers.Yet size is not an unalloyed good. Advertising is a fast-changing business. Clients need agents to be nimble. Creating a colossus with $23bn in revenue is therefore a risk for both buyer and seller. If the total shareholder returns of both companies are a guide, Mr Wren’s eventual elevation to CEO of the merged group may hinder the creation of one as operationally efficient as Publicis.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
81;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-29T17:02:37Z;Publicis gains as ‘merger of equals’ buoys European media;FTSE Eurofirst 300 edges up after downside pressure from financials;Shares in Publicis, the French advertising agency that has plans to merge with US rival Omnicom, climbed as bid news helped keep pan-European indices afloat.The $35bn Franco-US “merger of equals” was signed in Paris on Sunday and, pending shareholder and regulatory approval, creates the world’s largest marketing company by revenues.Publicis shares opened for trade at the same time as Omnicom’s as New York markets came online and closed after two hours of trade up 0.1 per cent to €59.40.“The deal will bring the group significant scale, which in turn will give it bargaining power and scope for significant potential synergies,” said analysts at Citigroup.Rival media groups rallied in response. France’s Havas gained 4.7 per cent to €5.66.Drugmaker Elan jumped 3.7 per cent to €11.55 after US rival Perrigo agreed to pay $8.6bn for the Irish company.Elan put itself up for sale last month after fighting off the advances of Royalty Pharma – rejecting three offers.Completing a trio of deals, Essilor International, the maker of lenses for spectacles, rallied 6.2 per cent to €85.62 after paying $1.73bn to take full control of Transitions Optical, its joint venture with US company PPG Industries.Meanwhile, KPN, the Dutch telecoms company which merged its German mobile unit with Telefónica Deutschland last week, rose after its biggest shareholder America Movil ended an agreement that keeps its stake below 30 per cent.Although the company owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim gave no indication it would raise its stake from the current 29.8 per cent, shares in KPN rose 4.6 per cent to €1.98.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 climbed 0.1 per cent to 1,206.04, with downside pressure from financial stocks keeping a lid on overall gains.Danone, the French food group, climbed 3.2 per cent to €59.27 after reporting like-for-like revenue growth of 6.5 per cent, beating market forecasts.The maker of dairy products and bottled waters said it saw a surge in sales of baby nutrition products in China.Ryanair was one of the biggest fallers after the Irish airline reported a weaker than expected first-quarter profit. Its shares fell 2.8 per cent to €6.97.
82;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-29T16:42:01Z;Veteran dealmaker Sir Martin Sorrell is left stranded;;Advertising’s biggest dealmaker finds himself uncharacteristically sidelined in the biggest deal in the sector’s history.Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, built the former wire basket company into the industry’s largest holding company through acquisitions of famed creative agencies such as Ogilvy, J Walter Thompson and Grey Global. He also broadened its business into market research, emerging markets and digital marketing.Yet he risks finding himself in second place if the planned merger of Publicis and Omnicom goes ahead, creating a group with 2012 revenues of $22.7bn compared with WPP’s $16bn.The WPP boss made clear his view of the deal in a CNBC interview on Monday morning, citing the merger codenames for Publicis and Omnicom, Purple and Orange. Mix the two together and you get “a muddy brown or grey colour”, he quipped.Sir Martin’s competitive streak is particularly acute when it comes to his rivalry with Maurice Lévy, Publicis’ chief executive, and a recurrent question among agency executives across the industry was: “What’s Martin going to do?”.Reporters at the press conference announcing the formation of Publicis Omnicom Group could not resist asking how the two companies expected him to respond.“Martin Sorrell is a strong competitor, a very strong competitor, we respect WPP enormously,” Mr Lévy said. But he added: “We do not define our strategy as regard to what he will think or what he will do.”Sir Martin poured faint praise on the deal as “extremely bold, extremely brave” and “very surprising”, singling out Mr Lévy for “all credit and bouquets” for the deal he secured for Publicis shareholders.As for what he would do, Sir Martin played down the need for WPP to respond, saying it would still lead the European and Asian markets and the deal would only create significant scale in the US where regulators would “take a good hard look at that”.WPP had several ways of responding, Bernstein Research analysts argued. It could replicate the Publicis-Omnicom strategy and buy another large agency group such as Interpublic or Havas. “But we think that Sorrell is a sophisticated thinker who may well look elsewhere,” the analysts said.Instead, WPP could expand further into data services and consumer insight by targeting market research companies such as Nielsen, GfK or Ipsos. A deal with one of the large software groups was another option, they said, but control could be an issue if WPP were the smaller partner.Sir Martin steered people the other way, saying those speculating about further acquisitions larger than its recent bolt-on deals were looking in the wrong direction.Instead, he argued, WPP could grow organically, by picking up clients and talent that fall out of the new market leader, and by pursuing its four-pronged strategy of focusing on faster-growth countries, digital business, consumer insight and pushing its divisions to work together.“There are massive opportunities for us to grow organically,” he said.Whichever route he chooses, few believe the WPP boss will be satisfied at being number two for long.
83;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-29T16:30:43Z;‘Stars align’ to allow for Omnicom-Publicis merger;;For Omnicom chief executive John Wren, the tie-up with Publicis is only possible now because “the stars had aligned”. But aligning the two was no simple process.The two groups are at pains to present their deal as a merger of equals, but on many measures Omnicom is the bigger of the two, with nearly double the revenues in 2012, and greater free cash flow and operating income.But Publicis has faster growth, thanks to the French group’s more aggressive digital dealmaking and expansion in fast-growing markets such as China under its septuagenarian chief executive Maurice Lévy.That has translated into a stronger share price performance, with Publicis stock outperforming Omnicom by 42 per cent since the start of 2010. The French group’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margin of 18 per cent far outstrips that of Omnicom at 14.7 per cent.On Monday, Mr Lévy conceded that the merger would have been impossible some years ago, but the rise in Publicis shares meant the two market capitalisations were closely aligned as they finalised the terms. Their net incomes line up equally closely at about $1bn each, as do their price to earnings ratios for this year.With small adjustments to their cash balances, paid out as dividends before the deal closes, the transaction gives each company’s shareholders roughly half of the new company. Publicis shareholders will have a slight advantage with 50.6 per cent of the fully diluted share capital.Omnicom shareholders will receive slightly less than 50 per cent, necessary to qualify for the new holding company’s Netherlands tax jurisdiction. Yet they will have a greater dividend payout and will own half of a group with better digital, media buying and emerging markets prospects than they had before.Doing the deal after such a run in Publicis shares benefits the French company, Citigroup analysts said on Monday. “This has given Publicis a unique opportunity to lock in its premium multiple,” they wrote.WPP’s Sir Martin Sorrell congratulated Mr Lévy, his frequent rival, on the deal but made no mention of Mr Wren, implying that the US group had come out worse off in the deal.Mergers are also balanced on board control, and analysts noted that the new company would start with equal numbers of directors from each company until 2019. However, Mr Wren is set to act as group chief executive in the longer term, when Mr Lévy steps up from a co-CEO role to chairman after 30 months.Analysts and rivals said it might not be until other roles were assigned, such as the chief financial officer, that they could tell who, if anybody, was the merger’s first among equals.
84;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-29T10:22:43Z;Publicis Omnicom faces challenges in wake of $35bn merger;;The proposed $35bn merger between France’s Publicis and Omnicom of the US to create a global advertising powerhouse will bring some of the world’s best-known agencies under one roof.But with that come some significant challenges. Here are the three big issues being aired in the industry.AntitrustCompetition authorities in Europe and the US will be scrutinising Publicis Omnicom Group, which will dominate the ad-buying world, spending an estimated combined $100bn a year, which represents about 20 per cent of the global media business.The main competition issue is expected to be in media buying, where advertising agencies purchase television or print ads on behalf of customers. Together, the two companies will have sales of almost $23bn, more than twice the £10.4bn in revenue that rival WPP reported last year.The merger, which needs to be cleared by regulators in 45 countries, will also see the new group own three of the world’s five largest media agencies, according to Ad Age.Publicis and Omnicom have said they were advised by “some of the best lawyers and do not expect any regulatory obstacles”.Client conflictsThe new company will house global rivals spanning all sectors from technology and telecommunications to consumer and automotive, raising questions as to whether some clients will re-evaluate their agency relationships.Clients of Publicis Omnicom include Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble, Nissan and Toyota, AT&T and Verizon, Google and Microsoft.Rival ad agencies, which may use the period of uncertainty to try to poach some clients, are already publicly criticising the merger.David Jones, chief executive of rival media agency Havas, said: “Clients today want us to be faster, more agile, more nimble and more entrepreneurial, not bigger and more bureaucratic and more complex.”Clients today want us to be faster, more agile, more nimble and more entrepreneurial, not bigger and more bureaucratic and more complexPublicis and Omnicom have stressed that they have had years of experience setting up “strict firewalls” to protect clients’ interests. However, some of their larger, longstanding clients may lose the leverage they have been used to in negotiating better payment terms.Culture clashThe deal is being presented as a merger of equals, which is one of the toughest types of deals to pull off.Maurice Lévy, Publicis chief executive, and John Wren, his counterpart at Omnicom, will jointly lead the new company for the first 30 months. Mr Levy will then become non-executive chairman while Mr Wren will remain as sole chief executive.The logic of combining two companies of equal size is that it creates a new company with double the market capitalisation, double the pricing power and double the management team.But history has shown that chief executive offices are not built for two and when no one is firmly in charge, promised cost savings and revenue increases can be delayed. The new group is aiming to achieve $500m in operating synergies.The new company will be headquartered in the Netherlands, with the group’s operational offices still led from Paris and New York. This separation could also lead to power battles and the creation of fiefdoms.
85;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-28T21:36:52Z;Publicis/ Omnicom: does not ad up yet;It is unclear if bigger means better;"Shareholders of Omnicom and Publicis could reasonably wonder why, exactly, their respective boards decided to combine the second and third largest global advertising agencies. After all, the shares of Omnicom and Publicis are each up more than 30 per cent in the last year.Yet on Sunday the two joined forces anyway, in a $35bn merger of equals that, if the deal goes through, will create a monstrosity that will easily surpasses WPP as the largest ad agency in the world.It is unclear if bigger means better. But, for now, investors should question why the equal split of economics should justify an awkward shared management structure.The combined company wants the muscle to rival Google, which dominates digital ad buying with a 30 per cent market share according to eMarketer (Facebook has a 5 per cent share). Still, digital remains only a fraction of the overall advertising market. Emarketer estimates that even by 2017, digital ad spending of $170bn will represent a quarter of total ad spending.Even if the landscape does not demand a set of larger players, by acting first Omnicom and Publicis will force WPP, Dentsu, and Interpublic to act to keep up. Each may strike their own deals that are not ideal fits or are done on unfavourable terms.Big M&A is precarious. But in this transaction, the terms of a 50/50 ownership split and smallish dividends representing the only cash payouts crucially align the motivation of both companies. This spirit of fairness has also led to equally shared governance with joint CEOs for 30 months and a board with balanced contributions from each side. Ironically though, fair governance is not always optimal governance. The muddle of multiple viewpoints may be distracting. As such, the markets must be convinced that this arrangement has a purpose above protecting the jobs of bigwigs.

86;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-28T19:14:53Z;Leviathan scrambles to connect with audience;;The historic merger between Publicis and Omnicom that will create the world’s largest advertising and marketing services group by revenues is a bold bet that size matters in a new media world that is increasingly controlled by technology.Gone are the advertising’s Mad Men days when creative shops such as Publicis’ Leo Burnett developed campaigns for the Marlboro Man. Today’s marketers are scrambling to connect with consumers amid the proliferation of media and mobile devices.A new crop of companies, ranging from internet groups such as Google and Amazon to marketing newcomers such as Salesforce.com and Accenture, threaten to cut traditional advertising groups out of the equation. They offer marketers revolutionary technologies to pitch their messages to customers in real time on television, the internet, smartphones and digital billboards with analytical systems designed by actual rocket scientists.“Lines have blurred completely. There are new competitors coming in every single day,” John Wren, the chief executive of Omnicom who will become co-CEO of the new entity, told the Financial Times. “The pace of change which is occurring today is going to get faster, not slower.”Publicis and Omnicom are billing the tie-up between the two companies, which had combined revenues of $22.7bn in 2012 and a combined market capitalisation of $35.1bn (including adjustments for fully diluted stock counts), as a “powerful solution” for their clients that will create a “new standard” for the industry.“Size will matter,” Maurice Lévy, the chief executive of Publicis who will be the new group’s other co-CEO, told the FT. “What is true today is really not true tomorrow, and we have to be prepared for that.”Mr Wren, 60, said that both groups have a history of striking ad-buying and ad-technology partnerships with new digital giants such as Google and Amazon and that the merger would create more powerful solutions for clients. “None of us are going to be speaking about anything that isn’t digital three to four years from now,” he said.Indeed, traditional media outlets such as television remain important and maintaining prowess in both old and new media will be essential.Standing on the rooftop of Publicis’ headquarters at the top of the Champs Élysées on Sunday afternoon, and with a picture-postcard view of the Arc de Triomphe, Mr Lévy, 71, told the FT how the idea of the merger began.“This started on this roof … the Arc de Triomphe and, he [Wren] said, “this is priceless”, and I made a joke. And we started to think, and so it is from a joke that everything started. But it started here, on this very roof.”The two executives described on Sunday how those conversations gradually become more serious, leading to deal which stands as the advertising industry’s largest to date. Advisers worked in secret for months to resolve everything from the Dutch holding company structure, to the listings, to the board composition. The two men confirmed plans to serve as co-CEOs for 30 months, after which Mr Levy will step up to become chairman and Mr Wren will become sole CEO.“Who is at the top, we don’t care any more,” Mr Lévy said. “We want to put our fight in achieving fantastic success and achieving great leadership.”The companies hope to close the deal by the end of this year or the beginning of 2014, but it is likely to face criticism and regulatory scrutiny.On Sunday, CGT, the communist-backed trade-union federation, called the proposed merger “a financial mega-operation rather than a relevant and complementary fusion”. It demanded “intervention from the government and competition authorities to avoid monopolies in France and across the Atlantic”.Mr Lévy and Mr Wren said that they were not expecting any red flags that would prevent the deal from going forward.Some rivals questioned the two men’s plans to find $500m in “efficiency” benefits. “They can’t get $500m of synergies unless they break some eggs,” one said.Others were just stunned that such a large deal was happening at all. After news of the talks first broke, David Jones, chief executive of competitor Havas, tweeted “oh wow just saw a flying pig”.“Clients today want us to be faster, more agile, more nimble and more entrepreneurial not bigger and more bureaucratic and more complex,” Mr Jones told the FT. “I doubt you’ll find a single client who said: ‘We wish you were bigger and we were less important to you.’”Some industry analysts forecast a wave of consolidation to follow, affecting WPP, Havas, Interpublic and Dentsu. Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, played down expectations that he would do a knock-on deal, instead playing up expectations that the Publicis-Omnicom merger would cause fallout among clients and staff.“An equilibrium may be starting to be established which will generate further significant opportunities for WPP organically,” he said.Omnicom agencies have long worked for PepsiCo, while Publicis agencies work for Coca-Cola, for instance. Omnicom and Publicis agencies also share several major clients.However ad holding companies resolve client conflicts through assigning rival accounts to different agencies under their umbrella.Mr Lévy and Mr Wren said they had spoken with the chief executives and chief marketing officers of several of their clients. They had wished the deal luck and did not expect such concerns to pose an issue.Added Mr Wren: “Do I expect to have difficulties? Yes. Do I expect to have resolutions? Absolutely.”Additional reporting by Rob Budden and Anousha Sakoui.Coke and Pepsi, Nestlé and Mars, Microsoft and Google, AT&T and Verizon – these bitter pairs of competitors will now find their advertising and marketing needs handled by one company, if regulators and shareholders clear the path for Publicis and Omnicom to unite, write Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Anousha Sakoui.The combination of Omnicom agencies such as BBDO Worldwide, DDB Worldwide and TBWA Worldwide with Publicis brands including Saatchi & Saatchi, Leo Burnett, Starcom MediaVest Group and Vivaki will have profound implications for clients and competitors alike.The two companies, which already share clients including McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble and L’Oréal, called clients to reassure them about “Chinese walls” protecting their confidentiality, even as rivals forecast fallout. One person close to the deal said the merger plan involved keeping both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, but “losing one is not a dealbreaker”.Omnicom, valued at $16.8bn at the close of trading on Friday, and Publicis, valued at €11.8bn or $15.7bn, will easily pass the current market leader, WPP, with a market capitalisation of $24bn.Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive, played down any pressure to respond with acquisitions of his own, and the pressure may be more acute at smaller rivals such as Interpublic, Havas and Dentsu.Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research raised his target price for Interpublic from $16 to $21. “Interpublic will immediately be considered to be in play,” he said, pointing to WPP as the most likely buyer.
87;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-28T18:48:07Z;The quiet man of adland;;In an industry filled with flashy personalities, John Wren stands apart for his low profile. He is the quiet man of adland.The chief executive of Omnicom has long operated behind the scenes, while a fierce and very public rivalry raged between Maurice Lévy of Publicis and Sir Martin Sorrell of WPP. Mr Wren, meanwhile, took the philosophy that his group’s advertising agencies – rather than their umbrella holding company – should dominate the spotlight.Raised in Brooklyn, Mr Wren started his business career at accounting firm Arthur Andersen in 1974. He entered the advertising business a decade later, joining the old Needham Harper agency.Mr Wren, 60, was part of the original team in 1986 who created Omnicom through the merger of New York agencies Needham, BBDO and DDB. The group was formed as a defensive play against Saatchi & Saatchi, the London ad group where Sir Martin was an executive, which was hunting for potential acquisitions on Madison Avenue, America’s advertising capital.Mr Wren took over as chief executive in 1997 and has steadily increased the company’s global and digital footprint into the second largest ad holding company by sales.Mr Wren and Mr Levy will serve as co-chief executives of the combined Publicis-Omnicom group for 30 months. Mr Lévy will then become chairman and Mr Wren, CEO.Industry insiders said there is a “collegial feeling” between Mr Wren and Mr Lévy, but also described the duo as polar opposites, not only in personality but also in their approach to business.Mr Wren has shied away from major digital acquisitions after the dotcom boom, in stark contrast to Mr Lévy who has made bold bets to get ahead. “How would they agree on future strategy?” an industry source asked.As his overseas rivals contended with criticism over their pay, Mr Wren has escaped controversy. In 2012, Mr Wren’s total pay package was $14.8m, according to the company’s proxy statement.“I have to say from my side, Maurice is the only person in the industry that I could agree and do this with,” Mr Wren told the FT on Sunday.Mr Levy added: “John is also the only one I could agree to do the deal with.”
88;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-28T17:17:01Z;Publicis and Omnicom reshape ad world;;Publicis and Omnicom unveiled plans for a $35bn merger on Sunday that would reshape the global marketing industry and affect billions of dollars spent by the world’s largest brands everywhere from television networks to Google and Facebook.The Franco-US deal, signed at Publicis’ Paris headquarters overlooking the Arc de Triomphe, confounded analysts and rivals who warned of client conflicts, regulatory risks and culture clashes.The new Publicis Omnicom Group would be the world’s largest marketing group by revenues and equity value. Under a new Dutch holding company structure it would retain headquarters in Paris and New York, a primary listing in New York and a Euronext Paris listing.Publicis chief executive Maurice Lévy and Omnicom CEO John Wren plan to share power as co-CEOs for 30 months, after which Mr Levy, 71, will step up to become chairman and Mr Wren, 60, will become sole CEO.The two men pitched the deal as a merger of equals that would offer clients a full range of services, global reach and top creative talent at a time when traditional marketing groups face new digital rivals and clients increasingly deal direct with Silicon Valley’s largest digital platforms.“We know that the traditional competitors are not the only competitors. That base has broadened significantly and we have to respond,” Mr Wren told the Financial Times.Analysts predicted that traditional rivals would also respond, forecasting follow-on deals such as an acquisition of Interpublic by WPP, which will lose its crown as the industry’s largest company, or even a merger of Havas and Vivendi, two groups in which French investor Vincent Bolloré has ownership and influence.Rivals reacted with surprise and scepticism. Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive called it “an extremely brave, bold and surprising deal” which could generate organic growth opportunities for WPP. He hinted that Publicis had gained the upper hand, calling it “a great deal for Publicis” and added: “Time will tell if the cultures will click …co-CEOs is not an easy structure.”David Jones, chief executive of Havas, predicted fallout among clients and staff, a culture clash between the “hands-on” Publicis and “hands-off” Omnicom, “and then there’s the French/USA thing.”Mr Levy told the FT that co-CEO arrangements had worked at other companies, including SAP, and hailed examples of Franco-US co-operation going back to the American Revolution. “Very strict firewalls” were already commonly used to prevent client conflicts he said.The group will unite Publicis agencies such as Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi, creators of the Marlboro Man and Margaret Thatcher’s ‘“Labour isn’t working” campaign with Omnicom brands, such as TBWA, which created the Steve Jobs’ Apple ads and BBDO, GE’s ad agency for nearly a century.Publicis Omnicom Group will have revenues of $22.7bn and a combined market capitalisation of $35.1bn. It expects “efficiencies” of roughly $500m, half from growth and cross-selling opportunities and half from scale benefits in procurement. No job cuts were planned, Mr Levy said.Analysts said the new company’s scale could attract regulatory scrutiny. Mr Wren admitted that his team often asked themselves “’is this really possible?” during the talks but Mr Levy said French officials had shown “tremendous support” and the companies hope to close the deal by the end of this year or early 2014.
89;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-27T16:08:49Z;Publicis and Omnicom in merger talks;;"Publicis and Omnicom are in talks about a merger that would create the world’s largest advertising and marketing services group by revenues, according to two people familiar with the deal.One person familiar with the situation warned it was not a done deal and that Publicis had also weighed bids for two other targets, including Interpublic. This person emphasised that no ad deals have been blocked before on antitrust grounds, however.Another person said the deal would be presented as a merger of equals. Omnicom had a market capitalisation of $16.8bn at the close of trading on Friday and Publicis was valued at €11.8bn or $15.7bn.A successful merger of two of the top three rivals in the sector could face regulatory hurdles and would have to overcome clients’ concerns about conflicts of interest.If completed, however, it would restructure the foundations of an intensely competitive industry at a time when the rise of digital media is already reshaping the business.Omnicom and Publicis generated $14.2bn and $8.8bn in revenues respectively in 2012. Combined, the companies would catapult ahead of WPP, now the industry’s largest player with $15.6bn in 2012 revenues, and leave Interpublic in distant third place.A combination of Publicis with Omnicom would mark a bold move by Maurice Lévy, chairman and chief executive of the Paris-based advertising group since 1987; and by John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive since 1997.One person familiar with the situation said Mr Levy and Mr Wren could be co-chief executives for a period after the merger, with Elisabeth Badinter and Bruce Crawford, also sharing the chairman role for a time.Rumours of broad consolidation among ad groups have swirled in the industry for decades. The major difference today is the executives are getting older and looking for succession plans. Mr Levy is 71; Mr Wren was 60 when Omnicom filed its proxy in April.Mr Lévy had been set to leave Publicis within three and a half years once a successor has been found.Several industry executives and analysts saw an Omnicom-Publicis matchup as highly unlikely given potential antitrust issues, client conflicts and previous comments by Omnicom and Publicis executives about their priorities.After news of the talks first broke, David Jones, chief executive of competitor Havas, tweeted “oh wow just saw a flying pig.”Omnicom, which owns ad agency networks BBDO and TBWA as well as its media buying division Omnicom Media Group, has shied away from major deals for the past several years. Instead, it has taken an especially cautious approach to acquisitions following a series of digital ad agency deals after the dotcom boom more than a decade ago.It would also mark a departure from Publicis’s recent strategy of acquiring smaller advertising agencies with significant expertise in digital and or emerging markets.At a strategy day earlier this year, Publicis said it wanted to increase its combined revenues from faster-growing digital and emerging markets to 75 per cent of total revenues in the next five years. It said it would achieve this through organic growth and by spending around €500m a year on acquisitions. Publicis currently generates over a third of its revenues from digital.Joining forces with either Omnicom or Interpublic, the smaller US rival, would make this goal slower to achieve, analysts said, given the strengths of both Interpublic and Omnicom in traditional media advertising.Mr Lévy dismissed speculation earlier in the year that Publicis was interested in acquiring Interpublic but told the FT in April he would be interested in “some of their assets” – in particular the group’s digital operations. Industry members had speculated that Publicis and Omnicom could make a joint bid for Interpublic to split its assets between them.News of the Publicis-Omnicom talks took several top executives at the companies by surprise, with some saying they were unaware that any talks were under way. Bloomberg broke news of the discussions after markets closed on Friday.Antitrust issues are likely to be a concern, especially in the United States. A combined company would control about 40 per cent of the US ad business, more than two times WPP’s share, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. He predicted similar issues in other global markets.“The industry as we have known it would arguably be too concentrated for many regulators to tolerate,” Mr Wieser said.Client conflicts also would need to be sorted out. Omnicom agencies have long worked for PepsiCo, while Publicis agencies work for Coca-Cola, for instance. Omnicom and Publicis agencies also share several major clients, including McDonald’s and Procter & Gamble.The conflicts are not necessarily deal-breaking. Ad holding companies have managed to resolve client conflicts through assigning competitors’ business to different agencies under their umbrella. Interpublic agencies, for instance, work with several competing automakers.Mr Wieser also noted that consolidation could be a boon for the business, creating better profit margins and reducing competition for the prices charged to clients.A successful deal with Omnicom would also be a landmark moment for Elisabeth Badinter, daughter of Publicis founder Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, and the company’s largest shareholder.During Mr Levy’s tenure he has presided over the transformation of Publicis from a French also-ran in the 1990s to one of the world’s top three agencies by revenue. Much of this growth was achieved through acquisitions, notably the takeover of Saatchi & Saatchi in 2000 and, just over five years ago, Digitas, an internet ad agency. Last year Publicis bought LBi, at the time one of the world’s last remaining sizeable independent digital advertising agencies, for €416m in cash.Joanne Trout, Omnicom’s spokeswoman, declined to comment. Publicis had not returned calls in time to comment for this article."
90;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-07-21T16:09:38Z;Ad agencies claim victory on bill payments;;Advertising agencies are claiming victory over attempts by major consumer products companies to push out bill payments to as long as six months, arguing that the moves risked putting people in the creative industries out of work.Companies such as Mondelez International, the former Kraft snacks business, and Anheuser-Busch InBev had been seeking to extend their payment terms with ad agencies to as long as 120 days.But the major global agencies have resisted the changes, according to senior advertising executives, with some marketing services groups even turning away new business where companies were insisting on more time to pay their bills.“We’ve turned down and not accepted clients that we could have won because we weren’t prepared to accept the terms they were offering,” said John Wren, chief executive of Omnicom, the world’s second-largest marketing services group by revenues.“We’re not a bank. I think if you speak to my competitors, they’ll . . . all three agree with that concept that’s not what we’re here for. And anybody who wants to treat us like a bank can go to a bank.”His comments are echoed by executives at other major ad agencies.Maurice Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Publicis, said: “We have not had any change in our arrangements,” referring to the company’s payment terms.Michael Roth, chief executive of Interpublic, added: “Frankly, they shouldn’t be looking to us to do their financing . . . and we have not seen a major impact on our business model.”“The companies didn’t like the publicity,” said another senior advertising executive. “How can you talk about doing good and beat up your suppliers, maybe even putting them out of business?”Professional bodies for the advertising sector have stepped up their rhetoric in recent weeks in response to the developments, which originated in the US, and had begun to spread to Europe.Paul Bainsfair, director-general of the UK’s Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, said that, the demands by the major consumer brands companies risked “biting the hand that feeds them”, as agencies would have to pass on lengthened payment terms to individual suppliers such as artists or photographers.Tom Finneran, executive vice-president of agency management services at the American Association of Advertising Agencies, said: “This is an egregious over-reach and abuse of scale by a handful of marketers. It’s short-sighted, ill-advised and potentially damaging to the ecosystem.”“It’s almost a breach of corporate responsibility,” he added.“The thing that is really annoying everyone is that they are not doing this for a good reason,” he added. “Interest rates are rock bottom at the moment.”
91;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2013-04-18T15:29:35Z;Omnicom hit by European slump;;European markets continue to drag on the advertising business, with Omnicom reporting only a slight increase in first-quarter revenues and profits despite growth in the US and other regions.The world’s second-largest advertising and communications company by market share on Thursday reported that revenue increased 2.8 per cent to $3.4bn in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. Net income was about flat, increasing to $205.1m from $204.6m.“We expected modest growth for 2013. Our expectations have not changed,” John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive, said during a conference call with analysts. “The global economy appears to be operating at three speeds. Asia and Latin America remain strong. The US continues to experience slow but steady growth. And the most challenging region continues to be the eurozone.”A 3.7 per cent drop in organic revenue growth in euro currency markets offset growth in Omnicom’s business in the US, UK and the rest of the world. The results come after Publicis earlier this week reported organic growth of 1.3 per cent, lower than analysts’ expectations. Interpublic, the advertising group, reports its earnings on Friday.Advertising companies are the first in the media and marketing industry to report earnings, and the results are watched closely as ad spending can be a leading indicator of economic recovery.Mr Wren said that he doesn’t see any signs that indicate a significant change in the short term. ”When you look further out past this year, I am more hopeful that we’re going to have steady progress and it’s going to lead to increased growth over time,” he said.Omnicom shares were down about 1.5 per cent in morning trading.
92;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2012-10-26T16:08:25Z;Ad agencies – not so festive;Run-up to Christmas less than merry with cuts to sales forecasts;Batten down the hatches. With October almost over, the festive advertising deluge is on the way – expect Father Christmas and happy children all over your screens soon. Unfortunately, life is not so sickly sweet for the agencies behind the ads. On Friday both Publicis of France and Interpublic of the US produced ugly third-quarter revenue numbers. The day before it was the UK’s WPP letting investors down. They all agree that September was dismal, although they differ on why. Interpublic said it was down to the US. WPP singled out PR spending. Publicis blamed Europe. Emerging markets and digital advertising did well but not well enough to prevent cuts to sales forecasts.But despite the revenue woe, all three stuck by their margin targets. WPP plans to increase its operating margin by 50 basis points to 14.8 per cent. Publicis is planning a 200-400 basis point improvement to more than the current 16 per cent but over a longer period. And Interpublic, which with a 9.8 per cent margin is playing catch up with the rest, still plans a 50 basis point increase this year. It has its work cut out – its third-quarter margin was lower than in the same period last year. Ad agencies are people businesses, so improving margins will mean cutting staff costs. WPP pointed out that flexible staff costs account for 6-7 per cent of its revenues. At Publicis the figure is 5-6 per cent.If the September slowdown turns out to be a blip, the margin targets look attainable. But if it stretches into 2013 (and given that it came as clients were setting budgets for next year, that is very possible), then the agencies will either have to cut costs more aggressively or scale back their margin hopes. Some of the uncertainty is priced in – valuations range from Omnicom on 13 times forecast earnings to WPP on 11. But the risks to revenues, margins and share prices all lie to the downside.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
93;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Publicis and Interpublic deepen ad industry gloom;;Worries about the state of the global advertising market are escalating, with Publicis Groupe and Interpublic Group reporting worse than expected sales in the third quarter and a particularly sharp slowdown in September.Maurice Lévy, chief executive of Publicis, who has led the French group since 1987, called the slowdown in September “brutal” and said corporate clients had become more likely to hoard cash and cut advertising spending at any hint of a downturn because of jitters about the European debt crisis. “They were traumatised by 2008,” he said.Michael Roth, chief executive of US advertising group Interpublic, called the decline in September a “surprise”. Interpublic – which has been at the centre of speculation that it could be bought by Publicis – reported a 3.3 per cent drop in total revenues in the third quarter.“Frankly we’re seeing that in our whole industry,” Mr Roth said during a conference call. “We’re seeing as a general tone . . . this concern and uncertainty with respect to the macroeconomic environment.”The caution comes a day after WPP, the world’s biggest advertising group by sales, cut its full-year growth target for the second time in two months. Omnicom of the US has also made downward revisions.Publicis, the number-three ad group by sales, said the third-quarter slowdown had been “as sudden as it was severe” but October had been slightly better. It was also slightly more optimistic than WPP about the end of 2012 and about 2013.“Next year there will be world growth, but with a dark cloud, which is Europe,” Mr Lévy said.Claudio Aspesi, analyst at Bernstein Research, said: “The sudden slowdown obviously caught management at WPP and Publicis by surprise . . . The pattern was similar for both companies, with western Europe a point of particular concern and North America also seeing signs of weakness. Both saw strong performance from high-growth markets, but Publicis management noted that growth is slowing there too.”Publicis said sales rose 14.7 per cent to €1.6bn in the third quarter, but growth was just 2 per cent after stripping out the contribution from acquisitions. The company had been planning for 6 per cent organic growth in September, but sales had in fact fallen 1.6 per cent during the month.“It was a surprise that was a little brutal, particularly in Europe,” Mr Lévy said, adding that the company would pay close attention to managing operating costs because of the slowdown.Amid speculation about consolidation among the world’s biggest ad groups, Ian Whittaker at Liberum Capital said Mr Lévy had “effectively ruled out a bid for Interpublic, in the short term” during a call with analysts on Friday. Mr Whittaker said this was “on the grounds of expense – a bid would need to be funded with a mixture of cash and shares – and the need to focus internally”.Like WPP, Publicis has been rapidly snapping up small agencies working in emerging markets or digital media.
94;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Advertisers fail to follow mobile trend;;A sharp rise in the amount of time people spend using their mobile devices is quickly reshaping the media industry and could undermine the growth of internet advertising, according to new industry research.Advertising dollars have yet to follow the trend, posing significant challenges for publishers who see their audiences migrating to mobile content but marketers not yet shifting their budgets.Excluding time talking on the phone, US adults now spend an average of 82 minutes a day using mobile devices, about four times the 22 minutes people spent with their mobile devices in 2009, according to eMarketer, the research group.The surge in mobile activity comes as growth rates slow for both the time people spend online with their desktop and laptop computers and internet-connected televisions and the dollars marketers spend on online ads. People now spend an average of nearly three hours a day online, and double-digit growth rates are not likely in the future, according to eMarketer.Consequently, growth in online ad spending has slowed. The US online ad business is expected to increase 13.6 per cent this year to $34.7bn, after growing 19.6 per cent last year. By 2016, online ad spending should increase just 1.5 per cent to $43.4bn, eMarketer projects.While mobile is capturing a larger share of time spent consuming media, up to 11.7 per cent this year from 3.5 per cent in 2009, its share of total ad spending is a minuscule 1.6 per cent. “Even on the desktop web, ad dollars are still playing catch-up to time spent with the medium – and that game is even further behind on mobile,” eMarketer said.Growth in mobile ad spending is expected to surge in the next couple of years, with eMarketer projecting an increase of 80 per cent this year to $2.6bn. But several challenges remain. For instance, Google charges cheaper prices for mobile search ads because it is less likely that consumers make purchases from mobile devices. Small screen sizes, meanwhile, prevent publishers such as Facebook from delivering as many ads per page.Television continues to dominate both the time people spend with media as well as its share of advertising budgets. US adults spend an average of more than four-and-a-half hours watching television a day, or a 39.8 per cent share of time spent with all media. TV attracts $64.5bn in ad spending, or a 38.9 per cent share of total ad spending.Future growth in mobile ad spending is likely to be fuelled by cutbacks in print ads. Print media account for 20.7 per cent of total ad spending, but only 5.4 per cent of the time people spend with media.John Wren, chief executive of advertising group Omnicom, called mobile the future of the industry during a call with analysts last week, noting that his group saw significant growth in the use of mobile advertising for the first time during the most recent quarter. “We’re just at the beginning of where mobile will go,” he said.“That remote control’s with you 24 hours a day and generally always in your pocket. Whatever shifts we have seen up until now, we’re going to see yet another seismic shift.”
95;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2012-10-17T10:03:43Z;Media ‘to use stock market algorithms’;;From television commercials to mobile phone ads, almost all media will soon be bought and sold via sophisticated trading algorithms that mimic the technologies of stock exchanges, said John Wren, chief executive of Omnicom, one of the world’s largest advertising groups.“It is a process of revolution,” Mr Wren said this week.A broad swath of traditional ads, ranging from television commercials to billboards, remain sold via the wining-and-dining sales tactics of the era of Mad Men, the television series set in the advertising world of the 1960s.In the US, for instance, broadcast networks sell about three-quarters of their commercial inventory during the annual upfront market each spring, during which networks host flashy, star-studded parties for advertising buyers.The rise of digital media is upending that tradition. During the past few years, the advertising industry has seen the rapid adoption of sophisticated technology-driven trading systems, called demand-side platforms, for buying and selling digital ads.“That kind of auction will occur for almost all media,” Mr Wren said. “But just because the technology exists to do it doesn’t mean it will happen overnight. It is slow.”The development was spurred by the rise of online ad exchanges that allow marketers to buy cheap ads across thousands of sites instead of negotiating deals directly with publishers.Several start-up companies created new systems for buying and selling online ads based on data about the person who would see the ad rather than the website where it appears. Within a nanosecond, marketers can evaluate the performance of an ad and tweak the way it looks or the audience that it is targeted at.The world’s largest advertising groups in the past few years all bought or built their own systems for trading digital ads and analysing consumer data. Omnicom, for instance, employs more than 600 people across 30 markets in its Annalect group that operates its digital trading system. WPP, the world’s largest advertising company, has steadily invested in expanding its Xaxis digital group that operates similar technologies.So far, most of these groups have managed the buying and selling of ads on the internet and mobile – not the more traditional media such as print or television.According to Tim Nollen, an industry analyst with Macquarie, as the use of these exchanges increases “the critical agency role is then about sourcing, storing and managing this data to help clients deliver better targeted ads”.The shift has sparked marketers’ demands for more data about consumers, fuelling the fast-growing business of tracking consumers and at the same time igniting debate over privacy issues.Mr Wren said the adoption of technology-based ad-buying systems for all media will depend on the resolution of privacy issues. “The question hasn’t been resolved yet,” he said. “I think it will take quite a while.”
96;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2012-10-05T15:58:10Z;Mideast poses ad minefield for westerners;;Ikea’s widely criticised airbrushing women out of the Saudi Arabian edition of its furniture catalogue is the latest in a cascade of cultural controversies and missteps involving western brands in the Middle East.Big consumer-goods companies from Samsung to Starbucks have struggled to strike the right tone in the region, where a single social or religious faux pas can sabotage access to a retail market worth hundreds of billions of dollars.As the political upheaval sweeping the Middle East makes foreign companies’ task harder still, many are struggling to balance the need to follow local norms with the risk of provoking criticism back home for kowtowing to oppressive practices.“It’s an extremely difficult position for a global brand to be in,” says Adil Khan, regional chief executive of advertising group Saatchi & Saatchi in Dubai. “On the one hand they have their value system as a global brand, but then on the other they have to be aware of local market sensitivities.”The airbrushing out of women from several images in Ikea’s Saudi catalogue has drawn scorn from around the world, including ministers in its egalitarian home nation of Sweden. The country’s trade minister, Ewa Björling, complained: “You can’t remove or airbrush women from reality.”Inter Ikea Systems, which runs the global franchise network of Ikea stores, said that it took “full responsibility for the mistakes made”. It expressed regret and said that it was reviewing its processes, as did Ikea Group, another company in the complicated Ikea structure that produces the catalogues.Ikea is one of many companies to have adapted its marketing to suit local tastes, a step that regional advertising executives say was in some cases probably overzealous.But with no formal government guidelines, international companies rely on local partners to avoid cultural sensitivities that vary dramatically across the Middle East. And given the room for confusion between the most conservative attitudes in Saudi Arabia and the most liberal in Lebanon, companies are unwilling to take risks.The Middle East has seen its fair share of contentious advertising campaigns – although the publicity has not always turned out badly for retailers, writes Camilla Hall in Dubai.● A Coca-Cola advertisement riled the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia in 2002 because of its focus on a young man and woman flirting over a Coke bottle. The same year, Coke released another ad where a young man writes his number in the condensation of the bottle and passes it to the woman. The company has faced such complications in the Middle East due to a decades-long political boycott that is has a dedicated part of its website to tackle Middle East rumours.● In 2006 Wonderbra launched an ad playing on a concept of censorship in the Middle East where a model in her underwear had black marker pen scrawled across her chest. The campaign ruffled feathers in the United Arab Emirates but received wide attention that may have provided a boost for the brand.● Burger King promotional videos were posted online in 2010 playing on stereotypes of two American women and two young Gulf men. “Y’all must be loaded,” one girl says. One of the men replies in broken English: “We have oil wells in our back yard OK and once a week businessmen come to us and we pump the oil by hand.” A prominent Saudi blogger wrote at the time: “Although the commercial is not offending – not to me, anyway – I don’t think Saudis should be thrilled about it. The TV ad simply reinforces some of the most negative stereotypes about us.”● One executive told of a bizarre instance in Saudi Arabia, in which billboards of La Vache qui Rit soft cheese were torn down after people took offence to the cow’s earrings, which were made of the triangular cheese.“When you don’t really understand you can kind of overdo it” in terms of self-censorship, says Dani Richa, chairman and chief executive of advertising company Impact BBDO Group, part of Omnicom, in Dubai. “But if a market is important enough for you to make an investment it’s important enough to do something specific for that market.”Advertising executives in the region identify the obvious cultural minefields as pork, alcohol, tobacco, sex, religion, politics, gambling and poking fun at the local population.Other sensitivities include consuming food or drink with the wrong hand and certain hyperbolic words which, in Arabic, are used only for religious purposes. When it comes to Saudi Arabia, the list is stricter, with women’s faces off limits and the approach to baring skin more delicate, says Tarek Miknas, chief executive of Fortune Promoseven, L’Oréal’s agency in the region.Some of the biggest international brands have chosen to adapt to secure a foothold in Saudi Arabia, where Booz & Co estimates the local retail market at $84.8bn. When Starbucks opened its doors in the kingdom, which practices a conservative form of Sunni Islam, the US coffee chain suffered a backlash for changing its green female mermaid logo to one with a crown in the water.But over time, the company has fully penetrated the market, with stores in Saudi Arabia’s biggest cities as well as in some of Islam’s holiest cities such as Mecca and Medina.While cultural sensitivities prompt companies to take advice across the region, Saudi Arabia is the most problematic.“A lot [of companies] just gave up using pictures of humans, you tend to just get pictures of products with a slushy slogan,” said one Riyadh resident of the billboards across the city. “They pixelate the pictures of humans so you can tell it’s a human being holding a drink but it’s blurred.”Alongside Starbucks, other food and beverage chains such as McDonald's and Burger King have adhered to Saudi Arabia’s strict gender separation rules. Family sections for married couples and women are divided from a section for single men. Religious police, known as the Mutawwa in Arabic or the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, stake out restaurants and malls, approaching anyone they suspect to be breaking the norms on segregation.An advertising agency created an advert in 2009 for Samsung, without its permission, in which Jesus Christ was shown taking photos of a group of nuns. The South Korean company was forced to deny that it commissioned the ad after Christians in Lebanon rallied against the work.But, with the risks associated with getting it wrong well known, most companies are trying to be as careful as possible, says Kamal Dimachkie, executive regional managing director of Leo Burnett, the advertising agency, in Dubai.“Brands are like people, they’re capable of making gaffes,” says Mr Dimachkie. “But they will err on the side of caution rather than take any unwarranted risk with their expression.”Additional reporting by Richard Milne
97;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2012-09-13T19:01:01Z;Facebook rolls out real-time ad platform;;"Some of the world’s largest advertising companies have signed up to Facebook’s new real-time advertising platform, in a move that the social network hopes will bolster its revenue streams.On Thursday, Facebook officially launched the platform, called Facebook Ad Exchange, or FBX, following months of testing. The system allows marketers to bid in real-time to buy ad impressions on the social networking site, and deliver their ads to users based on their immediate web-browsing habits, or linked to current events, such as sports results.“Real-time marketing is getting to be a really important component of digital advertising,” said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. “We’ll see a lot of event-triggered marketing in the upcoming election cycle.”The ads use information gathered from computer browsing histories to target individual Facebook users, and the ad prices fluctuate as in auction-style bidding system. So a user who looks at shoes on a retail site could then see an ad for the same brand when clicking back to Facebook.The capacity will help Facebook compete more directly with advertising rivals Google and Yahoo, which have long provided real-time bidding to advertisers.Some of the agencies that have agreed to use FBX include Accuen, part of the New York-based ad group Omnicom; Xaxis, a WPP subsidiary; Interpublic Group’s Mediabrands Audience Platform; Aegis’s trading platform Amnet; and VivaKi, part of Publicis Groupe.FBX is facilitated by several technology partners, including Turn, the cloud marketing platform.Within one-tenth of a second, the system notifies when an ad space is available, evaluates 2,000 data points to determine the most relevant ad, calculates a price and prompts the ad to appear.The global real-time bidding sector is estimated to be worth some $3bn-$4bn, but industry observers expect this to reach as much as $20bn by 2015.“With the launch of FBX, Facebook not only instantly multiplies the overall size of the real-time bidding market, it provides high-quality inventory that is brand safe and extremely targeted,” said Brian Lesser, chief executive of Xaxis.However, the launch did little to buoy Facebook shares – down 0.6 per cent to $20.80 in early New York trading – which have fallen since its disappointing stock market debut in May."
98;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2012-07-30T14:52:51Z;Bleak forecast for global ad spend;;Uncertainty in the European and US economies is clouding the forecast for the global advertising market.GroupM, part of WPP, slashed its 2012 predictions for global ad spending growth by 1.2 percentage points to 5.1 per cent because of the tenuous global economy, particularly in the eurozone, and political and fiscal uncertainties in the US. Global ad spending should reach $506.3bn this year, GroupM estimates.Ad spending in Western Europe should decline 0.7 per cent, down from previous expectations of 2 per cent growth, because of a small pullback in ad spending in Germany and more significant cuts in Spain and Italy, GroupM said. That represents a loss of $2.7bn in total global advertising growth.In China, where the pace of growth is slowing because of economic headwinds and loss of consumer confidence, GroupM cut its forecast for ad spending growth four percentage points to 13 per cent this year. That accounts for a $2bn reduction in global ad spending. Deteriorating global and local sentiment also is impacting the ad markets in India and Brazil.For the US, amid uncertainty of the election and fiscal policies, GroupM cut forecasts for ad spending 0.4 percentage points to 3.6 per cent growth.Omnicom, the New York-based advertising company, underscored the precarious nature of the global ad market when it reported second-quarter earnings. While Omnicom’s global revenues increased 2.1 per cent to $3.5bn, revenues outside the US decreased 1.3 per cent.“Europe continues to kick the can down the road. So there’s constant uncertainty,” John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive, said during a call with analysts. “If there is anything that is true every morning it’s that you don’t know what today will bring. So we’re cautious. We remain cautious.”Digital remains one of the industry’s bright spots. Continued strength in internet advertising across the globe led GroupM to increase its estimates for online ad spending growth to 18 per cent, reaching $99bn. GroupM also increased its forecast for ad spending growth in Japan 1.6 percentage points to 5 per cent after a quicker-than-expected recovery from the 2011 earthquake.
99;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2012-07-13T16:55:33Z;Dentsu’s offer for Aegis hard to top;;Dentsu, Japan’s dominant advertising group, agreed to buy Aegis, the UK-listed advertising agency, for £3.2bn in cash this week, in the biggest overseas foray for the Japanese company in its 111-year history.The combined group will be the largest ad agency in Asia, the second largest in western Europe and the fifth largest in the world, challenging the grip on the global advertising markets held by Omnicom, WPP, Publicis and Interpublic.The acquisition comes amid a period of renewed takeover activity in the sector after Publicis Groupe took full control of London-based Bartle Bogle Hegarty and WPP bought AKQA, the independent digital agency.Analysts said there was a drive by ad agencies to expand their global reach and scale to invest in technology and to beef up their expertise in digital marketing, the fastest growing area in advertising.Competitors described the 240p cash offer for Aegis as rich, representing a 48 per cent premium on the previous day’s close. Given the significant premium, analysts said it was unlikely that rival bidders for Aegis would emerge.The deal gleaned the support of Vincent Bolloré, the French billionaire investor and Aegis’s largest shareholder, whose group is set to receive about €915m should the Dentsu deal be completed, representing a capital gain of €450m.Mr Bolloré had originally harboured ambitions to combine Aegis with Havas, a rival French advertising group over which he has control, but was resisted by the British group’s management.
100;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2012-05-24T19:00:16Z;Adam & Eve proves tempting for DDB;;Adam & Eve, the agency behind John Lewis’s sentimental television ads, has been acquired by DDB, one of the world’s largest advertising agencies, in a deal worth tens of millions of pounds.Just under five years after quitting WPP, prompting a bitter legal battle with its chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, Adam & Eve’s co-founders James Murphy, Ben Priest, David Golding and Jon Forsyth will join DDB, which is owned by WPP rival Omnicom.The deal will make multimillionaires of the founders of Adam & Eve, which had £8m in revenues last year.Adam & Eve built its reputation on its work for John Lewis, including 2010’s “Always a Woman”-soundtracked ad sweeping through life’s big events, and last December’s understated ad showing a boy waiting impatiently for Christmas day.Other clients include Fosters, Phones 4U and Google.“It’s work that captured the public imagination, the work they’ve done for John Lewis in particular,” said Stephen Woodford, DDB’s chairman. “We weren’t looking at acquisitions. Had we not made the acquisition of Adam& Eve we wouldn’t have made any other acquisitions.”Omnicom, DDB’s parent, in April acquired a majority stake in Portland Communications, the public affairs firm run by Tony Blair’s former press secretary Tim Allan, who this week took on his former Downing Street colleague Alastair Campbell as a consultant.DDB’s work for the likes of Volkswagen and Marmite was a draw for the Adam & Eve team, but the Omnicom unit has also suffered from recent account losses.“Adam & Eve is one of the few agencies with a proven track record of producing creative campaigns that have huge cut-through and get noticed. That is a rare commodity and has a massive value,” said Marcus Anselm, partner at Clarity Capital Partners, which advised Adam & Eve on the deal.“The marketing mix might be changing, and data-driven and more quantitative aspects might be coming more to the fore, but that’s not to undermine the importance of brilliant creatives who create cut-through campaigns that appeal to people on a really human, emotional level.”Mr Murphy said: “We probably wouldn’t have considered joining another agency for another year or two on the basis of precedent but because it was DDB we were all transfixed.”The deal was struck despite uncertainty in the UK’s ad market, where consumer confidence is weighing on marketing spending.“From our point of view, we started the business four and a half years ago in the teeth of a recession,” said Mr Murphy. “It’s good to see that British creativity can still win through in such an adverse economic climate.”
101;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2012-05-18T20:26:19Z;GM to sit out next Super Bowl;;General Motors will not advertise in the Super Bowl next year, the most watched US television event of the year, in an unexpected move that follows a significant revamping of its media strategy.“We understand the reach the Super Bowl provides, but with the significant increase in price, we simply can’t justify the expense,” said Joel Ewanick, chief marketing officer for the US carmaker.The decision not to advertise during the 2013 broadcast on CBS came just days after GM said it would stop paying for advertising on Facebook, the leading social network.Pat Morrissey, a GM spokesman, said the move represented a “quite different” line of thinking than the regular review of the group’s media spending that the carmaker is undertaking. He said the company’s overall advertising budget – $4.47bn last year – was unchanged, but would not comment on where money previously spent on the game would be reallocated.“This is specifically looking at the cost of Super Bowl advertising and the significant increase in price,” he said.The cost of a 30-second spot during the championship American football game rose 17 per cent this year to as much as $3.5m and is expected to go even higher in 2013.“It feels premature for GM to make such a big decision regarding the Super Bowl, especially since GM will be launching a new line of full-size pick-up trucks and full-size SUVs around Super Bowl time,” said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Edmunds.com, the car research website. “The Super Bowl audience is ideal for those vehicles and the timing is right.”GM ran five spots during this year’s game, including three for the Chevrolet Sonic subcompact. Edmunds said interest in the car on the Edmunds.com website more than doubled in the week after the game.The carmaker last sat out the Super Bowl in 2009, when it was going through bankruptcy and restructuring amid the near-collapse of the US auto industry.Advertisements for the Chevrolet and Cadillac brands will run on US television during this year’s Olympic Games in London as GM is a sponsor of NBC’s coverage, Mr Morrissey said.Over the past six months, the company has undertaken a sweeping reorganisation of its media and marketing strategy. GM consolidated its $3bn global media buying account with one agency, Aegis Group’s Carat, and replaced 70 agencies that handled global advertising for the Chevrolet brand with a single agency, Commonwealth, a joint venture of Omnicom’s Goodby, Silverstein & Partners and Interpublic’s McCann Erickson.Those two moves are expected to save the company $2bn over the next five years, Mr Morrissey said.
102;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2012-04-17T14:19:30Z;Omnicom revenues rise in fragile economy;;Omnicom, the first of the big advertising companies to report first-quarter earnings, said revenues for the first three months of the year were slightly ahead of expectations.The US group behind BBDO and DDB often serves as a barometer of the broader global economy. It said US revenues increased 4 per cent to $1.72bn and international revenues increased 6 per cent to $1.59bn.Net income was up 1.3 per cent to $204.6m from $201.9m a year ago and earnings per share were 4.3 per cent higher at 72 cents compared with 69 cents in the first quarter of 2011.“The region most at risk is Europe,” said John Wren, chief executive, citing concerns over a “fragile global economy.”Continental Europe saw only “nominal growth,” he said. Germany was the strongest European market for the quarter, while business in France shrunk. “There’s uncertainty” in France,” Mr Wren said, noting that “some people are distracted” by the upcoming French elections and the plight of Greece and Spain.Growth in the UK slowed compared to the previous quarter, but the UK “market remains relatively favourable” compared to Europe, Mr Wren said.Nonetheless Mr Wren said he was “cautiously optimistic” and that “revenues exceeded our internal forecasts”. Omnicom saw growth in its public relations businesses, while US advertising was buoyed by robust demand for brand advertising and the continued strength of sports programming.Omnicom’s business in Japan returned positive organic growth for first time since 2010, signalling the continued recovery of the Japanese economy after last year’s tsunami and nuclear disaster.Given the macroeconomic uncertainty Mr Wren said the company was “focused on things we can control” such as hiring and the development of the group’s digital strategy.Omnicom on Monday announced the acquisition of Nim Digital, a digital agency in China. The deal took more than a year to complete, highlighting the difficulty of dealmaking in the region. But Mr Wren said: “We expect acquisition activity in China and other Asian markets will accelerate over the rest of the year.”Omnicom is under pressure from New York City’s public pension funds to disclose information about the racial and gender breakdown of its staff. John Liu, the New York City comptroller, is leading the push, saying that public companies perform better when there is racial and gender diversity.On Monday Mr Liu announced that Goldman Sachs and MetLife have agreed to make such disclosures, but said Omnicom was resisting. The issue is expected to go to a shareholder ballot when Omnicom has its annual meeting next month in San Francisco.Complaints about inequality in the workplace have dogged the advertising industry for decades, and are a prominent theme in Mad Men, the popular show that chronicles a New York advertising agency in the 1960s.
103;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2012-02-09T23:35:58Z;Publicis’ US digital revenues set to overtake traditional media;;Digital revenues from Publicis Groupe’s US business are set to overtake those from traditional advertising this year, a first for a leading marketing services group in the world’s largest media market.Maurice Lévy, Publicis chief executive, told the FT that digital media buying and creative work would constitute more than 50 per cent of its North American revenues this year after reaching 46.4 per cent in 2011 – providing a helpful bulwark against the French group’s more sluggish European division.“This will be a magnet for clients,” Mr Levy said. His aim is for 75 per cent of group revenues to come from digital media and emerging markets such as Brazil and China in the “pretty near future”.Barring any unexpected merger activity in the coming months, Publicis will reach this milestone ahead of rivals such as WPP and Omnicom, thanks to the acquisitions of three large digital agencies in recent years: Digitas, Razorfish and Rosetta. About a quarter of media spending in the US goes on digital companies such as Google, Facebook and AOL, making it the market which has shifted the most away from TV and print.In another corner of the US media industry, digital track downloads overtook sales of CDs, in volume terms, last year, although in other activities – such as video viewing – the transition has been much slower.Digital revenues made up 30.6 per cent of Publicis Groupe’s global total in 2011, up from 7 per cent in 2006, and represents the fastest-growing part of the business, up 13.7 per cent last year over 2010, excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations.“The most important aspect is that we will grow to a certain degree on par with the digital market,” Mr Levy said of Publicis’ US business.Analysts said that the shift towards digital would help maintain Publicis’ historical outperformance of the market in revenue growth terms.“If the environment gets tougher, they will benefit from their high proportion in digital,” said Patrick Kirby, media analyst at Deutsche Bank. “Digital migration of marketing spend will insulate their revenues.”Publicis said revenues, excluding the effects of currencies and acquisitions, grew by 5.7 per cent to €5.8bn in 2011. Its operating margin, a metric watched closely by analysts, increased from 15.8 per cent in 2010 to 16.0 per cent last year, with earnings per share up 14 per cent to €2.96.Mr Levy said that he expected Publicis’ revenue growth this year to exceed its forecast 4.7 per cent increase in global media spending, even in western Europe despite a drop in sales in the region in the fourth quarter of last year. Publicis’ loss of the General Motors media-buying account would result in a less than 0.5 per cent hit to revenues, he said.However, despite this improvement in profitability and its €4bn in available cash, Publicis left its dividend pay-out unchanged at €0.70 per share, a disappointment to some analysts.“Given it’s a cash generative business and the balance sheet is very strong, it’s surprising they maintained the dividend,” Mr Kirby said. “During this results season, Publicis is likely to be the exception, since we think its peers will be announcing dividend increases and share buy-backs.”Mr Levy explained that it needed to preserve funds in case Dentsu, Japan’s largest marketing services group by revenues, decided to sell its 11 per cent stake in Publicis. The two companies’ partnership agreements are due to expire in July and if not renewed, Publicis has promised to buy back upwards of the €800m to €900m stake, and cancel the shares.Dentsu sold down a portion of its stake in 2010 and the partnership has proved less fruitful than the two companies might have hoped, so some analysts speculate the agency groups are likely to go their separate ways.Publicis shares closed broadly flat at €39.83 on Thursday evening in Paris.
104;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-12-12T22:53:12Z;The public image: McDonald’s viral non-ad;;"Client: McDonald’s, Germany
Agency: Heye Group, DDB Tribal
Verdict: 5/5The internet has spawned a genre of commercials which the companies they laud swear not to have commissioned, and their agencies claim never to have released.Ford, Nokia and VW have all featured in such non-ads. The latest one is “Package”, a work purporting to speak for McDonald’s, Germany.The online video shows a young boy sitting in a playground trying to eat his McDonald’s burger and fries, only to have them pilfered by older boys. The end of the spot shows our young hero eating free of predators, his McDonald’s fries hidden by a Burger King bag.The rival burger chain says the ad breaches the rules of comparative advertising by “degrading” its brand. McDonald’s swears it does not know how it got onto the web, saying it was only seen internally, volunteered in brainstorming meetings by Omnicom units Heye Group and DDB Tribal.The company says it is trying to see whether “Package” can be removed from the web, where it has been watched hundreds of thousands of times.Six years ago, a viral non-ad depicted an exploding suicide bomber and a VW Polo, which contains the blast and stays intact. VW has always distanced itself from its contents. But, as the company says: “Once on the web, always on the web.”"
105;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-10-30T23:22:34Z;Omnicom buys Mudra in India push;;US advertising group Omnicom is making its biggest push yet into India with the acquisition of a majority stake in Mudra Group, one of the subcontinent’s largest advertising conglomerates.The deal will give Omnicom, the company behind agencies such as BBDO and DDB, a new foothold in one of the world’s largest emerging consumer markets. Financial terms of the transaction were not released, but Omnicom is taking a majority stake immediately, and will have the ability to increase its control in the near future.“We’re paying fair value for it,” said John Wren, Omnicom chief executive. “It’s a complete transaction, including 26 offices and four or five operating companies across the subcontinent. This gives us a backbone to expand our other services including retail capabilities and public relations.”Omnicom said the addition of Mudra will make the US group one of the top three holding companies in India, a market where it has traditionally had less exposure than its peers. Omnicom has had a 10 per cent stake in Mudra Group since 1993.As the economies of the US and western Europe show persistently little growth, advertising groups are increasingly looking to emerging markets for new revenues.Strong international sales helped Omnicom report surprisingly robust third-quarter earnings in late October, even as the outlook for the sector worsens. International revenues increased 22 per cent to $1.68bn, nearly equalling US revenues of $1.7bn, which were up 5.3 per cent.Interpublic, the second-largest advertising group in the US, has been on an international acquisitions spree, and attributed its strong third-quarter results last week to improved sales in Asia and Latin America.“Every western company of any importance is expanding into India, and India also has quite a number of important companies that are expanding outside of India,” said Mr Wren. “It’s extraordinarily important that we become as strong in India as we are in the US.”Founded in 1980 and based in Mumbai, Mudra now has more than 1,100 employees. Mudra has succeeded in introducing international brands such as 7Up and HBO to India’s large emerging middle class, and has also become an agency for the country’s local brands, such as Air India and the government’s tourism board.“We have significant relationships around the world that can only get more significant in India,” said Chuck Brymer, chief executive of DDB Worldwide. DDB already works with Mudra and shared clients including Unilever and McDonald’s.Omnicom also said that Anil Ambani, the Indian billionaire who is chairman of Reliance Group, will join the Omnicom international advisory committee.“I’ve known Anil for over 20 years,” said Mr Wren. “Having access to him in an area of the world where the future is going to be defined is terribly important.”
106;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-10-28T09:15:01Z;WPP reduces 2011 sales forecast;;WPP cut its 2011 sales growth forecast on Friday as its market research arm continued to underperform, leaving smaller rivals including Interpublic and Havas to post stronger results and more confident guidance.Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, admitted that the performance in its consumer insight division, where like-for-like sales dipped 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, was “not acceptable”.However, shares in the world’s largest marketing services group by sales and market capitalisation rose 11p to 688p, thanks to improvements in operating margins.Ahead of planning meetings in the coming weeks, Sir Martin said that WPP may budget for 3 to 4 per cent growth in 2012, boosted by the Olympics and US presidential election. He suggested that 2013 would present a greater challenge, when “a newly elected American president will finally have to deal with the US deficit”.In the third quarter this year, like-for-like sales growth – excluding acquisitions and currency movements – was 4.7 per cent to £2.46bn, down from the 5.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent achieved in the second and first quarters respectively.For the full year, the group had been expecting like-for-like sales growth of about 5.9 per cent in 2011. On Friday, it reduced this forecast to 5 per cent.Sir Martin said that “custom” market research – one-off surveys on a particular topic – was suffering as clients trimmed costs, though “syndicated” research and emerging markets remain strong.He also suggested that the growth of online polling may be hitting growth. “The sample is not as good and statistically you don’t have a verifiable and quantifiable result but it’s still pretty seductive because it may be faster or cheaper,” he said.Even though research is proving a drag on WPP’s overall growth, which lags behind that of rivals such as Publicis and Omnicom, Sir Martin said that he did not regret spending £1bn on TNS in 2008.WPP’s update contrasted sharply with Interpublic, the US advertising group behind Draftfcb and R/GA, which reported better than expected third-quarter results on Friday thanks to strong growth in international revenues and tighter cost controls.Like-for-like revenues were up 8.7 per cent overall to $1.73bn for the quarter, with international income up 15 per cent. Michael Roth, chief executive, said Interpublic would meet or surpass its estimate of 4 to 5 per cent revenue growth and operating margin guidance of 9.5 per cent for the year.In a positive sign for advertising growth next year, Mr Roth said big clients were not taking money off the table. “We’ve seen little in the way of pullbacks among clients, despite the economic climate,” he said. “The performance of the most economically sensitive client sectors – auto, financial services and retail – remain solid in the third quarter.”IPG’s shares leapt 13 per cent to $10.05.On Thursday, Havas, the French owner of agencies including EuroRSCG, reported 7.3 per cent organic growth, its best performance in three years.

108;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-10-27T23:48:29Z;Havas’s quarterly sales hit three-year best;Americas and Asia boost results against poor European climate;Havas, the French marketing services group, delivered its best quarterly sales in three years, significantly beating analysts’ expectations in spite of fears that waning business confidence might hit advertising spending.Like-for-like revenues at the owner of agencies including EuroRSCG and Arnold grew 7.3 per cent to €387m in the third quarter, thanks to a strong performance in North America, Asia and Latin America.That figure, which excludes the effects of acquisitions and currency fluctuations compares with consensus analyst estimates of about 3 per cent, an outperformance which sent Havas shares up 6.6 per cent to €3.18 in Paris trading.David Jones, chief executive, said that Havas’ integration of digital capabilities across all its agencies accounted for its rapid growth but warned that it was impossible to predict how the year would turn out, given macroeconomic uncertainty.“Our clients on the whole are cautious rather than actually taking action and cutting anything,” he said. “There is a real lack of visibility. We are going to see from an industry level the first quarter of next year being critically important. At the moment across the board, the majority of advertisers are not making cuts.”Havas’ rivals, including Publicis, Omnicom and WPP, have also suggested that falling business and consumer confidence has yet to take its toll on advertising spending.The one blot in Havas’ performance was France, where revenues fell due to problems in its healthcare and events businesses, as well as energy clients cancelling campaigns due to the Japanese earthquake. “It’s not widespread, it’s more due to three or four things hitting in one-quarter,” Mr Jones said.Most analysts hailed Havas strong performance but Simon Wallis of ING, bemoaned its lack of guidance in a note to clients entitled “Apparent paradox: a communications agency not communicating.”“Bilious unrequired detail in the press release,” Mr Wallis wrote, “but pertinent points relatively thin on the ground … Just a vague comment about an ‘uncertain economic environment’. Yes. Thank you very much.”
109;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-10-20T18:27:49Z;Publicis upbeat on marketing spending;;Publicis Groupe joined rival advertising groups WPP and Omnicom in saying that the wider economic uncertainty has not yet had a serious impact on marketing spending.The Paris-based group reported third-quarter revenues on Thursday at the top end of analysts’ forecasts but warned that the fourth quarter would see some slowdown due to the comparison with stronger results in the same period last year.Shares in Publicis fell about 4 per cent to €33.52 at the close of Paris trading on concerns the sales slowdown could hit profitability. Maurice Lévy, Publicis’ chief executive, said that after weakening in the first half, operating margins would be “in the ballpark of what we have [already] announced”, in line or slightly ahead of last year.“There is this situation of uncertainty and people are holding back on their investment as well as their expenditures. We see a slower economic growth,” Mr Lévy said. “This leads me to believe that we may well have a blip in the fourth quarter but that the trend of growth remains solid and healthy.”Publicis posted revenues of €1.42bn ($1.94bn) for the third quarter, growth of 6.4 per cent on a like for like basis, with year-to-date revenues up 6.9 per cent on a like for like basis.France, Germany and Russia showed organic growth of above 10 per cent, among Publicis’ best-performing regions, in the first nine months of the year. The slowest-growing markets include the UK, Italy and India, while revenues fell in Australia, Greece, Japan and Poland.Earlier this month, ZenithOptimedia, Publicis’ media agency, trimmed its forecasts for global media spending growth in 2011 from 4.1 per cent to 3.6 per cent and for 2012 from 5.9 per cent to 5.3 per cent. But WPP and Omnicom, Publicis’ larger competitors, said this week that trading had so far been unaffected by the eurozone crisis and other macroeconomic uncertainty.“We don’t see what I would call the ‘cliff effect’ as we have seen in 2008 or the beginning of 2009,” Mr Lévy said of chief executives’ approach to marketing budgets. “We see an erosion, we see some cuts – nothing which is alarming but we have to remain cautious. I feel good, I believe we will be on target, I believe next year we should see an improvement.”Analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients: “We believe this to be sensible caution and to a great degree reflects what the market is aware of in the wider macro sphere, having said that the caution may jar against neutral comments from Omnicom on Tuesday.”Mr Lévy warned that advertising spending was weakening in the financial sector, including insurance and banking clients.“They are suffering and it’s difficult for them currently to have a strong communication programme,” he said, while predicting a return to “very positive momentum” once the macroeconomic environment stabilises.On the other hand, many consumer goods advertisers – among the biggest-spending sectors – are “raising their expenditures …Most are protecting their brand, and we see here something which is very positive”.Mr Lévy said that after spending a total of just over €800m this year on acquisitions, including the large US digital agency Rosetta, Publicis would spend about half as much in 2012, with deals largely focused on emerging markets.
110;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-10-18T19:52:01Z;International sales help Omnicom buck trend;;Strong international sales helped Omnicom, one of the world’s largest advertising groups, report surprisingly robust third-quarter earnings, even as the outlook for the sector worsens.International revenues increased 22 per cent to $1.68bn, nearly equalling US revenues of $1.7bn, which were up 5.3 per cent.“Geographically all of our major markets experienced solid organic growth,” said John Wren, chief executive. “This performance is particularly notable given the worsening of economic and capital market conditions since our last earnings call.”Omnicom, which owns agencies such as BBDO Worldwide and DDB Worldwide, saw net income rise 16.4 per cent to $201.4m for the third quarter, while overall revenues were up 12.9 per cent to $3.38bn. It was the fourth consecutive quarter that Omnicom beat analyst estimates, as the company continues to rebound strongly from the recession.“Given the doom and gloom out there, I don’t know how you don’t look at this as pretty constructive results,” said Benjamin Swinburne, Morgan Stanley analyst.Mr Wren said growth was strongest in the UK, Germany and France. “In continental Europe, our results were quite positive in spite of the region’s sovereign debt problems,” he added.The impact of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami continued to affect sales in Asia, Mr Wren said. “Asia, Latin America and the Middle East continue to perform very well. All are experiencing double digit growth during the quarter even though Asia continues to be negatively impacted by our performance in Japan,” he added.But the car industry, which was hit hard by the disasters in Japan, has since rebounded.Mr Wren shied away from making specific predictions about the fourth quarter, but said the company’s performance would be affected by “the ability of European leaders to deal with the region’s sovereign debt problems, Washington’s ability to foster economic growth, and the role that rapidly growing economies in Asia and other parts of the world will play not only economically, but politically”.Omnicom slowed its share repurchase programme during the quarter, but acquired several new international agencies.Many analysts still believe ad spending will grow next year, despite lingering macroeconomic concerns. “We still think advertising grows in the US next year,” said Mr Swinburne.Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the advertising group, said on Tuesday that his group had not yet seen a strong pullback from advertisers.“September was very similar to July,” Sir Martin said at an investor day in London.Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw
111;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-10-04T18:42:50Z;Bric focus as Interpublic spree goes on;;Interpublic Group, the US advertising and public relations group, has acquired 14 new businesses in 10 months, in a spree that will see it buy more this year than it had in the previous five.The company behind agencies including McCann Worldgroup, Mediabrands and Draftfcb is on course to spend $150m buying new agencies this year.“Expect us to be aggressive,” said Michael Roth, IPG chief executive, in an interview.“We have the financial wherewithal and the capital to do acquisitions, but we want to make sure they fit within our overall plans.”For IPG, which gets most of its business from the US, this has meant gaining share in the Bric countries.Among its acquisitions this year have been S2Publicom, a public relations company in Brazil, AllofUS, a UK shop that has strong sales in Russia, and Interactive Avenues, a joint venture in India.“Our global agencies are the ones we’re investing in because those are where the growth markets are,” Mr Roth said.But in China, where “the media is owned by the government”, Mr Roth said IPG was taking a more measured approach to growth.“We’re going to invest in it, but it’s not the environment we want to bet the ranch on,” he said.Mr Roth is also looking to expand IPG’s new media and social media expertise.On Wednesday it will announce the acquisition of Meteorite, a digital shop in the UK with clients including Costa and Royal Mail.Several other of its new agencies specialise in digital marketing as well.The growth spurt has inherent risk for IPG, which has been burnt by acquisitions before.In 2005 the group said it would restate earnings back to 2000 because of problems with its internal accounting controls during an acquisition spree in the 1980s and 1990s.The company was on the brink of debt default and stock market delisting, and Mr Roth, formerly a financial services executive, was brought in to orchestrate a turnround.“We spent a number of years strengthening our balance sheet,” Mr Roth said.“The turnround isn’t over, but financially we’re as comfortable as we’ve been in a while.”Yet analysts and investors remain unconvinced. Shares in the company have fallen more than 30 per cent since the start of the year, and have hit all-time lows in recent weeks.While shares in rival groups Omnicom and Publicis are down about 20 per cent, and WPP is down 25 per cent, the poor share performance at IPG has led some in the industry to question the company’s long-term viability.Other analysts, however, are prepared to give Mr Roth more time, believing that IPG may yet be able to find growth, despite an uncertain economic outlook.“IPG has once again become a ‘show me’ story and will have to deliver before the stock reacts well and gets credit for the strong earnings growth expected this year and next,” wrote Alexia Quadrani, JPMorgan analyst, in a recent note.
112;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-09-23T18:13:25Z;Media mood darkens as advertising outlook dims;;"The mood of multinational media groups darkened this week as growing uncertainty about the advertising outlook clouded their assurances that new digital distributors would increase the value of premium content rather than hit traditional revenues.The annual Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference took place against a backdrop of slumping media share prices, as wider market nerves were accentuated in the sector by downgrades to forecasts from Viacom and the New York Times.“The watchword is caution,” said Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the advertising and marketing group.Agencies had seen little change yet in clients’ spending, he said, but “we’re going to tell our people to come in very cautiously with their budgets”.“In general, we don’t necessarily see the recovery, but we don’t see another big downturn,” added Randall Weisenburger, chief financial officer of Omnicom, WPP’s closest rival.Michael Roth, chief executive of Interpublic, the smaller advertising holding company, said: “This isn’t what we saw in 2008. There’s cash out there; [advertisers] have money to spend in this environment.“That said, there’s uncertainty out there and you have to be concerned. In 2008, we didn’t see the pullback until December and the fourth quarter.”Analysts expressed caution after Philippe Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive, lowered guidance for fourth-quarter advertising growth to “high single-digits” from the double-digit growth it predicted in August.“Despite widespread comments that the market is healthy, we worry that slowing national TV scatter [advertising] …is as much to blame as ratings,” said Michael Nathanson, a Nomura media analyst.Print media, hit first and hardest by the 2008-09 advertising slump, appear again to be struggling. Janet Robinson, chief executive of the New York Times, lowered its guidance for the coming quarter.Jeff Bewkes, chairman and chief of Time Warner, said that while advertising was still “pretty strong” in its cable networks, such as TNT, it was “a little softer” in its magazine division.Credit Suisse analysts estimated this month that one in five Americans could one day cancel cable or satellite subscriptions to take digital video from the likes of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com, but Mr Bewkes and Mr Dauman insisted that “cord-cutting” was a reflection of a weak economy rather than a challenge to pay-TV models.“Over the top” digital video services would provide incremental revenues, content owners argued. “The beautiful thing about Netflix is that it’s a new window for us,” after a show’s first-run airing and later TV syndication, said David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications.Les Moonves, CEO of CBS, and Chase Carey, chief operating officer of News Corp, both dubbed Netflix a service for “library” content, which could add value to older hits. Such services were “working out as a net plus for everybody”, Mr Bewkes added.Even as they reassured their biggest cable and satellite customers, however, content creators hinted at financial battles to come with their traditional distributors. Content owners said they expected extra payment in order for the cable industry to fulfil its ambitions to provide “TV Everywhere” or “authenticated” services that let subscribers see a full line-up of channels on any device.Executives also highlighted the profound shifts in TV economics being wrought by digital distribution. HBO Go, the TV Everywhere product from Time Warner’s premium cable channel, had increased users’ viewing of HBO programmes by 50 per cent, Mr Bewkes noted. “What happens when every other channel does it?” he asked."
113;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-08-31T16:03:30Z;Havas cautious on acquisition strategy;;Havas, the French marketing services group, is being more cautious with its acquisition strategy in light of global economic uncertainty, its chief executive said on Tuesday, as second-quarter revenue growth slowed.David Jones took over Havas’ top job in March with a mandate to invest up to €750m on dealmaking.“That absolutely remains our goal and objective,” he said. “The key thing is we want to spend our money wisely.”Mr Jones said Havas had examined “every significant target that is out there in the market”, including holding meetings with about 30 companies’ management and financial backers.“The valuations on digital businesses are extraordinarily high, on the one level. On the other level there are a lot of grey clouds being talked around the economy. The last thing we want to be is the people who spent our money fastest.”He said that within the next two months he would be presenting his acquisition plan to the Havas board, which includes chairman and largest shareholder Vincent Bolloré, the French industrialist.Havas has long been seen as a potential suitor for Aegis, a rival that recently agreed to sell its market research business. However, Mr Bolloré, which is the largest shareholder in both companies, has recently suggested he may instead be open to offers for his stake in Aegis.Mr Jones’ comments came as Havas, which owns agencies including Euro RSCG, posted a mixed set of results for the first half of the year.Like-for-like revenues at the Paris-based company grew 5.6 per cent to €765m in the six months to June 30, a slower rate than rivals WPP, Aegis, Publicis and Omnicom.In Europe, Havas’s like-for-like sales declined 0.9 per cent over the second quarter, with the UK down 2.3 per cent and Greece, Spain and Portugal also dragging on growth.However, Havas’ organic revenues grew 9.0 per cent in North America with 24.6 per cent growth in Latin America over the three-month period.All of the advertising holding companies have reported a slowdown in the second quarter of the year compared with the first but most executives have remained confident that the macroeconomic turmoil is unlikely to have a significant impact on marketing budgets this year.Clients in Europe and the US are “becoming much more cautious”, said Mr Jones. “They are not as optimistic as they were seven, eight months ago, especially in the North American market.”Mr Jones said that the UK business fell back due to client losses and strong comparative results from last year. Recent client wins “should put us back into a decent position in the back half of the year”, he said.He said that the US growth rate was likely to temper in the second half but he warned that there was “little visibility” on the wider economy. “I would love to have more clarity on what our clients’ plans are.”Earnings per share increased 8 per cent to €0.12 in the first half of 2011, on net income of €53m. Operating margins increased 90 basis points to 12.4 per cent.Average net debt was reduced by 73 per cent to €22m.Mr Jones said the company may look at buying back company stock in the coming months as Havas share price was “undervalued at the moment”.Havas shares closed 1.4 per cent higher at €2.79 in Paris trading on Wednesday afternoon.
114;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-08-29T14:16:15Z;Wall Street up on consumer spending data;;The S&P 500 closed above 1,200 for the first time in two weeks as traders seized on better than expected consumer spending figures to propel a broad market rally.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 rose 4.2 per cent, led by insurance groups, which avoided big pay outs after hurricane Irene left New York relatively unscathed. Irene had been downgraded to a tropical storm shortly before it made landfall, and markets opened as usual Monday morning. Hartford Financial Services was up 13 per cent at $19.42. Allstate rose 8.5 per cent to $26.30.Bank of America was up 8.1 per cent at $8.39, after it announced the $8.3bn sale of half of its 10 per cent stake in China Construction Bank. Some analysts had expected the bank to dispose of its entire stake in CCB to raise capital, but analysts were pleased with the price, which represents a premium over the $7.3bn received for 6 per cent of CCB in 2009.“The price seems good to me, and BofA are shrinking their balance sheet and disposing of non-core assets, which is what markets are telling them to do,” said Paul Miller at FBR Capital Markets.The S&P 500 closed up 2.8 per cent at 1,210.08, above the 1,200 barrier at which bears have offered resistance. But trading was lower than on any other day this month, leaving traders cautious about reading too much into the rally.“Technicians will tell you they want the S&P 500 to reach 1,200 on strong volume,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential. “In a rally, more than percentage rises, volume is important.”Media groups dependent on advertising for revenue outperformed the S&P 500. The sector suffered losses last week after Citigroup downgraded several stocks citing expected sluggish growth in consumer spending.Cable company CBS was up 5.6 per cent at $24.47 and Gannett, which owns magazines and newspapers including USA Today, was up 8.1 per cent at $11.56.James Dix at Wedbush said an economic slowdown would not necessarily hurt media companies immediately. “Large companies are not as highly levered as they were in 2008. That gives them some flexibility to keep spending on advertising to gain market share, in the hope that any downturn will be short,” he said.But he said he preferred to hold advertising agency stocks over advertising-dependent media groups.“Advertising agencies have exposure to emerging markets, because companies will still be looking to grow their brands there by deploying marketing budgets. But if you are looking for growth in China, you won’t advertise on CBS.“Margins are also tougher for media groups. Advertising companies can lay off staff in a downturn, but media companies have high fixed costs. They have already invested in their content and need to sell advertising to make a profit.”Advertising agencies had a mixed day. Omnicom Group was up only 2.1 per cent to $40.01. Rival Interpublic Group, a big advertising agency, was up 7.2 per cent at $8.66.Micron Technology, the semiconductor manufacturer, gained 8.6 per cent to close at $6.15.The group has rallied almost 20 per cent since a dramatic fall last Wednesday, when the company warned it would miss revenue expectations because of falling demand for the Dram components it makes for computers.Since then the Dram spot price has unexpectedly risen almost 5 per cent, continuing gains today, despite a report by business research group IHS, which predicted “free-falling prices are in store in the third quarter”.Other semiconductor stocks also gained. Applied Materials was up 3.7 per cent to $11.39.Based on the quarterly earnings reports of the main semiconductor manufacturers, Citigroup analyst Timothy Arcuri estimated orders had fallen 50 per cent to $20bn during the quarter.But Mr Arcuri said current stock prices reflect depressed demand sufficiently, and said the sector may have now troughed.Monsanto shares fell 1.3 per cent on reports that one of its genetically modified corn crops may have developed resistance to pesticides.Zillow rose 5.3 per cent to $33.04, after Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney initiated coverage with a $36 target and recommendation to “buy”. Mr Mahaney cited the company’s first mover status in online property search and the size of the US property market.Citi, which was the main underwriter of Zillow’s IPO, becomes the first major bank to cover the stock.Youku shares were up 7 per cent at $24.95 after the Chinese video-sharing website announced an online distribution agreement for rights to the DreamWorks Animation Kung Fu Panda franchise films in mainland China. The deal marks the first time DWA titles will be made available through an online platform in China.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent at 11,447.49 and the Nasdaq index of tech shares rose 2.5 per cent to 2,542.86 at midday.
115;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-07-27T23:21:28Z;Managers buy in to buy-outs;There are benefits in running businesses that are not listed;"In the trophy cabinet at Birds Eye’s factory in Lowestoft, a large silver cup has pride of place. It is the 2009 Cash Profit Award – an apt illustration of the venerable frozen food producer’s priorities since 2006, when the division was bought from Unilever by Permira, the private equity firm.“Unilever was a more comfortable place to work,” concedes Craig Hamilton, the enthusiastic Glaswegian who was promoted after the buy-out to run the factory, perched on the easternmost point of the UK. However, he welcomes the discipline of private equity. “It’s a more financially focused business now.”The common preconception of how private equity operates is that a fierce focus on cost-cutting and determination to pay down acquisition debt comes at the expense of jobs and long-term corporate sustainability. In Britain, the winding up of Southern Cross – a care home group that once belonged to US buy-out group Blackstone – has given new fuel to union protests against private equity’s methods (see box). A return of larger leveraged deals could revive concerns that last peaked in 2006 and 2007.But managers who once worked for listed groups and have successfully come through the credit crunch say there are also clear benefits to the discipline of private equity ownership.At the time of the Birds Eye deal, Permira was in the crosshairs of the critics. One union had mounted a stunt by taking a camel to the local church of Damon Buffini, then Permira chairman, in a reference to Jesus’s comment that it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for the wealthy to get to heaven. Union fears seemed to be confirmed when about 850 out of Birds Eye’s 5,000 workers lost their jobs in the subsequent closure of its factory in Hull. Those jobs have not returned.“The objective wasn’t to bring a number of jobs back to previous [levels]; the objective was to be as efficient and as competitive as possible,” says Martin Glenn, chief executive of Iglo, which controls the Birds Eye and Iglo brands for Permira.But Mr Hamilton, who joined Unilever as a graduate in 1993, is not nostalgic for the comforts of working for a listed multinational. He says staff at the plant were initially nervous about the takeover, but quickly recognised the benefits of becoming more efficient and attracting more volume to Lowestoft’s production line.In fact, he and other executives in the sector are quick to point out the disadvantages of the listed model. William Eccleshare worked for both WPP and Omnicom, the quoted media groups, and is now chief executive of outdoor advertising company Clear Channel International, part of Clear Channel Communications, controlled by Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital. He says that at the listed companies “there was always a very short-term pressure to deliver the next quarterly earnings, and never really a great sense of the need to build a long-term strategy”.John Pearmund, chief executive of Domestic & General, which provides extended electrical appliance warranties, agrees. He ran the company before and after its 2007 buy-out by Advent International.“With one main investor, all these discussions [about strategy] can be had in a much more open environment – not in one of these presentations to [public company] investors where …you get constrained in lots of ways,” he says.These managers cite four main reasons why they prefer the private equity model. One is the greater proximity between managers and owners. Mr Eccleshare reports to an operating committee of the board, which includes representatives of both TH Lee and Bain Capital. “We have very intense monthly reviews,” he says, where the questions are more rigorous and more intelligent than those he used to field when working for listed media companies.Blackstone, a US private equity group that manages $159bn in assets, came under fierce criticism this year amid the financial crisis at the care homes operator, Southern Cross. Blackstone was accused of “selling off” Southern Cross’s real estate between 2004, when it acquired the company, and 2006, when it floated it in London.When its finances fell apart this year, Southern Cross partly blamed the fact that it owned none of its 752 homes, leaving it vulnerable to rent increases.Blackstone points out that Southern Cross owned only 20 of its homes when Blackstone bought it. It argues that the most aggressive “sale and leaseback” activity took place after the flotation, when 95 per cent of Southern Cross homes operated under leases that existed before Blackstone’s involvement. “Many operators of care homes in the UK dating back to the 1990s did not own their real estate,” Blackstone said last month. “Blackstone did not create the care home operating company model.”A second reason is the speed with which decisions are taken. Mr Hamilton says that if he can justify capital spending decisions – such as two recent £500,000 investments to produce resealable bags for frozen peas – Iglo is quick to approve them. Previously, he says, getting approval could take longer than the lead time for delivering the machinery. For its part, Unilever says it made a strategic decision to sell the frozen-foods business, even though it was highly profitable, and focus on other core product categories – and adds that it has streamlined decision-making since then.Third, private equity owners demand focus. “‘We don’t want to over-complicate this business’ is a phrase you hear quite often [from the owners],” says Mr Eccleshare.At D&G, Mr Pearmund was able to drop a diffuse strategy without having to justify the apparent U-turn to critics in the press or investor community. This fourth advantage – privacy – means costly strategic investment or painful restructuring can be done away from public scrutiny. Stepping off the treadmill of quarterly or half-yearly corporate reporting certainly frees up time to manage. Mr Pearmund estimates that he has saved two months in every year that he used to spend briefing analysts and investors.Unions, however, claim private equity can keep management and investment failures out of the headlines. So does this style of management produce better operational results? Studies of private equity performance carried out for the World Economic Forum two years ago showed that on average, private equity ownership did improve productivity, and that private equity-owned companies demonstrated higher levels of management practice.But the difference, particularly compared with companies with dispersed shareholders, was small, raising the question of whether the disruption and transaction costs involved in such takeovers is worthwhile. Moreover, during credit bubbles the gains achieved by private equity owners are much lower. “There is so much easy money to be made by flipping [buying and selling companies in short order] that they don’t really do the hard work of adding value,” says Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School, who helped bring together the WEF studies. “That wouldn’t be a problem, except those are the periods where the bulk of money gets invested.”Private equity’s advocates hope the credit crunch will refocus the sector on the basics of good management. They point out that firms’ reputations and the returns to limited partners in their funds suffer if they fail to offer to eventual buyers a well-managed company with potential for growth.John Singer, managing partner at Advent International, says: “The industry did try to do things with arbitrage and leverage, but it’s become clear recently that [earnings] growth is the way to add value.”There may be another, largely unspoken reason why managers prefer private equity to the listed model: the potential payback that buy-out firms offer to those who lead their companies to a profitable exit. By giving such incentives, private equity firms say they align the interests of owners and managers. As Mr Eccleshare says, “they reward success and they’re intolerant of failure”.This and the operational benefits of managing under private equity ownership help explain why nobody interviewed for this article expressed an urge to return to running a listed company. The prizes for successful management under private equity control still look more valuable."
116;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-07-22T12:53:31Z;Publicis battles with rising staff costs;;Rising staff costs put a dent in margins at Publicis Groupe, one of the world’s largest marketing services companies, causing first-half profits to miss analysts’ expectations.Operating profits at the owner of Razorfish, Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi fell by 1.4 per cent to €364m ($524m) in the six months to June 30, compared with analysts’ consensus expectations of about €400m. As a result, Publicis’ operating margins – closely watched by investors – fell 100 basis points to 13.5 per cent.However, like-for-like revenue growth of 7.1 per cent to €2.7bn for the first half of 2011 came in ahead of forecasts. Sales growth improved in the second quarter over the first, thanks to a strong performance in France, Germany and China, offsetting a slowdown in North America.Maurice Lévy, chief executive of Publicis, told the Financial Times that he had flagged a plan to increase investment in staffing and technology earlier in the year.Publicis lifted its freeze on recruitment and salary increases, implemented during the economic downturn, in May last year.“We are getting back to normal and as we reduced the number of people, we had to go back to a normal level of people,” Mr Lévy said. “The second bucket [of costs] is that we had to invest in technology and new ventures. We have also hired people to develop [marketing technology] platforms and work for which we will get the revenue much later… in maybe a year or 18 months.”Mr Lévy said that Publicis was also hiring in advance of new business wins from clients such as Microsoft and Disney which would not be billed until later in the year. Currency fluctuations have also compounded the problem.He said that there would be no “major problem” in reaching the company’s margin targets for the full year.“We are in the second half getting to something which is more normal and the comparison base will be more favourable,” he said. “We will be in a situation which is much more satisfactory.”Last week, Publicis refinanced a €1.2bn revolving debt facility, which had been due for renewal in 2012, giving it a total of €4bn in cash and available credit. “It was not specifically to cover such and such an acquisition,” Mr Lévy said. “It is purely to have a good financial strategy regarding our balance sheet.”Publicis has made a string of acquisitions in the last few months, including Rosetta, a US digital agency for $575m and Genedigi Group, a public relations agency in China.“As of today we have probably spent something slightly over €500m,” Mr Lévy said. “As we have a few negotiations under way regarding China and some emerging markets we decided we should look at raising the level of money that we would be spending.”Progress on deals in China was “slow”, he said, due to having to negotiate with both companies and government bodies. “It doesn’t change our appetite,” he said, even though Publicis had not yet made as many purchases as he “would have liked”.China will be Publicis’ third-largest market in the next three years, he said.Analysts at Liberum Capital downgraded Publicis from ‘buy’ to ‘hold’ on the results, saying: “Comments on cost inflation are more bearish than Omnicom and we suspect some elements are Publicis-specific. We are also worried about the slowdown in growth in North America, especially given it is where Publicis’ higher growth media and digital businesses have their base.”Earlier this week, Omnicom, a US rival, reported like for like revenue growth of 6.2 per cent to $6.6bn in the first half of the year, with income before taxes 13.9 per cent higher at $750m.Shares in Publicis, which opened about 2 per cent lower in Paris trading on Thursday, recovered to close down 0.5 per cent at €37.65.
117;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-07-19T19:47:53Z;BSkyB gains on special dividend hope and banks recover losses;Banks led way after two-year low on Monday;British Sky Broadcasting followed the London market higher as pressure intensified on James Murdoch, chairman, to return cash to share-holders.While the appearance of the Murdochs before a parliamentary media select committee dominated the day, analysts looked ahead to the broadcaster’s results due on July 29.They saw scope for a special dividend of up to £2.4bn. But few were assuming any specific pledges in the light of the turmoil at News Corporation and doubts about James Murdoch’s independence.To return cash would be “a sign of strength” by BSkyB’s board, Macquarie argued. However, it expected the group to say it was still reviewing its options.“The political fall-out and PR consequences of a major cash return strategy where News Corp is entitled to 39 per cent is likely to be too much in the short term,” said the broker. “BSkyB has largely avoided the media fall-out from News International and we believe BSkyB’s directors would be advised not to antagonise the press in the coming weeks and drag the company into the mire.”JPMorgan Cazenove said BSkyB could afford to give back 120p per share by taking net debt to a historic level of 1.6 times operating earnings.UBS argued that up to two times earnings was plausible, which would give holders 137p apiece.Shares in BSkyB closed up 2.9 per cent to 734p as both JPMorgan and UBS repeated buy advice.The wider market broke a three-day losing streak with the FTSE 100 ending 0.7 per cent higher, or 37.18 points, to 5,789.99.Banks led the way, having reached a two-year low on Monday. Lloyds Banking Group bounced 4.4 per cent to 43¼p, Barclays added 1.9 per cent to 211½p and Royal Bank of Scotland edged up 0.4 per cent to 33p.WPP rose 2.8 per cent to 709p after earnings by smaller peer Omnicom beat forecasts. Omnicom also reassured about the outlook, saying there were no signs that clients were looking to rein in spending.Tesco slipped 0.8 per cent to 392p as UK industry data from Kantar showed its growth was the weakest among the big four grocers in recent weeks.J Sainsbury rose 0.6 per cent to 316p even after Shore Capital cut dividend forecasts for the group.British Land fell 1.1 per cent to 598p after Goldman Sachs downgraded to “neutral” on valuation grounds.Petropavlovsk was up 3.6 per cent to 830p after Credit Suisse recommended the gold miner, which it said was at a discount of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent to Russian peers.“Petropavlovsk has solid growth profile and we believe such discount is not justified fundamentally,” Credit Suisse said.BWin Party Digital was 5.9 per cent higher to 140p after the European Commission said Germany’s proposals to reform its gambling industry would breach EU law. BWin, formerly known as Partygaming, generates about a quarter of its revenue from Germany.A relief rally carried IG Group higher by 5.4 per cent to 433¾p after management said trading at the start of the new year had been “encouraging,” in spite of low volatility.Full-year results from the spread-betting specialist matched previous guidance.Henderson Group rose 3.9 per cent to 155p on a positive first-half trading update with the money manager announcing performance and transaction fees well in advance of consensus expectations.Sector peer Aberdeen Asset Management gained 3.2 per cent to 226½p before results on Monday.Deutsche Bank, which added Aberdeen to its “buy” list, said the group was likely to show net inflows to its higher-margin equity funds in the quarter, helping boost management fees.Ahead of results, London Stock Exchange climbed 3.4 per cent to 996½p following a speculative report that Nasdaq may still be working on a takeover offer.Analysts also noted the potential benefit to the LSE from the Italian debt crisis.The rapid growth in Italian interbank loans was the main driver behind LSE’s earnings jumping 22 per cent last year in an otherwise sluggish trading environment, Berenberg Bank highlighted.Among small caps, stockbroker Evolution Group added 8.3 per cent to 72p on news of discussions to acquire BNP Paribas Private Investment Management.Mulberry, the luxury handbag maker, added 4.8 per cent to £18.40 even after Godfrey Davis, chairman, declared the sale of 205,000 shares at £18 each.Bowleven firmed 1.7 per cent to 297p on talk that the explorer could announce the results of drilling on the Sapele-2 Cameroon well.This article has been ammened to show Evolution is in talks to buy BNP Paribas Private Investment Management.
118;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-06-28T03:01:33Z;WPP sets up digital media advertising unit;;WPP, the world’s largest marketing group by sales, has created a unit for buying digital media, a one-stop shop for targeted, mobile and social network advertising that will directly compete with products from Google and Microsoft.Xaxis, the subsidiary, combines several technologies and acquisitions from across WPP to allow advertisers to target specific demographics and build up anonymised profiles of would-be consumers.Big ad groups are striving to grab a larger share of the fast-growing online advertising market by making a fragmented market more simple, compared with traditional media such as television. Many of the world’s biggest advertisers are also looking at consolidating their marketing duties in fewer, larger agencies.The creation of Xaxis follows digital media initiatives from Publicis and Omnicom, WPP’s rivals. Publicis formed Vivaki in 2008, while Omnicom has announced partnerships with technology companies such as Google, AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo – all of which offer their own digital media buying tools.WPP claims it can differentiate its products by using in-house technology, such as 24/7 Real Media, the digital ad group that it bought for $650m in 2007.“We took a fundamentally different stance in this space than our traditional agency competitors,” said Brian Lesser, the Xaxis chief executive who joined WPP when it bought 24/7. “We thought it was very important to have proprietary technology because we are better able to control our advertisers’ data and to manage different solutions.”Ad agencies are grappling with how best to work with internet companies, as they balance the opportunity of sharing in their more rapid growth with the risk of being removed from the business chain through disintermediation.Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, likes to call Google a “frenemy”, reflecting its dual role as a competitor and customer. Google’s in-house Creative Lab won awards at last week’s Cannes Lions advertising festival, where technology companies including Microsoft, AOL and Facebook were more prominent than in previous years.Mr Lesser said Xaxis would work with third-party technology companies, but said: “We are much better suited to offer competitive products that integrate with what our agencies are doing …Google is a great partner of ours but we don’t rely on their full technology stack the way some of our colleagues at other agencies do.”This allows the group to be much more objective in where it buys media and how it provides insights and analysis to its advertisers, he added.Mr Lesser said Xaxis would be working with hundreds of GroupM’s large and small clients, and use data created by WPP’s Kantar market research unit to determine which audiences to target online.WPP shares closed 1½p lower at 742p in London.
119;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-04-21T12:12:43Z;Publicis targets China after sales growth;;Publicis Groupe is renewing its focus on China, earmarking up to $250m for acquisitions there in the coming years, after reporting 10.7 per cent sales growth across the marketing services group in the first quarter.Like-for-like revenues at Publicis, which owns agencies including Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi, grew by 6.5 per cent in the first three months of the year to €1.29bn.Maurice Lévy, chief executive of Publicis, attributed the performance to strong media spending in the US, France and Germany, with growth across all sectors, particularly among financial services and technology, media and telecoms clients.However, organic revenues in Africa and the Middle East fell by 0.5 per cent and Asia-Pacific, which includes Japan and Australia, grew just 1.5 per cent, due to the disruption in these regions. Both units are much smaller sources of revenue than the US or Europe.“What we could have lost in terms of revenue and margin in Japan and the Middle East we are regaining elsewhere,” Mr Lévy told the Financial Times, adding that commodity price rises have not yet impacted advertising spending.“For the time being, we don’t see a lot of evidence of budget cuts.”He indicated that in spite of disruption in Japan and the Middle East, Publicis expects to grow its revenues by more than 5 per cent over the course of 2011. “Five would be a very conservative number for us,” he said. “The [new business] pipeline is good. It’s not exploding but it’s good.”Last week, Omnicom, a US rival, reported like-for-like growth of 5.2 per cent in its first quarter. WPP, the world’s largest marketing services group by revenues and other measures, will update investors on current trading next week.Publicis’ like-for-like revenues in China, Brazil, India and Russia grew by 11.4 per cent in the quarter and Mr Lévy said that he hoped to double the size of its business there by 2013.As part of that goal, Publicis could spend between $150m and $250m on acquisitions in China over the next three years, he said, if the company could find the right deals, although organic growth was also important.Publicis was winning new business from multinational firms expanding into China as well as local companies such as China Mobile and China Telecom, he said. It competes against both international rivals and local agencies.“On media [buying] it is highly sensitive on price,” he said. “When the client is sophisticated and requires high level services with full-fledged agency services, this is something we never lose against local agencies. Currently we win more than we lose.”Jean-Yves Naouri, Publicis’ chief operating officer, will update analysts on the group’s China strategy in Paris on Thursday. Mr Lévy has indicated that Mr Naouri is a likely successor when he retires, although no departure date has been set.Alongside securing 30 per cent of revenues from faster-growing markets such as China, Publicis has also set a target of 35 per cent of revenues from digital marketing in three years’ time.Digital revenues grew by 12.6 per cent at the group level in the first quarter and made up 42 per cent of sales in North America, Mr Lévy said.Publicis shares fell by 3.7 per cent to €37.45 by midday in Paris trading.
120;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-04-19T14:27:00Z;Omnicom reports 24% jump in profits;;Omnicom, one of the world’s largest marketing services groups, said its strong first quarter reflected a strengthening global economy as it reported a 23.6 per cent leap in net earnings to $201.9 for the first three months of the year.Global revenues for the first quarter were up 7.9 per cent to $3.15bn, as the advertising and communications group said it had its greatest international mix in revenues to date. Omnicom owns advertising agencies such as DDB and BBDO and public relations groups including the newly acquired Voce Communications.US revenues for Omnicom grew 3.8 per cent to $1.63bn as advertising spending returned gradually and the company worked to contain costs. “We expect to see solid growth in the US as employment and business fundamentals continue to improve,” said John Wren, chief executive.The group’s international revenues reached a record 47.6 per cent for the quarter, and Omnicom’s regional performance provided a snapshot of the global economy and the impact of various natural disasters and political disruptions.“The tragic events in Japan contributed to a negative impact in the quarter,” said Mr Wren. Advertising in Japan accounts for 1.5 per cent of Omnicom’s revenues.Mr Wren added that in the coming quarters spending in other regions might be affected as weakened Japanese manufacturers pulled back on advertising their goods abroad. “Their production is really going to be affected in the second quarter,” he said.Omnicom also reported lost revenue in the quarter as a result of the political unrest in the Middle East. “Growth in the region slowed from strong double digits to single-digits,” said chief financial officer Randall Weisenburger. The region accounts for 1 per cent of Omnicom’s revenues.The company also said floods in Brisbane, Australia and the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand had had an impact on business operations. The company also said spending in Germany had been weaker this quarter than last, but that this had more to do with accounts than any macroeconomic trends.European growth was on track, with the larger economies such as France, Germany and the UK recovering more quickly.“The larger markets performed fairly well, while the niche markets were negative, but less negative than they were last year,” said Mr Weisenburger.Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne said top-line growth at the company was offset by a Omnicom’s strong capital return programme, which is among the most generous in the industry.“Key risks include a double dip in global economies leading to organic revenue deterioration,” he said. “Accelerating return of capital could lead to earnings upside.”
121;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-04-15T16:38:03Z;Publicis to sell stake in Freud PR firm;;Matthew Freud, one of London’s best-known public relations operatives, and Publicis Group, the French advertising group, have parted ways after months of fraught negotiations.Publicis said in a statement after the close of trading in Paris that it had reached an agreement to sell back its majority stake in Freud Communications. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed but one person familiar with the deal said that Publicis made a modest profit on the sale.Mr Freud sold a 50.1 per cent stake to Publicis in 2005 in a deal that valued his company at €70m-€80m, according to people familiar with the situation at the time. Revenues grew 23 per cent to £33.0m last year.The agency, the UK’s largest consumer PR firm, has clients including Asda, Sony and Nike. The FT first reported that the deal was in negotiations in November last year.“I enjoyed working with Matthew and I have a lot of respect for his skills,” said Olivier Fleurot, chief executive of MSL Group, Publicis’ communications and events network. “We wish him success in his future endeavours.”Nicola Howson, chief executive of Freud Communications, said: “We are grateful for the support of Publicis Groupe as a shareholder since 2005 and look forward to our future as an independently owned company.”The deal is not the first time that Freud Communications has been taken over by a larger marketing services group, only to extricate itself several years later. The agency was bought by Abbott Mead Vickers, a British ad agency, in 1994. After AMV was acquired by Omnicom, Mr Freud and his team bought back the agency in 2001.Mr Freud did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Last month saw the departure of another senior British executive from Publicis when Richard Pinder, chief operating officer of Publicis Worldwide, its largest agency, was replaced by Jean-Yves Naouri. Maurice Lévy, Publicis Groupe chief executive, told the FT that Mr Naouri “is clearly in a leading position for winning the race” to take over as chief when he steps down in the coming years.
122;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-03-15T02:23:07Z;Univision chief to step down;;Joe Uva is quitting Univision Communications, leaving America’s most watched Spanish language broadcaster to find a new chief executive to lead an initial public offering that could happen as soon as next year.The news surprised many industry members, coming less than six months after Univision resolved its biggest strategic challenge by locking in its supply of telenovelas and other programming from Mexico’s Televisa until 2020.Mr Uva, 55, was brought in four years ago from Omnicom’s OMD media arm by the investor group that led Univision’s $12.3bn buy-out in 2006, overseeing strong audience gains and benefiting from rising advertiser interest in the growing spending power of America’s Hispanic population.The private equity group, led by Madison Dearborn, Providence Equity Partners, Texas Pacific Group, Thomas H Lee and Saban Capital, suffered heavy paper losses as markets turned, but has grown more confident of exiting the investment at a profit as Univision’s revenues have grown and its relationship with Televisa has stabilised.Bankers and other industry observers believe an IPO may be possible next year, depending on market conditions.Mr Uva, a former sales and marketing executive at Turner Broadcasting Systems, had not served as a public company chief executive, but the company would not comment on whether this was a factor in his departure.The company said Mr Uva had decided not to renew his contract, which ends on April 2.“The team is strong and I have decided the time is right for me to capitalise on other opportunities,” he said.Haim Saban, executive chairman, will take on extra responsibilities while the board conducts an internal and external search for a successor.It was not immediately clear whether Randy Falco, the former AOL and NBC executive who joined Univision as chief operating officer in January, would be a candidate.It was also unclear what role Televisa would play in the selection of a successor.October’s $1.2bn investment gave the Mexican group 5 per cent of Univision, with debentures convertible into another 30 per cent and the option to raise its total holding to 40 per cent should US foreign ownership laws be loosened.Mr Uva leaves as Univision is challenging English language broadcast networks, finishing February ahead of NBC among 18-34 -year-old viewers. World Cup football rights helped its revenues increase by 14 per cent to $2.25bn in 2010.
123;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-03-09T23:39:26Z;Omnicom in deals to target online ads;;Omnicom, one of the world’s largest marketing services groups, has struck what it claims are industry-first partnerships with AOL, Yahoo and Microsoft, to gain direct access to the internet companies’ consumer data.The deals, which follow a similar agreement with Google last year, will give Omnicom’s agencies the ability to target advertising to particular locations, ages and demographics across the web’s biggest media networks.“We are already spending hundreds of millions of dollars with all of these four companies, but now we can spend it more efficiently and effectively,” said Jonathan Nelson, Omnicom’s digital chief.Although there are no commitments on either side around minimum spending as part of the agreement, discounts will be given depending on the volume.The partnerships are part of a wider strategy at Omnicom around the “art and science” of building greater expertise in digital advertising, as more clients increase their online advertising spending.Other elements of the partnerships involve technology companies providing “creative ambassadors” to work with Omnicom’s agencies.“We are primarily a services company, that is where we add value to our clients and where we see our sweet spot,” said John Wren, chief executive of Omnicom.“Technology is changing at an incredibly rapid pace. It’s not sensible for us to be investing in technologies which may not be appropriate six, 12 or 18 months from now. It’s far wiser for us to come up with sensible collaborative arrangements where we share points of mutual interest with the technologists and figure out a compatible way for us to live with each other …We have figured out a way to optimise what both companies are doing.”The partnership approach contrasts with the more acquisitive path taken by Omnicom’s main rivals, WPP and Publicis, as they jostle for leadership in the digital advertising world. Analysts say its latest deals provide Omnicom with similar capabilities to its rivals without hefty upfront investment, but could leave it vulnerable to internet companies revoking access to their data in future.Omnicom believes its partnerships with the four largest online media owners will enable it to sidestep criticism around privacy, because it will not own the data, instead gaining constant access to the internet companies’ own databases.At the same time, it hopes that having a view across four data sets will enable it to become more consistent and accurate in targeting advertising to demographics such as car buyers or sports fans, which can be defined differently by different media owners.“They are providing their database segmented the way we want it,” said Mr Nelson. “We don’t need to own the data to have the most intelligence. We don’t see anything that the media company doesn’t want us to see. What we get is real-time access to their audiences at the moment that we need to make a [media] buy.”
124;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Advertising industry resilient, says WPP;;Advertising agencies had confounded the critics who said they would be eradicated by the recession and the internet, said Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP.“There is no complacency but a lot of people were forecasting that a lot of us would go out of business for either the G word [Google] or the R word [recession],” Sir Martin said.“I don’t think you ever see it off. It just proves that the business was a little bit more resistant than people thought it was.”Traditional advertising and media-buying were WPP’s strongest sectors last year, when like-for-like sales grew 5.3 per cent to £9.3bn and pre-tax profits leapt 28.5 per cent to £851.3m. The company lifted its total dividend from 15.47p to 17.79p.Sir Martin predicted that the marketing services group would show a similar revenue growth rate this year, with the environment “set fair” until 2012.Rivals such as Omnicom and Publicis had earlier reported better than expected results for the fourth quarter, as advertising spending accelerated through 2010.Sir Martin pointed to recent results from traditional media owners such as ITV, noting that the “mood is better” after the “annus horribilis” of 2009.But he said that “big challenges remain” in adapting to the digital world, as he set a new target for “new media” to make up 35 to 40 per cent of WPP’s revenues, from 29 per cent today.“A lot of people thought that there was going to be doom and destruction and it hasn’t proven to be as bad,” he said. “That doesn’t mean it’s still not a testing time.”WPP has also set a new 35-40 per cent target for the share of revenues from faster-growing markets, such as India, Brazil and China, as the world “continues to move at very different speeds”.In English football terms, Sir Martin put “Bric” markets and others, such as Indonesia and Turkey, in the Premier League, with the US in the Championship and the more sluggish western Europe – including the UK – in the next division down.Sir Martin said the UK could “perhaps” be promoted, thanks to the government’s emphasis on deficit reduction and long-term growth, in contrast to his concerns that failure to tackle the deficit in the US could cause problems by 2013.Like Reed Elsevier and Informa before it, WPP’s shares were punished on Friday for merely meeting market expectations and fell 2.6 per cent to 814½p.A lack of upgrades will not help the shares’ momentum in the near term. But confidence is returning to medialand and WPP lifted its dividend and has promised to increase its pay-out ratio in the “medium term”.That is likely to reassure investors that Sir Martin will not expend a vast sum of their cash on another big, risky acquisition – even though the last such deal, TNS, is delivering returns ahead of schedule.On Citigroup’s forecasts, WPP trades at 11.5 times 2012 earnings, a slight discount to its global peers.
125;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-03-04T20:16:27Z;Tobacco groups fall on packaging control;Rising oil price puts travel companies among the fallers;Cigarette makers followed the London market lower on Friday on concerns the UK government would enforce generic packaging.Imperial Tobacco lost 1.5 per cent to £19.42 and British American Tobacco was 0.7 per cent weaker at £24.83.Analysts speculated that the government may publish its Tobacco Control Plan to coincide with National No Smoking Day on Wednesday.“We think there is a good chance the government may want plain packaging,” said Citigroup analyst Adam Spielman. “We don’t think the market is focusing adequately on this risk.”Imperial, with a fifth of its earnings coming from the UK, would be most directly exposed to a change in legislation. But with the European Commission due to rule on generic packaging early in 2012, it may be several years before investors have a clear view of the impact, Citi said.“The potential problem is more that plain packaging may accelerate down-trading in the long term rather than its potential to hurt volumes,” said Mr Spielman.“Down-trading is often more damaging to profit than volume declines,” he saidThe wider market ended the week where it started, with the index closing Friday’s session weaker by 14.70 points or 0.2 per cent to 5,990.39.A rising oil price put travel companies among the fallers. Carnival lost 3 per cent to £25.90 and British Airways owner IAG was down 2.9 per cent to 227p.WPP weakened by 2.6 per cent to 815p on profit-taking after its full-year results provided no surprises. While earnings from the advertising group were slightly ahead of market expectations, rivals Publicis and Omnicom had already reported bigger positive earnings surprises, analysts said.Smith & Nephew was up 0.6 per cent to 715p on renewed hopes of a bid from Johnson & Johnson.The speculation came after J&J, which has $28bn in cash, this week filed a so-called shelf registration with US authorities, giving it the option of issuing multiple new debt lines.“J&J could buy almost anything,” said Merrill Lynch. However, the broker doubted whether S&N was a likely target. “Additional deals in orthopedics make little sense to us as J&J already has critical mass and we see little innovation within the space going forward,” it said.Vague talk of a large-cap bid next week also helped several of the perennial subjects of takeover gossip. Centricawas up 0.2 per cent to 337p and Smiths Group rose 1 per cent to £13.44.Late in the day, Arm Holdings was mentioned by US traders as a plausible takeover target, though its shares ended down by 1.9 per cent to 584p.BSkyB rose 0.2 per cent to 825p after three institutions lifted their shareholdings. The purchases follow talk that a rebel group of shareholders was looking to put pressure on News Corporation to significantly raise its bid for BSkyB.Fidelity, Taconic Capital Advisors and Odey Asset Management all reported purchases at between 810p and 820p apiece. On Thursday, fund manager Crispin Odey said he “might” accept a 950p per share offer from News Corp.An upgrade to “buy” from Merrill Lynch lifted Serco, the outsourcing company, by 4.6 per cent to 619p.Merrill forecast Serco’s sales growth to accelerate on UK proposals to open up the supply of public services to competition, and noted that the government was due to award material contracts for defence, pensions and law within the first half of 2011. “As a growth defensive, Serco should be more attractive to investors who are cautious regarding the economic outlook and instability in Africa and the Middle East,” it said.Elsewhere among the gainers, Petrofac was up 3.2 per cent to £14.66 ahead of results due Monday, while Insurer Standard Life rose 2.9 per cent to 237p on Investec “buy” advice.Forth Ports took on 4.5 per cent to £15.23 on a retread of speculation that the Northstream consortium, its 27.4 per cent shareholder, may make another takeover approach. Forth last year rejected three bids up to £14 a share from the consortium, led by property investor John Whittaker.Engineer Bodycote was up 5.1 per cent to 325p on the back of an upgrade to “buy” from RBS. “We believe positive pricing and its improved performance in Brazil will also help drive its margins higher in 2011,” it said. “We also like the lack of raw materials or energy cost concerns that currently exist elsewhere in the sector.”
126;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-03-04T09:54:27Z;WPP bolstered by strong US market;;WPP unveiled its best quarterly sales growth in a decade on Friday, aided by continued strength in the US.The increase helped the UK-headquartered marketing services group post an annual pre-tax profit of £851m, up 28 per cent on 2009.The buoyancy of the recent results posted by rivals Interpublic, Omnicom and Publicis had already signalled that the year had ended well for the industry.WPP’s activities include advertising, market research and public relations. Its brands include Grey, JWT, Burson-Marsteller and TNS.In the last three months of 2010, it said year-on-year sales growth was 8.5 per cent on a like-for-like basis that excluded the effect of acquisitions and currency fluctuations.The figure, which compared with 7.5 per cent in the third quarter, was the strongest since the fourth quarter of 2000 and reflected faster growth in WPP’s UK businesses as well as robustness in the US.WPP said the momentum had rolled into 2011, with like-for-like sales up more than 8 per cent in January.Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, added that its emerging markets activities had started to grow faster than its US and UK businesses in the early weeks of 2011.For 2010 as a whole, WPP posted sales of £9.3bn, up 7 per cent on 2009, or 5.3 per cent on a like-for-like basis. The company said it was budgeting for about 5 per cent like-for-like sales growth in 2011.During the second half of the year, the company said it had returned to the levels of profitability it had enjoyed before the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Annual earnings per share were 45.9p on a diluted basis, an increase of 30 per cent. A second interim dividend of 11.82p has been declared, making a total of 17.79p for the year, an increase of 15 per cent.WPP said it would be increasing its target dividend pay-out ratio from about 30 per cent of post-tax profits to about 40 per cent over the medium term.Sir Martin said: “In a low interest rate world, institutions seem to be more focused on dividends …rather than share buy-backs.”Investec, a broker that has a buy recommendation on WPP shares, said the results appeared slightly better than it had forecast.Shares in the company, which had climbed over the past month, fell 1.8 per cent to 821½p in early morning trading in London on Friday.
127;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-02-25T19:21:17Z;Interpublic resumes payouts as revenues leap;;Interpublic, the marketing services group which owns McCann Erickson and other agencies, has reinstated its dividend after eight years, sending its shares 11 per cent higher in early New York trading.Fourth-quarter revenues at Interpublic came in ahead of analysts’ expectations, providing further evidence of the ad market’s recovery after similar outperformance from Publicis and Omnicom.Interpublic is also beginning a $300m share repurchase programme.“2010 was significant in that we put our company back on the track of competitive organic revenue growth and margin expansion that we had established before the recession hit the marketing services sector in 2009,” said Michael Roth, chief executive.“It’s clear that marketers are leaning forward and looking to us to help them grow. This gives us greater confidence that they will maintain or increase their levels of spend in 2011… The dividend and share repurchase programs we are announcing today signal our confidence in our ability build on this progress.”Mr Roth added that like-for-like revenue growth of 4 to 5 per cent was “a reasonable outlook” for 2011.Agencies across the advertising industry will find it tough to repeat their strong performances in 2010, when sales rebounded much faster than expected after revenues plummeted in 2009.Full-year revenues at Interpublic grew 7.0 per cent, after stripping out the effects of acquisition and currency fluctuations, to $6.53bn. Fourth-quarter organic revenue growth was 11.2 per cent, with a particularly strong performance in the US, which makes up around half of IPG’s business.“It’s clear that the business ended the year on a strong note,” Mr Roth told analysts.As in all previous quarters of 2010, contributions to our growth came from an extremely broad range of the portfolio.Advertisers in most of the biggest-spending industries – including automotive, retail, financial services and packaged goods- increased their marketing by double-digit percentages, with the UK, China and Brazil among the best performing regions outside the US.Net income in 2010 rose 40 per cent to $222.8m, with earnings up 52 per cent to $0.41.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said that IPG’s results beat its expectations in revenues but was below its forecasts at the margin level, due to office and general expenses. “The key leverage cost area, salaries and services, was in-line, which suggests margin expansion expectations going forward are appropriate,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients.“We like [Interpublic’s] balance between buybacks and dividends, and believe that a recurring and growing dividend can bring new investors into the name for the first time.”
128;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-02-16T07:51:13Z;Omnicom heralds advertising acceleration;;Omnicom said the fourth quarter was its strongest of 2010, with the advertising group reporting a “significant improvement” – confirming the recent acceleration in advertising spending flagged by rival Publicis.Like-for-like revenues grew 10 per cent at Omnicom, which owns advertising agencies such as DDB and BBDO. John Wren, chief executive, said a 12.7 per cent improvement in organic revenues in the US was ahead of expectations.Full-year revenues increased by 6.4 per cent to $12.5bn, with net income up 4.4 per cent to $827.7m.“Over the course of 2010, we have seen a steady increase in the number of clients around the world who are again investing at their own growth,” Mr Wren said. “At this point we expect growth in 2011 to return to normal levels.”The growth forecast would be the equivalent of outpacing global gross domestic product growth by 100 to 200 basis points, he added.“2010 was a great year,” Mr Wren said. “We don’t have a full analysis yet as to the strength in the fourth quarter – as to whether some of it was due to comps [comparators], some of it due to clients with budgets wanting to spend the money to increase their market share or increase performance.“At this point, until we see evidence to the contrary, we really fully expect to go back to what we can expect normally from a historic point of view.”Underlining that confidence, Omnicom’s board has approved a 25 per cent increase in dividend pay-out.Client wins in the fourth quarter included GSK, J&J baby products, the Gap and BMW. Technology and financial services companies were among its biggest -pending clients.Last week, Publicis, which owns Saatchi & Saatchi and ZenithOptimedia, reported organic revenue growth of 12.5 per cent in the fourth quarter.Omnicom has made several acquisitions in recent months, including Clemenger, an Australian agency, and Communispace, an online market researcher. But Mr Wren insisted: “We are not on a spree by any standards.”The group has been less acquisitive than rivals such as WPP and Publicis in recent years. After announcing a partnership in online media trading with Google last year, further partnerships with Microsoft and Yahoo will be announced soon, Mr Wren said.Omnicom has pledged to return its margins to 2007 levels by 2012.
129;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2011-02-10T17:38:34Z;Strong finish to 2010 for Publicis ad agencies;;Publicis Groupe set a strong pace for the advertising agency groups’ results season by reporting fourth-quarter results ahead of market expectations.Revenues in the last three months of 2010 rose by 12.5 per cent on a like-for-like basis, stripping out the effects of acquisitions and currency fluctuations, making it Publicis’s strongest quarter of the year in spite of concerns that macroeconomic uncertainty might hit advertising spending before Christmas.Full-year revenues rose by 8.3 per cent on the same basis to €5.4bn, with net income up 30.5 per cent to €526m. The agency group, which owns Saatchi & Saatchi, ZenithOptimedia and Razorfish, said operating margins rose by 80 basis points to 15.8 per cent in 2010 compared with the prior year.Shares in Publicis rose about 4 per cent to €40.56 on the results, which also lifted its rivals Omnicom and WPP’s shares by about 1 per cent, against a broadly lower market. Omnicom will publish its fourth-quarter financials next week, with WPP to follow in early March.Maurice Lévy, chief executive of Publicis, told the FT that new business wins in the third quarter, which had a high component of digital advertising, delivered revenues faster than expected while the fourth quarter had also seen several “one-off” contracts.“We also had a good economical climate which has helped some of our clients to spend more money during the fourth quarter, to win market share and finish the year with good growth,” he said.France and the US were particularly strong performers for Publicis, with advertisers from technology, media and telecoms, automotive and financial services industries increasing their spending the most.Publicis’ figures will bolster confidence in the advertising market as analysts question whether 2010’s unexpectedly strong recovery can be maintained into 2011.Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, twice lifted growth expectations for the company in November. TV advertising slots on the recent Super Bowl fetched up to $3m for 30 seconds, with the most expensive matching 2009’s peak in prices.Although Mr Lévy said that he expected Publicis’ revenue growth rate to outperform the market in 2011, he did not say whether 2010’s growth could be bettered.“I think that beginning of the year should be slightly better than the second half but who knows. We are loaded with so many uncertainties that I have to be cautious,” he said.Over the next few years, the company’s margins could exceed previous highs of 17 to 18 per cent, he said. “I believe the margin can go much above this. If I look at the future and we find the right combination of various parts of the group we can plan for something which is above 20 per cent. Not immediately, it will take a few years, but this is not something which is impossible.”To accelerate growth, Publicis has set a new target of deriving 35 per cent of sales from digital advertising and marketing, up from 28 per cent today, and 30 per cent from high-growth markets, such as China and Brazil, up from 22.7 per cent now.“If we want to take maximum advantage of the growth in China we need to make some acquisitions,” he said, adding that healthcare and public relations were of particular interest, as well as deals in regions of China where Publicis has no presence today.After finishing 2010 in a net cash positive position, Publicis has €4.3bn available in cash and committed debt facilities. It plans to hold on to about €750m until next year in case Dentsu, a Japanese agency group, decides to sell its 11 per cent stake in Publicis. Dentsu sold down some of its holding in May last year. Publicis bought the shares and cancelled them to avoid diluting other shareholders.Analysts at RBS said that Publicis’ shares have underperformed in the year to date. “We believe 2011will be another strong year but we also see scope for late-cycle cost inflation,” RBS said in a note to clients on Thursday.Publicis plans to announce a “new initiative” on February 21, Mr Lévy said, without giving further details.
130;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-12-29T21:07:57Z;WPP closes in on Blue State Digital purchase;;WPP, the world’s largest marketing holding company, is close to acquiring the digital agency that led Barack Obama’s groundbreaking online fundraising campaign in the 2008 US presidential election.Blue State Digital became one of the most prominent digital and social media agencies during the Obama for America campaign, reporting revenues for 2009 of $12.8m and gross assets at the end of last year of $3m. Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive, declined to comment after Sky News first reported the talks, and Thomas Gensemer, managing partner of Blue State Digital, told the Financial Times: “We have no comment at this moment.”But WPP’s digital investment arm is understood to be close to announcing the acquisition of BSD’s entire US and UK operation, which employs 130 people in offices in Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Boston and London. If concluded, the deal would mark the latest in a string of small acquisitions for WPP, whose TNS research company on Wednesday announced the purchase of a majority stake in Research and Marketing Services, the largest custom research agency in west and central Africa.Sir Martin has said, however, that WPP’s spending on acquisitions will rise only slightly from 2010’s £100m level, citing concerns about the price digital agencies are demanding.John Wren, chief executive of Omnicom, also voiced caution about digital acquisitions in an FT interview this week, saying that his company would invest in training its employees and seek digital partnerships in 2011 rather than large acquisitions.Blue State Digital specialises in online fundraising, advocacy, social networking and “constituency development”, and claims to have raised more than $800m in contributions since its foundation in 2004.Its clients include the Democratic National Committee, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, HBO, AT&T, the Unite and Teamsters unions and campaigns including Walmart Watch and the It Gets Better anti-bullying project.The proposed deal comes as spending on digital media continues to climb. A study by eMarketer predicted this month that double-digit annual gains would take digital media from 15.3 per cent of total US ad spending in 2010 to 21.5 per cent by 2014.BDO last month reported that three-quarters of US retailers had included social networking in their holiday marketing strategy, up from half in 2009.
131;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-12-28T00:02:10Z;Wren sceptical of rivals’ digital strategies;;"As advertising agencies grapple with the constantly changing world of digital media and technology, the industry speaks with one voice.Every agency is now a digital agency, their leaders will proclaim, with geeks and TV gurus working hand in glove.In an industry that exists on branding and selling an image, judging which agencies are truly “integrated” can be a challenge for clients and investors alike.To the outsider, WPP and Publicis have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on splashy digital acquisitions while their US rival, Omnicom, has held back, preferring “organic” growth.Like its rivals, Omnicom turned in a much-improved performance in 2010 versus 2009. But its third-quarter like-for-like revenue growth of 6.9 per cent trailed WPP’s 7.5 per cent and Publicis’ 9.2 per cent, in spite of its weighting towards the US, the quickest of the leading advertising markets to recover.Nonetheless, investors seem to prefer it; on Deutsche Bank’s 2010 forecasts, Omnicom’s shares trade at a higher earnings multiple than its two largest rivals.Media agencies expect full-year growth in 2010’s global ad spend of between 3.9 per cent and 5.9 per cent, with slightly slower growth forecast for next year.Even if that has handed a PR advantage to his rivals’ claims of digital capabilities, John Wren, Omnicom chief executive, does not apologise for the path his firm has taken.He says: “My competitors have put bigger stakes in the ground by saying ‘we are going to take the shareholders’ money and invest huge chunks of it in certain areas’, and then they are going to figure out how that is best utilised by their clients and their employees, when the environment is changing at speed.“There are more people outside the advertising industry creating new technologies and devices than there are who work in the advertising industry today. So some of this is a bit short-sighted, I think, if you are going to be in competition with that industry which is larger than you and isn’t the focus of what your people are good at.”Instead of buying big new companies, Omnicom is planning to invest in internal training of its existing employees.It will also unveil a series of digital media and technology partnerships in 2011 that will align it with leaders of innovation, without the cost and risk of an acquisition.WPP’s deal spree – concluding with its 2008 acquisition of Taylor Nelson Sofres, a market researcher – gave it the bulk to take over the top spot in holding company rankings from Omnicom.Becoming the biggest is a source of considerable pride for Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive. But if Mr Wren – who helped create Omnicom from the merger of BBDO and DDB in 1986 before becoming its chief executive in 1997 – was upset to be dethroned as the king of adland, he covers it well.He admits Omnicom’s ambition is to be the “dominant player globally” in the ad market but says that being the largest by revenue has “never been a governing rule or important to me” – although he adds with a smile: “That’s easier to say now I’m no longer the biggest.”Mr Wren has no compunction in closing or selling parts of the business that “we don’t think we’ll get digital enough fast enough”.Even as he strives to make his business more internet-savvy, he acknowledges that some parts of the online advertising world are tricky for his agencies to make money from.Advertising space on social media such as Facebook is not yet “fully priced”, he says.“I’m not sure that Facebook can get what you’d get for being first on top of a search page,” he muses, comparing the cost of ads on the world’s biggest social network to Google’s lucrative AdWords.“We know it’s important; I don’t know that anybody knows how to value it in the same way you would value a traditional TV audience. But if that medium isn’t fairly paid, chances are we’re doing a lot of work that we are not 100 per cent fairly paid for either – but we have to do the work nonetheless.”Mr Wren says that sort of uncertainty is something agencies have to get used to. “That is just part of this constant state of change that we are in – it’s just part of the new environment.”"
132;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-12-27T22:51:23Z;Omnicom looks for digital partners;;Omnicom is to accelerate its push into digital media and marketing in 2011 by focusing on new partnerships with technology companies and large-scale training for its staff.John Wren, chief executive, said the advertising group planned to introduce a technical education programme for all its 63,000 employees to teach them the ways of Google, Facebook and other online media.The Madison Avenue group, the second largest by revenues, is also appointing privacy officers in more agencies to ensure the responsible use of data collected from internet advertising.Omnicom is eschewing the big digital acquisitions made by rivals such as WPP and Publicis in recent years.The group, which has largely avoided large purchases since the mid-1990s, is instead embarking on a string of partnership agreements with technology companies.Mr Wren said: “I don’t need to go out and buy an ad exchange or try to develop my own ad exchange in competition with the Googles of the world.“I can find a very fair ground for my clients by negotiating the proper deals with those people.”A possible template for such partnerships will be the deal Omnicom struck last summer with Google, agreeing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars via the technology company’s display advertising exchange.Big acquisitions such as 24/7 Real Media, Digitas and Razorfish have allowed rivals WPP and Publicis to claim they generate a larger share of their revenues from digital services than Omnicom.But Mr Wren insisted no such deal was on his agenda in 2011, in spite of renewing a $2bn revolving credit facility in December, with the option of an additional $500m. Available funds could be put towards share buy-backs or dividend increases.Instead, Omnicom plans to dispose of lower margin, slow-growth businesses that do not fit into its new digital profile.
133;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
134;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-11-24T19:57:10Z;Matthew Freud seeks break from Publicis;;Matthew Freud, one of the best-known figures in Britain’s public relations industry, is making a break for independence from Publicis, the French communications group that bought a 50.1 per cent stake in his agency five years ago.Publicis and Freud have held talks to separate, according to people familiar with the matter.However, they said the parties remained far apart on the valuation of the business, the UK’s largest consumer PR agency with a client list that includes Asda, Sony and Nike.People close to Mr Freud said that he had become frustrated working within the Publicis group structure, adding the French company had not facilitated international expansion as much as he had hoped.A Publicis insider said that the French group been “completely hands-off”.“The only person he reports to is God,” the person said.Mr Freud sold 50.1 per cent of Freud Communications to Publicis under a deal that valued the whole company at €70m-€80m in the summer of 2005, around 10 to 11 times underlying earnings, according to people familiar with the situation at the time.Analysts estimate a PR agency might currently expect to fetch between nine and 12 times 2010 earnings.As most marketing companies suffered sharp declines in sales last year, Freud’s revenues rose 23 per cent to £33.0m, thanks to growth in Europe and the US, with pre-tax profits up 28 per cent to £6.7m.This year, the agency has won lucrative contracts with Bupa and the London 2012 Olympics.Mr Freud is one of London’s most high-profile PR figures. He is married to Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch. Close to leading members of the Conservative party including David Cameron, he hosts famed Christmas parties, attracting guests including Mick Jagger.Mr Freud has made similar bids for independence in the past. In 1994, Freud Communications was acquired by Abbott Mead Vickers, then an independent UK advertising agency. After AMV was acquired by Omnicom, the US marketing services group, Mr Freud and his management partners bought back the firm in 2001.He also owns stakes in M&C Saatchi and Engine Group, two of the UK’s leading independent advertising agency groups.Freud Communications and Publicis Groupe declined to comment.
135;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-10-29T16:07:08Z;US ad rebound spurs Interpublic;;The upswing in American advertising spending has carried Interpublic back into investment-grade status, after its third-quarter results beat expectations.Fitch, the ratings agency, upgraded Interpublic’s issuer default rating to BBB from BB+ on Friday, citing improved growth and careful balance-sheet management.The upgrade came as IPG, which owns agencies including McCann Worldgroup and Draftfcb, reported third-quarter revenues up 9.4 per cent to $1.56bn. Net income leapt 88 per cent to $45.3m, while earnings more than doubled to 9c per share.Michael Roth, chief executive of IPG, said the company would make good on its pledge to improve operating margins to greater than 8 per cent and return revenue growth to more competitive levels this year.“Clients’ liquidity is improving,” said Mr Roth. “We see solid but moderating growth for the balance of the year … The tone of the business as we look to 2011 remains solid.”Fitch said its upgrade reflected IPG’s “conservative financial management and its actions to both turn the company around between 2005 and 2008 and to weather the economic recession in 2009”.“Management has demonstrated its willingness and ability to achieve an investment-grade credit profile,” Fitch said.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said IPG’s revenue growth rate, which was unaided by any acquisitions, was “at the upper end of industry” comparators and comfortably beat consensus forecasts of about 7 per cent.The US, IPG’s largest market, grew at 9.9 per cent, in the third quarter, but international growth of 8.7 per cent – fuelled by emerging markets such as India and Brazil– was greater than analysts had expected.IPG’s shares rose 2.9 per cent to $10.72 by mid-morning trading in New York.Interpublic is just the latest agency group to beat market expectations, after rivals Publicis, Omnicom and WPP all turned in strong third-quarter results.But Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive, said the unexpectedly strong growth in the US media market would not last into 2011, calling the recovery a “dead cat bounce”, driven by the fiscal and monetary stimulus.“America has been behaving like an emerging market,” he said. “I can’t see America continuing to grow at 8 per cent for us against 4 per cent for the company [WPP] as a whole and [gross national product] at 2 per cent.”WPP had expected markets such as India, China and Brazil to drive a greater portion of its growth as the advertising market came out of recession.“The sobering thing about the results so far this year is the importance of America,” Sir Martin said. “The lesson is: never write it off.”WPP on Friday turned in its highest quarterly revenue growth in a decade, posting 7.5 per cent like-for-like growth in the third quarter.
136;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-10-27T11:49:18Z;WPP trumpets best trading in 10 years;;WPP had its best quarter for a decade in the three months to September, Sir Martin Sorrell has said, as marketing groups’ recovery continues apace.“Our organic growth rate in the third quarter will be the strongest growth for 10 years,” Sir Martin, WPP chief executive, told the World Retail Congress in Berlin on Tuesday. “We’ve seen sequential improvement – month-by-month improvement – through to September, with the exception of June.”WPP’s like-for-like revenue growth in the first nine months of the year was more than 4 per cent, he added. But Sir Martin warned that there remained considerable uncertainty about advertising spending in 2011, with the US unlikely to repeat the 8 per cent growth shown this year.His comments follow better-than-expected results from rivals Omnicom, Publicis and Havas last week, as analysts continue to upgrade forecasts for advertising spending.WPP and Interpublic will report their third-quarter results on Friday.Analysts at Citigroup said Sir Martin’s comments implied third-quarter growth of up to 8 per cent, ahead of its forecast of 6 per cent growth for WPP. Full-year growth could exceed WPP’s guidance of 4 per cent, Citi added.However, analysts at Jefferies warned that momentum was likely to moderate in the fourth quarter, as year-on-year comparisons become tougher for the advertising sector and the boost from events such as the football World Cup and the Shanghai Expo wanes.“Continuing unemployment issues and election uncertainty in the US suggest a more challenging environment in the year-end and possibly into 2011,” Jefferies said in a note to clients this week.Sir Martin told Reuters that growth in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa would pick up next year, creating a “rebalancing” after this year’s unexpectedly strong US media market.Jefferies estimates that WPP won net new business worth $1.3bn (£800m) in the third quarter, from clients including AB Inbev, GSK, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Communications. Though behind Publicis’ $2.7bn in third the quarter, such a performance would leave WPP well placed to turn in the industry’s leading average new business performance for the year.WPP’s shares fell 5½ p to 726½p in Wednesday morning trading in London.
137;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-10-19T18:19:09Z;Ad recovery beats expectations;;Global advertising spending is recovering more quickly than expected by big agencies ahead of the Christmas season.Strong third-quarter results for the industry are showing that investment by clients in branding and promotions has rebounded from a record low last year as companies strive to gain market share.Omnicom, the second-largest marketing group by revenues, on Tuesday reported like-for-like revenue growth of 6.7 per cent in the third quarter to $2.99bn, its strongest performance in the year to date.“In the US, every client I speak to seems to have a renewed focus on top-line growth,” said John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive. “While improvements in the economy are inconsistent from region to region, we have been pleasantly surprised by the recovery in the US and renewed strength in Western Europe.”Every major category of advertiser was spending more than last year, Mr Wren added, with the exception of travel and entertainment. The fourth quarter is looking “pretty strong”, Omnicom added, as the market was “definitely improving”, even though the recovery remained “fragile”.Car companies have been among the biggest spenders, with an 8 per cent increase in spending at Omnicom, which counts Chevrolet and Volkswagen among its clients.But other sectors have been less resilient, with pharmaceuticals and telecoms advertisers cutting spending this year, according to Nielsen, a market research company.Government spending has seen huge reductions in markets such as the UK, and analysts expect the growth rate to slow in the fourth quarter.Omnicom’s results follow similar improvement at Havas, a smaller rival, where like-for-like sales rose by 5.3 per cent to €368m ($507m) in the three months to September, compared with growth of 1.5 and 2.0 per cent in the first and second quarters respectively.On Monday, Publicis’ media agency, ZenithOptimedia, upgraded its 2010 forecasts for the fourth time after a “midyear surge”, predicting global growth in media spending of 4.8 per cent.Investment in advertising spending is recovering from a low base, as marketing activity is usually cut early as companies head into a downturn.Nonetheless, analysts say the resumption in spending is happening in advance of stronger evidence of a recovery in sales, as companies strive to rebuild their neglected brands.However, even as they rebuild their investment, agencies’ clients are driving a harder bargain as marketing services firms scramble for new business.Omnicom’s 5.4 per cent growth in net income and earnings of $0.57 were shy of some analysts’ expectations, even as it set out a new target to restore margins to 2007 levels by 2012.
138;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-09-14T19:24:32Z;DDB uses science to make ads catchy;;Faced with viewers who fast-forward ads and the many distractions provided by the internet, DDB, a large advertising group, is hoping the appliance of science will help make its ads more memorable.DDB’s London office has hired a “scientist in residence”, who will apply neuroscientific theory and psychological testing to its clients’ campaigns.Daniel Müllensiefen, a lecturer in psychology, music and computing at Goldsmiths, University of London, is also an expert in “earworms” – catchy, memorable tunes.Marketing services companies have long used focus groups and more recently incorporated theories of ethnography and behavioural economics to try to improve their campaigns.“We’ve always prided ourselves on understanding people,” said Sarah Carter, strategy director at DDB. “This will help us with the emotional side of advertising that tends to be overlooked by clients in favour of messages and more rational things.”Dr Müllensiefen will spend about a day a week at DDB, which is owned by Omnicom, in what the agency claims as a world first.“The main motivation for DDB is to have someone in-house where they can have an open chat about what new scientific methods [such as] brain imaging might mean for advertising,” he said.Rather than asking consumers directly what they think of a brand, Dr Müllensiefen plans to run “implicit attitude tests” that glean information from eye movements or reaction times.The study, found tunes with low complexity and big intervals between notes tend to be more catchy.
139;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-08-31T20:10:04Z;Havas primed to pursue new deals;;Improved profitability at Havas will act as a springboard to bigger acquisitions by the advertising group after a dealmaking hiatus of several years.Vincent Bolloré, the chairman, who has set a target of increasing turnover by a third over the next two years, said: “Now the financial situation allows Havas to come back to acquisitions.“It doesn’t mean we want to make one big shot but some different acquisitions in different countries.”Net income at Havas, which owns agencies including Euro RSCG and MPG, rose 22.5 per cent in the first half of 2010 compared with the same period last year, returning profits to the pre-recession level of €49m ($62m). Average net debt in the period was half 2009’s equivalent.However, Havas’s organic revenue growth in the first half, up 1.8 per cent to €729m, lagged behind larger rivals such as Omnicom, Publicis and WPP.Mr Bolloré said: “The financial structure is very healthy. The question now is growth. We have been very reasonable in the past three or four years. Of course we will try to be a little more aggressive in the next two years.”Mr Bolloré attributed Havas’s below-average growth rate to the loss of a large contract with Carrefour, and its relative lack of exposure to Asia.He said valuations were “expensive and volatile” both in Asia and in digital advertising, the areas most frequently targeted for deals by rival groups, but did not rule out purchases in these areas.Havas would be opportunist in its approach to acquisitions, with David Jones, the global chief executive of Euro RSCG, and his team going “country by country” to find a “good price and interesting companies”.By ruling out a “big shot” acquisition, Mr Bolloré implied that the long-rumoured combination of Havas, in which he is a 33 per cent shareholder, with UK-based Aegis, where he holds 29.9 per cent, was an unlikely application of the €1.5bn to €2bn that is available to Havas in cash and credit loans.Aegis’s market capitalisation stands at about £1.3bn ($1.9bn), with its shares down 6.5 per cent in the year to date in spite of a broader advertising recovery, as hopes of a bid have waned.Mr Bolloré said he was “not unhappy” as an Aegis shareholder, reiterating praise for John Napier, its chairman, but saying he had “never talked directly” to Jerry Buhlmann, who was appointed chief executive this year.He noted Aegis’s plans to increase its own pace of acquisitions.Contrasting his interests in the two companies, he said Havas was “really a part of us [the Bolloré ­family]” but Aegis was a “financial investment …We are pretty far from them.”
140;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-08-31T17:29:32Z;M&A fever lifts the tempo in Brazil;;When a Brazilian advertising executive read that Publicis of France, the world’s third-biggest advertising group, was preparing to take a stake in local agency Talent that valued it at R$350m ($199m), he turned to his wife and said: “I think we’re rich”.Many would say the executive – one of the biggest names in the industry – was rich already. But the high value put on Talent, about seven times annual revenues, is further evidence of a scramble among big international groups to grab a piece of the Brazilian market – or the part of it that is still locally owned.The industry is buzzing with rumours of other possible deals. Marcio Oliveira, vice-president of operations at Lew’Lara\TBWA, says: “There are just a few agencies left that are 100 per cent local and they are being visited all the time by the world’s big communication groups, such as Omnicom, Havas, WPP and Publicis”.His agency was formerly Lew’Lara, but was itself renamed after TBWA, part of the Omnicom group, bought it three years ago.This is not the first time takeover fever has swept Brazil’s advertising industry, widely recognised as one of the most dynamic and creative in the world.In the early 1990s, foreign groups paid huge multiples to enter what even then was one of the few growth markets around.Fernanda Romano, a Brazilian who is global creative director for digital advertising at Euro RSCG in London, says: “They made unbelievable deals. They probably paid 10 times earnings. But the world has changed. Right now the standard would be three times, maybe five times.”The Talent deal suggests multiples are on the rise again. The 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics will both be held in Brazil, drawing enormous global audiences.Brazil’s robust economy, expected to grow by 7 per cent this year, is being driven by domestic consumption, as millions of people emerge from poverty to join the consumer classes.With many developed markets facing stagnation, Brazil is once again an obvious choice for expansion.A person close to Talent says another motive for the deal is to take advantage of Brazilian companies’ increasing overseas expansion.A host of big companies has made recent overseas acquisitions, including food processors Brasil Foods and JBS Friboi, banks such as Itaú Unibanco and Banco do Brasil, and raw materials groups such as Vale in mining, Gerdau in steel and Votorantim in cement.“Brazilian brands are going international and Talent will service its Brazilian clients in overseas markets,” the person says.Lord Bell, chairman of Chime Communications, a UK-based public relations and sports marketing business, says he is looking for partners in Brazil ahead of the World Cup and the Olympics.“Brazilian brands will get involved in the [events] and will become [international] because of the global watch,” he says.Márcio Santoro, co-president of Agência Africa says being acquired by big foreign companies can help “because they can use a worldwide network to help them.“For example, they can create the Santander campaign in Brazil [recently won by Talent] and bring it to other countries, with help from the network.”Africa is owned by Grupo ABC, one of the few remaining large, purely Brazilian-owned advertising groups, and one of the few to take Brazilian brands abroad without outside help.Mr de Oliveira at Lew’Lara\TBWA says his company is creating Visa’s global campaign for its sponsorship of Fifa events in Brazil, including the World Cup, which will be exported abroad.He says: “Two or three years ago, it would have been impossible to find companies that were considering Brazil the global hub for clients.”Such trends are driving rapid expansion of advertising spending. According to Carat, a media services agency, spending in Brazil will increase by 12.7 per cent in 2010 and by 14.4 per cent in 2011, rivalled only by China and Russia among leading markets.But Euro RSCG’s Ms Romano says numbers are not all that matter. “China, India and Russia are all difficult to do business in, culturally. Brazilians are easy.“The advertising culture in Brazil is more similar to the US – anything goes, people are more open …It’s a perfect alignment of the stars. It makes Brazil a very interesting target.”

The pace of revenue growth improved from 1 per cent in the first quarter to 5 per cent in the second. “We have a more sustained period of recovery,” said Mr Buhlmann.The 6.8 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 1.025p per share was an “important message and a clear sign” of growing confidence, he added, in spite of economic uncertainty and limited visibility.Underlying that confidence, Carat, Aegis’ media-buying unit, raised its 2010 forecast for global advertising spending by 1 percentage point to 3.9 per cent, rising to 4.7 per cent next year. Much of that growth is expected to come from Asia, central and eastern Europe and Latin America.First-half sales at Aegis Media were flat in the “challenging” Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, adjusted for exchange rate changes, but saw growth of 3.1 per cent in the Americas and 18.4 per cent in Asia Pacific. Client wins included Deutsche Bank, China Telecom and Kraft-Cadbury.Synovate, Aegis’ market research unit, returned to profitability, with revenues up 1.3 per cent at constant currencies, “well ahead” of Aegis’ own expectations.Shares rose 0.3p to 111.7p.● FT CommentAegis’ results affirm advertising agencies’ return to confidence, following im-proving results at larger rivals WPP, Publicis, Omnicom and Interpublic in recent weeks. But Aegis’ shares have underperformed the six largest western agency groups, including Havas, which like Aegis counts French industrialist Vincent Bolloré as a significant shareholder. Mr Bolloré recently said he was “happy” with Aegis but described it as a “financial investment”, unlike Havas, which is “a part of my blood now”. That will not bolster investors’ hopes for the long-awaited merger of Aegis and Havas, and accordingly Aegis has lost its takeover premium, trading in line with the sector on a 2011 p/e ratio of 11 times.
142;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-08-24T19:55:43Z;WPP raises forecasts as advertising rebounds;;A rapid rebound in advertising in North America and on television that surprised even Sir Martin Sorrell on Tuesday pushed WPP, the world’s largest marketing services group, to raise its earnings guidance for the year.WPP’s chief executive said the group was “aiming” to return to 2008’s absolute level of earnings per share this year, sooner than expected.After budgeting for flat sales in 2010 compared with last year, WPP now expects the second quarter’s 4 per cent growth rate to hold for the remainder of the year.“We were clearly too optimistic in 2009 and clearly we’ve been too pessimistic, at least so far, in 2010,” Sir Martin said. “We have seen strong growth in the second quarter, particularly driven by America and traditional advertising biting back.”Sir Martin was forced to revise his adopted analogy of a “LUV”-shaped recovery, which predicted stagnation in western Europe, eventual recovery in the US and a sharp upswing in emerging economies.Sir Martin said he now expected a “LuVVy-shaped” profile, after WPP’s North American business posted 8 per cent like-for-like revenue growth in the second quarter.Group like-for-like sales rose 2.5 per cent to £4.4bn in the six months to June 30, with pre-tax profits up 36 per cent to £243.9m. WPP recommended an interim dividend rise of 15 per cent to 5.97p.WPP’s results follow similar evidence of recovery from rivals including Publicis, Omnicom and Interpublic.However, Sir Martin warned of a “twilight zone” of lingering uncertainty among WPP clients, due to macroeconomic concerns, even though he believed that the global economy would avoid a “double-dip” recession.“When people say we are out of the recession, I don’t think that’s quite right,” he said. “CEOs are setting expectations lower – because of these uncertainties, they don’t want to over-commit themselves.”This meant that WPP would face a “slog” with “slower rates of growth but some mild expansion” in revenues in the coming months.Shares in the company fell almost 4 per cent to 644½p in London trading, after growth of 8.5 per cent over the past six months.Analysts at Citigroup attributed the drop to a slight disappointment on WPP’s operating margins, of 10.3 per cent, as the company began to hire again after radical headcount reduction last year.“Despite stronger topline growth at Advertising and Media and Consumer Insight, margins were lower than expected at both divisions,” said Citigroup’s Tom Singlehurst.Sir Martin said WPP saw a healthy pipeline of small and medium-sized acquisitions, even though valuations among US digital agencies have become “very aggressive”, with some “mad scrambles” in Brazil and China also pushing up prices.
143;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-08-15T22:16:21Z;Interpublic chief remains pragmatic;;"For all the stress and strain that marketing cuts have placed on advertising agencies in the past two years, adland remains a creative and colourful place.Even the men running the big agency holding companies – such as WPP’s Sir Martin Sorrell or Publicis’ Maurice Levy – set aside their more operational backgrounds to enliven earnings calls with economic soothsaying or witty banter with analysts.But for Michael Roth, chief executive of Interpublic, the past five years have left little scope for jollity. He joined IPG – the world’s fourth-largest advertising group by sales, after being overtaken by Publicis last year – in 2005.The group was grappling with accounting problems, the result of rapid growth and an over-ambitious acquisition spree.Mr Roth brought the company back from the brink of debt default and stock market delisting, returned it to steady growth and made some headway on profitability – only to run headlong into the recession.So while Sir Martin ponders the next slogan to describe the shape of the recovery, Mr Roth is just keeping his fingers crossed that it lasts. “Having experienced what hit us in 2009 and the end of 2008, I don’t want to go through that again.”Profitability still lags way behind the industry average. For many analysts, that makes IPG the most compelling story in the agency world as revenues recover and operational gearing kicks in.The share price suggests investors are starting to buy into the recovery story. Taken over a five-year view, IPG has been the worst investment of the big six agency groups; over the past six months, it has outperformed them all. Last month’s second-quarter results firmed IPG’s place in the broader advertising recovery.Organic revenues rose 8.5 per cent, storming past analysts’ expectations of about 2 per cent growth.Pushing beyond the current target of “better than 8 per cent” operating margins is largely a matter of patience, Mr Roth says.“We have spent a lot of time fixing our company and up until the recession we were well on track to achieve those targets we had stated,” he says. “We took the period of time in between to focus more on costs and what our staffing requirements are and where our people are. We are back on track for sure in terms of achieving those type of targets. The issue of whether it occurs in 2011, 2012 or 2013 is a macroeconomic issue.”The economy may still be “skittish”, Mr Roth says, but IPG is finally ready for the rebound.“I’m very pleased with the turnround of media [planning and buying],” he says. “The creative part of our business needs to be bolstered and we are doing that . . . The opportunity is getting the media and creative working together.”Recently, he has merged Deutsche with Lowe in the US and acquired DLKW, a London creative agency, to boost European operations.But Mr Roth does not seem ready to accelerate the turnround with a big strategic move. “I don’t see that many big deals out there,” he says, aside from the odd fill-in deal or partnership.Havas and Aegis, the smallest of the big six, are the favourite subjects of gossip but IPG is regularly tipped as a target, particularly for Publicis.“On paper there is some logic to a transaction,” Mr Roth says of a combination with Publicis, “given our client base and things like that. But there is no compelling reason for it. We don’t need the capital, we don’t need the areas of expertise and he’s [Mr Levy] not about to pay an exorbitant price that would cause us to look at it.”The finger-pointing and whispering of Soho and Madison Avenue is not a game he is keen to play.“I don’t talk about other businesses. I would say John Wren [Omnicom’s chief executive] and I are more similar in that regard than Maurice and Martin,” he says. “I don’t make it about me, I make it about our agencies.”"
144;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-07-29T18:03:19Z;Rebound in sales and profits at ad groups;;Advertising agencies reported a strong rebound in sales and profitability in the second quarter, with both Interpublic and Publicis raising forecasts and beating market expectations.Publicis reported like-for-like revenue growth of 7.1 per cent in the second quarter, with analysts hailing a “huge beat” from Inter­public, with 8.5 per cent growth in the period.“The improvement relative to last year is significant, as is the sequential change from the first quarter,” said Michael Roth, IPG’s chief executive. Shares in the company rose by more than 8 per cent in New York.“All the major client segments we track are up for the quarter and the [first] half,” he added, with the exception of technology, where IPG suffered client losses.The figures confirm a positive trend set last week by Omnicom, the second-largest agency group by revenues, which also outperformed expectations with 6 per cent growth.A return to spending from automotive, retail and financial services customers has boosted the recovery, as did the football World Cup.ZenithOptimedia, Publicis’s media agency, recently raised its forecast for global advertising spending from 2.2 to 3.5 per cent.Maurice Levy, Publicis chief executive, raised operating margin guidance for the year, saying it would reach at least 15 per cent, even as Publicis ended its hiring and salary freeze. Mr Roth was also more confident of beating an 8 per cent margin target at IPG.About 26 of Publicis’s 30 largest clients increased their spending in the period and media pricing was improving, particularly in television. Mr Levy said its largest markets were performing well, compensating for underperformance in Germany and Japan.“France and the UK …are posting very, very good growth and very healthy growth,” said Mr Levy. “This has nothing to do with the comparable basis, this is purely the result of the increase in spending from our clients, growth in new activities and digital operations, and new business. We do believe this will continue.”In another sign of industry confidence, Aegis Group on Thursday bid £207m ($323m) for Mitchell Communication Group, an Australian rival. Analysts expect Aegis and WPP, the world’s largest ad group, to maintain the positive trend when they report their interim results next month.Publicis shares closed 1 per cent higher in Paris, with WPP up 1.5 per cent and Aegis up 2.1 per cent in London.“We knew the second quarter was going to be good – it’s turned out to be very good,” said Anthony de Larrinaga, analyst at Jefferies. “The swing factor against my expectations has been the strength of the growth out of the US.”But he said macro­economic factors and the waning of easier comparatives made the fourth quarter more difficult to judge.
145;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-07-29T12:36:49Z;Aegis bids for Australian agency;;"Aegis Group is to make its largest acquisition for a decade, bidding about £207m for Mitchell Communication Group, Australia’s largest media-buying agency.The deal, which has been recommended by Mitchells’ board and its largest shareholder, fulfils a promise in March by Jerry Buhlmann, chief executive of Aegis, to return to substantial acquisitions.“It very much fits our strategic objectives around media, around digital and around geography,” Mr Buhlmann told the Financial Times.The move comes amid rising confidence among advertising agency groups, with Aegis’s larger rivals Omnicom and Publicis recently reporting strong trading in the first half of the year.Mr Buhlmann declined to comment on current trading ahead of Aegis’ interim results but said that he expected Carat, the group’s media agency, to raise its forecasts for advertising spending next month.Aegis shares rose 1.6 per cent to 118.9p around midday in London.Buying Mitchells will move Aegis from fifth to third in the rankings of media agencies by billings in Asia Pacific, more than doubling its revenues in the fastest-growth region for advertising spending.In January Aegis formed a joint venture with Charm Communications of China in which it also took a 17.7 per cent stake.“Our business is performing exceptionally well in China,” Mr Buhlmann said.Pending court and shareholder approval, Aegis’s offer values Mitchells at a 15.4 per cent premium to the Australian company’s closing price on Thursday, or a third higher than its average trading price over the past six months.Mitchells shareholders will be offered the choice of accepting the offer in either cash or Aegis shares via a scheme of arrangement. Existing Aegis shareholders – the largest of whom is Vincent Bolloré, chairman of rival Havas – will face maximum dilution of 10 per cent.Harold Mitchell, executive chairman of the Australian company, will accept Aegis shares for his 30 per cent stake, becoming a 4 per cent shareholder in the group. Mr Mitchell, who will lead Aegis’s Asia-Pacific operations, has pledged not to sell more than 15 per cent of those shares for at least 24 months.Aegis will fund the cash component of the deal from its own resources, having raised $225m in a US private placing and £190.6m in a convertible bond over the past nine months. The company has also extended for a further five years its revolving credit facility, which had been due for renewal next June, leaving plenty of capacity for further acquisitions.Mitchells generated sales of A$225.2m (£128.8m) in the year to June 30, 2009, more than half of which came from digital advertising; Aegis reported revenues of £1.35bn in the year to December 31.Aegis was advised by Greenhill, Slaughter and May and Freehills. Mitchell was advised by ANZ Mergers and Acquisitions and Mallesons Stephen Jaques."
146;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-06-16T00:16:34Z;Advertising: Digital agencies add to region’s marketing mix;;Tthe recent launch of Wenlock and Mandeville, the two mascots for London’s 2012 Olympics, gives a clue as to why the north-west can claim to be the UK’s biggest hub for advertising and marketing outside London.While much of the high-profile design work was done by Iris, a fast growing London-based creative agency, and Beijing’s CG Crystal, a leading digital media company, McCann Manchester, the north-west’s biggest advertising agency, played an important behind the-scenes role.Over the next couple of years Wenlock and Mande­ville will be going on a digital tour to promote the Olympic and Paralympic games.McCann Manchester will be helping them interact with their fans through a social networking platform that has been built with the aid of Cisco, the US networking group.“These two mascots have amazing and unique characteristics and we’re extremely proud to be the digital guardians who will support their online adventures over the next two years,” Sue Little, chief executive of McCann Manchester, said in a recent interview with How-Do, the north-west media website.McCann, which is part of Interpublic, the US advertising and marketing services giant, is one of the mainstays of a north-west advertising cluster that includes branches of most of the global agencies such as CheethamBell JWT (WPP), and TBWA (Omnicom), as well as the main media buyers such as Mediaedge, Media­Vest, and PHD North.It is also home to a growing number of digital agencies. Probably the most successful is Manchester’s Code Computer Love, which has created marketing strategies and websites for top UK brand names ranging from HMV and PZ Cussons to Waterstones.Some of the digital newcomers, such as Rippleffect, have already been swallowed up by bigger quoted media groups, in this case Trinity Mirror.Others, such as Flame Digital and Idaho, have had their problems. But several other independents, such as MagneticNorth, an adviser to blue-chip clients such as Kellogg’s and Sony Music, go from strength to strength.According to a recent How-Do report on the north-west’s advertising industry, there are 500 advertising businesses and consultancies in the region, and more than half of these employ less than five staff. Only six have more than 200 staff.Fudge, a Bolton-based digital agency set up by David Eccles 10 years ago, is typical of the growing number of smaller success stories in the region’s highly fragmented advertising and marketing sector.Employing just 14 staff, it counts Orange among its clients, and often finds itself working with bigger agencies on projects in New York and Paris.“We often work with people we have never met,” says Mr Eccles. “Conversations can start via e-mail, phone or even Twitter. The days when you had to have a physical presence [overseas] are long gone.”Fudge is undaunted by the scale of the competition from London-based agencies. Roughly half its business already comes from outside the north-west, and it is picking up an increasing amount from London and overseas.The agency is one of the survivors in a sector which has probably shed 800 jobs in the recession. The recent results of the handful of quoted marketing services companies with interests in the north-west underlines the difficult times facing many agencies in the region.Media Square, which moved its head office from Macclesfield to London at the end of last year, lost £21m ($31m) in its last financial year and its workforce has more than halved to 730.Hasgrove, which owns Manchester agencies such as Amaze, Odyssey and The Chase, reported a two-thirds drop in its 2009 pre-tax profits, to £1.47m.Charlotte Thompson, business development director of BJL, an independent Manchester agency whose clients include Hilton hotels and Asda, remains upbeat about the longer-term prospects for the region’s advertising sector.She highlights recent examples of north-west agencies winning against strong London competition – TBWA and The Co-operative Group and BJL and Typhoo tea.“It was a commonly held view that the capital had the best talent, which is why the top brands went there,” says Ms Thompson.But she sees signs this is changing, and a regional model is emerging that is much more like the US, with New York, Chicago and other regional centres boasting strong creative reputations and clients.Scott McCubbin, of design agency Glorious Creative, agrees. “When national brands such as HMV, Waterstones and British Airways are appointing north-west agencies, you have to view that as a breakthrough,” he says.Another sign of Manchester’s renaissance as an advertising and marketing hub is the imminent relaunch of the 90-year-old Manchester Publicity Association (MPA), chaired by Mike Perls, founder of MC2, a public relations and marketing services agency.He wants to increase the MPA’s membership fivefold to 4,000 by the year-end, and create an organisation that can champion the north-west on a regional, national and global scale.Only by getting all the various strands of the north-west media and creative businesses talking and working together can the region’s media industries really take off, says Mr Perls.
147;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-06-07T21:52:45Z;General Motors: the marques man;The US’s biggest carmaker is shedding its bureaucratic ways;It was December 7 and a late autumn Monday morning in Detroit. Ed Whitacre, installed by President Barack Obama’s automotive industry taskforce as chairman of General Motors as it emerged from bankruptcy protection last July, took his place at the boardroom table on the 38th floor of the Renaissance Centre, the optimistically named headquarters of what was once the world’s biggest carmaker.A few days earlier, the GM board had designated him acting chief executive as well – and for the first time since then, Mr Whitacre was meeting in formal session with the close to a dozen people who ran the company.That day’s executive committee meeting lasted less than two hours. But the man so recently brought in to head the 102-year-old carmaker came away from the weekly powwow with agreement on two things of which most new CEOs the world over might by that stage only dream. A crisp if prosaic vision statement – “To design, build and sell the world’s best vehicles”. And a restructuring plan for the core business in its home market.The moves counted as a radical departure at a company notorious for slow decision-making and a complacent management culture, which had lost $88bn (£61bn, €73bn) in the four years prior to its filing for protection from creditors a year ago this month. “It was a very cathartic moment,” recalls Steve Girsky, a former Morgan Stanley analyst and consultant who is now a GM vice-chairman and director.The drive to turn around the global industry’s third-largest car producer as measured by first-quarter output is now firmly identified with the 68-year-old Mr Whitacre. He took over as chief executive after his board sacked Fritz Henderson, a 25-year GM veteran. Mr Whitacre’s Texan drawl and self-deprecating country-boy manner belie a ruthless impatience for results. Almost a year since his initial appointment and six months on from that December Monday – he was confirmed as chief executive the following month – much rides on his continued success, not just in the US but around the world.Even after the downsizing that the US and Canadian governments demanded as the price of their $61bn bail-out, GM sells more vehicles than any maker except Toyota and Volkswagen. But these days, more of its sales are in China than in the US.In interviews, several of Mr Whitacre’s senior colleagues describe a boss who has shifted GM’s focus back squarely towards its customers, and that of his 205,000 staff toward concrete results in the carmaker’s core businesses. “Ed Whitacre wants us to monitor the engine, not the tailpipe,” says Tim Lee, head of international operations. (Mr Whitacre, who rarely gives interviews, declined to speak to the Financial Times.)To be sure, GM had accomplished much of the toughest work needed even before Mr Whitacre came on the scene. His predecessors, including Mr Henderson , had begun designing and building cars – whether Buicks in the US and China or Opels in Germany – that were climbing industry league tables on quality.GM e merged from its swift 40-day journey through bankruptcy court under US government control, shorn of almost all of its debts and worthless assets. It is now one of the best capitalised carmakers. As part of the pre-Whitacre restructuring, GM also began ridding itself of four underperforming brands – Hummer, Pontiac, Saab and Saturn – enabling it to concentrate its limited resources on the remaining four: Buick, Cadillac, GMC and especially Chevrolet, its expanding global value marque.By closing plants and shedding tens of thousands of workers, GM can now break even on a US car market running at crisis levels of 10.5m in annual industry sales. A sharp turnround in North America plus a strong performance in emerging markets propelled it to a first-quarter profit of $1.2bn, its first quarterly earnings in four years.But the court-supervised restructuring has turned out to be just a milestone in a much bigger transformation that has begun under Mr Whitacre’s leadership. Of the 51 most senior executives listed in GM’s 2008 annual report, more than half have left. Of those who remain, only three are still in the same job they were two years ago. Mr Whitacre has shuffled several GM veterans into new jobs and recruited top executives from outside Detroit, notably Mr Girsky and Chris Liddell, hired from Microsoft as chief financial officer.The US government initially hoped to separate the roles of chairman and CEO. But Steven Rattner, who oversaw the Obama administration’s auto industry policy in the months leading up to GM’s and Chrysler’s bankruptcy, is one who says Mr Whitacre’s dual role is justified on the grounds of “an unusual transition period”. The real test, he adds, will be whether the board insists on Mr Whitacre’s successor splitting the jobs.While Mr Whitacre’s shake-up of top management has been profound, some outsiders doubt whether the culture change will cascade further down the ranks. “You can change the top, but the rest probably isn’t used to working at the speed required by Ed Whitacre,” says one who knows the company well.In addition to the demanding job of transforming a large carmaker, Mr Whitacre needs to play his politics carefully. On this front, his defining task is to pave the way for a public share offering that will allow GM to repay more of the money it received from US and Canadian taxpayers. Underscoring the sensitivity of the task, when GM ran advertisements a few weeks ago boasting that it had repaid its government loans, conservative critics lambasted the company for neglecting to mention the tens of billions of dollars GM still had in the bank as payment for the majority government stake. Mr Girsky says: “No one is declaring victory around here. There’s a lot of work to do.”Mr Whitacre is using December’s speedily crafted mission statement to put his stamp on the company and accelerate change. He challenged employees he met in subsequent weeks with the greeting: “Hello, do you know what the vision is?”The new CEO has little appetite for the PowerPoint presentations that have long been a staple of internal GM meetings. He has delegated many decisions and honed in on aspects of the old GM’s bureaucratic way of doing things that he sees as ripe for the cull. At one meeting in April, he questioned the number of websites GM ran – nearly 3,000, two-thirds of which were internal and many of which were not updated regularly. “Why on earth do we need this many?” a colleague recalls him asking. Many have since been closed.Mr Girsky has chopped the number of regular reports compiled by GM’s research group from 94 to four. He may dispense with some of these too, after deliberately not e-mailing them to the usual 150 recipients and finding that only a handful missed them. If executives give forecasts or dates of something they plan to do, Mr Whitacre makes clear they will be held accountable. “Everything is a bit more immediate,” says one executive.Mr Whitacre has impressed staff with a hectic schedule of plant visits, some unannounced. He regularly lunches in the RenCen’s food court, clearing his tray afterwards. But he has left little doubt that behind the unpretentious style is an iron fist. “He’s not a flashy kind of guy but he’s relentless,” says someone who has known him for more than a decade.The new boss has driven home the message that he wants results quickly. He has also made it clear that the flip side of extra responsibility is accountability, with few second chances. The head of North American marketing was replaced after just a few months in the job by Joel Evanick, a fast-rising star at Hyundai’s US arm. Mr Evanick had been at GM less than a week when he moved Chevrolet’s huge advertising account from Publicis to San Francisco-based Goodby, Silverstein Partners, part of the Omnicom group. GM had given Publicis the account just a month earlier, ending a 91-year association with the Campbell-Ewald agency.At all levels, Mr Whitacre asks managers to take more risks. When subordinates request money for a new initiative, his response is typically to ask whether the amount is within their existing budgets. If so, they are told that the decision whether to spend it is theirs. “You don’t have to wait for that monthly meeting,” says Ed Welburn, GM’s design chief, citing a recent decision to change the rear-seat design of a new Cadillac model.Mr Welburn, one of the handful of executives still in the same job they held two years ago, recalls that prior to the new regime, “half of our people were spending all of their time preparing presentations, instead of designing great cars”.Mr Whitacre is by no means assured of success. Even in China, it faces formidable competition from VW and other carmakers chasing the same lucrative business. In Europe, GM’s politically sensitive and often rancorous effort to restructure Opel/Vauxhall has distracted attention. In the US, GM’s sales have improved but are by no means robust.CFO Mr Liddell, who has decorated his office with an upside-down map of the world to encourage unconventional thinking, is non-committal about the timing of a share offering, saying it depends on the state of the markets and GM’s own finances. Analysts guess that, the economic climate permitting, it will take place later this year or in the first half of 2011.Explaining his decision to forsake one of America’s most successful technology companies for the uncertainty of Detroit, Mr Liddell says that “this has the potential to be one of the great turnround stories of all time”. Mr Girsky takes a more cautious view. “No one is in denial here,” he says. For all the things that GM is now doing right, he acknowledges, “I worry about years three to five”.Battle to fix the European brandsGeneral Motors head Ed Whitacre, colleagues say, does not spend time trying to fix things that are not broken.Foremost among the GM businesses unlikely to need mending in the near future are the US carmaker’s operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, which posted an operating profit of $1.2bn in the first quarter of this year, $500m more than in the last quarter of 2009.As the US carmaker submitted to the difficult and humbling process of reorganising in bankruptcy in 2009, it made much of the sales records it was setting in China, which replaced the US as the world’s biggest vehicle market last year. Its joint ventures in the country paid $400m of equity income in the first quarter of this year before taxes.GM’s operation in Brazil – where it is the number three producer after Italy’s Fiat and Volkswagen of Germany – was profitable enough to remain ring-fenced from the US bankruptcy filing.In Europe, where GM lost $506m before tax in the first quarter, it is a different story.The company is still struggling to secure German-led government support for a €3.7bn plan to restructure Opel and Vauxhall, its continental and UK brands. Fritz Henderson, Mr Whitacre’s predecessor, infuriated Berlin in February 2009 by saying GM would sell Opel then backing off in November after its board – headed by Mr Whitacre, as GM chairman but not yet chief executive – decided the business was too important to the wider group.Indeed, the ability to staunch losses at Opel by completing the restructuring may matter more to the company’s long-term viability than China, analysts say. According to an industry executive who knows the group well: “There is a whole hype around the fantastic money [GM is making] in China,”“The truth,” he says, “is that the battle for the future of GM will be lost or won in the US, and maybe at Opel.”Opel’s technical development centre near Frankfurt, for example, forms GM’s most important brains trust outside the US, with about 6,500 people on staff and proved expertise in developing small cars of the type increasingly in demand around the world, including in America.However, Opel has lost more than half a point of its market share in the past year. Nick Reilly, president of GM Europe, blames the end of scrappage incentives in Europe but acknowledges that negative headlines about the bail-out have not helped.“There’s no doubt that …some people have decided not to put Opel on their shopping list,” says Mr Reilly. He says the two European brands plan to launch a “confidence campaign” targeting European consumers over the next few months.But, with the German government focused on broader problems in the eurozone, GM’s earnings improving, and the worst of the industry’s crisis apparently over, Berlin seems increasingly reluctant to put its shoulder to the wheel. Ford Motor and GM’s other competitors have argued against state aid.The German government’s steering committee on the loan guarantee GM is seeking is due to come to a decision on Wednesday.
148;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-05-19T02:33:53Z;Mixed results bring cautious cheer to Aegis;;Aegis Group said that its media buying business had returned to growth after two years of decline but warned that its market research unit continued to underperform.The owner of agencies such as Carat and Isobar said in a trading update that it continued to expect “modest growth” this year after the first quarter performed in line with management’s expectations.Group revenues rose 1.1 per cent in the first quarter, after adjusting for acquisitions, currencies and disposals. Aegis’ shares rose 0.1p to 123.1p in London.Jerry Buhlmann, who was appointed as chief executive officer in March, said the company’s performance was “solid”. “There were tentative signs of clients’ starting to increase their marketing and advertising budgets for the second half of 2010.”Aegis is the last of the large advertising agency holding companies to update investors on its first-quarter performance. Its tone of cautious optimism echoes similar comments from WPP, Publicis and Omnicom.Aegis Media, the group’s larger division, saw growth of 3 per cent, as the rebound in emerging markets such as China and Russia outweighed a more sluggish recovery in Western Europe and North America.Analysts said Aegis Media’s performance was ahead of expectations but there was a greater decline in revenues than forecast at Synovate, Aegis’ market research business.Although Aegis said sales orders “continued to improve”, organic revenues fell by 1.9 per cent, even after the sharp contraction in marketing spend during the same period last year.Aegis raised £191m ($273m) from the issue of a convertible bond earlier this year, and has already invested £40m in acquisitions, including a joint venture in China.Analysts expect Aegis to make further acquisitions. However, Steve Liechti at Investec noted that speculation that Aegis itself may be a target for French rival Havas – with whom it shares an investor in Vincent Bolloré– had lost momentum.Aegis is owner of Posterscope, one of the UK’s two leading outdoor advertising agencies. The Office of Fair Trading said on Tuesday that it would launch a market investigation into the UK outdoor sector after concerns about commission paid by media owners to agencies in a “highly concentrated” market.
149;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-04-29T18:44:29Z;Interpublic sees marketing spending improvements;;Interpublic Group, which owns ad agencies such as McCann Worldgroup and Draftfcb, said that marketing spending was improving faster than it expected, as first-quarter losses narrowed.“Revenue growth and stability are slowly coming back into the picture,” said Michael Roth, Interpublic’s chief executive. “We believe the positive trajectory of the business is sustainable.”Mr Roth said that in 2010, Interpublic would post revenues “no worse than flat”, after adjusting for acquisitions and currency fluctuations, with operating margins of “8 per cent or better”.First-quarter revenues fell 2.9 per cent on an organic basis to $1.34bn compared to the first three months of 2009. Net losses shrank from $73.6m to $70.3m, with a loss per share of $0.15.Last year IPG reported an organic 10.8 per cent slump in sales. But rivals such as Omnicom have revealed a rapidly improving advertising market in recent weeks, with Publicis returning to organic growth in its first quarter.Client losses in the technology and telecoms sectors took their toll on IPG’s figures. Mr Roth said that if those industries were stripped out, organic growth would have nudged into positive territory for the quarter.Although that that will weigh on results for much of the year, Mr Roth said he was “feeling increased confidence about the prospects for growth in 2010” after first-quarter performance was “better than we expected coming into the year”.Latin America saw the greatest sales growth at 10 per cent, while the UK and Europe turned in the worst performance, with revenue declines in the mid-teens.Where there is improvement, Mr Roth said it was largely coming from existing clients spending more money, rather than client wins. Raising margins this year will depend on expanding the scope of work without taking on new staff where possible, he said.Digital agencies are rebounding fast, with Interpublic’s R/GA and Huge both showing double-digit percentage increases in revenue. Mr Roth said that margins in digital could be accretive to overall profitability, in spite of higher staff costs and more labour-intensive work than in traditional marketing.Rates for advertising work have come under pressure in recent years by increased involvement of procurement departments in contract negotiations, a process accelerated in the recession. Mr Roth said that while clients have “got a taste” for keeping procurement specialists involved, he saw “some semblance of reasoning” returning to deals, which will also help with profitability.New business activity remains busy as brands put their contracts out to pitch. “As the economy gets stronger, clients are taking a strong and hard look at their marketing capabilities,” Mr Roth told analysts.Changes in senior marketing personnel at clients often leads to new agency appointments, which was “good and bad news” for IPG, which recently won the US media account for L’Oreal, which it previously held jointly with Publicis. “As the economy starts to unfold, we are going to see more and more of this activity… We will have some wins and some losses.”Interpublic’s shares rose $0.15 to $9.42 in mid-morning trading in New York.
150;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-04-21T17:19:42Z;Commercial success;Not all recoveries announce themselves with a bang;"Not all recoveries announce themselves with a crash bang wallop. Unlike the tech sector’s noisy revival, the advertising world has emitted a steady drip of good news. Television companies are flagging surprisingly strong sales; agencies have revised upwards their global ad spending forecasts; ad companies this week reported a return to organic revenue growth. Taken together, it is clear that the advertising rebound has begun. But how to invest in it?The easiest route would be to buy into advertising groups like France’s Havas and the US’s Omnicom, which just reported good first quarters. Their shares, though, were long ago pricing in recovery, and may have got ahead of themselves. Global ad spending forecasts have nudged up from near-zero growth to 2-3 percentage points this year, but that still leaves total spending below 2006 levels. Shares in most ad groups meanwhile have climbed to levels last seen in 2007, trading at 13 to 16 times forecast 2010 earnings.Agencies are also less geared to the recovery than they might seem. After a slow start last year, ad companies slashed headcounts by almost 10 per cent to protect margins. But people are crucial to the business and as clients start to spend more, agencies will have to hire more too. Increased revenue will not flow straight to the bottom line – just look at Omnicom’s first quarter, in which revenue was up but profits still down. Finally there is a wild card: some agencies made desperate media price reduction promises last year that could cause trouble as the market reflates.A better, though trickier, strategy is to pick spots showing higher growth: television, for example, is emerging as a surprise success as advertisers capitalise on its broad reach. Broadcasters such as the UK’s ITV and Germany’s Prosieben have also seen a strong run-up in shares – but they have higher operational leverage than ad groups, and so could profit further if spending continues to surprise. Good things come to those who pick and mix."
151;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-04-13T21:30:40Z;Twitter branches out to instant advertisers;;For a service that has been so long in development, Twitter’s advertising platform, announced on Tuesday, feels remarkably familiar.Twitter is closely following Google’s game plan of slowly building a user base, before gently introducing a system of advertising that seeks to match commercial messaging with individuals’ interests.By showing that advertising can be relevant and useful to users of its search engine, Google made sponsored results the internet’s main form of advertising.“Promoted tweets”, as Twitter is calling its twist on the model, will allow brands to place a short message at the top of the list of search results when users of the microblogging website look for information about a particular product, company or news event.The ad will be persistent, so that it is not lost in the hourly deluge of tweets with only one ad appearing on each page of search results.Biz Stone, Twitter co-founder, said promoted tweets would be a “powerful means of delivering information relevant to [the user] at the moment”.The scheme is Twitter’s first serious effort at generating revenue after building up an estimated 50m regular users of its service, which started in 2006.That has left some observers questioning quite why it took Twitter so long.“It hasn’t really caught us by surprise,” said Norm Johnston, global digital leader for Mindshare Worldwide, a media buyer.“It’s a good step . . . It’s not Second Life, but nor is it Google.”Twitter will be hoping to avoid the fate suffered by Second Life, the hugely hyped virtual world that failed to provide a lasting destination for brands.“As this is the first introduction of advertising directly to the Twitter audience, they are clearly being very sensitive to how these new promoted tweets are shown,” said Chris Clarke, executive creative director at LBi, a digital marketing agency.Building the software systems that can ensure promoted tweets are relevant – or, as Twitter puts it, “resonant” – is crucial to ensuring users do not decamp to another social networking platform.The waning fortunes of Bebo and MySpace, which secured valuations close to Twitter’s purported $1bn equity value, attest to that risk.“This is high-performance computing – to do targeting on that level from scratch is a pretty big engineering task,” says Jonathan Nelson, head of Omnicom Digital.“If we are advertising for a travel client, we are going to look at how many ticket sales it leads to.”Although Twitter’s first paying advertisers are brand names such as Starbucks and Red Bull, emulating Google’s model means it will largely attract advertisers looking for an instant response to an ad.That contrasts with Facebook, a much larger social network, which is hoping to attract consumer-goods advertisers.But Twitter’s ability to advertise in a highly time-sensitive way also makes it a unique location for certain kinds of promotions.“It’s like Lastminute.com on steroids,” said Mark Read, head of digital at WPP, allowing hotels to sell vacant rooms or airlines to fill a plane at very short notice.“To date it’s been used by a lot of clients without [having to pay] Twitter . . . Giving advertisers a [better] way to communicate with consumers could help [Twitter] to become more mainstream.”As well as advertisers, Twitter is hoping to win over the many companies who make tools based on its constant stream of information.That includes software such as Seesmic and Tweetdeck, which are used by heavy Twitter users to read and post comments, and analytics sites such as Habit Stream or Tweetminster, which aggregate the mass of tweets into more digestible data.On Tuesday, a day ahead of Twitter’s Chirp conference, 20 of the main developers were gathering in San Francisco to discuss the raft of changes Twitter has unveiled in recent days, including its purchase of mobile developer Tweetie.Twitter’s move appeared to threaten the business model for TweetUp, a site offering advertising around tweets that launched only this week.But in spite of potentially competing with some of their products, developers welcomed Twitter’s pledge to share ad revenues with third-party clients.“It was Google’s great strength that it helped other people make money,” said Saul Klein, an investor in Tweetdeck through the Accelerator Group. “It’s a good thing for the Twitter ecosystem that it has a business model not only for itself but that it can share.”
152;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-03-24T02:24:06Z;Havas to double dividend after tough year;;Havas, the French advertising group chaired by Vincent Bolloré, has recommended a doubling of its dividend, after profits fell by 11.5 per cent last year.After the worst advertising recession in decades, Havas and its larger US rival, Omnicom, are the only large marketing services groups to raise their dividends for last year. Omnicom declared a 33.3 per cent increase in its payout last month, while WPP, Aegis and Publicis all held their dividends.Raising its dividend to €0.08 per share will bring Havas’ payout into line with its peer group after completing a restructuring in 2008.As it reported its 2009 annual results, Havas – which owns agencies such as Euro RSCG – said it would also seek shareholder approval for a buyback of around 9.3 per cent of its stock.At Tuesday’s closing price of €3.42, a 3.3 per cent gain for the day, the proposed buyback of 40m shares would cost €137m. Havas has set a maximum price of €5 or €200m.“The idea was to bring back the group where we think it belongs and should always be which is a group which takes care of its shareholders,” said Fernando Rodés Vilà, Havas chief executive. “We haven’t been able to [do that] too [well] in the last few years but now that we can, we can. Our payout ratio us now more-or-less average to our peers.”Shareholders will vote on the proposals at the annual meeting on May 11. If approved, Mr Bolloré – the French industrialist who owns 30 per cent of Havas and the largest shareholder in its British rival Aegis – would make around €6m from the dividend payout.Revenues at Havas fell 7.9 per cent on a like-for-like basis to €1.44bn in 2009. Net income fell 11.5 per cent to €92m, with earnings per share down 12.5 per cent to €0.21. The group cut 8 per cent of its workforce, or 1,200, mainly in the US, UK and Spain.Mr Rodés Vilà declined to provide guidance for 2010 until trading showed a more consistent recovery, after organic revenue decline improved to 4.4 per cent in the fourth quarter.“The first couple of months [of 2010] were not bad, much better than I thought personally,” he said, in line with much of the media sector. “I don’t know if it will last. The mood is much more positive than we had in 2009 or 2008 and in general advertisers are investing more. There are storm clouds on the horizon. Consumers in general, especially in western economies, are not yet inviting themselves to the party.”The group is on track to meet its target of generating 19 per cent of its revenues from digital advertising and marketing, from 16 per cent last year, Mr Rodés Vilà said.Client losses and management changes have disrupted Havas’ performance in the Asia-Pacific region, he added. Many advertising groups are looking to faster-growth markets such as India and China to counterbalance weakness in western Europe and North America.Havas said it would still consider “very targeted” acquisitions, particularly in Brazil, India and Russia.In spite of persistent speculation of a tie-up with Aegis, Mr Rodés Vilà said there was “nothing new” in the two groups’ relationship.John Napier, Aegis chairman, last week dismissed the rumours as “one of those love affairs that take place in the newspapers. I haven’t even had my hand held yet.”
153;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-03-16T23:29:53Z;Publicis management board waives bonuses;;Members of the management board of Publicis Groupe have agreed to waive their bonuses for last year.Maurice Levy, chairman and chief executive, will miss out on a €2.7m ($3.7m) performance-related bonus as a “gesture of solidarity” with the marketing group’s employees, who faced a hiring and pay freeze in 2009. His base salary in 2008 was €900,000.“It is something that is I guess the right thing to do,” he told the FT. “We are always saying our people are important and we are in a people business and we have to act accordingly.”Other members of Publicis’ “directoire” – David Kenny and Jack Klues, who run its Vivaki digital and media unit, operations chief Jean-Yves Naouri, and Kevin Roberts, head of Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide – would have received between €300,000 and €900,000 in performance-related pay.Like-for-like revenues at Publicis fell 6.5 per cent in 2009 to €4.52bn, a better performance than most of the marketing industry even though net profits fell 10 per cent.After thousands of redundancies, personnel expenses fell 1.2 per cent to €2.81bn, or 4.9 per cent after stripping out the effects of acquisitions such as Razorfish.Mr Levy said he had previously volunteered to skip his bonus more than 20 years ago. “Since the 1990s we have not faced a crisis of this magnitude,” he said.Publicis’ bonuses are calculated mainly on revenue growth and margin performance relative to its competition, which includes WPP and Omnicom. Publicis overtook Interpublic to become the world’s third largest agency holding company by revenues last year.Last week, Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, sold £785,000 worth of shares to fund a tax bill.Each member of Publicis’ management board discussed their bonus with Mr Levy individually so that there was no group pressure to give up their remuneration, he said.“I have not invited anyone to give up his bonus,” Mr Levy said. “I felt that it would not be right to have a collective conversation. If someone knew what somebody else would be doing they could have been put in a difficult situation.”Publicis shares rose 1.3 per cent to €30.63 in Paris trading on Tuesday.
154;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-03-05T17:02:49Z;WPP;The world’s biggest ad agency doesn’t see much growth yet;"Advertisers peddle happiness; it’s their job. So it is unnerving when the world’s biggest ad agency struggles to find something cheerful to say. After a gruesome year for the industry, WPP reports that its business has finally stabilised. But recovery is not yet assured and the company expects revenues to be flat over 2010. Given like-for-like revenues dropped 8 per cent last year, that is a pretty gloomy forecast.WPP’s competitors are not much chirpier: France’s Havas and US-based Omnicom, for whom revenues dropped more than 8 per cent apiece last year, are hoping for growth but only in the second half. France’s Publicis thinks it can do better but is vague on the details. At the heart of their concern is the continued stinginess of clients, which are eyeing double-digit unemployment in many markets and an uncertain recovery. Global advertising spending is forecast to rise by less than 1 per cent this year and marketing spending to fall another 2 per cent. WPP is frustrated. “The fact that you cannot cost-cut your way to prosperity has not been accepted – as yet,” it complained in Friday’s results statement. It should perhaps be more forgiving: last year WPP cut staff numbers by 12 per cent to protect the bottom line.Things may well pan out better than the agencies fear. WPP and Publicis expect growth in emerging markets, where WPP in particular plans a string of small acquisitions. Digital media are promising. And some set-piece events should help: the World Cup in South Africa, the World Expo in Shanghai and the US mid-term elections. But it is telling that months after everyone else started talking of “green shoots”, the ad men – who know a catchy phrase when they hear one – are saying nothing of the sort.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially"
155;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-02-26T17:17:12Z;Interpublic jumps 10% on brighter outlook;;Shares in Interpublic Group leapt 10 per cent as the advertising group said it would improve profitability this year, after net income halved in 2009.The owner of advertising agencies such as McCann-Erickson and Draftfcb said that its fourth-quarter revenues fell 8.2 per cent, adjusting for currency fluctuations and acquisitions, better than the double-digit declines analysts had forecast.Interpublic echoed remarks from rivals Publicis and Omnicom that the second half of 2010 would see a recovery in marketing spending, which has been hit hard by the recession.Michael Roth, Interpublic’s chief executive, described the company’s outlook as “tempered optimism” after an “extremely challenging year”.“Our goal of achieving 8 per cent or greater operating margin this year in a flat revenue environment is within our reach, as is the opportunity to more aggressively expand margins if the back half of 2010 shows more improvement,” he said. Interpublic’s operating margin fell to 5.7 per cent in 2009, or 6.9 per cent excluding severance costs.Its shares opened more than 10 per cent higher at $7.43 in early New York trading.Over 2009, Interpublic’s revenues fell 13.4 per cent to $6.03bn, a 10.8 per cent decline on an organic basis, meaning it fell into fourth place in the global agency rankings behind Publicis Groupe.WPP, the world’s largest agency group by revenues, reports its results next week.Net income at Interpublic fell 54.9 per cent to $143.4m, while earnings per share slumped from $0.57 to $0.20.Interpublic said its margins would improve, in spite of more cautious guidance on profitability from rivals, because it has made deeper staff cuts than other agencies.Headcount was 11 per cent lower at the start of 2010 than the prior year, incurring $71m in severance costs in the fourth quarter. Those extra costs forced Interpublic to renegotiate its lending terms with banks, raising its covenants.“I think this recovery is somewhat tenuous,” Mr Roth warned. “It is not going to take a lot for everyone to get spooked again in terms of spending those dollars.”He said half of the fourth-quarter revenue decline was attributable to lost clients or weaker spending in the automotive, technology and telecoms industries.“In the fourth quarter auto improved and we are continuing to see that. It’s less worse than it was before. Tech and telecom didn’t come back as strong as we did in auto.”
156;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-02-18T21:08:21Z;Microsoft-Yahoo alliance is approved;;"US and European antitrust regulators approved an internet search alliance between Microsoft and Yahooin a decision that backed the view of many big advertisers that the combination would give kingpin Google more competition.The companies said they would begin integrating the relevant operations in the “coming days”, acting on plans they have been working on since they proposed the deal in July last year.Microsoft would assume responsibility by the end of 2010 for the computer-generated search results and advertising links on Yahoo’s pages.A smaller combined market share in Europe had given the companies confidence of winning European Union approval, but the blessing of the Obama administration had been less certain. Regulators in the US Department of Justice have pledged a tougher antitrust line than the preceding regime.Some of the largest advertising buyers, including WPP, Omnicom and Publicis, argued in favour of the pact, while Google stood on the sidelines.EU competition officials said that their one-month investigation had indicated that scale was critical to search-ad competition and that Google had
90 per cent of the European market. Justice officials had no immediate comment.Carol Bartz, Yahoo chief, agreed to the deal after a long courtship that at one point envisioned Microsoft’s outright purchase of the struggling portal. Yahoo stockholders were disappointed with some of the terms of the final alliance, including the small cash guarantees. But within Yahoo, yesterday’s clearance of the last big hurdle to consummation brought a sense of relief, since the company’s search share has continued to dwindle and it had no serious back-up plan.Yahoo said that a 10-year licence to its own search technology and 400 employees will be turned over to Microsoft, as projected previously.Besides providing the algorithms for search results, Microsoft will handle the small businesses that buy ads based on search words without assistance from sales staffers. Yahoo’s sales force will take control of the relationship with the biggest buyers.Advertisers might not be moved to the new system before the end-of-year holiday season, Yahoo conceded, and the massive integration effort might last into 2012.Although Yahoo argues the point, analysts said that the ­outsourcing of search marks the end of the company’s position as a true contender in internet ­technology.Instead, Yahoo is now a pure new media group, with its fortunes pegged to the number of users it draws and the effectiveness of different means for showing them advertisements."
157;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-02-17T11:38:23Z;Publicis confident of revenue growth;;Publicis, France’s largest advertising agency group, followed rivals Havas and Omnicom in reporting a lower rate of revenue decline in its fourth quarter – even as 2009 profits fell by 10 per cent.The owner of agencies including Saatchi & Saatchi, Fallon and Zenith Optimedia said organic revenues – sales adjusted for currency fluctuations and acquisitions or disposals – fell 5.4 per cent in the final quarter of 2009, compared with a fall of 7.4 per cent in the third quarter and a drop of 8.6 per cent in the second.“The very first figures for January 2010 or the first quarter seem to be pointing in the same direction and the trend seems to be unchanged,” said Maurice Levy, chief executive.Mr Levy said that, after an “unprecedented drop in the market” in 2009, he was “confident” of positive revenue growth in 2010. “The growth outlook [according to independent market forecasters] for the year is -0.5 per cent [or] -0.9 per cent. We will do better and be in the positive figures thus outperforming the market and our competitors.”Shares in Publicis fell 2.74 per cent to €28.40 by mid-morning trading in Paris.Net income fell 10 per cent to €403m ($553m). Group sales for the year fell 3.8 per cent to €4.52bn compared with 2008, broadly in line with expectations.Publicis’ organic revenue decline for the year of 6.5 per cent was a better performance than Omnicom and Havas, who reported high single-digit declines last week. Publicis won €6bn in accounts during 2009, including L’Oreal, Honda and Carrefour.But in spite of the improving trend, Mr Levy guided investors to expect an unchanged operating margin in 2010 of 15 per cent. It maintained a 16.7 per cent margin target for 2012, but Mr Levy said clients remained “very demanding” with pressure on agency fees.Omnicom also suggested margins were likely to remain flat this year.“We can’t keep that same pressure on headcount and salaries. We are going to have to give a little in 2010,” Mr Levy told analysts, adding that the pay and hiring freeze would “thaw progressively” during the year. The group reduced staff levels by 3,000 positions in 2009.Publicis will also invest in digital marketing technology and expansion in emerging markets, raising its target for revenues from these areas from 50 per cent to 60 per cent of group sales this year.Publicis’ acquisition of Razorfish from Microsoft for $530m in 2009 helped digital revenues grow about 7 per cent, from 18.6 per cent of revenues in 2008 to 22.4 per cent in 2009. Mr Levy highlighted social networks such as Facebook and 3G mobile network penetration as opportunities this year.He added that he was unlikely to make further large purchases this year. “We are not anticipating a massive acquisition plan,” he said. That contrasts with Omnicom’s ambition to accelerate its M&A this year.
158;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-02-11T20:03:13Z;Cost of CDS raise ‘ripple’ effect fears;;Banks remained out of favour on Thursday even as the FTSE 100 edged higher for a fourth straight day.Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group were among the sharpest fallers as the European Union’s agreement to tackle Greece’s debt crisis failed to calm markets.While banks’ direct exposure to a sovereign default looks small, the recent volatility in sovereign credit default swaps presents a bigger risk, analysts at Sanford Bernstein said.Bank derivative desks have likely been the biggest buyers of sovereign CDS in the current crisis. With state customers not usually required to provide collateral, these default-insurance contracts would be the only means the banks have to hedge exposure as default concerns grew.But demand for sovereign CDS is outstripping supply on the most at-risk countries, Bernstein said. And if even a small number of banks looked to hedge their exposures for the UK and US, where supply is even shallower, the effect on prices could be dramatic.A spike in the cost of insuring UK and US debt would cause a ripple effect that would force banks to rein in activities, Bernstein argued.Barclays, which reports full-year results next week, closed down 3.4 per cent at 268¼p. Lloyds fell 3.7 per cent to 48¼p and Royal Bank of Scotland was 2.2 per cent weaker at 31¾p.The FTSE 100 ended higher by 29.49, or 0.6 per cent, at 5,161.48 after another choppy session driven by news and rumours from the EU meeting.Corporate results helped keep the benchmark in positive territory, with Rolls-Royce and Smith & Nephew topping the leaderboard after their 2009 figures beat expectations. RollsRoyce closed up 6.5 per cent at 520½p and S&N was 4.3 per cent higher at 660p.WPP rose 1.7 per cent to 593p after Omnicom, its US rival, posted better than expected quarterly sales and pointed to signs of improvement in its home market.Miners gained as copper registered its biggest one-day gain since August, boosted by Chinese bank lending data. Vedanta Resources gained 2.1 per cent to £24.24, Xstrata took on 1.7 per cent to £10.30½ and BHP Billiton rose 2.4 per cent to £19.01½.Rio Tinto climbed 2.4 per cent to £32.16 after resuming dividend payments and delivering annual figures that were slightly better than forecast.BT Group led the blue-chip fallers, down 8.8 per cent to 120p, after the pension regulator said it had “substantial concerns” about how the group intended to manage its scheme, which was in deficit by £9bn at the end of 2008.The spat affected other companies with pension fund deficits, with British Airways down 3.4 per cent to 211p, Cable & Wireless dropping 2.3 per cent to 136¼p and ITV lower by 1.6 per cent to 49¾p.Diageo fell 0.7 per cent to £10.18 after its first-half earnings came in slightly below expectations due to weak demand in the US and Europe.Sports Direct was the biggest gainer among the mid-caps, up 7.9 per cent to 104¾p, after its Christmas sales beat expectations and the Competition Commission provisionally cleared its purchase of stores from rival JJB Sports.CSR edged up 0.5 per cent to 479½p after Natixis said the Bluetooth chipmaker “would be an ideal takeover target” given its market share and cash pile, which equates to nearly half the market capitalisation.Recent FTSE 250 entrant SDL, the translation software maker, drifted 0.3 per cent to 443½p even after strong numbers from US peer Lionbridge.Yell lost a further 0.7 per cent to 39p in the wake of Wednesday’s profit warning from Eniro, the Nordic yellow-pages publisher.UBS, repeated its “buy” advice on Yell, and played down the concerns.“Given the later cycle nature of the Scandinavian ad market, Eniro is still seeing accelerating revenue declines whereas management tone and revenue trajectory is much more favourable for Yell, which has now passed the inflection point in declines,” the bank said.Desire Petroleum, which has seen some large share sales by directors in recent weeks, was in focus on Thursday.Its shares dipped 1.6 per cent to 106¼p on news that the Argentine government had in January “detained” what was described as a “British oil industry vessel” because it had been operating in waters near the Falkland Islands.Argentina has already made protests to the British ambassador in Buenos Aires about the imminent start of drilling for oil and gas in the Falklands.Weather permitting, Desire is due to start drilling a well in the North Falkland basin next week.Prosperity Minerals, up 7.7 per cent to 161½p, was in focus after broker Daniel Stewart said it was convinced that the sale of PM’s cement assets would go ahead. Prosperity has agreed to sell the cement assets to TTC International Holdings for £300m.Phorm Group marked time at 362½p in spite of late rumours that it might have signed a long-awaited deal in Brazil.Scisys rose 5.6 per cent to 47p after it was selected by the European Space Agency as a prime contractors for a software outsourcing contract. “The award of the contract demonstrates that some of SciSys’ projects may be resilient to tightening government budgets,” noted Canaccord Adams.Pursuit Dynamics improved 2.5 per cent to 143p amid talk that it was close to signing a big contract with a brewer.Innovation Group, which provides software for the insurance industry, held firm at 13½p as Andrew Roberts, chairman, was appointed as its new chief executive. “Mr Roberts is a capable and very experienced IT services operator who is likely to ‘fix’, scale or sell Innovation – he will not let it languish,” said Panmure Gordon.Alexander Mining added 4.2 per cent to 12½p on talk Freeport McMoRan was interested in its ammonia leaching technology.
159;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-02-10T20:31:16Z;New York Times;Company is off life support;There is a big difference between finding a cure and mitigating symptoms. The New York Times is off life support. After a year in which the company mortgaged its headquarters, closed its retail and distribution division and sold assets including a New York classical music radio station, total debt is down from $1.1bn at the start of 2009 to $770m now. Fourth quarter results on Wednesday showed higher profits thanks to furious cost cutting. Yet shares in the company dropped almost a tenth.Mixed messages from management may be a cause. Signs elsewhere suggest the advertising market is starting to recover. US ad agency owner Omnicom on Wednesday reported that ad spending stabilised during the fourth quarter and predicts recovery in the second half of this year. French peer Havas echoed the emerging optimism.Yet while commentary from the New York Times was similarly upbeat – spending from packaged goods, healthcare and automotive companies is returning – visibility remains extremely poor. The numbers suggest declines are merely moderating, with fourth-quarter advertising revenues down 15 per cent on 2008.Meanwhile familiar worries remain. Even with price hikes for both The Boston Globe and the Times (up a third on weekdays), shrinking readerships mean circulation revenues edged up a mere 3 per cent. The website About.com is growing nicely from a low base, but online advertising still contributes less than a quarter of overall ad sales. The company could trumpet 3m downloads of its iPhone app, but there was no mention of Apple’s iPad, alleged saviour of media companies. And while a new metering model to charge online readers is on the way, details are sparse.

160;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2010-02-10T14:28:05Z;Omnicom and Havas herald rebound;;The long-awaited rebound in advertising spending appears to have edged closer after Omnicom and Havas, the agency groups, both reported fourth quarter results ahead of expectations.Both groups are hoping for a return to growth after June but marketing chiefs remain concerned slower rates of decline owe more to stimulus packages than a genuine consumer recovery.Omnicom, the world’s second-largest marketing services group by sales, on Wednesday said fourth-quarter revenues fell 6.3 per cent on an organic basis, adjusting for currency fluctuations and acquisitions, to $3.27bn. That was ahead of analysts’ forecasts of an 8.5 per cent decline.The group, which owns agencies such as DDB, called last year the “toughest economic period in our firm’s history” but said it expected revenues to begin growing from the second quarter of 2010.“As economies improve, we believe the worst of the recession and its impact are behind us,” said John Wren, Omnicom chief. “We anticipate many clients will at least modestly increase spending in the second half of this year.”Full-year revenues fell 8.7 per cent organically to $11.7bn, with income before tax 21.1 per cent lower at $1.27bn. Earnings per share fell 19.9 per cent to $2.54.Havas, the French agency group which owns Euro RSCG, reported a similar improvement in a trading statement on Tuesday.Revenues for 2009 fell 8.1 per cent to €1.4m ($1.9m). Fourth-quarter organic revenues fell 4.4 per cent to €415m, compared with declines of between 8 and 10 per cent for the preceding three quarters of 2009.Havas’ shares closed 7.9 per cent higher at €3.12 in Paris. Omnicom’s shares rose 0.9 per cent to $35.55 by midday in New York.Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients that Omnicom’s report, following Havas, “serves as a second datapoint of agencies beginning to see the recovery”.Omnicom said that although western Europe had continued to decline in the fourth quarter, US business stabilised and most emerging markets such as China and India posted year-on-year growth.PHD, an Omnicom agency, recently won Unilever’s China account from its largest rival, WPP. However, WPP fended off a challenge from Omnicom to retain the Unilever media-buying account in western Europe and the US.Omnicom said revenues from the automotive sector fell 25 per cent organically, accounting for 40 per cent of organic revenue decline in the fourth quarter. Omnicom lost its Chrysler account (worth 1 per cent of revenues) last year but Mr Wren said carmakers were now “spending more money” as part of a “war for market share”.He said Omnicom would increase dividends and acquisitions, targeted on geographic expansion and digital, with residual cash flow going towards share buy-backs.
161;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-12-19T01:00:22Z;WPP loses China account;;WPP, the world’s biggest advertising and communications group, is to lose Unilever’s media planning and buying business in China to rival Omnicom, in a blow to chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell’s ambitions to harness growth in developing markets next year.PHD, an Omnicom media agency, has won the Unilever account for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan from WPP’s Mindshare, according to people familiar with the negotiations.The deal, which is expected to be announced next week, is the first of several media contract reviews by Unilever, as companies look to capitalise on the advertising downturn to secure better pricing and new capabilities in a rapidly changing media landscape.Estimates of Unilever’s media spending in China range between $200m and $450m a year.WPP is responsible for about 70 per cent of media planning and buying duties globally at Unilever, which owns brands such as Dove, Persil and PG Tips.Sir Martin Sorrell told a UBS media conference in New York earlier this month that China continued to be a focus in WPP’s target to increase sales in faster-growing markets to 34 per cent of group revenues.“Really, when you boil it down, life is about China and the internet,” he said, which have been the industry’s only sources of growth since 2008.WPP claims to be the largest agency group in greater China with 38 per cent of the media market. Last year the region generated billings of $4.1bn and retained revenues of $840m for WPP.Analysts at Citigroup estimate that Unilever’s China account is worth just 0.2 per cent of WPP’s group revenues but said this and other client losses in the region “somewhat dents the emerging markets thesis for WPP” and “throws doubt on WPP’s ability to grow 2010 revenues” in the region.“We suspect that Omnicom won this away on price, which appears to be a current trend,” Citi added.Sir Martin has warned of “very significant price cutting” as WPP and its rivals battle for revenue growth and scale in newer markets.Some competitors are “still prepared, totally inadvisably, to give guarantees beyond their fees”, he told the FT earlier this year, which is creating significant contingent liabilities on their balance sheets.WPP’s rivals said it had also been aggressive in negotiations.Omnicom, WPP and Unilever declined to comment for this story.
162;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-10-30T22:30:44Z;Marketing groups pin hopes on acquisitions;;Marketing services groups such as Publicis and Omnicom are looking to acquisitions to drive growth after the sector’s third-quarter results failed to demonstrate improvement in the advertising markets.Publicis of France showed the best results among the five large agency groups reporting in the past two weeks, with like-for-like revenues declining 7.4 per cent in the three months to September. At the other extreme, Interpublic, a US-based group, posted organic sales down 14.2 per cent.Along with Havas and Omnicom, all showed only marginal improvement in the third quarter compared with the second. WPP fared better, reporting on Friday that organic revenues fell 8.7 per cent, “less worse” than the 10.5 per cent drop in the prior quarter.But Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, remained reluctant to forecast anything more optimistic than a flat performance in 2010. “Some people look at those numbers and say the recession has ended,” he said. “We say the recession doesn’t end unless we see like-for-like growth. Some of the statements that people make in our industry sound like they are running for office.”Maurice Lévy, chief executive of Publicis, gave the most optimistic outlook, but even he remained cautious. “The trend and all the information we have currently suggests that the worst is behind us. We are not yet with the positive numbers.”Anthony de Larrinaga, analyst at Jefferies, said all the agency groups were “bounding along the bottom with very little visibility”.Contemplating a slow recovery in clients’ spending, advertising executives are steeling themselves for a resurgence in industry consolidation.Publicis plans to make acquisitions in India and China, although not on the scale of its €369m ($530m) deal to buy Razorfish, a digital agency, from Microsoft.Omnicom, which saw third-quarter sales drop 10.7 per cent but has historically made fewer acquisitions than its rivals, is also looking to digital and emerging-market dealmaking.“Given the strength of our balance sheet, I fully expect the company will be more active and you can expect more acquisition activity from us as we move forward,” said John Wren, chief executive. Speculation has also arisen this week about that the long awaited tie-up between Aegis, a UK group providing media-buying and market research services, and Havas.The two have a common shareholder in Vincent Bolloré, whose family holdings also include electric cars, telecoms and paper.Havas last week raised €350m in a bond issue it said would help lengthen the maturity of its debt as well as seek “opportunities for growth”. Aegis looks vulnerable in the wake of management changes and a long-running search for a new permanent chief executive, analysts say.However, Havas’s €650m in cash and undrawn facilities would be insufficient to buy Aegis outright. Analysts speculate that GfK or Ipsos, the European market research groups, could be interested in Synovate, its market research arm, worth an estimated £350m ($575m).“Aegis is not within Havas’s grasp unless it is raising money from elsewhere,” said Patrick Kirby of Deutsche Bank.
163;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-10-30T08:49:15Z;WPP puts its faith in ‘LUV’ recovery;;"WPP is counting on tough “LUV” to lead it out of the recession, the advertising group said on Friday, as it revealed declines in revenue only slightly worse than its French rival Publicis but ahead of the other global ad agencies.Shares in WPP rose 4.3 per cent or 23½p to 568½p in early trading.The “LUV”-shaped trajectory for the world economy – an elaborately finessed rendering of the decoupling hypothesis – sees western Europe experiencing an “L”-shaped path of protracted stagnation; the US undergoing a “U”-shaped return to growth; and the developing world staging a quick return to growth via a “V”-shaped recovery.The company said its belief in “LUV” boded well for its focus on the so-called Bric economies – Brazil, Russia, India and China. This would complement WPP’s presence in the so-called “next 11” tier of developing states, including Vietnam, Turkey and Mexico, it said.For the quarter ending in September, WPP’s revenues rose 16.7 per cent to £2bn, boosted by the acquisition of Taylor Nelson Sofres last year and the weakness of sterling.However, stripping out currency effects and the TNS acquisition, organic revenues fell 8.7 per cent, which was worse than the first-quarter decline of 8.3 per cent but better than the second-quarter decline of 10.5 per cent.This quarterly fall of 8.7 per cent is worse than the third-quarter performance at Publicis, where revenues fell 7.4 per cent. However, revenues at US group Interpublic slid 14.2 per cent in the third quarter, while Havas and Omnicom saw falls of 9.3 per cent and 10.7 per cent respectively.Latin America was the best-performing region, with like-for-like revenues down only 1.2 per cent, followed by the US, where third-quarter revenues fell 6.1 per cent compared with the same period last year.In the UK, revenues dropped 9 per cent, while in western Europe they were down 12.5 per cent.WPP said that although the corporate mood had improved since companies skirted the threat of “armageddon and apocalypse” last autumn, most executives responsible for ad spending were still nervous of committing to new projects, while consumers were worried over the threat of rising unemployment.“While the hearts of CEOs and CMOs [chief marketing officers] are stronger and their minds clearer, increased confidence is still not transferring to their cheque-writing hands,” the company said in a statement.“Brand investment is still in check, particularly in the west.”WPP has been cutting back on its own investment, as it continued to shed employees in the third quarter. At the end of September, group headcount stood at 101,333, 10 per cent fewer than at the end of 2008."
164;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-10-27T14:13:20Z;Publicis forecasts ad spend recovery;;Publicis expects profitability to return to its 2007 peak, when margins hit 16.7 per cent, by 2011 as the communications conglomerate eyes a recovery in advertising spending next year.Reporting its third-quarter results on Tuesday, Publicis, which owns agencies including Saatchi & Saatchi and Digitas, said revenues in the three months to September 30 fell 5.3 per cent to €1.05bn, broadly in line with market expectations.Organic revenues, a metric watched by analysts that excludes the effects of acquisitions and currency fluctuations, fell 7.4 per cent. That represents an improvement on the second-quarter decline of 8.6 per cent but below the first quarter, with January and February remaining the best-performing months of the year to date.Maurice Lévy, Publicis chief executive, anticipates a “U-shaped” recovery in marketing spending, picking up in the second half of 2010 after the market hit its nadir in June, when Publicis’ sales fell by more than 10 per cent.“Our objective for 2011 [is] we are back to the level of record margin,” said Mr Lévy. “We will be in the region of 16.7 per cent [operating margin] in 2011 – maybe 16.5, 16.4 [per cent].”Analysts at Nomura had forecast operating margins of 15.5 per cent for 2011, up from an anticipated 14.7 per cent in 2009.ZenithOptimedia, Publicis’ own media agency, does not expect the world’s largest advertising markets to return to growth until 2011.Publicis shares rose 1.18 per cent to €27.81 by early afternoon in Paris trading.Digital advertising would lead the return to growth in advertising spending, said Mr Lévy, followed by media spending generally, with creative work lagging.Group revenues from digital activity increased by 5.1 per cent in the third quarter, with growth in North America, excluding sales from General Motors, of 17.1 per cent in the year to date.Publicis’ €369m acquisition of Razorfish from Microsoft, closed on October 13. Razorfish’s margins are expected to be brought up to match the rest of the group within three years.Mr Lévy echoed comments last week from a larger rival, Omnicom, that he would look to make more acquisitions in digital and emerging markets, but none as large as Razorfish.“We are looking for operations which cost between a few million [euros] to a few tens [of millions],” said Mr Lévy, although he added that “we remain cautious”. “The fact that valuations are down is not sufficient for us to make an acquisition. It has to be compelling to our strategy and also right for our clients.”Mr Levy said that Publicis was planning to “strengthen our position” in India and China. “We are number three or four in India and we need to do some further investment,” he said. “We are looking at various opportunities.”Expanding in China was a ”huge undertaking”, he said, but Publicis was ”looking at all the possibilities”.His desire to push further into India and China stemmed from Publicis’ organic revenue decline of 12.4 per cent in the Asia-Pacific region, which Mr Lévy said was due to the company’s greater exposure to more mature markets such as Japan, Australia and Korea.India, Italy and Spain were among the worst performing markets in the third quarter, with organic revenues down more than 10 per cent. But Europe’s organic decline of 9.5 per cent was better than some analysts had expected.Publicis’ 6.9 per cent organic year-on-year decline in revenues for the year to date compares with Havas, a smaller French rival, reporting an 8.2 per cent drop and Omnicom’s 15.4 per cent fall.WPP, the world’s largest marketing services group by revenues, and Interpublic will report their third-quarter results later this week.Global advertising revenues are expected to drop by around 10 per cent this year.
165;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-10-25T22:27:09Z;Carmakers in marketing rethink;;General Motors and Chrysler have launched far-reaching reviews of their marketing strategies in the latest sign of carmakers adjusting their business in an economic downturn that has crippled their industry.Chrysler, now under the operational control of Italy’s Fiat, has pushed aside BBDO, its lead advertising agency for more than six decades, to consider pitches from rival groups.The move came after a stormy meeting between the agency and Sergio Marchionne, Fiat’s chief executive.GM’s Cadillac brand has parted company with Boston-based Modernista after what the agency called “creative and strategic differences”. GM said that Modernista “couldn’t fulfill all of our needs”.Chevrolet, GM’s flagship brand, has kept its main agency, Campbell-Ewald, but has invited others to compete for specific campaigns. “It’s inviting new ideas and fresh thinking,” said Jay Spenchian, GM’s executive director for marketing strategy. “The more ideas we can get in here the better.”Volkswagen announced on Friday that it had chosen Deutsch, a unit of Interpublic, as its lead US agency, replacing Crispin Porter & Bogusky of Miami, a division of MDC Partners.The upheavals stem partly from GM and Chrysler’s court-supervised restructurings over the summer and carmakers’ need to take steps to stimulate business at a time of plummeting vehicle sales. According to Mr Spenchian, “We’ve all asked ourselves – what can we do differently?”But the moves also reflect intensified competition among ad agencies for accounts as a result of the worldwide slump in vehicle sales. Carmakers have traditionally been among their largest clients. But Omnicom, BBDO’s parent, disclosed last week that its global automotive revenues have tumbled by 30 per cent this year.Kip Cassino, vice-president for research at Borrell Associates, highlights another shift. He said carmakers have become more reluctant to commit to comprehensive “upfront” contracts with TV networks. Instead, they are looking to the so-called “scatter” market, where ads are negotiated with specific stations, albeit at higher rates.“This is another case where the old rules of advertising just aren’t working any more,” Mr Cassino said.Mr Spenchian said that GM’s marketing emphasis would shift from special promotions to drive up monthly sales to “a heightened focus on the consumer”, especially through social and digital media.The Detroit carmakers’ biggest marketing challenge is to persuade Americans to give their vehicles another try after years of bad reviews. “We can only do so much talking [as GM], but others have to step in and start telling the stories for us,” Mr Spenchian said.
166;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-10-25T18:17:03Z;Delayed payments bringing bigger rewards;;Buy now, pay later.That’s the bargaining tool sellers and buyers are using to bridge the disconnect between their valuation of assets.Global Infrastructure Partners, which just bought Gatwick Airport from BAA, has agreed to make additional payments of up to £55m contingent on achieving certain targets relating to passenger volume and future capital structure.Likewise, CVC, which earlier this month acquired Anheuser-Busch InBev’s central European business, could end up paying the brewer up to $800m in further compensation, depending on CVC’s return on the investment.In a market where sellers do not want to offload assets for a low price and buyers are reluctant to pay top dollar, offering a deferred payment consideration can keep both sides happy.The rationale is that a buyer can avoid the risk of overpaying, while the seller can share in any potential upside.The mechanism also acts as a type of anti-embarrassment clause for sellers who need to dodge shareholder accusations of having sold prized assets too cheaply.It certainly looked that way earlier this year when Candover Investments needed to sell Wood Mackenzie, an energy research business, after it failed to meet a €1bn (£915m) commitment to a new €3bn Candover Partners fund.At a time when both financing and buyers were scarce, Candover Partners agreed to sell it to rival Charterhouse Capital for an immediate cash payment of £19.6m, plus £1.9m via a deferred consideration scheme.In reality, that was just another form of vendor finance and, more often than not, it can mask the real value of an asset and does little but postpone the true cash cost of the deal.After all, hypothesising on the future earnings and cash flow of an asset at a time when few have a clear idea of how the economy is shaping up does not exactly provide the level of comfort it promises.That also makes it difficult for buyers to describe an acquisition as earnings-enhancing when it is being calculated on the initial payment only.Consider what happened to the big advertising agencies that funded much of their acquisition binge during the 1990s using earn-outs linked to the performance of the acquired company.Omnicom, for example, had to admit that it owed up to $418m to companies it had bought in a year when at the time its net income was just $503m.But the redeeming feature of this M&A device is that if unforeseen factors do adversely affect the expected results of the deferred payment, both the seller and the buyer will have to swallow that risk. That’s how the market should work.Real Deal will not appear next week but will return on November 9.lina.saigol@ft.com
167;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-10-21T22:05:55Z;Omnicom sounds cautious tone on advertising;;Omnicom sounded a cautious note for advertising agency groups as its third-quarter trading failed to show broad signs of improvement, with profits falling by almost a quarter against the same period last year.The world’s second-largest communications holding company, which owns agencies such as DDB and OMD, reported an organic revenue decline of 10.7 per cent compared to the same period last year, in line with its second-quarter performance.John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive, said he did not see “significant changes” in the third quarter compared with the second, after clients slashed their budgets at the beginning of the year.“We are steadily seeing stabilisation,” Mr Wren said. The effects of budget-cutting would likely take a further two quarters to “fully cycle through the business”, he added, with no sequential improvement likely before the end of 2009.In spite of growing optimism among media owners in recent weeks, Mr Wren did not indicate any substantial recovery in North America and Europe, the largest advertising markets.Omnicom is the first of the agency groups to reveal its figures for the latest period. It will be followed by France’s Havas on Thursday and larger rivals WPP, Publicis and Interpublic next week.Earlier this week, ZenithOptimedia, Publicis’ media agency, warned that major media markets would not return to meaningful growth until 2011. Global advertising spending is expected to fall about 10 per cent this year.But Maurice Levy, Publicis chief executive, has been more bullish than his peers, suggesting the advertising market has been picking up since hitting bottom in June.There was scant evidence for that in Omnicom’s latest figures. Its total revenues fell 14.4 per cent to $2.84bn in the three months to September 30, with net income 22.5 per cent lower at $165.6m, broadly in line with analysts’ expectations.“Both US and international organic growth decelerated even more sharply than expected,” analysts at Deutsche Bank said.Its operating margin in the third quarter fell about 90 basis points to 10.4 per cent. So far this year, the group has incurred $102m in severance costs. Severance in the fourth quarter is likely to be in line or slightly below that of the third, it said.Omnicom’s shares fell $1.11, or 2.9 per cent, to $36.96, by midday in New York trading.Mr Wren said that Europe in particular “remains weak”, with the exception of France. “As we go into 2010, we expect any recovery to be slow,” he said, with scant signs of recovery in Japan and Korea. “In the US, with the exception of several sectors, client spending has stabilised and there are even signs of positive growth.”Only developing markets, including India, China, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, put in a stronger performance.Spending in the automotive sector fell more than 30 per cent, as Mr Wren admitted that its account with Chrysler, worth roughly 1 per cent of 2009’s revenues, was “at risk”.Revenue from financial services’ clients also fell about 15 per cent in the third quarter.“We are hopeful as we move into 2010 that these areas will recover slowly,” he said.Omnicom ended the quarter with $3bn in cash and undrawn credit facilities, with net debt standing at $2.05bn, down almost $880m year-on-year.“Given the strength of our balance sheet … you can expect more acquisition activity from us as we move forward,” Mr Wren said, focusing on emerging markets and “sensibly priced” digital agencies.However, he said that any major restructuring of its existing portfolio was unlikely. Interpublic, a US-based rival, last week merged Lowe Worldwide and Deutsche, two of its creative agencies, to save on back-office costs.
168;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-10-19T20:56:52Z;Microsoft-Yahoo tie-up garners ad chief support;;The heads of the four largest advertising agencies came out on Monday in support of the proposed search engine alliance between Microsoft and Yahoo.Their backing for the deal comes as regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are studying the partnership, which the two companies claim will create a stronger force in search advertising to counter market leader Google.Their support came in a letter to the Department of Justice from the American Association of Advertising Agencies from Nancy Hill, the association’s chief executive officer. The letter was co-signed by Maurice Levy of Publicis Groupe, Martin Sorrell of WPP, Michael Roth of Interpublic and John Wren of Omnicom.The brief submission did not go into detail about the dynamics of the search market or mention Google in any way, but argued that the alliance “enhances competition” and that it “should be allowed to take effect as soon as possible.”The lack of any mention of how the alliance might counter-balance Google’s dominance in the search market appeared to reflect the different positions that the individual agency heads have struck in the past.A year ago, when Google tried to forge an alliance of its own with Yahoo, Mr Sorrell spoke out strongly against the proposal, while Mr Levy backed the idea. The plan was eventually scrapped at the last minute after the DoJ signalled that it would sue to block it.“We believe that Yahoo! and Microsoft’s proposal to combine their technologies and search platforms is good for advertisers, marketing services agencies, website publishers and consumers,” Monday’s letter read.Google itself has remained on the sidelines, at least publicly, during the regulatory review of the alliance, having taken a strong position against the full acquisition of Yahoo that Microsoft tried to pull off last year.Microsoft and Yahoo have said that they hope to complete their partnership by early next year. They have yet to file a notification seeking approval from the European Commission, and their small combined share in Europe has raised questions about whether they need formal approval from regulators there. However, a failure to anticipate potential objections from Brussels recently tripped up another prominent technology deal, when European regulators refused to issue an expected rubber-stamp for Oracle’s proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems.
169;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-10-19T15:07:45Z;Biggest ad markets will see no growth until 2011;;The world’s largest media markets will return to growth in 2011, according to the latest advertising spending forecast, but with only a “meagre” recovery as emerging markets take a greater share of global ad budgets.ZenithOptimedia, the media agency owned by Publicis Groupe, said on Monday that advertising spending in the developed markets of western Europe, North America and Japan would fall by 2.9 per cent next year, growing 1.5 per cent in 2011.By contrast, developing markets such as India, China, eastern Europe and Africa will grow a “healthy” 7.8 per cent in 2010 and 9.8 per cent the following year, taking their share of global media spending to 35 per cent by 2011.On a worldwide basis, Zenith now expects advertising spending to plummet 9.9 per cent this year, with growth of just 0.5 per cent in 2010, a gloomier forecast than its July report. Growth of 4.3 per cent in 2011 will still pale in comparison to the 6.3 per cent year-on-year rise the media world experienced in 2007.However, Zenith said that confidence was improving amid “positive signals from media owners that the downturn is bottoming out”.“We are still confident that the second half of [2009] will be much less painful for the ad market than the first half, and expect the market to hit bottom before the end of 2009,” its report said.Of all the media formats, magazines and newspapers are suffering the most, with a “steep decline” this year. Advertising spending in newspapers is expected to fall by 25 per cent between 2007 and 2011, with magazines down 28 per cent from the same peak.TV, cinema and outdoor advertising will return to growth next year, with TV maintaining its share of spending at around 40 per cent to be the world’s largest medium.Online advertising is closing in on newspapers to become the world’s second largest advertising format, with 14.9 per cent share by 2011, up from 10.2 per cent last year. Newspapers’ share is expected to fall from 25.3 per cent in 2008 to 21.2 per cent in 2011.The forecast comes ahead of the third-quarter reporting season for advertising agency groups. On Wednesday Omnicom will be the first to report its figures, while WPP, Publicis and Interpublic all update the market next week.Last week, Maurice Levy, chief executive of Publicis, said in an interview with Les Echos, the French newspaper, that he expected the advertising market to recover in the second half of 2010.”We reached a low at the end of June, while the market has continued to fall at least until September,” Mr Levy said.
170;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-09-22T22:30:22Z;Agency with sticking power;;In spite of being dominated by global giants such as WPP and Omnicom, the advertising world is something of a cottage industry. A pattern is for serial entrepreneurs to build up an agency, sell it to a holding company, wait until they are paid their earn-outs and start again.It is a people business made up of restless, impatient, creative individuals. So it is unusual to find the co-founder of an agency still in the top seat after a decade, especially if the company has changed hands a couple of times.Along with three colleagues, Mark Cridge set up Glue London in 1999 as a creative digital agency designing online banners for clients. Since 2005, it has been part of Aegis, the international network of media buying and planning agencies, and last year Glue turned over £9.77m, employing 105 people.But in spite of operating within a larger group, Mr Cridge keeps an entrepreneurial feel at the agency, as it evolves from a digital specialist to a broader range of advertising and marketing services, including offline.“You give up certain things, you’re perceived differently, but you gain a hell of a lot more,” he says. An enabler of growth, Aegis offers Glue a degree of freedom to retain its independent spirit. “We have to justify certain decisions to other people in the hierarchy – which is fine when things are going well but we have ups and downs like any other company.”As chief executive, Mr Cridge has seen the business through the dotcom boom and bust, two takeovers, a management buy-out from a parent company in administration, and the current advertising recession. “Going through those ups and downs makes you very pragmatic,” he says.An engaging and lively Scot, Mr Cridge has a keen interest on how communications can play a greater role in environmental campaigning.At Glue’s headquarters in Shoreditch, a fashionable corner of east London near the City, he describes the concrete and white-tiled office as “kebab shop, abattoir, carpark chic”.It was while training to be an architect that he spent 12 months out in a web design company and never went back. While much of the design work is left to others, his background helps with client relationships and the business’s positioning, he says. “Having the lunatics running the asylum is great for a creative business.”Digital agencies have not always been viewed as creative. Even five years ago, Mr Cridge says, Glue was more of a production business. Only this year has it delivered its first campaign encompassing offline media, including a TV spot, radio and billboards as well as online, for 3, the mobile operator.From the start, Glue took an unconventional approach to the role of a digital agency. “Until then, most digital agencies had been about web development and technology or design …We made our name by proving you could be creative with banners,” he says.Glue was set up as a joint venture with Deepend, a highly regarded web design firm. “They did some good stuff but there was no fundamental business logic to what they were doing,” says Mr Cridge. The dotcom collapse combined with the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 put Deepend into administration that month. “So in 2001 we found ourselves out on the street, literally.”Mr Cridge knew a new company had to be formed within days. “There was an urgency because we would lose our clients and our people – nobody had been paid for the previous month.”With investment from St Lukes, another independent agency, the assets of Glue were bought up and 17 people formed the new business. “That urgency really carried us through that two-year period,” Mr Cridge says. Within two years, Glue was named Campaign magazine’s digital agency of the year – “a rubber stamp that we were getting this right”, he says.Unusually, a dozen people remain at Glue from that time. “People enjoy working here, not just in a frivolous pool-table and fussball-table way,” he says.As the company grew, by late 2003 the value of St Lukes’s stake had risen to more than £300,000 and Mr Cridge and two colleagues decided to buy the company back, personally guaranteeing its loans. “The crash was easy in comparison because we had nothing to lose,” says Mr Cridge of that time.The next two years of independence were “quite a formative business experience, [but] not one I want to repeat in a hurry”, he adds. “I had a mortgage, no savings . . . Daddy wasn’t going to step in to sort things out.” There was also responsibility for his growing team. “That’s where the real stress comes from – if other people lose their jobs because of your actions.”Suitors soon came knocking, however, and in 2005 Aegis’s digital network, Isobar, made an offer too tempting to ignore.Glue’s management team had been scarred by Deepend’s implosion. “Having seen at close quarters a company almost make it and then lose it, when a company puts money on the table, you take it,” he says. “You might be able to get a bigger valuation down the line, but a bigger catastrophe might come along.”Aegis’s offer was attractive. Although it had big digital and media sales networks, it had no traditional creative business. “We didn’t want to be the digital arm of another agency. We didn’t know what the future was going to look like but we wanted the space to work it out ourselves.”Access to Aegis’s media sales and research units helped Glue expand more rapidly and efficiently and Aegis has introduced it to big clients such as Nokia, Philips and Reebok. Since 2005, Mr Cridge says, headcount and revenues have doubled and profits have quadrupled.Glue’s turnover increased 8 per cent last year, with pre-tax profits rising from about £400,000 in 2007 to £1.74m in 2008. Mr Cridge says the profit growth is thanks to higher-margin work with longer contracts, whereas digital work is more usually commissioned project by project.In 2005, Aegis offered to pay up to £14.75m for the business, depending on performance over three and a half years. Mr Cridge says he and two of the co-founders, Seb Royce and Martin Bailie, have done “pretty well” from the earn-out (the fourth co-founder left early on).Mr Cridge advises any other agency start-ups to remain focused if they want to succeed and survive. “If you start from scratch trying to do too much, you are going to fail.” But even though Glue has taken an unconventional route by not starting out afresh, Mr Cridge says its new, broader brief keeps the entrepreneurial spirit alive. “We are starting again,” he says.
171;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-09-21T19:45:26Z;Sorrell sees more gloom for media;;"It has been a brutal year for the media industry. Since the credit crunch began to hit the sector in August 2008, broadcasters, newspapers and advertising agencies have all been suffering, with thousands laid off across the sector in the UK alone.Yet over the summer, many media executives dared to suggest that the worst was over.July saw Omnicom and Publicis, two of the world’s largest communications groups, as well as JCDecaux, the billboard owner, describe improvements since the spring. Michael Grade, ITV’s outgoing executive chairman, said in August that the UK was “at or around the bottom of the market” after the country’s “worst ever decline” in advertising spending.Even Rupert Murdoch, the News Corp chief, said this month that business was “very much better than it was a couple of months ago”.“Confidence is getting better but that isn’t translating into people spending more on their brands,” Sir Martin Sorrell tells the Financial Times. The WPP’s chief executive’s sober outlook contrasts with the improving mood of other industry executives: he said last month that he expected revenue to be flat in 2010 after what Citigroup forecasts as a 7.7 per cent fall in like-for-like revenue this year.“People keep saying I’m more gloomy than others,” Sir Martin says. “I think it’s a difference in tone or spin. We are being more realistic about it …To me, recovery is year-on-year growth of like-for-like revenues. I don’t think the fact that July and August were less worse than June is a recovery. It seems to me to be statistical semantics. If we are not falling off a cliff, the sequential quarters have to improve.”This short-term improvement should be not surprising, he adds, given the scale of governments’ economic stimulus packages.“This is a deceleration of negatives,” he says. “Everyone at the moment is looking for green shoots and signs of improvement, so they fasten on to things far too quickly.”Administrations in the UK, Germany and the US all have a “vested interest” in talking up a recovery, as elections loom. Media owners, too, are trying to talk up demand to encourage more up-front ad bookings, at a time when most advertisers are buying media space at the last minute.So while the first part of the stock market rally of recent months was understandable out of relief that “Armageddon didn’t happen”, the second leg is “more questionable”.In the first half of this year, only Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Poland provided growth for WPP. The world’s largest advertising and communications group by sales saw its revenue fall 8.3 per cent in that period. Sir Martin has admitted the group should have cut costs faster than it did but says staffing is now better aligned with the sales drop; headcount had been reduced by about 8 per cent at the end of August.“In the short term we are looking to costs …In the long term we are all about new markets, new media and consumer insight,” he says. He expects Asia, particularly India and China, to lead the world out of recession, followed by North America and then western Europe.But while WPP has interests worldwide, other UK-based media businesses – such as ITV – are not so fortunate. “If you are a single-medium company in a single country, you have lots of headaches,” Sir Martin says.That will force mergers between different kinds of media owners, on both a regional and national level.“There has to be more consolidation, it’s inevitable. These organisations cannot continue at these levels of profitability. The pain suffered in newspapers, magazines and free-to-air television is so great there is no other way, or a lot more of them will go into bankruptcy.”The presence of the BBC in the UK means the pressure on these media is even greater here than elsewhere, he says.“In a way, the BBC is getting close to being in a Google position in the UK,” Sir Martin says. “It’s becoming increasingly dominant.”James Murdoch’s criticism of the BBC in his MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh TV festival was “right on”, says Sir Martin.“As James raised in his lecture, it’s a question about what we want as consumers. Are we prepared to rely on the BBC to this extent? We have to decide whether having a healthy non-BBC sector is important.”Sir Martin also backs Murdoch senior’s push into charging for news online. Advertising isn’t enough to sustain such titles alone on the web, he says. “There isn’t enough advertising to go around in a more fragmented media model.”But it is not all gloom for traditional media. Television pricing is at its cheapest for a decade, which is luring back big advertisers. “The balance of cost between online and offline has shifted in offline’s favour,” Sir Martin says. “Online has always been cheap, offline has looked relatively expensive.”Five large events should spur media spending in 2010, including the World Cup in South Africa, the Winter Olympics in Vancouver and the Shanghai Expo. These “mini-quadrennials” should add 1 per cent to advertising growth next year, which Sir Martin says should be just enough to stop WPP’s revenue falling into negative terrain.But Sir Martin – who famously described the last recession as bath shaped – sounds half-hearted when he describes this downturn as L-shaped. “The L signifies we probably won’t go back to where we were before and signifies that the pre-slump situation was a bubble,” he says. “But I don’t think this applies so much for the south or east …The alphabet soup game is a little bit ridiculous.”"
172;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-09-10T20:27:14Z;Big media push for new tracking system;;Top US media companies, advertisers and advertising agencies have formed a new venture to investigate ways to measure viewers across TV, mobile phone and computer screens in a move that could upset Nielsen’s control on media tracking.The group, called the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement, comprises companies including Time Warner, News Corp, NBC Universal, CBS, Disney, Discovery and Viacom.Procter & Gamble, Unilever and AT&T have joined, as have advertising agencies owned by Interpublic Group, Starcom MediaVest, WPP and Omnicom.The venture, first reported in the FT last month, did not disclose funding. Initial funding for research is expected to reach about $1.5m, with provisions to request more if needed, people familiar with the venture say. The 14 participants are expected to contribute equally with the anticipation that funds would improve as participants are added.“Existing systems are incapable of accurately measuring the media habits of our audience across today’s multiplicity of platforms,” Jeff Zucker, chief executive of NBC Universal, said in a statement. “If we can’t measure our audience accurately, we can’t sell it.”The group’s formation is the culmination of decades of frustration with Nielsen, which controls the television viewer measurement through a sample of 18,000 US homes. But new technology has fragmented audiences, who now spend time consuming media on mobile phones and computers making them harder to track.Hanging in the balance is some $70bn spent on television advertising, which is expected to decline as marketers shift spending to online and other services.Nielsen has begun tracking the viewership of online videos in 375 of the 18,000 homes in Time Warner’s TV Everywhere programme that aims to offer more pay TV shows to subscribers with a full deployment across its sample by 2011.“Comprehensive and accurate measurement will have a direct effect on the continued growth of our industry,” said Jeffrey Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, which last month signed a seven-year agreement to provide tracking of TV, online and mobile viewership.Nielsen is unlikely to be invited to join the group given its dominance over television measurement, but will be invited to submit bids for new projects, these people say. Initially, the group will focus on accurately measuring viewership data from television set-top boxes and on cross platform measurement.The formation of the group stems from conversations between Mr Zucker and Peter Chernin, former News Corp chief operating officer, who also collaborated on Hulu, a joint venture of US broadcasters that has become the internet’s second most popular online video site behind YouTube. The coalition will be run as a separate body.
173;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-09-09T21:40:21Z;Companies plan to cut marketing agencies;;More companies are planning to reduce the number of marketing agencies they use as the outlook for advertising spending remains uncertain.A survey of 115 members of the Marketing Society, produced in conjunction with Royal Mail, found that over a quarter will consolidate their agency roster, although more than two-thirds will retain the same number of third-party agencies.In spite of claims by agency chiefs at Omnicom and Publicis that the advertising market had bottomed out, the survey gave little prospect of imminent recovery in spending.A quarter of marketers plan to cut their budgets in the next six months, while the same amount will increase their spending. Half will keep budgets the same into next year after what GroupM, a media agency, expects to be an 14 per cent fall in 2009 spending in the UK.Marketers are prioritising techniques that lift sales, as well as retaining and acquiring customers, rather than brand building, the survey found.Boosting their brands’ position in search engine results – seen as a cheap way to attract customers online – is a top priority for more than half of respondents. A quarter believe online display ads are most important, with a fifth looking to paid search ads.Direct mail, press campaigns and experiential marketing were also rated highly, with TV, radio, outdoor and cinema seen as lower priorities by most respondents.Online and direct marketing are cheaper in the short term, said Hugh Burkitt, chief executive of the Marketing Society. “But there are limitations on search …It helps for people to be looking for a brand rather than a category or product,” he said, which requires greater investment in other media, such as TV.Mr Burkitt added: “This year has been really savage on agencies. The shortage of money generally will continue for some time.”
174;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-08-30T18:35:38Z;Engine considers flotation;;Engine Group, one of the UK’s largest independent communications companies, expects to outperform the broader marketing industry in 2009 as it considers a possible stock market listing next year.After reporting organic revenue growth of 10 per cent in 2008, the company is expecting a flat financial performance this year. Carat, Aegis Group’s media agency, predicts that UK advertising spending will fall 7.1 per cent this year.Peter Scott, chairman and joint chief executive of Engine, says it could return to a 10 per cent growth rate in 2010 in the UK.“Once companies have been through that round of pretty aggressive cost cutting, marketing has to come back to the fore to drive demand and build value, because there is nothing else you can do. I think there will be a renaissance in marketing.”Growth will also come from gaining market share, Mr Scott added. Engine’s clients include Churchill Insurance, Royal Bank of Scotland and the government.Mr Scott is hoping to raise about £50m ($81m) either through an initial public offering or private equity investment. The funds would help Engine launch in the US, Europe, India and China.Mr Scott said that he had been talking to private equity groups since April.If by October those talks have not been fruitful, Engine would look at a possible flotation next spring.Engine is 78 per cent employee-owned. Loudwater Trust, a late-stage, pre-IPO fund, bought a 10 per cent stake in 2007.Including acquisitions, Engine saw revenue grow 53 per cent to £58.7m in 2008. But pre-tax profits of £2.1m in 2007 became a pre-tax loss of £1m in 2008 after a £3.1m exceptional charge relating to a lease write-off and £2m in share option charges.Mr Scott contrasts Engine’s “genuine integration” of marketing services – including advertising, design, PR and sponsorship – with that of much larger groups, such as WPP and Omnicom, which he says are too fragmented.“Clients are looking for a different model,” he said. “What worked in the 1990s when you had a dominant mass media doesn’t work in a time of media fragmentation.”
175;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-08-27T19:40:03Z;Out of the box;;In 2008, the only advertisement any marketer could talk about was Cadbury’s drumming gorilla. The advert was made for television but was also viewed millions of times on YouTube.Agencies were delirious at the crossover success to the video sharing site. Here, finally, was proof that traditional agencies could conquer the web with old-school marketing skills. Gorilla scooped the grand prix in film at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.By June this year, Cannes was a very different festival. For a start, the Croisette – normally packed with partying ad men – was deserted as agencies stayed away to nurse their shrinking budgets. But in any event, rather than television adverts winning awards for online work as Gorilla had, it was the online campaigns that impressed the judges across every category.The campaign that won the most awards was the web-led Tourism Queensland contest to fill “the best job in the world” – a caretaker on an “island paradise”. This word-of-mouth hit generated press coverage, including a BBC television documentary on the search for the winner, worth an estimated $100m (€70m, £62m) from a budget of just $1.2m.This digital discombobulation, combined with the recession, has taken its toll not only on advertising budgets and fees but also on the self-esteem of a vast industry, in which the top five global agency groups are expected by Jefferies, the investment bank, to earn revenues of $45bn this year, with the marketing services industry as a whole turning over $80bn.The sector is facing huge cyclical and structural upheavals. According to a forecast by GroupM, part of the WPP group that buys media space for clients, global advertising expenditure will fall 5.5 per cent to $417bn this year and a further 1.4 per cent in 2010. WPP, which ranks as the world’s largest communications group by revenues, this week disclosed that its profits had almost halved in the first half, further underlining the strain placed on the industry by the recession.But the very troubles faced by traditional agencies are providing opportunities for advertisers, which spend about $1,000bn a year with third-party marketing and communications agencies, according to estimates by Jefferies. Volkswagen, for example, chose to launch the latest version of its Golf GTi without using television or print advertising, relying almost entirely on free “buzz” online.“The tough times and the niche nature of the model got [VW] across the line to go pure digital,” says Mike Parsons, UK managing director of Tribal DDB, whose GTi website won a coveted mention on the BBC’s Top Gear motoring programme.“Software engineers are the new rock stars of marketing,” says Tom Bedecarré, chief executive of AKQA, a large independent digital agency – displacing the guru role usually afforded to creative directors and copywriters. But the swaggering confidence with which Don Draper – the creative director in Mad Men, the 1960s-set Madison Avenue television drama – seduced his clients has been lost.“Gone is the mood lighting – we are all under fluorescent lights,” says Liz Miller of the CMO Council, which represents marketing officers. “It is not a pretty time if you are looking to put on a lot of show and window-dressing.”Long-established agencies are floundering in a sea of social media, viral marketing, behavioural targeting and three-dimensional “augmented reality” (see left and below). They are reacting to these buzzwords, not coining them. And their businesses, little changed since Draper’s day, are ill-equipped to cope. “In the old world, agencies were way out in front of clients,” Mary Beth West, chief marketing officer at Kraft Foods, said in a panel debate in Cannes. “Now …clients are ahead of the agencies – and the consumer is ahead of all of us.”Economic pressures are making change in the marketing business more urgent, according to Jim Stengel, who as chief marketing officer of Procter & Gamble until last year was the industry’s biggest single client, before leaving to establish his own consultancy. As marketing budgets are increasingly spent on “service and utility and help for customers”, a smaller slice of the pie may be left for what agencies have traditionally done. “What was already a volatile and changing situation is just accelerating,” says Mr Stengel. However, he adds: “In the long term, it’s positive because I think it has opened people’s minds up to different ideas and models, and to taking more risks.”Some agency chiefs admit that their model is ill-suited to the internet age. Fernando Rodés Vilà, chief executive of Havas, the French agency group, says the old wartime metaphors of “campaign, target and launch” no longer apply. “The model that started with world war two was based on control in a few hands: very few media, two or three relevant brands in each sector and a few agencies,” he says. “We are [now] facing a very different panorama, which is much more democratic, much more social, much more interesting but much more difficult for marketers.”This change has been under way since well before the recession started to bite last year. Global advertising expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product has been falling since 2002. Up until then, it had risen and fallen in line with the broader economy since the 1970s, according to Robert Shaw, a professor at London’s Cass Business School. He blames the divergence on the shift of budgets to the internet. “The problem with online is that many of the [media] costs are so much lower that it’s dragging everything down,” he says. “But for agencies, the irony is that their costs are so much higher online than they were on television,” he adds. That eats into their profit margins.Because the internet audience is more fragmented, every pound spent on advertising space online costs almost three times more, in terms of time and labour, than it would if you spent it on traditional media, says Quentin George, chief digital officer at Interpublic’s Mediabrands.The traditional time-based billing model is tough to uphold when developing online campaigns, says Rich Silverstein, co-founder of Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, an agency owned by Omnicom, the global marketing giant. “The internet is so deep it’s like drilling for oil,” he says. “So far, I don’t think we’ve really charged for all the time we’ve put into it.”Agency chiefs bat off fears that their industry is in long-term decline, however. Sir Martin Sorrell , chief executive of WPP, says trends such as increasing globalisation and corporate social responsibility among clients will raise demand for marketing services. Maurice Lévy, his opposite number at Publicis of France, is confident margins can return to more than 16 per cent within three years – up from 13 per cent in the first half of 2009 – in part by creating contracts with more incentives based on performance. “As our clients are cutting fees and want more for less, we say ‘OK, but we want to be incentivised on performance. If you win, we win.’”Coca-Cola is one large advertiser that is already moving to performance-related pay with all its agencies. “From a client point of view, you don’t want to pay only for effort, you want to pay for results,” says Carol Kruse, vice-president for interactive marketing at the soft drinks group.If agencies are to avoid longer-term decline, experimentation in new models of remuneration and agency structure is only going to increase. Consultants at PwC do not expect global advertising spending to recover to 2006 levels until 2013, with internet advertising meanwhile more than doubling its share of budgets from 8.6 per cent to 18.7 per cent.In the past 20 years, “the ability to measure and control [marketing] spend has got so much more sophisticated”, says Mark Lund, chief executive of the UK government’s Central Office of Information, Britain’s biggest advertiser. “Overall expenditure has been allowed to go down. It’s not that people are marketing less well but it is being better planned.” Advertisers, which have long complained that half of their budget is wasted but they do not know which half, are now ensuring they get a better return on their investment.Agencies are responding by becoming more “catholic” in the services they provide, says Mr Lund. Or, as Chuck Brymer, chief executive of DDB (which is Omnicom’s largest agency and is employed by the Financial Times) puts it: “We are somewhat media-agnostic.” He says he prefers to focus on creative ideas rather than the medium.Within the traditional agency hierarchy, however, digital is only just emerging from the basement, having been relegated to the status of technical producer rather than ideas generator. Only now are digital agencies taking the lead on large client accounts.“The first year we attended Cannes we felt like we were aliens,” says Gaston Legorburu, executive director and creative officer at Sapient, a digital agency. “We were not considered to be a creative shop.” So Sapient acquired Nitro, the agency behind Tourism Queensland’s campaign, in one of the first instances of a digital specialist acquiring a traditional advertising company. “I don’t believe in the ‘self-proclaimed genius with a bunch of helpers’ structure that [many] agencies have,” he explains. “Trying to turn an old-school Madison Avenue institution into something different is a lot more difficult.”That is precisely the challenge facing David Eastman, worldwide digital director at JWT, one of the oldest agencies in the business. “It’s hard to get an advertising agency and an online agency working simpatico,” Mr Eastman says, because traditional agencies tend to see themselves as guardians of the brand, while interactive agencies approach briefs from the consumer’s perspective. “These are two fundamental opposing views which exist and are very much entrenched today.”For many traditional agencies, moving into digital will mean forming partnerships with technology groups that they once saw as their rivals – notably Google and Microsoft. While WPP’s Sir Martin describes Google as a “frenemy” – part friend, part foe – Publicis’s Mr Lévy has cosied up to the two internet giants in part by buying a digital agency (Performics and Razorfish respectively) from each.More prosaically, Interpublic is working with Microsoft to build an automated system for planning and buying media space. Most agencies still use Excel spreadsheets and fax machines, with the process oiled, as ever, by long client lunches. But technological improvements more profound than binning the fax are required if holding companies are to increase their efficiency, says John Farrell, until last month a member of Publicis’ executive committee.“I can’t think of many other industries where the fundamental process of producing the product hasn’t changed for 40 years,” he says.AUGMENTED REALITY: ‘IT’S ABOUT CREATING A BUZZ’Advertising agencies are always on the lookout for new ways to capture consumers’ imagination. “Augmented reality” is one of the latest technologies that shows how far agencies have moved on from producing 30-second television commercials, writes Tim Bradshaw.A “marker” on a printed page can be “read” by a webcam-enabled personal computer a bit like a barcode. A three-dimensional virtual object appears on the screen, suspended like a hologram over the image of the page.Car manufacturers such as BMW and Toyota have used the technique to show off their latest models. Paramount Pictures, the film distributor, used 3D graphics to publicise Transformers 2 and Star Trek.“It’s about creating buzz and getting people involved,” says Chris Jenkins of Tribal DDB, the interactive agency that created the example used on this page. “It’s a startling reaction because it’s something no one has seen before.”With some markers, when used in conjunction with a mobile phone, consumers can look “through” the handset to the objects behind. Extra information can also be overlaid on the picture displayed. Applications for Apple’s iPhone already do this to direct people to their nearest London Underground station.Mr Jenkins says augmented reality could be combined with data about the viewer to create highly targeted advertising. At the moment, “a billboard gives the same message to everyone who sees it” but ultimately, “what you see can be tailored to you personally”.Additional reporting by Sarah Halls
176;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-08-26T07:38:20Z;WPP suffers ‘severe’ drop in profitability;;WPP, the world’s largest marketing and communications group by revenues, reported a “severe” fall in first-half profitability and warned that growth was unlikely in 2010.WPP’s operating margin, a closely-watched metric among analysts, fell to 8 per cent from 13.6 per cent in the first half of last year, below market expectations of about 10 per cent.“I think we’d have to admit we should have moved quicker” in cutting costs, Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive, told the Financial Times.After pre-tax profits almost halved in the six months to June 30, falling 47 per cent to £179m ($291m), WPP said that profitability would improve in the second half and that results for July indicated a “less-worse” picture.But in spite of a rallying stock market, Sir Martin said, “I don’t think we’ve yet had a fundamental change in the pattern of investment in branding amongst our clients yet …It may well be that we lag the upturn.”WPP had planned for a 4 per cent drop in like-for-like revenues in the first half but on Wednesday reported revenues (excluding the impact of currencies and acquisitions) down 8.3 per cent to £4.29bn. The revenue drop intensified in the second quarter, particularly in the US and UK, with the greatest like-for-like fall in its “consumer insight” division, down 10.3 per cent, which includes Taylor Nelson Sofres, the market research business for which WPP paid more than £1bn last year.Analysts at Numis Securities said the figures suggested revenues fell 11 per cent in both May and June. That compares with like-for-like second quarter declines of 11 per cent year-on-year at Omnicom, 9 per cent at Publicis and 15 per cent at Interpublic, WPP’s rivals.WPP is confident that its costs are now “better balanced” with the decline in revenues. By July, staffing was down by 7 per cent on the previous year.WPP tentatively expects revenues to remain level next year, in spite of a boost from large events such as the Winter Olympics and the football World Cup, which were largely absent this year.Western Europe is the “toughest region in the world” facing the “slowest growth rate out of the recession”, Sir Martin said. As a result, WPP is focusing on faster-growth markets such as Brazil and China, digital marketing and data services.The company did not launch an equity fundraising to shore up its credit rating, as some analysts had feared.WPP held its dividend flat at 5.19p per share.…………………………………………….Cost of failing to act quicklyWPP’s failure to cut costs fast enough to cope with the recession has reopened questions about how easy it is to manage large marketing holding groups.Groups such as Omnicom, Publicis, Interpublic and WPP are all comprised of many small agencies, with varying degrees of integration and co-ordination by their parent. Even when bosses such as Sir Martin Sorrell foresee revenue contractions ahead, subsidiary agencies are not always responsive to demands to cut staff and other overheads.“It’s not like GM saying they are going to shut down a factory or a line. They can make a decision based on macro-economic factors quite easily,” says Anthony de Larrinaga, media analyst at Jefferies. “[Advertising] is not a homogeneous business, it’s a people-based business. It’s difficult to micromanage tens of thousands of staff.”Budgets are typically set by canvassing individual agency chiefs, who may be misled or flattered by ebullient clients. WPP said on Wednesday that as recently as last November it was budgeting for flat revenues in 2009.After missing budgets for each of the first five months of 2009, only in June were costs brought into line with revenues.“With the benefit of hindsight,” said Sir Martin, “you would have taken out more cost in the fourth quarter of 2008.The higher costs and longer timescales of cutting jobs in western Europe, compared with the rest of the world, was also a significant factor in higher-than-expected severance costs, he said.
177;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-08-14T21:30:01Z;Pessimism still swirls around WPP’s outlook;;"Investors in WPP have had an unsettling week as the world’s largest marketing and communications group found itself on the defensive.Arch-rival Publicis Groupesnapped up Razorfish, Microsoft’s digital agency in which WPP had also shown an interest. And analysts at Morgan Stanley and UBS stirred market concern about whether WPP needed to launch an equity fundraising to protect its credit rating.The Razorfish news triggered an initial rally in WPP shares as it eased worries that the group might take on more debt or issue shares to do a deal. The broker notes then undercut the shares before a rally left them broadly unchanged over the week.But there remain some questions over the outlook for WPP. While its share price has rallied 17 per cent since the start of 2009 and has outperformed the FTSE 100, it has underperformed some of its peers.Shares in Havas are 33 per cent higher, adjusted for currency fluctuations, while Aegis has gained 25 per cent and Publicis 22 per cent. Omnicom has gained 13.7 per cent.Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, has been more pessimistic on the industry outlook than some of his peers, warning since June’s annual meeting that any green shoots in the economy were not finding their way into marketing budgets. At the Cannes Lions advertising festival later that month, he told the Financial Times that WPP would find it tough to meet the margin targets it set itself at the beginning of the year.In contrast, other media companies have sought to reassure the market that the worst is over.Publicis and Omnicom called the bottom of the advertising market last month, alongside media owners such as ITV and JC Decaux, the outdoor advertising company. Analysts concur; Bernstein Research said this week that the first quarter of 2009 “was indeed the trough in advertising growth” in the US, the largest advertising market.But the ad market is forecast by Group M, WPP’s own media agency, to fall 5.5 per cent globally this year, with a further contraction of 1.4 per cent in 2010.While marketers have finally cut their budgets as much as they can – which is what has cheered Maurice Lévy of Publicis and John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive – Sir Martin says they are unlikely to rise off the bottom until well into next year. The second half may look as if it’s improving, but that’s only because comparisons with last year’s figures will be easier in the second half of this year than they were in the first.The absence of underlying growth is what worries the credit rating agencies. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s rate WPP’s debt just two notches above junk on a negative outlook.“Agencies hold client money as part of doing business, so clients might become jittery if they felt their agency’s financial rating was under pressure,” said Patrick Kirby, analyst at Deutsche Bank.Concern that WPP’s debt-to-earnings ratio might deteriorate below the rating agencies’ targets in 2010 prompted UBS to downgrade the stock from ‘buy’ to ‘neutral’ last week.“We do continue to see [long-term] upside,” said UBS in its note, with WPP’s valuation “still well below” the previous trough. “However, given the risk of weak interim results and potential equity raising, there may be better entry points.”A £500m placing, while unlikely, would dilute existing shareholders by about 7 per cent, UBS said.Morgan Stanley agreed that WPP is a “potential candidate to rebalance leverage with equity”. It forecasts WPP’s net debt to reach three times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in 2010, double what its analysts say is the “optimal” gearing for an agency.It is a moot point whether WPP would have been able to top Publicis’s $530m (£321m) winning bid for Razorfish, which operates in the fast-growing digital advertising market.But misgivings about Razorfish’s profitability, rather than concerns about WPP’s balance sheet, may have convinced Sir Martin not to outbid Publicis.It was not the race for Razorfish, but Reed Elsevier’s £824m capital raising last month that piqued investors’ concerns about WPP’s balance sheet.Goldman Sachs firmly rebutted such speculation on Wednesday, noting that WPP was well within its debt covenants and had raised sufficient funds from its recent bond and convertible issuances to pay down the £650m debt due in July 2010, owed for the purchase of Taylor Nelson Sofres, the market research group, last year.While WPP could face a single-notch downgrade before the end of the year, Goldman analysts said “a reduction to below investment grade is unlikely and would require a significant further macro deterioration”.TNS itself could prove to be a greater problem. “Market research generally has turned out to be more cyclical than was expected to be at the start of the year,” said Mr Kirby.WPP’s interim results on August 26 are likely to show a 10 per cent decline in second-quarter revenue with an operating margin falling close to single digits, down about 300 basis points on the first half of last year, due to severance and TNS integration costs.“They are going to be really bad numbers but they are unlikely to surprise negatively,” said one analyst, who asked not to be named. “People have got comfort with these issues.”"
178;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-07-30T19:21:37Z;Partnership urged to take rapid action;;Advertising agencies are urging Microsoft and Yahoo to accelerate their search partnership if the two technology companies are to counterbalance the dominance of Google.Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the world’s largest communications group by revenue, welcomed the long-awaited deal, unveiled this week.“It’s good news for clients, good news for agencies and good news for regulators,” Sir Martin told the Financial Times. “But the quicker it happens the better … It is important that Bing instantly moves its market share.”Others agree that the planned two-year integration process – which will see Microsoft’s Bing search engine power Yahoo’s search pages while Yahoo sells search ads on both – is too long.“The risk in those two years is making sure that Microsoft and Yahoo don’t lose focus,” said Nick Beil, chief executive of Performics, the search engine marketing agency which Publicis, the French agency group, bought from Google last year. “Google will continue to innovate.”That means that Performics will not shift its spending pattern – in which Google receives “the lion’s share” – in the near term, Mr Beil said.Faced with a more formidable competitor, Google may increase its focus on search even more.That would be good news for traditional agencies, who have been wary of Google’s forays beyond internet advertising, such as into TV and radio.The combination of Yahoo and Microsoft’s search efforts will be particularly important to smaller advertisers.Small and medium-sized businesses have not always found it easy to move from buying a listing in a directory to the technical aspects of search marketing.“For a lot of mid-sized and smaller companies, the additional effort of managing campaigns across three different search engines wasn’t worth it,” said Alex Hoye, chief executive of Latitude, an independent search agency. “In the US it certainly becomes worth it [now].”The same may not be true elsewhere. Google’s dominance in the UK and parts of western Europe may be little dented by an enlarged Bing. But Microsoft’s strong balance sheet will leave it better placed to change that than Yahoo would.If the alliance succeeds, a stronger competitor to Google could accelerate the decline in costs of buying search terms already initiated by the downturn.“From our point of view and for the broader technology and media industry it’s a sigh of relief,” said Mike Parsons, managing director at Tribal DDB, an Omnicom-owned digital agency.The increased importance of Bing could also make Razorfish, Microsoft’s digital agency, more appealing to potential acquirers. Microsoft has begun a second round of due diligence ahead of a potential sale of Razorfish, with WPP, Publicis and Dentsu all mulling a deal, according to people familiar with the process.
179;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-07-23T20:34:36Z;Dow breaks 9,000 as US stocks soar;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 9,000 points on Thursday to a record high for the year as corporate profits continued to please US investors and drive stocks higher.Two pieces of takeover news also boosted confidence in the health of corporate America on another busy day of earnings news.Bristol-Myers Squibb, the drugmaker, easily beat profit estimates and raised its full-year outlook.The company also said it would buy smaller rival Medarex for $2.4bn, a deal it estimated would improve its earnings by 2-3 cents a share in 2009. Bristol-Myers rose 2.8 per cent to $20.86 and Medarex soared 89.2 per cent to $15.89.Amazon announced its expansion into the clothing sector with a $928m deal for privately-held Zappos.com, the online shoe retailer.
The shares rose 5.7 per cent to $93.87.Amazon’s rival Ebay further boosted market sentiment after sales and profits topped estimates. The shares climbed 10.6 per cent to $21.52.Two smaller healthcare companies added to Bristol-Myers’ gains, helping the sector outperform the broader market.Rival drugmaker Celgene jumped 18.6 per cent to $55.97 after it beat estimates for its profits and said a test showed that a blood cancer drug could be used earlier in a patients’ treatment than thought.Intuitive Surgical surged 26.8 per cent to $215.37 after profits that were 26 per cent better than analysts’ forecasts as sales of its robotic system for surgery easily beat expectations.Ford showed signs of strength from the US consumer as it reported a smaller operating loss and cash-burn rate than exppected. Its shares gained 9.4 per cent to $6.98.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.3 per cent up at 976.29, while the Dow rose 2.1 per cent to 9,069.29 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.5 per cent to 1,973.60.“The markets broke through a key resistance level,” said Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group. “Now the S&P can get to 1,100 before you get significant resistance.”But Richard Hughes, co-president of Portfolio Management Consultants, warned: “Much of this is fuelled by short covering. Some see signs of stabilisation in spending, but with the exception of tech stocks most companies have not seen revenue growth.”Economic data gave further fuel to the rally. The number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits unexpectedly fell and sales of existing homes rose more than expected.This helped homebuilders rally strongly as DR Horton climbed 7.6 per cent to $11.17 and Lennar gained 6 per cent to $11.26.But the session was dominated by earnings news, with two companies in particular boosting the Dow.Strong sales at 3M helped the maker of Post-It Notes easily beat revenue and profit expectations. The shares picked up 7.4 per cent to $69.43.AT&T, the telecoms company, also beat expectations, helped by strong sales of Apple’s iPhone, which in the US operates only on the AT&T network. The stock advanced 2.6 per cent to $25.48.But McDonald’s injected an element of caution as the restaurant group’s revenues missed Wall Street expectations and analysts warned that its results were a sign of continued weakness from the US consumer. McDonald’s shares fell
4.6 per cent to $56.09.Omnicom, the advertising conglomerate, and UPS, the parcel deliverer, experienced continuing declines in revenue and profits, suggesting business spending remained constrained.But both reversed early losses as the rally gathered steam and Omnicom closed up 0.4 per cent at $34.56 and UPS was 2.3 per cent higher at $53.51.There were mixed results from banks as both Huntington Bancshares and Fifth Third reported their earnings. Investors remain concerned over future write-offs from bad loans. Huntington more than tripling the reserves set aside for such losses and Fifth Third saw an 82 per cent rise in net charge-offs.Huntington fell 4.9 per cent to $3.73 but Fifth Third, which made a smaller operating loss than expected, jumped 14.3 per cent to $8.01."
180;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-07-23T19:47:13Z;Omnicom;;"At a time when capitalism is being questioned as never before, a company that boasts of a “constructive disruption of conventional thinking” looks like a prime candidate for where it all went wrong. Unless consumption is outlawed, however, the likes of Omnicom– one of the world’s biggest advertising and marketing companies – are here to stay.However, that does not mean consumption has to rebound any time soon. And what clients deem essential versus discretionary spending can change rapidly.Thus it is no surprise that in the middle of a recession Omnicom’s second-quarter results were weak. Half of the decline in overall revenues came from “non-core” businesses such as recruitment, not-for-profit marketing and event and sports marketing, all of which saw revenues plummet. Its “core” advertising and marketing bits were down about 8 per cent and 10 per cent year on year respectively, after accounting for a strong dollar. The twin deaths in Detroit did not help either.That said, Omnicom’s disparate network did very well to keep margins more or less steady. The bigger issue therefore is growth. Management reckons this second quarter marks the low point for revenues.Stripping out currency effects, as well as gains and losses from acquisitions, a fair base for Omnicom’s quarterly revenues is about $3bn, with a net income margin of between 8 and 10 per cent. Assuming no top-line growth for the rest of the year and 5 per cent quarterly growth next, a stock trading on 10 times 2010 earnings sounds attractive. But that scenario requires a strong economic recovery. Without one, not only can Omnicom forget about the non-core businesses, but clients who have largely bet on a V-shaped recovery will begin a fresh assault on costs, including advertising and marketing.

181;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-07-09T22:22:06Z;Dentsu joins Razorfish fray;;Dentsu, the largest advertising group in Japan, has jumped into the fray as Microsoft opened the books to bidders for its Razorfish agency this week.WPP and Publicis, the rival communications groups, had already been considering an offer for Razorfish, a digital marketing specialist which could fetch around $600m to $700m.Morgan Stanley has been overseeing a due diligence process for Microsoft in New York, ahead of a potential sale of the agency, which Microsoft acquired as part of its $6bn acquisition of aQuantive two years ago. Dentsu has now hired advisers as it considers a bid, which would help it broaden its business outside Japan and in faster-growing online markets.It is not clear that Microsoft is determined to pursue a sale, nor that any agency will proceed to a bid. Razorfish’s revenues are expected to fall this year from around $400m in 2008, with profits also lower, according to people close to the situation.Analysts note that this is not an ideal time to sell any advertising business, even though digital has fared better than traditional marketing in the downturn. Zenith Optimedia, Publicis’ media agency, this week said it expected global advertising spending to fall 8.5 per cent this year, with only a “mild” global recovery of 1.6 per cent growth in 2010.Any move from Dentsu would mark a departure for the group, which already runs a digital agency in partnership with Razorfish in Japan. Dentsu generates less than 10 per cent of its sales from outside Japan, making it less internationally diversified than rivals such as WPP, Publicis and Omnicom. Its most recent US agency acquisition, McGarry Bowen in New York, while relatively large for Dentsu, was much smaller than Razorfish. Terms of last November’s deal were not disclosed.In a recent note to clients, analysts at Macquarie Research said: “We believe that Dentsu understands its only true path to growth is overseas expansion. However, we also expect that the company will continue to take a very cautious approach to such expansion.”As in the rest of the large media markets, Japanese advertising agencies face a structural shift of advertising revenues from traditional media to the internet.Macquarie said that Dentsu’s execution on developing a digital strategy had “not been particularly good thus far”. “The internet does not represent a growth strategy for Dentsu, but rather something the company needs to do in order to just stand still,” analysts said.Publicis, headquartered in France, said that it could put funds from last month’s refinancing towards acquisitions of digital assets. Analysts see it as the frontrunner in any bid for Razorfish.But WPP has less balance sheet flexibility after its £1.2bn acquisition of Taylor Nelson Sofres, a market research firm, last year. One analyst said that even after its recent bond issue, a move for Razorfish outright could be “overstretching”.“The market is expecting banks to demand higher covenants,” the analyst said. “The last thing institutions are going to want to do is revisit WPP with more equity.”It was reported last summer that WPP was considering an asset swap with Microsoft for Razorfish, in exchange for elements of 24/7 Real Media, the advertising technology group for which WPP paid $649m in 2007.Dentsu, Publicis, WPP and Microsoft all declined to comment.Additional reporting by Robin Harding
182;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-06-29T22:11:15Z;Adverts mark a seismic shift to digital;;"For the past 55 years, The Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival has celebrated the best creative work in television produced by agencies around the world.But this year saw a seismic shift, with the focus at Cannes firmly on digital work. The film “grand prix”, announced on Saturday, went to an interactive online video by Tribal DDB, a digital agency, for a Philips TV set. Barack Obama’s presidential election campaign also won a grand prix award for its ground-breaking use of digital marketing to build grassroots support.“The Cyber Lions [digital advertising awards] are catching up and winning more and more audience, and more and more interest,” said Maurice Lévy, chief executive of Publicis Groupe, the French marketing group. “We still have a lot of people who are thinking first TV, first [the] 30-second commercial. It’s critically important we shift gear to digital.”The downturn has accelerated the move of advertisers’ budgets into digital media. PwC, the professional services firm, expects 19 per cent of ad spending to be on internet and mobile by 2013, from 12 per cent last year. “There is clearly an inflection point shift in digital,” said Mark Pritchard, global marketing officer at Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest advertiser. “I think that has been evident this entire week. Now we are really starting to figure out how to integrate digital into the rest of the mix.”Michael Mendenhall, chief marketing officer at Hewlett-Packard, said that online campaigns can be less intrusive than other advertising. “Marketers want to move from interruptive to engagement. They can do that more effectively in the digital space.”Underlining digital’s shift from the fringes of advertising to its heart was the acquisition by Sapient, a digital specialist, of Nitro, the traditional Australian ad agency.Dozens of digital shops have been absorbed into larger traditional agencies, but Sapient’s $50m deal was the first time a digital group took over a traditional agency.“It is some of the oldest stodgiest agencies who still hold the [client] relationships,” said Gaston Legorburu, chief creative officer at Sapient. “We had to break down some of those barriers.”Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the world’s largest marketing group by sales, suggested at Cannes that the “lure of online” is that it is cheaper, at a time when there is a “premium on efficiency”. Absolute costs can be 10 or 20 per cent of TV spending, he said.Google has managed to build what some estimate is the world’s most valuable brand with a miniscule investment in traditional advertising. “In general we have not needed to [advertise],” Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive, told Mr Lévy in an on-stage interview at Cannes. “We have chosen to pretty much operate from an end-user referral basis.” WPP and Publicis, like most agencies, aim to increase the share of revenues from online advertising. But the shift to digital poses problems for advertising groups: as well as eating into media spending due to the power of word-of-mouth or “viral” campaigns, digital advertising usually commands lower margins.Steve Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft and recipient of the “media person of the year” award in Cannes, told delegates that advertising spending was unlikely to grow as a proportion of gross domestic product over the next 10 years as all media becomes digital.Publicis and WPP’s chiefs disagree. But studies suggest digital is already dragging down budgets. Bryan Finn, a marketing consultant and economist, said that from the 1970s until 2000, every 1 per cent increase in GDP led to a 1.3 to 1.4 per cent increase in advertising spending; since 2000, and the rapid rise in online advertising, that correlation has reversed.But Chuck Brymer, chief executive of DDB Worldwide, owned by Omnicom, is confident that agencies can raise margins in digital as they move from building banner ads to being the centre of clients’ strategies.“If we are looking at creating ideas first in the digital arena, as the tip of the spear, the margin from those ideas is the same [as in traditional advertising],” he said. “We are charging for the ideas – that is the value you [as an agency] provide.”"
183;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-06-28T22:33:25Z;Microsoft puts Razorfish up for sale;;Microsoft has appointed Morgan Stanley to find a potential buyer for Razorfish, its digital agency.Publicis, the French marketing company that says it is planning more acquisitions in online advertising, is thought to be a possible bidder.Microsoft acquired the agency, formerly called Avenue A Razorfish, as part of its $6bn takeover of aQuantive in 2007.One analyst valued Razorfish at $600m-$700m, based on sales of about $400m last year and profit margins for similar businesses of 12-13 per cent.The analyst said: “Much more than that would be overpaying”, adding that even in digital marketing, valuations had fallen since last year, when Advertising Age trade magazine reported a valuation of $800mIn August, two years after the aQuantive deal, more favourable tax implications will provide an opportunity for Microsoft to sell an asset some view as a conflict of interest with Microsoft Advertising, which sells technology to rival agencies.Microsoft declined to comment.Razorfish, which has headquarters in Seattle, is one of the largest digital agencies, with 2,000 employees. Clients include Audi, Nike and Kraft.Maurice Lévy, Publicis chief executive, said funds from a refinancing this month could be used for acquisitions, particularly in digital and emerging markets, which are performing better than traditional advertising in the US and Europe.“There are some opportunities” for acquisitions, he said.“Obviously if we can take advantage of the current situation to be ready to take these things, it’s good.”Publicis had previously said that its issuance of €719m ($1bn) in convertible bonds was related to a refinancing due in 2012.Mr Lévy said there was currently a “window where it looks like it is relatively easy to raise money” even if there was no “immediate need”.He did not name potential targets and declined to comment on whether he would be interested in acquiring Razorfish.But one analyst, who asked not to be named, said: “Publicis would be willing to look at everything. It has the best balance sheet and the most to do.” Razorfish is “the more likely name”.Publicis and Microsoft Advertising on Friday announced a broad strategic agreement, including Publicis’s VivaKi unit using Microsoft technology to place targeted advertising on television set-top boxes.Other agency groups, such as Omnicom and WPP, which are facing the same structural shift of marketing budgets into digital, could also be interested in Razorfish.
184;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-06-22T01:21:20Z;Budget cuts cloud Cannes ad party;;The advertising industry’s annual week of backslapping and partying in Cannes is set to be a more subdued affair this year as agencies struggle to redefine themselves in a period of digital disruption and slashed budgets.Attendance at the Cannes Lions, which opens this week, is expected to be down at least 40 per cent compared with last year, according to its organisers.While there has been a last-minute rush of delegate registrations, some in the industry suggest that could be conservative. Many agencies, such as BBH and TBWA in London, are not sending any staff at all.Others are swapping the usual lavish yachts and beach parties for big-name seminars they hope will cast their agency in a more favourably light for clients, who have started joining admen in Cannes in recent years.“We are a profile industry,” one US agency chief told the Financial Times, so Cannes is an opportunity for clients to see agencies taking themselves seriously. The chief added: “I don’t want some reporter writing that I’m sitting by the pool at the Carlton [hotel]” in the current economic climate.Another London agency head said: “It is in bad taste to go to Cannes when we are laying people off.”Microsoft, the festival’s lead sponsor, has forgone last year’s €220,000-a-week, ($310,000-a-week) 132-foot yacht and lavish party, instead hosting an intimate onshore gathering for 300 guests.DDB, the Omnicom agency, has cancelled what is one of the week’s biggest beach bashes. Instead it will host a seminar with David Plouffe, Barack Obama’s campaign manager.This year is also the first in the Lions’ 55-year history to see the addition of a PR category. The PR industry sees the festival as an opportunity to prove its worth, says Tony Burgess-Webb, chief marketing officer at Hill & Knowlton.H&K is hosting a seminar with Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter, the white-hot social network.“Twitter exemplifies the challenge to traditional marketing communications thinking which these new communications platforms represent,” Mr Burgess-Webb said. “This is just the start.”One chief marketing officer from a large technology company attending the event said traditional agency roles were challenged by the transition of budgets from traditional media to digital, which is expected to accelerate in the recession.“We believe the centre of the [marketing] ecosystem is now online, not the 30-second spot. What the macro-economic environment has done is put pressure on marketing communities to move more quickly in this direction,” the marketing chief said.Many advertising agencies and their parent companies were struggling to make the switch to putting digital strategies at the centre of their advice to clients, he said.
185;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-06-07T22:38:36Z;Clear Channel confident of debt solution;;The private equity owners of Clear Channel Communications are confident of winning a stand-off with lenders to the heavily indebted radio and outdoor advertising group, according to the newly-appointed head of its international business.William Eccleshare, appointed on Thursday just as some lenders threatened to turn down a proposed debt exchange aimed at averting a breach of its banking covenants, said: “I’ve clearly done my due diligence and I believe it’s a very sound situation”.Mr Eccleshare also played down speculation among some lenders and industry executives that Clear Channel could seek to lighten its $20bn debt load by selling the international outdoor advertising business he has been appointed to run.He said: “I’ve had a lot of conversations with the private equity partners and I genuinely believe my appointment reflects their commitment and confidence in this business”.Nobody had discussed a possible sale with him, he added.Thomas H Lee Partners and Bain Capital Partners, the private equity groups that completed the troubled $23.8bn buy-out last July, did not want to “cut and run”, Mr Eccleshare said.Instead, they had the appetite and resources to back a growth strategy featuring acquisitions and investment. His comments are the first by a Clear Channel executive since tensions with lenders surfaced over a proposed swap of some parent company debt for debt in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, the listed US billboard division.The exchange offer, in which Clear Channel Outdoor could repay a $2.5bn debt to the parent company, has not yet been formalised but some senior creditors say they will resist it in the hope that a breach of the company’s lending agreements might give them control of the group’s equity at a steep discount.A filing by the group on Thursday stated that it expected to be in compliance with covenants under its senior secured credit facilities in 2009 but admitted to “significant uncertainty” about its results and said there could be no assurance that it would be in compliance.The filing showed a 22.8 per cent drop in the group’s first-quarter revenues, led by a 29.4 per cent fall at the international outdoor advertising arm. Rising interest costs dragged the group from net income of $800m to a $418m loss in the period.But Mr Eccleshare said the group’s biggest growth opportunity lay in the international division, where it would look to expand in markets where it was weak.As television audiences fragmented and digital technology improved the appeal of the outdoor medium, “I think we have an opportunity to gain share of the advertising cake when the market picks up,” he added.Mr Eccleshare, a former McKinsey executive, was recruited from BBDO Europe, the Omnicom-owned advertising group that won the Mercedes-Benz account last year. Outdoor advertising was “the last great broadcast medium”, he said. “Brands need public media in which to breathe and gain fame, and it is very hard to find other media to deliver that.”
186;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-06-01T22:20:49Z;Advertising creditors play tense waiting game;;Advertising and media buying agencies are anxiously awaiting details of what marketing budget General Motors will be allowed in bankruptcy, as their exposure highlighted the risks to media businesses that are already struggling in a weak economy.GM was the third-largest advertiser in the US last year, after Procter & Gamble and AT&T, according to TNS Media Intelligence, which reported last month that its spending on measured media had risen 11.3 per cent in 2008 to $2.23bn.Yesterday, the list of GM’s trade creditors was topped by Starcom Media-Vest, with a claim of $122m, but this represented advertising space booked with broadcasters, publishers and other media owners but not yet paid for.“Sequential liability” clauses in its agreement with GM mean that, while Starcom has a small liability, media owners would have to petition the bankruptcy court directly for any unpaid bills.Publicis, Starcom’s French parent company, had a separate claim of $25.3m, connected to liabilities through its Digitas and Leo Burnett arms. Interpublic had a $15m claim, as well as exposure through agencies including McCann Erickson, Campbell-Ewald and Deutsch.The bankruptcy filing comes after the start of the “upfront” season, in which US broadcasters show their wares for the coming season and advertisers commit about half of their annual television spending.The season has been dogged by uncertainty about whether GM will be able to participate or not, but three marketing executives who asked not to be named said they expected the government’s auto task force to approve a marketing budget for GM.Chrysler, the smaller carmaker, was similarly granted $67m in marketing spending last month, and has used the Omnicom-owned BBDO Worldwide to launch a campaign with the message: “We’re building a new car company.”GM’s website now features a brand campaign called “GM re:invention” and the company has bought search terms such as “GM bankruptcy”.Investor nervousness about the extent of Madison Avenue’s dependence on Detroit has prompted Interpublic to state that its “worst-case” exposure to GM would be no more than $150m. Publicis has estimated its risk at €40m-€70m ($57m-$99m).Interpublic also struck a deal with lenders last month to stay within its debt covenants in the event of a GM bankruptcy, allowing it to exclude GM-related charges from earnings calculations in the loan agreements.Carmakers accounted for 9 per cent of all US media spending last year, according to TNS, even after domestic manufacturers cut their spending by 21.3 per cent to $5.51bn.
187;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-05-25T18:34:11Z;Sorrell bonus plan to face investor test;;The strength of the backlash against boardroom bonuses will be tested further next week when WPP asks investors to approve a scheme that could see its chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell earn as much as $95m (£60m).Known as the Leadership Equity Acquisition Plan III (Leap), the scheme has been put in the spotlight after the Association of British Insurers last week gave members a so-called “red top” warning, encouraging them to look closely at the scheme before approving it.That warning comes amid growing shareholder anger over remuneration and bonuses. Royal Dutch Shell shareholders last week voted against its executive pay plan.The WPP scheme will be put to a shareholder vote at its annual meeting in Ireland on June 2. The ABI said on Monday it had not recommended members vote against the scheme but urged they consider its “unique” structure.Under the five-year bonus scheme, which follows two previous Leap schemes, top executives are entitled to pledge up to 100 per cent of their target remuneration in shares.They are paid depending on how well WPP performs, measured by total shareholder return, against a group of nine companies. In 2008, these were Aegis, Arbitron, Dentsu, Gfk, Havas Advertising, Interpublic, Ipsos, Omnicom Group and Publicis.If the company performs very well, executives can get up to five times the amount of shares they invested. Sir Martin is entitled to invest a maximum of $19m in the scheme, giving him the possibility of earning $95m from it if WPP outperforms all nine companies.WPP, which claims to have more demanding performance criteria than other companies, said that its scheme differed from other bonus schemes because it required an investment from executives, and rewarded them for meeting goals over the long term (a five-year period).WPP said: “Consistent with previous Leap schemes, there’s no reward for failure.”If the company performs poorly, executives get nothing under the scheme. WPP cut its revenue growth forecast last month after Sir Martin had previously pledged to outperform most analysts’ forecasts.Even if UK investors oppose the scheme, the FTSE 100 company has a good chance of having it passed by foreign investors.
188;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-05-17T14:44:51Z;When it pays to open up to the competition;;Last week, nearly 300 people gathered in London with the express purpose of hacking Yahoo’s technology. But the internet giant did not call the police – it had called in the hackers itself.Yahoo was the first big internet company to host a “hack day” back in 2005, and it has now held such events all over the world.Most companies would not dream of allowing a group of strangers in to poke around under the hoods of their products. But Yahoo was built on the technological principles of open source – which means that anybody can see the underlying code on which a piece of software is based and thus improve it.“Opening stuff up can enable employees of Yahoo to collaborate [internally] more easily and collaborate with third parties,” says David Filo, Yahoo’s co-founder. “Open is something, I think, that will continue to drive a lot of innovation.”It has allowed, for instance, collaborations with competitors such as Google and MySpace, allowing Yahoo users to transfer new content and services from them to a personalised Yahoo homepage.Indeed, at a time when many companies’ investments in innovation are being cut, technology and media companies are showing that there can be advantages in harnessing the ideas of customers or even competitors.The principle has been extended beyond technology and applied to organisational structures. For instance, new kinds of advertising agencies are springing up that replace the vast, all-encompassing networks of WPP or Omnicom with something more informal and ad hoc.“Digital [networking] allows and feeds a freelance marketplace, because I can rapidly find experts,” says Piers Fawkes, co-founder of PSFK, an informal network of trend-watchers and creative types around the world. Feedback from 400,000 monthly readers of PSFK’s blog informs the consulting work it does for Apple, BMW and Coca-Cola, while regular conferences and “salons” further aid networking.Websites such as Twitter have also been instrumental in making it possible to find and maintain such loose connections.Mr Fawkes likens the new agency model to a film production company with a central “superproducer” to pick up talent as and when required. “If you have a superproducer, you don’t have to staff up,” he says. Without a team of, say, TV advertising makers to support, recommendations for clients are unbiased.More established advertising agencies are also experimenting with the loosely coupled network model. Ben Fennell, BBH’s UK chief executive, describes the agency’s BBH Labs as the collision of technology and idea generation: “We are pioneering new ways that we might work in social networking, open source creative working, creating virtual networks of creative communities.”As well as coming up with more interesting ideas, the Labs concept could also lower an agency’s overheads in permanent staff, office space and support functions, and increase flexibility.Ben Malbon, managing partner at BBH Labs in New York, says the Labs were inspired by working with Google. “They only ever do half the work, their whole model is based on collaboration, outsourcing and crowd-sourcing.”It also works on the mantra that no matter where you work, there are always more smart people somewhere else. “Rather than trying to hoard all the great people in the building, all we need to know is that we know the best people,” he says. “We spend a third of our time meeting people who we’d never normally meet because we never thought we’d need their help.”That could also mean involving more people in the product development process. BBH Labs used itself as a test case by “crowd-sourcing” its own logo, attracting 1,740 submissions on Crowdspring, a site facilitating open calls for creative services work.But in spite of its popularity, the experiment brought accusations of exploitation or commoditising creative work, and the sheer volume of entries made the process more labour-intensive than BBH expected. “In the quest for quality from the crowd, two of the bigger problems we face are around pride and payment,” says Mr Malbon.
189;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-05-15T22:00:09Z;Financial ad spend slump hits Havas;;Marketing budget cuts among financial clients dented revenues at Havas, the French communications group revealed on Friday.First-quarter sales declined 8.4 per cent on an organic basis to €325m at Havas, where Vincent Bolloré is chairman and largest shareholder.Financial services companies cut their marketing spending 20 per cent, while revenues from healthcare clients fell 11 per cent. North America bore the brunt of the cuts, with revenues down 9.2 per cent, excluding acquisitions and currency effects.While Havas’ European business fell 7.6 per cent, the UK was relatively resistant, down 1.6 per cent, thanks to growth at Havas Media and Euro RSCG, its media-buying and creative agencies respectively.The loss of the Dell account last June continues to weigh in Asia, where sales fell 24.7 per cent.New account wins, including GSK, Novartis, China Telecom and Sprint, offset the loss of two large contracts with Carrefore and Radio Shack. Net new business of €507m was modestly lower than in the first quarter of 2008.Havas’ sales decline compares with 7.4 per cent growth in the same period last year. But after outperforming its rivals with its 2008 results, Havas is showing a weaker start to 2009. Publicis Groupe, France’s largest advertising company, reported a 4.4 per cent fall in revenues.WPP, the world’s largest agency group by revenues, saw an organic sales decline of 5.8 per cent in the first quarter, as Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive, cut his forecasts for the year.Omnicom reported a 6.6 per cent organic revenue decline, while US rival Interpublic’s sales fell 5.6 per cent.The advertising market is expected to decline between 4 and 7 per cent this year.
190;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-05-07T12:31:06Z;JCDecaux expects fall in revenues;;JCDecaux, the world’s second largest outdoor advertising group, warned that revenues and profitability would be below expectations in the first half of 2009.The Paris-based group said that first-quarter sales fell 11.9 per cent overall, below analysts’ forecasts.Jean-Charles Decaux, chairman and co-chief executive, said in a statement on Wednesday he expected no improvement in the second quarter. Given strong comparators and the “unprecedented” impact of the downturn on advertising spending, he now expects first-half revenues to fall 15 per cent.“The magnitude of this decline exceeds our previous expectations and, combined with the costs associated with new and recently renewed contracts, will have a significant impact on the group’s [first-half] operating margin,” said Mr Decaux.As recently as March, JCDecaux had warned sales would fall 10 per cent. It then scrapped its dividend.ZenithOptimedia, Publicis Groupe’s media buying unit, warned last month that global advertising spending would fall 6.9 per cent this year. Last week, the world’s largest advertising groups, including WPP, Omnicom and Publicis, all reported mid-single-digit like-for-like revenue declines in the first quarter.The outdoor advertising market is facing increased price competition from other media, JCDecaux said. The UK out-of-home market has been suffering more than other regions due to oversupply, but JCDecaux said that Spain, Germany and North America all saw double-digit declines in street furniture advertising, its largest division. Street furniture revenues fell 16.8 per cent overall to €198.6m ($264.2m), the worst performance of its three business units, with an increase only in smaller markets and the Middle East.Billboard advertising revenues fell 18.7 per cent to €88.5m, but advertising at airports rose 2.1 per cent, boosted by foreign exchange. Like-for-like transport revenues fell 4.7 per cent.Mr Decaux said that the company was “increasingly well positioned in this industry and the strength of our balance sheet will allow us to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise”.Analysts at Citigroup said that JCDecaux’s strong balance sheet left it “strongly positioned to take share” from more indebted competitors.But Citigroup added that JCDecaux’s new forecast implied an 18 per cent decline in sales for the second quarter.“This is likely to be worse than expected, even accounting for the tough comparator,” Citigroup said in a note to clients on Thursday. “We see significant downward pressure to consensus numbers”, which for 2009 earnings range between €0.20 and €0.64 per share.At 1pm on Thursday, JCDecaux’s shares were 1.9 per cent lower at €11.70.
191;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-05-03T19:52:13Z;WPP to cut 7,200 staff in drive to save costs;;WPP, the marketing services group led by Sir Martin Sorrell, will reduce staff by about 7,200, or 6 per cent, this year to keep down costs as the global recession hits advertising spending.About half of the cuts will come from compulsory redundancies, with the rest coming from not replacing staff who leave the company.Some 3,600 jobs have already gone in the first three months of the year, including 2,200 who were made redundant. Most of the remaining job cuts are expected in the second quarter.WPP provides advertising, market research and public relations services to multinational clients such as Ford Motor, IBM and Kelloggs, but has seen sales decline as these clients put the brakes on advertising spending.Job losses are likely to be concentrated in the US and Europe, while headcount could actually increase in emerging markets such as Russia, India and South America, where demand for advertising is holding up much better. The US has been the company’s worst-performing region.The 6 per cent reduction in staffing is in line with analysts’ expectations that revenues at the company will decline 5 to 6 per cent this year. WPP has a policy of trimming staff costs in line with falls in revenues.WPP’s underlying sales fell 5.8 per cent in the first quarter of the year, a steeper decline than expected. WPP, which had revenues of £7.5bn in 2008, had initially forecast just a 2 per cent decline in 2009, but was forced to revise this last week after seeing trading conditions turn more difficult. Rivals have seen similar falls in like-for-like sales, with Interpublic’s ales down 5.6 per cent, and Omnicom declining 6.6 per cent.WPP’s stable of agencies includes Ogilvy & Mather, Y&R, Kantar and Burson-Marsteller, and spans more than 2000 offices in 106 countries.In spite of predicting a steeper fall in sales, Sir Martin has said he was “comfortable” that that WPP could refinance $650m (£445m) of debt coming due by next June. Fitch Ratings lowered its outlook on the company, but maintained its triple B rating.In addition to staff cuts, WPP plans to keep its acquisition spending at about $100m, in order to generate surplus cash to pay down debt. This will make 2009 a quiet year for the acquisitive company, which spent £1.2bn in buying TNS, the market research group, in 2008.WPP shares, which have falled by 25 per cent over the past 12 months, closed up 1½p on Friday at 468p.
192;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-04-30T21:46:35Z;P&G forecasts ‘buyer’s market’ in advertising;;"Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest advertiser, highlighted the slump in global media markets on Thursday, forecasting the “buyer’s market” in advertising would continue as car companies and banks scale back their marketing spending.P&G said its selling, general and administrative expenses fell $800m, or 13 per cent, in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year, “reflecting the benefit of lower marketing expenses while increasing media delivery”. P&G’s global marketing budget is about $8bn.“It’s been a buyer’s market,” said AG Lafley, chief executive. “A simple way to look at it is this: auto industry – big media buyers – dramatic drawdown; financial services industry – big media buyers – substantial drawdown.” Mr Lafley said P&G was getting more for less from its media suppliers, which had helped it offset some of the costs resulting from increases in issuing money-saving coupons and in-store efforts to lure budget-conscious consumers.“What we’ve tried to do . . . is to figure out how to spend a little less money and get a lot more delivery,” he said, arguing “in the near term it could be even a bit more of a buyer’s market”.Separately, Ian Cook, CEO of Colgate-Palmolive, said the oral and personal care company had seen falls in advertising costs “anything from mid-single digits to north of 25 per cent” in differing media and markets.“Starting in the fourth quarter and continuing this year we saw some meaningful downward moves in the costs of advertising media. We took advantage of that and expect to take advantage of it further in 2009.”Quarterly results from WPP and Omnicom, the global advertising and marketing companies, this week showed a steep fall in new commissions and one-off project work from large clients, as well as signs of pressure on agency fees.Both saw like-for-like revenue fall by about 6 per cent.Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, said “clients are being very demanding”. “I’m not talking about new business situations, I’m talking about existing relationships. Anybody who suggests otherwise is being economical with the actualité.”John Wren, Omnicom’s chief executive, told analysts that the company had been “working with clients to adjust fee structures to their spending needs and their requirements”."
193;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-04-29T19:33:05Z;Madison Avenue feels the squeeze;;Duck Phillips! Thou should’st be living at this hour.Phillips was the alcoholic account executive in the television series Mad Men who lost out after failing to marginalise his advertising agency’s charismatic copywriters, led by Don Draper. The power of the creatives was ascendant in the 1960s and 1970s, the prime era of the 30-second television advertisement.Four decades later, the face-off between the people in suits – this time in media planning agencies – and the creatives is back again. Now, it is fuelled by recession rather than growth, and the internet rather than television – and the Madison Avenue creatives have a tougher fight.It is the kind of turf battle that fascinates insiders but is often tedious to those who are not involved. Yet it says something about the precarious state of the industry.I witnessed it this week in San Francisco, at the annual gathering of modern-day Mad Men (and Women): the leadership conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, or 4As.It is usually where veteran creatives such as Chuck Porter of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky (creators of the Burger King “subservient chicken” campaign) and Dan Wieden of Wieden + Kennedy (Nike’s “Just Do It”) can swagger. There was not much swaggering this week.The two largest global advertising and marketing groups – Omnicom and WPP – both disclosed miserable results, with like-for-like revenues falling by about 6 per cent. WPP declared that “any recovery, of sorts, will probably occur in 2010”.Even that is overstating the degree of stability in the industry, as companies not only cut back print and television advertising but even scaled back digital investments. “The industry is under siege,” declared Miles Nadal of MDC Partners, parent of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky.Mr Nadal talked of an “ad chill” factor, like the “wind chill” factor beloved of US weather forecasters. Ad agencies feel squeezed by more than single digits because their clients are demanding more work – in particular adding digital campaigns to traditional print and television ones – for the same or less money.The industry is unaccustomed to being squeezed. Revenues have grown in high single digits for most of the past two decades, which has financed big salaries and bonuses, increased employment and the fragmentation of agencies into media buyers, digital boutiques, research shops and so on.The biggest expansion was when the media buying departments of ad agencies, the second-class citizens to the copywriting and visual creatives, split off into separate agencies in the 1990s. They offered big companies a more precise, professional (and expensive) service in placing ads across different media.Now, it is in question again. The proliferation of agencies not only feels to many advertisers like a luxury in straitened times, but is also ill-fitted to the new digital world.The obvious way to respond to the fall in revenues is to consolidate agencies, which would eliminate duplication. As Mr Nadal says, there is a “huge opportunity” for large holding companies to cut costs by putting together the myriad different agencies they have so far permitted to operate independently.This could also help to solve a second problem for the clients – the fact that media and creative agencies are jostling up against each other to devise and plan digital campaigns on the unfamiliar territory of the internet, blogs, Facebook, Twitter and mobile phones.In the analogue world, everyone’s job was fairly clear. The creatives devised catchy slogans and wacky visuals, and media agencies plotted how to place them before as many of the right consumers as possible.This clarity has dissipated as the divide between the content and the means of distribution has narrowed. The dictum of Marshall McLuhan that “the medium is the message” applies to the internet. Good digital campaigns do not simply involve banner ads on internet sites.Brands gain attention when their agencies devise some interactive stunt that is entertaining or provocative enough to make consumers engage, for example by forwarding videos to friends, entering a competition, or signing up to an online club. True success is when a brand campaign spreads virally.This demands a lot of creativity – a good internet or mobile campaign is more like a short piece of programming or entertainment than a marketing pitch – and a sophisticated grasp of consumers, and how to use old and new media. In other words, it draws on the entire range of the industry’s fragmented skills.It did not matter while clients had plenty of money to throw at the problem, but they are no longer willing to pay lots of agencies for overlapping roles, and are squeezing fees. Coca-Cola wants to reimburse its agencies for costs and only reward them beyond that when campaigns have been shown to work.Laura Desmond, chief executive of Starcom MediaVest, the media planning arm of Publicis, says the industry is heading into a “50-50 world” in which half of revenues go to digital and interactive campaigns. That will require agencies to cut their analogue expenses and the industry to curb its structural excess.She insists that “the toothpaste cannot be put back in the tube” – that big advertisers now demand sophisticated planning from agencies as well as the best campaigns. Maybe so, but they also want to pay less to fewer advertising people to gain more attention for their brands.The creatives have to plan more, or the planners have to create more. Something has to give.john.gapper@ft.com
194;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-04-28T17:38:30Z;Advertising agencies;;"Investors looking to advertising groups for early hints of an economic recovery have received mixed signals this week. Downbeat results on Tuesday from WPP, the world’s biggest advertising group, should take some of the gloss off better-than-expected results from rivals Omnicom and Interpublic.Fresh off a first quarter in which underlying sales dropped 5.8 per cent, Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive, warned that the second quarter would show little improvement and that a recovery was unlikely until 2010. Contrary to WPP’s earlier estimate of a 2 per cent drop in like-for-like sales this year, it now expects like-for-like revenues to fall by the mid-single digits, excluding acquisitions and currency movements, as ad budgets continue to suffer in the recession.Many forecasters had already pegged WPP’s earlier estimate as overly optimistic. While first-quarter sales came in below WPP’s own estimates, they were in line with most analysts’ own forecasts for the group. News that WPP was unlikely to maintain its operating margin at 2008 levels was somewhat more disappointing, but again not unexpected. In that context, the drop in WPP’s share price looks overdone.But investors keen to pounce on hints that the worst of the downturn may be over should also think twice. Omnicom’s optimism on Monday was based largely on the idea that stimulus spending will lead to an improvement in ad budgets by the end of this year. But stimulus-driven demand is one thing. A sustainable recovery is quite another. Advertising has typically been viewed as a leading indicator – some investors expect ad agency revenues to begin to improve several months before any turnround in the broader economy.Publicis, the world’s fourth-biggest ad group, will round out the industry picture when it reports results on Wednesday. In the meantime, Sir Martin’s prediction of continued pain for advertisers until next year will serve as cold water in the face of the green shoots brigade.WPP, the marketing services group, said on Tuesday that its first-quarter sales were below its budgeted figure, falling by 5.8 per cent on an underlying basis.It added that its full-year target of a 2 per cent decline in underlying sales would probably be lowered — a move likely to lead to further job losses, given WPP’s policy of trimming staff costs in line with any sales declines.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

195;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-04-28T12:24:04Z;WPP turns more cautious on 2009;;WPP said a recovery in advertising and marketing budgets was unlikely this year, in a more wary stance than its closest rival as it reported first-quarter figures below expectations.The marketing services group on Tuesday said it now expected the underlying fall in sales to be closer to industry forecasts of mid single- digit declines for 2009 than the 2 per cent fall it predicted last month.The first quarter of 2009 had been “markedly different” from the more benign fourth quarter of 2008, WPP said, although the rate of decline slowed in March. “Clients are being very demanding and asking more for less,” said Sir MartinSorrell, chief executive.Omnicom, WPP’s largest competitor, had expressed cautious optimism on Monday that the large stimulus spending by most governments could help advertising budgets by the fourth quarter.WPP’s first-quarter revenue fell 5.8 per cent before acquisition and currency effects, compared with a 5.6 per cent organic decline reported yesterday by Interpublic, the US advertising company, and a 6.6 per cent underlying fall at Omnicom.Sir Martin echoed rivals when he said trading had been most difficult in the US and strongest in Latin America. He foresaw further expansion there as the “Bric” economies – which include Brazil – and Mexico pull away from developed markets in a recovery.In China, business had picked up in March as foreign multinationals responded to domestic rivals maintaining their spending, he said.The structural threat posed to the advertising industry by Google had abated in the recession, Sir Martin argued, saying that he was more focused on cyclical challenges. “The G word has been overtaken by the R word,” he said.Sir Martin said he was “pretty comfortable” that WPP could refinance $650m (£445m) of debt coming due by next June. Fitch Ratings lowered its outlook on the company, but maintained its triple B rating.WPP said its short-term focus this year would be on “balancing the likely fall in revenues against staff costs and headcount”.The number of people employed by the group fell 3 per cent in the first quarter to 109,400, although almost a third of that was the result of net attrition rather than severance.For his part, Michael Roth, Iterpublic’s chief executive, said clients were “measured and cautious”, but they recognised that “under-investing in their brands creates a significant risk of lost market share in the long term.”
196;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-04-28T02:11:41Z;Cautious optimism for Omnicom;;Stimulus spending by governments around the world could start to rebuild battered advertising budgets by the end of this year, Omnicom said on Monday as it reported that customers were cautiously optimistic that the worst was over.The advertising and marketing services group behind BBDO Worldwide, Chrysler’s advertising agency, reported that the troubles of the automotive industry and cuts to clients’ discretionary spending led to a 21.2 per cent fall in net income for the first quarter, to $164.5m.Investors had expected worse, and Omnicom’s shares closed up 4 per cent at $30.55, their highest level since November.“As the pace of the economic decline finds a bottom, we do believe companies will focus on revenue growth and start investing or reinvesting in their brands,” John Wren, chief executive, told analysts.Stimulus spending “should start to have a positive impact in the fourth quarter of this year and the first half of next year,” he said.Even if Chrysler or other automakers went through bankruptcy reorganisations, he added, Omnicom expected their marketing not to be restricted.Mr Wren’s comments kicked off a reporting season for advertising groups that will be closely watched for signs of when the advertising slump might reverse.A 14 per cent drop in Omnicom’s quarterly revenue was affected by the stronger dollar, with declines in the US, Europe, Japan and South Korea driving organic growth down 6.6 per cent.Specialty communications, which includes directories and healthcare marketing, was down 16.2 per cent organically, and public relations fell 10.5 per cent before currency effects.Commission and project revenues had already seen “a step change” in the fourth quarter of last year, said Randall Weisenburger, chief financial officer.“I don’t really realistically think that those numbers can get significantly worse,” Mr Weisenburger said. Reductions in fees would take longer to come through, he added.New business wins amounting to $970m in the quarter, compared with $780m in the prior period, would benefit the group by the second half of this year, he forecast.Staff cuts in the past two quarters would save $340m from annual costs and more were likely.Mr Weisenburger emphasised that Omnicom’s $2.4bn in liquidity left it “well positioned”, but said it was holding off acquisitions, “knowing that most opportunities will continue to be there in three to six months.”Net income fell from $209m to $165m in the first quarter, or from 64 cents per share to 54 cents. Analysts’ consensus expectation had been for earnings of 44 cents.Currency movements contributed to a steep 20.9 per cent drop in international revenues.
197;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-04-14T01:00:46Z;Global ad spending to fall by 7%;;Declines in global advertising will be much worse than expected, says a leading media buyer, which will on Tuesday unveil the grimmest forecasts yet seen for the advertising market and traditional media companies.Worldwide advertising spending, a barometer for economic confidence, will fall 6.9 per cent in 2009 to $453bn, compared with 1 per cent growth last year, predicts ZenithOptimedia, the media buying unit of Publicis, the world’s fourth-largest advertising group.The forecasts outstrip rivals’ figures released last month. Group M, owned by WPP, expects a 4.4 per cent decline this year and Carat, owned by Aegis, expects a 5.8 per cent drop.The outlook is gloomiest for newspapers. Spending is projected to fall 12 per cent. Radio and magazines are also grappling with double-digit declines.Television is expected to perform relatively well, with ad spending down 5.5 per cent, due to its vastly reduced prices, marketers’ familiarity with the medium and evidence that consumers are also watching more television, rather than going out.In contrast, the internet’s share of advertising continues to grow, reaching a projected 12.1 per cent of overall spending.In December, Zenith had expected advertising spending to decline 0.2 per cent. Since then the economic crisis has spread to emerging markets, said Jonathan Barnard, head of publications at the agency.“A lot of markets we were expecting to show at least modest growth this year are clearly going to be down substantially,” he told the Financial Times.Mr Barnard said the latest revisions reflected “reality crashing in” on advertisers. China and India continue to show “substantial promise”, he added. But central and eastern Europe, where ad spending had previously been expected to grow 1.5 per cent this year, is now forecast to fall 13.9 per cent. Hungary, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia will all see “substantial declines”, Mr Barnard said.Latin America, while forecast to fall 2 per cent, is the most resilient area of the world, with the Brazilian market up 7 per cent excluding currency effects. Among the more developed markets, North America will suffer the most, losing 8.3 per cent of its value this year. Western Europe, down 6.7 per cent as a whole, will see the UK and Spain suffer the greatest falls, Zenith said.Mr Barnard expects the global advertising market to resume modest growth in 2010 in most markets except North America.
198;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-04-08T22:33:57Z;Dotcom veterans in Twitter ‘brains trust’;;"Some of the best-known names in the London dotcom world are joining forces to cash in on the popularity of Twitter, the rapidly growing social network.Twitter Partners said that it will help brands, media companies and celebrities to monitor and market themselves on the network, which allows more than 4m users to post 140-character updates to their list of “followers”.Peter Read, the marketing agency’s founder, has been an angel investor and adviser to a range of digital-media start-ups such as Skype, Metacafe and Babelgum.Mr Read has brought together a “brains trust” of advisers to Twitter Partners, including Brent Hoberman and Martha Lane Fox, founders of Lastminute.com; Saul Klein, a partner at Index Ventures, the London venture capitalists; and Toby Coppel, the former European vice-president at Yahoo.Other advisers hail from broadcaster BSkyB, music site Last.fm, and advertising agencies Aegis, Omnicom and Razorfish.Twitter is free to use and does not currently carry any advertising, although co-founder Biz Stone has said that it could charge companies for extra features and support.However, Twitter has just 30 employees, mainly technical staff, providing an opportunity for it to work with partners on commercialisation.Mr Read said on Wednesday that Twitter Partners, which will be launched today, will provide consulting, software tools and services to prospective clients, including Virgin Media, Universal Pictures and Bananaz, the new film from the cartoon band Gorillaz.“[Twitter doesn’t] have ad units that we can just go and buy,” he said. “Harnessing Twitter has to be a bit more strategic.”Mr Read confessed that like Twitter itself, his agency is still figuring out how to make money from the service. “I could see that Twitter has potential,” he told the FT, “but I didn’t know where the commercial opportunities were and I don’t think anybody does at the moment.”One area of interest is “buzz-monitoring”, whereby companies monitor Twitter to see what its users are saying about their products and services. Mr Read worked for eight years at Nielsen, the market research group.Mr Klein, who is advising Twitter Partners in a personal capacity, has worked with Mr Read for several years on early-stage investment and digital marketing.“We have always been interested in this whole seam of how you use social media and data on behalf of brands to help them understand their audiences and leverage these new channels,” he said.Meanwhile, Mr Klein, as part of seed investors The Accelerator Group (TAG), has backed a variety of Twitter-related companies, including TweetDeck, a London-based developer, whose site is the second most popular for posting “tweets” after Twitter itself. TAG has also invested in Bit.ly, which shortens web addresses and monitors traffic, and Tipjoy, which allows payments over Twitter."
199;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-04-06T21:34:18Z;Facebook puts fizz in Coke;;When two Coca-Cola enthusiasts created a Facebook profile in honour of their favourite soft drink last year, they could not have known it would become one of the social network site’s most popular profile pages – second only to Barack Obama’s.The page was created by Dusty Sorg, a Los Angeles-based actor, who maintains it with his friend Michael Jedrzejewski, a writer.“I was already on Facebook a lot and I didn’t see any Coke pages that seemed very official,” says Mr Sorg. So he started the page in August, invited his friends, and watched it grow.And grow and grow and grow. By December, the page had 1.2m fans, making it the most popular brand-related page on Facebook. It now has some 3.3m members.What spurred the enormous growth remains something of a mystery. There were already more than 200 Coke-related fan pages on Facebook. Michael Donnelly, Coca-Cola’s group director of worldwide interactive marketing, who had been monitoring the page since October, believes it may have been as simple as a good visual cue. “They chose a great image,” he says. “It was a high-resolution picture of a can of cold Coke, and it was just perfect.”At any rate, the page is now an enormous asset for the company, which was forced by Facebook to administer the page jointly with Mr Sorg to comply with the site’s rules on trademarks (see panel). “It gives us an opportunity we didn’t have in the past,” says Mr Donnelly. “It’s a great way for us to expose a huge number of people to what we’re doing at no cost.”While Coke’s successful Facebook foray may have been inadvertent, more and more marketing departments and advertising agencies are trying to find ways to harness the power of the online social networks provided by the likes of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and MySpace.A recent poll of members of the US-based Chief Marketing Officer Council found that a third did not have the internal talent in their marketing departments to engage in new media programmes. The same proportion have a limited understanding of social media yet almost two-thirds are actively investing in it.“That is a big opportunity for an [advertising] agency to come in,” says Liz Miller, vice-president of programmes and operations at the CMOC. The opportunity has been widened by the economic downturn, which has forced many brands to re-evaluate their expenditure on traditional forms of marketing, such as paid advertising.While Carat, the media planning and buying agency, forecasts global advertising expenditure to fall 5.8 per cent this year, social media remains one of the few sectors where agencies are hiring rather than firing.Indeed, in recent months agencies have been falling over themselves to create dedicated social media divisions. MPG, the Havas-owned media agency, Creston, a British agency group, and LBi, a digital agency, all established social media units last month. Tribal DDB, the digital division of Omnicom’s vast creative agency DDB, in January brought its Canadian social media specialist, Radar DDB, to the UK, while Vivaki, the media buying and trading business of Publicis, has created a set of media planning tools to help clients “engage consumers on the social web”.“From the agency world, it’s a bit of a land grab at the moment,” says Mike Parsons, managing director at Tribal DDB. “Either from threat or opportunity.”However, efforts to build a loyal and engaged network of consumers using social marketing campaigns have met with mixed results. One successful promotion was designed for Burger King by the advertising agency Crispin Porter+Bogusky, which has offices in the US and London. Instead of simply running ads, the agency created a Facebook application that gave users a coupon for a free hamburger if they deleted 10 friends from their Facebook account. Facebook eventually shut it down, arguing that it violated privacy terms but, nevertheless, more than 82,000 people used the application in less than a week.Agency.com, a US-based digital marketing firm, had some success when it recently redesigned the website of Skittles sweets. The firm replaced Skittles’ corporate homepage with Skittles-themed pages from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Wikipedia. The strategy generated a buzz at the outset but quickly drew criticism from some who regarded it as a gimmick designed to exploit Twitter’s popularity.The first step when trying to harness social networks for marketing is to explore what consumers are saying about a brand by using “buzz-monitoring” services, such as Onalytica and Brandwatch.“The best way to get this stuff right is by listening and understanding before engaging,” says Will McInnes, managing director and co-founder of NixonMcInnes, a specialist social media agency.David Kenny, managing partner at Vivaki, says advertisers and marketers need to be aware of how digital media has changed the nature of marketing. “Now you don’t start with the product, you start with the human beings – where are they, how do they learn, how do they entertain themselves?”But amid efforts by companies to claim a share of this new marketing space, Ms Miller of the CMOC warns that social media may yet prove to be just another marketing fad. “People are seeing a lot of opportunity but my question is always going to come back to the longevity of that opportunity.”She warns that in such a nascent market there remains a risk of being sold snake oil. “Please don’t ever hire a Twitter consultant.”But perhaps the biggest cause for scepticism is that the pot of gold at the end of the social media rainbow is currently small.A report by Forrester Research found that three-quarters of corporate marketing departments surveyed dedicated $100,000 or less a year to social media. For budgets to increase meaningfully, agencies will have to demonstrate that the returns of marketing on social media can be measured.“Tracking [activity] back to purchases is the big challenge for this year,” says Helen Lawrence, one of London’s first social media planners, at digital agency Dare.But even if it becomes easier to measure and value the effectiveness of social media as a marketing tool, there is no easy way for agencies or their clients to emulate the kind of runaway success Coca-Cola has enjoyed on Facebook.Mr Sorg’s fan page was a hit thanks to a combination of weak competition, good timing and pretty pictures. It had a momentum of its own, and a community loyal to its quirky founders. Had Coke set up the page itself or taken it over, there is no guarantee it would still be thriving.Indeed, the most effective thing Coca-Cola did – and perhaps the best lesson for other companies – was not getting in the way.
200;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-03-22T22:10:36Z;Ad agencies struggle to sell early recovery;Analysts forecast decline of at least 5%;Even though an advertising agency’s job is communication and sales for its clients, many have failed to convince the market to buy the industry’s story of its own performance.The fourth quarter of 2008 proved not to be as apocalyptic for agencies as many had feared. Yet the six largest global holding companies – WPP and Aegis based in the UK, Omnicom and Interpublic in the US, and Havas and Publicis of France – have struggled to convince investors that the advertising market will recover before 2010.“The tone of companies’ guidance is a moderate revenue decline and broadly flat margins [in 2009],” says Patrick Kirby, analyst at Deutsche Bank. “I really think that’s right at the top end of the range of likely outcomes.”He fears a repeat of 2002, when agencies started the year confident but gradually lowered their guidance in subsequent months.Analysts forecast revenue declines of at least 5 per cent for most agencies, in spite of the insistence of Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP chief executive, that he is budgeting for a 2 per cent fall this year.WPP’s share price suggests the market is more inclined to believe the analysts than Sir Martin.He did at least give specific guidance. His peers in the other agency holding companies largely declined to put a figure on their prevailingly gloomy outlooks.“The answer is nobody knows, that is what we have to all own up to,” said John Napier, Aegis chairman and interim chief executive.The supposedly more resilient areas for marketing such as digital and emerging markets, including Russia and China, are already showing signs of deterioration.As in traditional media, prices for online display advertising are falling, although advertising against web search results is holding up.Mr Napier has likened the advertising business to big-game hunting and there remain some large beasts in the wild. This year, Publicis and Omnicom have won billion-dollar accounts from Carrefour, the French retailer, and Hewlett-Packard.But that is a result of large advertisers trimming the number of agencies they use in a bid to lower fees. This trend comes on top of the huge advertising budget cuts already made by automotive and financial services clients.“We simply see no evidence to suggest advertising conditions will accelerate any time in 2009,” analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent note.They cite Anheuser-Busch and General Motors as examples of advertisers shifting to later payment terms, which could create cashflow problems for agencies.Reflecting these concerns, Moody’s, the ratings agency, put WPP and Omnicom on negative watch after their results, although both retain an investment grade rating.WPP is expected soon to need to refinance about half of the £650m ($942m) bridge loan it took out for last year’s acquisition of Taylor Nelson Sofres.At its results, WPP demonstrated it was well within its banking covenants. “WPP’s leverage at 2.3 times is not high in absolute terms,” says Deutsche’s Mr Kirby. “But it is still at least twice the sector average.”He thinks a rights issue is unlikely and that WPP is more likely to sell bonds to raise funds to refinance the loan.In spite of the challenges, some analysts seek solace in the hope that agencies do not suffer from the same long-term structural challenges that afflict other media businesses, such as directories and newspapers.”An agency is an advertiser’s conduit into media,” says Justin Diddams, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. “It’s a business model that will still exist in ten years’ time.”But he adds that the model is “becoming more labour intensive”, particularly online.“Margins in the medium term will come down to 12-13 per cent rather than the 15-16 per cent of the last ten years,” he says.
201;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-03-03T00:23:40Z;Havas outperforms rival agencies;;Havas released better-than-expected 2008 results on Monday evening, after the Paris markets closed.The advertising agency group, which counts Vincent Bolloré as its chairman and largest shareholder, posted revenues up 2.3 per cent to €1.57bn.Organic revenue growth of 4.7 per cent (excluding acquisitions, disposals and currency fluctuations) represented a slowdown from 7.1 per cent in 2007.But the growth rate outstripped that of rivals Publicis, Omnicom and Interpublic, who have all reported 2008 figures – accompanied by gloomy outlooks for 2009 – in recent weeks.Havas also outperformed by growing revenues 2 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, when the downturn started to hit marketing spending. Interpublic and Omnicom, which are both based in the US, both reported revenue declines in the final quarter of 2008.Havas said that North American revenues fell 2 per cent in its fourth quarter, but rose 2.1 per cent in the full year to €477m.European sales were up 5.4 per cent for the year to €923m, with Latin America growing at 13.8 per cent on an organic basis.Full-year earnings increased 26 per cent to 24 cents. Operating margins improved from 11.0 per cent in 2007 to 12.1 per cent of 2008, beating analysts’ expectations of about 11.5 per cent.Fernando Rodés Vilà, chief executive, said that Havas had achieved “a year early” the sales growth and margin targets he set in 2006. But he did not give any comment on how the business would fare in 2009.“This position of strength enables us to face the current challenging economic climate with confidence,” Havas said in its outlook statement. “We see our well-established positions in mature markets as giving us an advantage in view of the expected slowdown in emerging markets.”With net debt of €79m, down from €226m a year earlier, analysts said Havas had the best leverage of the major agency groups. WPP will release its 2008 figures on Friday, while Aegis – in which Mr Bolloré also holds a 29.9 per cent stake – is expected to report later this month.New business wins last year included Kraft, Santander and Wal-Mart.Digital marketing, which is growing faster than traditional media, now accounts for 14 per cent of Havas revenues.Havas on Monday announced that it was reorganising EuroRSCG and Arnold Worldwide, its creative agencies, under a new entity, Havas Worldwide, to be headed by David Jones, EuroRSCG chief executive.On Monday, Havas shares closed down 4.9 per cent at €1.29.
202;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-02-11T23:25:38Z;Publicis chief gloomy on ad market recovery;;Maurice Lévy, chairman and chief executive of Publicis Groupe, said on Wednesday he did not expect the advertising market to recover before mid-2010.But in spite of the gloomy outlook, the world’s fourth largest advertising group which owns agencies such as Fallon and Saatchi & Saatchi weathered a fourth-quarter slowdown to maintain revenue growth last year.Revenues increased 3.8 per cent, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange movements, to €4.7bn ($6bn, £4.2bn) in the year to December 31 2008.Fourth-quarter organic growth was 1.1 per cent, in spite of revenue declines in the UK, Spain, Germany, Japan and Korea.Net income fell 1.1 per cent to €447m, although net debt was down to €676m from €837m at the end of 2007. Omnicom, a larger rival to Publicis, reported fourth-quarter organic revenues down 5.8 per cent on Tuesday.While declining to give specific guidance, Mr Lévy estimated the advertising market would decline 2-3 per cent in 2009, with the first half weaker than the second.He added: “I think the market will pick up in the second quarter of 2010 at best.”Zenith Optimedia, Publicis’ media buying unit, made preliminary cuts yesterday to its advertising market forecasts, and now expects a 1.8 per cent drop worldwide in 2009.But even in a falling market, Mr Lévy pledged to increase Publicis’ market share. “In 2009 we will without any doubt be the [advertising] company with the best margin on the market,” he said.Operating margins would be “fairly close” to 2008’s 16.7 per cent, he added, thanks to flexible costs that represent 8 per cent of revenues and savings from moving back-office functions from New York to Costa Rica.Almost two-thirds of Publicis revenues come from what Mr Lévy called “resilient sectors”, such as consumer packaged goods, although automotive clients make up 15 per cent.Justin Diddams, analyst at RBS, said he was “a little bit more comfortable” about Publicis’ margin outlook, as it has “done the hard work in making the business more efficient”.But he queried Publicis’ decision not to raise its dividend, given its strong balance sheet.The UK faced the steepest cuts in Zenith’s revised advertising forecasts. Having expected growth of 1.5 per cent in December, it now estimates the UK market will fall 4 per cent in 2009.However, in a separate report released yesterday, the UK’s Advertising Association predicted marketing budgets in the UK would recover from 2010, with growth of between 28 per cent and 52 per cent in the subsequent decade.Additional reporting by Ben Hall in Paris
203;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-02-10T22:35:45Z;Omnicom predicts grim ad outlook;;Omnicom, one of the world’s largest advertising groups, on Tuesday said the industry was facing its toughest conditions since the early 1990s recession as the group reported its first quarterly profits fall for many years.The results came as the US-based company outlined its executive compensation structure, which appeared to suggest the group’s executives could be in for a nervous year.Randall Weisenburger, chief financial officer, said that a 4-5 per cent reduction in full-year revenues could mean a 40-50 per cent reduction in senior executive pay.UBS expects Omnicom revenues to fall more than 7 per cent for the year, broadly in line with the global advertising market.“We think the first nine months of this year are going to be difficult,” said John Wren, president and chief executive. However, Mr Wren said he expected some improvement in the fourth quarter due to the effects from governmental economic stimuli.The outlook came as the company said fourth-quarter net profits fell 14 per cent to $271m, on sales down 7 per cent to $3.37bn. “The fourth quarter was probably the most challenging quarter the company has faced since 1992,” Mr Wren said.Meanwhile, full-year net profit increased 2.5 per cent to $1bn, on sales up 5.2 per cent to $13.4bn.Omnicom has already made staff reductions, increasing fourth-quarter severance costs by $55m, which it expects to result in annualised savings of $215m. The group has also frozen salaries and reduced incentive compensation for senior executives.The company would continue to make “surgical” cost cuts, said Mr Wren, but not on the scale of the last quarter.As a result, he said operating margins would not fall back to the 11-12 per cent range seen in the early 1990s, from 12.6 per cent last year. But margin declines of 50 to 100 basis points in 2009 “would be a pretty strong performance”, he added.Omnicom shares fell on Tuesday about 1 per cent to $27.93.As the first large marketing group to report fourth-quarter results, Omnicom’s performance will be closely watched by the industry. Advertising spending, which had held up on a global basis until the third quarter, took a sharp hit when the banking system froze in November, said Mr Wren.Publicis Groupe, which reports on Wednesday, has said that revenues are likely to decline this year. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, which is of similar size to Omnicom, has said he expects flat revenues in 2009.On Monday, Dentsu, Japan’s largest advertising group, cut its net profit forecast by two-thirds for the year to March 31 to Y6.5bn ($71m), alongside a 5.4 per cent reduction in revenue forecasts, due to revaluation of securities and clients’ “increasingly cautious approach to advertising spending”.
204;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-01-23T01:20:08Z;Gazprom lobbyist suspended from EU;;Gazprom’s Brussels lobbying firm has been suspended from the European Union’s lobbying register for failing to disclose the identity of three clients.GPlus Europe, one of Brussels’ most influential lobbying firms, is the first to be suspended from the voluntary registry, which was established in June to promote greater transparency about the role of lobbyists in EU decision making.The commission’s decision, communicated in a letter last week, does not imply any wrongdoing by GPlus or restrict its ability to operate.Peter Guilford, one of GPlus’ founders, said the firm had informed the commission in December, when it first joined the registry, that it had pre-existing confidentiality agreements with three clients, who did not want their names disclosed. Two of those clients are no longer represented by GPlus.“We’ve been super-transparent,” Mr Guilford said, noting that the clients in question included two trade associations and one corporation.GPlus has since published on its own website the information it submitted to the commission about its relations with Gazprom and dozens of other clients.The episode underlines the challenges of devising an effective lobbying registry. The EU plan calls for participants to disclose all their clients, and their respective payments within 50,000 euros. Since its launch in June, more than 800 firms have signed on.Yet lobbyists and even commission officials acknowledge that many others would be prevented from registering due to their clients’ concerns about privacy. “I think it’s an anomaly that needs ironing out when they review [the registry] in the summer,” Mr Guilford said.GPlus, a division of media giant Omnicom, was hired by Moscow after it received most of the blame for a 2006 gas dispute with Ukraine that disrupted supplies to western Europe.
205;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2009-01-05T22:30:29Z;Ad agencies to cut staff;;The woes of the automotive sector are triggering job cuts in advertising agencies as the marketing world prepares for a dire 2009.Omnicom became the first of the large agency holding companies to reveal large-scale redundancies in mid-December when it said that it would be cutting just under 5 per cent of its workforce, estimated at about 3,000 people.More job losses are expected in the US and Europe at groups such as Interpublic and WPP, as agencies and their clients finalise their budgets.The outlook for the advertising sector has deteriorated since companies’ third-quarter updates in October. Hopes that growth from online advertising and emerging markets may counterbalance shortfalls in the US and western Europe are receding.Publicis-owned ZenithOptimedia now forecasts a 0.2 per cent decline in world advertising spending in 2009, with North America expected to be down 5.7 per cent on 2008.Job cuts have already been made in Detroit and other agencies where carmakers are large clients.Omnicom’s cutbacks are expected to result in a severance provision of up to $75m in the fourth quarter, analysts say.In a recent note, Deutsche Bank said it was “highly likely that most of the $200m or so of project work that typically gets done in [the fourth quarter] did not materialise” for Omnicom.Analysts added that the adjustments to its cost structure suggested that “advertising trends are getting worse in a hurry”.Automotive companies’ advertising spending dropped by about 10 per cent in the first half of 2008, according to figures from Nielsen, with Ford and Chrysler making the deepest cuts. Although not all agencies comment on specific clients, Publicis is believed to have the largest exposure to the automotive sector with about 15 per cent of revenues, followed by Omnicom at about 14 per cent and WPP and Aegis at almost 10 per cent. Ford is estimated to represent almost 5 per cent of WPP revenues, while Interpublic and Publicis agencies are used by General Motors.“Bailout or not, marketing spending for the car companies is going to be under a lot of pressure in 2009,” said Patrick Kirby, analyst at Deutsche Bank, due to delayed launches of new cars, constrained financing and wanting to appear frugal.In the event of an advertiser going bankrupt, a system of “sequential liability” in the US means that media owners’ owed money goes directly to advertisers, not agencies. As a result, WPP, for instance, does not have credit insurance on US media spending.
206;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2008-12-04T19:40:07Z;Neat conclusion to a year Aim would rather forget;;With impeccable timing, the business that took Aim briefly through the 1,700 companies barrier in January has decided to leave the market.Steppingstone Associates, a recruitment specialist in the communications sector, raised £1.1m gross through a placing at 4p a share. Within weeks it had changed its name to 1700 Group in honour of its place in Aim history. I am not making this up, but the board was concerned over possible confusion with StepStone Solutions, a company whose parent is listed on the Norwegian stock exchange.Whatever the name, the climate in its chosen field changed in October when Omnicom, the world’s largest advertising agency group, said it expected the fourth quarter to be a challenge, and WPP imposed a recruitment freeze. 1700 Group cut its own staff and warned of profits lower than expectations for the year to March.Steve Hyde, the chief executive who owns 47 per cent of the equity, said the reason for joining Aim was to instigate a buy-and- build strategy. But the share price has fallen to 0.1p, leaving the company with a capitalisation of £240,000, which is probably less than the annual cost of the quote.The company has called a shareholder meeting on December 19 to cancel its listing. It will be a neat conclusion to a year Aim would rather forget.A glass half fullBut the London Stock Exchange is an organisation that sees a glass as half full rather than half empty. On Monday it announced that the rule book for Aim Italia had become effective, and that the market was ready for launch.Nine Italian nomads, including UniCredit and Centrobanca, will have their applications finalised in the coming weeks. They will then start looking among more than 4,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises in Italy suitable for life on the new junior market.The launch represents a milestone of the merger between Borsa Italiana and the LSE. Massimo Capuano, Borsa chief executive, says: “Aim Italia will become one of the main ways for financing developing Italian growth companies.”Aim Italia is not alone. In Spain, the Bolsas y Mercados Españoles is pushing ahead with its own version of Aim, and has recruited more than 20 nomads. It seems that what is happening on Aim is passing them by. Who is going to research and trade stocks on new junior markets?Even companies of a reasonable size that have a good story to tell are finding the going tough in the UK. Alternative Networks, which provides telecoms services to businesses employing between 50 and 500 staff, reported a 30 per cent increase in both turnover and underlying profits for the year to September 30. It increased the dividend by almost 40 per cent. The shares have held up better than most over the past year, and it has a market capitalisation of £67m. Yet the three independent brokers that used to cover it have stopped doing so, leaving it with just the house forecast.Bad timingMr Hyde of 1700 Group is disappointed that his buy-and-build plans have come to nought, considering the time, effort and cost involved. But he accepts that the timing of the flotation was mainly to blame.Others are not so generous. Michael Kingshott introduced Asia Distribution Solutions to Aim in November 2007 with plans to build one of China’s first national drinks and distribution chains. “We did a huge number of road shows in January, February and March. There was lots of interest, but no money,” he says.He persisted, but “frankly it was like talking to a brick wall. Aim is broken . . . there is no access to capital at all.”The company has reversed into Yarraman Winery and will be listed on Nasdaq. The deal values Asia Distribution shares, which fell from 25p to 11½p, at 52.9p.Steve Howell brought Freshwater UK to Aim in July last year, raising £4m at 85p. The strategy of building a regional public relations group has gone well, and three acquisitions have been completed. The company this week reported a 27 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to £1.17m on revenues up 61 per cent at £7.5m. Yet the shares have fallen to 41½p, giving it a market capitalisation of £5.4m.He believes the junior market has lost its way. “We are typical of the kind of business Aim should be serving,” he says. “We had a clear strategy, raised money, and delivered.”But he believes Aim has been “rather promiscuous”, and an influx of larger companies has soaked up money from the kind of company the market was founded to help. But he rejects any idea of leaving the market. “Why the hell should we consider delisting? It cost us £600,000, and we have the right to expect Aim should deliver.”david.blackwell@ft.com
207;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2008-10-21T18:39:39Z;Omnicom sees ‘challenging’ future;;Concerns mounted on Tuesday over the impact of deteriorating corporate and consumer confidence on advertising spending after Omnicom, the world’s largest agency group, said it expected the fourth quarter to be “a challenge”.The first of the large advertising and marketing services companies to report third-quarter earnings said clients were “very cautious”, although only the automotive sector and some retailers had so far made significant cutbacks.Omnicom, whose agencies include BBDO Worldwide and DDB Worldwide, had “far less visibility” about future revenues than was usual for this stage of the year, said Randall Weisenburger, chief financial officer.Clients were “cautious and confused,” said John Wren, chief executive, and were focused on the “chatter” about the financial crisis. “There hasn’t been a lot of clear actionable information derived from clients above that chatter level,” he added.Shares in Omnicom fell 7 per cent to $31.03 by midday in New York, knocking other agency groups as analysts voiced growing bearishness about the outlook.“Our understanding from industry contacts is that trading over the last few weeks has taken a sharp turn down,” Gareth Thomas, a Collins Stewart analyst, wrote in a note on Tuesday.“We are absolutely in uncharted territory,” said Lorna Tilbian, media analyst at Numis Securities. “In 2003, it was a [business-to-business] downturn not a consumer downturn. Back in 1992, it was a consumer downturn without a credit squeeze. Now we have all three. A lot of management teams – and clients – haven’t seen this ever before,” she added.With advertising agency price-to-forecast-earnings ratios now half what they were at the last trough in March 2003, and dividend yields twice what they were, “we are going to have to take a machete to our numbers,” said Ms Tilbian.Omnicom said it was pleased with third-quarter figures showing a 5.6 per cent rise in net income to $214m and an 11.3 per cent rise in diluted earnings per share to 69 cents, from revenues of $3.32bn, up 6.9 per cent.However, it said it had suspended share buybacks in August to avoid adding “more stress to what is already a stressful situation,” Mr Weisenburger said, and had delayed hiring plans and planned salary increases.WPP has already imposed a hiring freeze. Campaign, the trade magazine, reported this week that WPP had told senior staff that September had been “another month in which even our recently prepared forecasts for revenues have not been achieved”.Omnicom executives said the pipeline of potential acquisition targets at ­“reasonable” prices had improved and predicted that the group could find opportunities even in a sustained recession.“We’ll make lemonade out of the lemons that we’re served,” said Mr Wren.
208;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2008-10-13T16:52:09Z;Mobile phone ads hit by spending curbs;;The global economic downturn is set to hit advertising on mobile phones until at least 2010, when marketing agencies expect clients to increase their budgets.Advertising agencies say clients are reining in their marketing spending and focusing on proven mediums such as mass audience television and the internet.The move deals a blow to European mobile operators, who were planning on generating significant new revenue from advertising. Informa, the research firm, estimates that the revenues derived from placing advertisements on mobiles will be worth $1.72bn in 2008, rising to $12.09bn by 2013.Jean-Paul Edwards, executive director of futures at Manning Gottlieb OMD, which is part of Omnicom, the world’s largest marketing agency, said that many advertisers become more conservative in a downturn, and “retreat into what is most proven”.He added that mobile advertising “has had false dawns for several years. The current economic climate will push things back a bit,” he said. “If money is tight, mobile is not proven yet.” Other companies involved in mobile advertising say that the industry’s fragmented state is also holding it back.Over the last 18 months, European mobile operators such as Vodafone and France Telecom’s Orange have increased investments in mobile advertising.Companies including AOL, Microsoft, Nokia, Publicis and Yahoo have made acquisitions to expand their roles in the mobile advertising market.Analysts say that the mobile advertising industry will be forced to consolidate after a “gold rush” by operators and venture capital-supported start-ups.“Brands are not seeing enough potential return from mobile at the moment to warrant significant investment,” said Informa, adding that advertising spending “will not be sufficient to sustain every player” across the young industry.Mobile operators pledged to work together to drive the nascent mobile advertising market in February at the Mobile World Congress, the mobile industry’s main industry event.But critics say that inertia and bureaucracy have impeded such collaboration. Andrea Casalini, chief executive of Buongiorno, an Italian technology company specialising in mobile content, said that operators’ piecemeal local initiatives were failing to provide advertisers with broad audiences.“Fragmentation is the single most important element slowing down the market,” he added.
209;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
210;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2008-07-24T05:02:11Z;Publicis shows resilience amid tight budgets;;Publicis showed resilience in Europe and North America in its second-quarter results, published Thursday morning, in spite of a deteriorating economy weighing on marketing budgets.However, the Paris-based advertising group warned that second-half performance depended on a strong contribution from the Olympics.Publicis, which owns UK advertising agencies Fallon and BBH as well as the digital specialist Digitas, showed steady organic revenue growth of 5.5 per cent in the quarter or 5.4 per cent in the first half. The UK grew “close to 5 per cent”, according to Maurice Levy, chief executive, and by 11 per cent in France.Publicis’ North American revenues gained 5.8 per cent, just ahead of its US-based rival, Omnicom, which reported results on Monday. Omnicom also reported flat growth in the UK in its second quarter, while WPP warned of a weaker performance in western European markets last month.Mr Levy told the FT: “What we expect for the second half of the year, as of today, we will see a small slowdown which may be compensated in some areas of the business.”In spite of an expected decline in industry growth next year, he said: “The first indications we have for 2009 are quite encouraging. It’s too early but indications from clients regarding plans for 2009 do not signal to us some sharp decline.”Analysts at JPMorgan earlier said Publicis’ management needed to meet expectations to rebuild credibility, after investors’ confidence was lost by “poorly communicating guidance” last year. “It will likely take some solid numbers and consistent performance for the market to retain assurance,” they said.Analysts’ consensus for second-quarter growth was 5.3 per cent, according to Publicis.Mr Levy said that weakness in some smaller markets, such as Spain, was offset by faster growth in emerging economies, particularly Russia and India. But he warned that China had seen a “short period of slowdown” following May’s Sichuan earthquake, which resulted in some cuts to events and other marketing spend.While remaining “cautiously” confident in the outlook for the rest of the year, Mr Levy said the short term will be “hugely influenced” by spending in the Olympic Games.“It looks that most of the advertisers have kept up with the level of investment they wanted to put behind the Olympic Games … We have not seen serious cuts,” he added.Operating margins of 15 per cent for the first half came in just ahead of consensus expectations of 14.8 per cent.“We were anticipating an erosion of our margin due to the fact that we have a larger chunk of our business in digital,” said Mr Levy. Digital accounted for 18.8 per cent of group revenue in the first half, compared to 12.7 per cent a year ago.Analysts said that a strong performance in new business wins, from clients such as Heineken in Asia and Nestlé in China, would leave Publicis well placed into the second half.Publicis plans to increase its share of revenues from emerging markets and digital to 25 per cent each by 2010. Last month, it reorganised its digital media agencies into a new initiative called Vivaki, which allows one central point for group companies to buy digital advertising space with Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL.Earlier this week, Publicis acquired Portfolio, a digital agency in Korea.
211;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2008-07-22T22:43:16Z;Lazarus to stand down from O&M;;Shelly Lazarus, chief executive of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and widely regarded as the most powerful woman in the advertising industry, will step down by the end of the year.Ms Lazarus, 62, is to be replaced by Miles Young, who has overseen the WPP-owned advertising and marketing firm’s fast-growing Asian operations for the last 13 years. She will remain as chairman of The Ogilvy Group. The move represents a rare management change at Ogilvy.Ms Lazarus has led the firm since 1996, and has worked there for more than 30 years, forging close ties with large corporate clients along the way.Under Ms Lazarus, Ogilvy continued its evolution from the traditional advertising agency founded by David Ogilvy to a more diversified communications group offering a range of services, including marketing, public relations and new media to help clients develop brands.Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, which acquired Ogilvy in 1989, praised Ms Lazarus, and said: “She’ll be an extremely difficult act to follow and we are delighted she will continue to focus, as chairman of The Ogilvy Group, on developing Ogilvy’s client relationships.”Omnicom, the world’s largest advertising agency group, said on Tuesay it saw opportunities for acquisitions in the economic downturn, even as it reported weaker performance in Europe. John Wren, president and chief executive, said: “One positive side of the economic slowdown is the reduction in financial buyers interested in our industry.”He added that some competitors, which have “aggressively paid uneconomic prices for their acquisitions, have weakened their balance sheets”, diminishing their ability to make further deals.“We have been very disciplined about pricing for a long time,” he said. “We are in a great position going forward as opportunities become more in line.”Omnicom reported second quarter results largely in line with expectations. Total revenues grew 11.2 per cent in the quarter to $3.48bn, with organic growth at 4.8 per cent.While the economic downturn was yet to have a substantial impact in its home market of the US, Omnicom – whose many agencies include BBDO and DDB – saw slower growth in Canada, Spain, Italy and the UK.“Spain and Italy have been more or less in an economic recession in the last couple of quarters,” said Mr Wren. The UK, which accounts for 10 per cent of Omnicom’s business, saw a “flat performance”, down on the first quarter. This was largely due to an expected deceleration in its recruitment advertising business.Mr Wren said there was no other clear trend weighing on the UK, which has “suffered financial services declines… plus a little nervousness in the overall economic situation”.
212;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2008-07-21T10:44:04Z;US advertising;;This summer, hamstring permitting, millions of eyes will be glued to sprinter Tyson Gay (sponsored by Adidas) in Beijing. John McCain and Barack Obama, meanwhile, might spend up to $1bn on advertising in their battle for the White House. But claims that the US advertising market can live up to the promise of this “quadrennial” year seem increasingly half-hearted.In classified advertising, automotive and real estate listings are down, under pressure from the internet. Just last week, the property bust savaged profits at Gannett, the largest US newspaper publisher. The pain is spreading as national advertisers review budgets – cash- strapped General Motors recently announced marketing cuts. The financial services sector, which with autos comprised more than a fifth of ad spend last year according to UBS, is more focused on repairing balance sheets than launching TV campaigns.Overall advertising spend, with television boosted by the Olympics and elections, should grow slightly this year, but forecasts are faltering. Citigroup also predicts a decline for 2009. Expansion of internet advertising will not help much. With about a 10 per cent share of total spend, online will not compensate in a slump, and growth forecasts, though still in double digits, are being hacked back. Constrained spenders must choose between digital and other media, and advertising versus good old-fashioned price cuts. Even Google grew at a less prodigious rate than usual in the second quarter.One bright spot for marketing groups such as Omnicom, which reports second-quarter earnings today, has been overseas revenue growth, flattered by the ailing US dollar. As developed markets slow, expansion in countries such as China, Russia and Brazil continues. Such groups also have malleable cost bases and the ability to shift between different media and advertising strategies.At home, publishers and broadcasters have little choice but to wait for conditions to improve. In advertising, the economy always trumps sport and politics.Post and read comments on this Lex
213;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2008-06-23T00:25:39Z;Unilever and P&G ease marketing fears;;Two of the world’s biggest advertisers, Unilever and Procter & Gamble, reassured media owners and advertising companies that they would not cut their marketing budgets.AG Lafley, chairman and chief executive of P&G, said: “Right now the plans are to spend about the same percentage of sales [on advertising as last year].” In particular, P&G would be increasing its communications in shops, where research said consumers were making more purchase decisions. “In a period of food price inflation, more of the shopping list is being decided in the store.”Jim Stengel, chief marketing officer at P&G, added: “At a time when people are under pressure, the value of brands is higher than ever.”Simon Rothon, senior vice- president of global marketing services at Unilever, told the Financial Times in Cannes: “Overall we are sustaining levels of total support. But within that total amount, TV has declined and in common with the rest of the industry, digital media has gone up.”This is not least due to digital’s “potential for delivering an enormous return on investment, because the paid-for-cost can sometimes be minimal”.He added: “It’s marketing wisdom that the advertisers that sustain advertising at the optimum level in a downturn are the ones who emerge with a much more sprightly step when they come out of that recession.”Agencies, unsurprisingly, echoed that sentiment, even as they admitted some advertisers, particularly banks, were trimming marketing budgets.Bob Jeffrey, chief executive of JWT, a large agency owned by WPP, said: “The worst thing to do in a downturn is to cut spending – they will lose market share and never recover.”But anecdotal evidence from the Cannes Lions advertising festival suggests the marketing industry remains nervous of a downturn. Richard Morris, regional director of DDB Europe, owned by Omnicom, said that new business was “very, very quiet” in the first few months of the year, only to pick up suddenly in May and June.That may not be a good sign, he said. “Generally, whenever there’s a downturn, it’s heralded by a flurry of new business because people suddenly have issues. The lack of activity going on for that long was very unusual.”
214;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2008-02-25T03:32:14Z;Advertising decline hits the trade press;;A decade ago, Reed Elsevier made its money from thick volumes lining lawyers’ office walls, authoritative tomes on doctors’ desks and magazines that were required reading for the professions they were aimed at.Today, most of the Anglo-Dutch publisher’s legal and medical information is delivered via online databases to which well over 90 per cent of its customers renew their subscriptions each year.One corner of the company, however, has remained uncomfortably reliant on print and on less dependable advertising revenues. Trade magazines are taking longer than other professional publishing businesses to make the transition from paper to data.Reed and peers such as Thomson of Canada or the UK’s Informa have been envied by consumer publishers for their ability to develop profitable digital business models.However, Reed’s announcement last week that it was putting its trade magazines up for sale makes it the latest business-to-business publisher to distance itself from any dependence on advertising revenues.Nielsen, the private equity-backed group, sold the former VNU’s European titles, including Computing and Accountancy Age, to 3i in December 2006 to concentrate on its marketing information business.Emap sold its B2B titles to Apax and Guardian Media Group two months ago, while rivals such as DMGT and United Business Media sat out the auctions of print titles and invested instead in exhibitions businesses.Trade magazines were until recently seen as among the most promising advertising media. Because they enabled brands to reach highly targeted audiences, they were supposed to be more resilient than newspapers. Now, however, a structural shift of advertising revenues to the internet has combined with cyclical fears that advertisers will cut budgets in a downturn to make even specialist media owners nervous.Reed is selling Reed Business Information – home to Variety in the US, Estates Gazette in the UK and Elsevier in the Netherlands – “because it’s an ad-driven model,” explains Sir Crispin Davis, its chief executive: “It’s more cyclical and lower growth.”Advertising accounts for 56 per cent of the division’s £906m turnover, he adds, and online activities bring in just 30 per cent of revenues, roughly half the share in Reed’s other divisions.About 36 per cent of the $24bn (£12.2bn) sector’s income comes from advertising, while subscription revenues equal just 26 per cent, according to Outsell, a research firm which advises the information industry. Since 2005, trade publishers’ print revenues have fallen by $1bn, or more than 10 per cent, because advertisers have turned their attention elsewhere. In part, this reflects specific problems such as falling public sector recruitment advertising, which prompted Reed to close healthcare titles such as Hospital Doctor and Independent Practitioner in January.However, in a poll of advertisers last year, Outsell discovered that the decline in print revenues did not simply reflect the triumph of search engines. Advertisers believed trade magazines were better at generating business leads than search engines, but that trade shows were more effective still, says Chuck Richard, lead analyst at Outsell. Tellingly, “transactional” activities such as trade shows have now overtaken advertising, accounting for 39 per cent of the sector’s revenues.“A publisher that is not offering events is missing out on marketing dollars,” the study concluded.Reed runs more than 500 events a year, but has kept them largely separate from its magazines. Its decision not to include exhibitions in its disposal plans is one reason why analysts expect Reed Business Information to sell for a lower multiple than Emap’s more event-heavy B2B division. RBI has adjusted operating margins of 13 per cent, compared with a 36 per cent margin at Emap’s B2B business.Trade magazines are unusual in another way that suggests a more optimistic outlook: next year, according to Outsell, their online revenues will overtake revenues from print. Although this in part reflects the decline in print advertising, it also demonstrates the success of initiatives such as specialist search engines including Reed’s Zibb brand and targeted recruitment sites such as Reed’s KellySearch.Industry-specific social networks are also taking off. “When we host an event, we have an entire industry for five days of the year,” one industry chief executive says. “We are now looking at how we can use social networking tools to keep them for the remaining 360 days.”There is still hope for print, says Mr Richard, as advertisers find their campaigns work best run across several media at once.
215;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2007-07-25T17:36:51Z;Pacey tale of advertising’s evolution;;"BOOK REVIEWAdland: A Global History of Advertising
By Mark Tungate
Kogan Page £18.99/$39.95One of the best-known books by Jacques Séguéla, doyenne of the French agency scene, is Don’t tell my mother I work in advertising – she thinks I’m a piano player in a brothel. One can hardly imagine, say, Jack Welch adopting such a tone in his business books. But the mix of self-deprecation and histrionics implicit in Séguéla’s title reflects a familiar mindset in the global advertising industry.Its practitioners seem willing to confess publicly to having broken business models or to criticise the effectiveness of lucrative industry practices such as the 30-second television commercial. Such pronouncements often seem aimed more at journalists than clients.Paradoxically, Mark Tungate’s book, Adland, a journalistic primer on the history of advertising, avoids melodramatic flourishes.Its brisk narrative takes the reader from the beginnings of commercial advertising up to and beyond the creation of global holding groups, such as WPP, Omnicom and Publicis, which each comprise several global advertising agency networks, as well as businesses in other parts of marketing.For primary sources, the book quotes extensively from trade publications and websites, as well as the business biographies of industry pioneers.These are complemented by some up-to-date magazine-style profiles. Interviewees range from captains of industry such as Maurice Lévy of Publicis Group to less well-known protagonists such as Masako Okamura, a creative director at Dentsu, the Japanese advertising group, and one of the few women in the story.With a penchant for wearing soccer shirts in the office, Okamura displays an unusual management style. She tells Tungate: “In my team the one hard-and-fast rule is that meetings are limited to 90 minutes – just like soccer games.”While the writing is pacey, much of the history will be familiar to readers of similar titles and the author does not have a particular thesis to promulgate.The book summarises trends such as the 1990s vogue for spinning off the higher-margin, cash-generative agency function of planning and buying media slots from the ad-making side of the business without much analysis.Adland’s chief originality is its internationalism. Tungate covers a lot of smaller advertising markets as well as the industry’s traditional capitals in the US, UK, France and Japan.But the result is more useful as an explanation of how advertising got to where it is today, rather than as a guide to where it might be going in future.For instance, one of the incidental themes of the book – not explored in depth by Tungate – is the symbiotic relationship between advertising and journalism that has existed since the early days of both industries.As Tungate outlines, William Tayler, an 18th-century London tradesman recognised as the first self-described advertising agent, worked not for advertisers, but for newspaper-owning printers. The earliest US ad agencies were effectively salesmen for newspapers trying to sell space.It did not help the sector’s fledgling reputation that one of its first common uses was to market quack patent medicines. But by the start of the 20th century Albert Lasker, a young Texan who had begun a newspaper career, found himself being persuaded by his family to take the more respectable option of a job in an advertising agency. Lasker later recalled: “My father had a dread of my becoming a newspaperman, because in those days ... almost every newspaperman was a heavy drinker.”Charles Havas, Raymond Rubicam, Leo Burnett – many of the names that hang above the doors of today’s networks began life writing news rather than advertising copy.But the mutually beneficial link between advertising and journalism is under threat. Through blogs, social networking websites or viral advertising clips, the internet has demonstrated the ability to unbundle advertising from the journalistic and entertainment content for which advertising historically provided an indirect subsidy.Given the pace of development in digital media the fact that the author does not address such issues is perhaps unsurprising.However, Kevin Roberts, worldwide chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi, is surely right in his analysis when he tells the author: “Consumers know exactly what they want. They want it all.”"
216;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2007-07-02T11:13:59Z;Advertising outlook weakens in US;;Advertising forecasters have downgraded prospects for the US, challenging expectations of a boost to the marketing industry from the presidential election race and the 2008 Beijing summer Olympics.Zenith Optimedia, the international media buyer, on Monday shaved its 2007 expectations of US advertising expenditure growth to 3.3 per cent at constant currencies.Zenith, part of Publicis, the Paris-headquartered marketing services group, says weak expenditure on US network television and trade magazines to reduce further its previous estimate of 3.4 per cent, which had already come down from 4.1 per cent in December.Zenith follows recently reduced US forecasts by Carat, part of Aegis, the UK-listed media and research group, and a gloomy analysis by Universal McCann, part of Interpublic, the US-listed marketing services group.Universal McCann said US businesses were cutting back to focus on improving productivity and profits and building up cash resources. It puts US advertising growth at 3.1 per cent this year.The US is the world’s biggest advertising market and the key profit territory for the world’s two largest marketing services groups - Omnicom of the US and UK-listed WPP.Worldwide, the industry would normally expect a jump in expenditure during a period which includes the run up to the US presidential elections, the Euro 2008 football championships and the summer Olympics in China.The current downgrades for the US contrast with upbeat assessments from Zenith and others of prospects for global advertising, especially internet marketing.Interest in online video advertising and localised marketing on search engines has encouraged Zenith to publish upgraded figures for expenditure on internet advertising.It now believes internet advertising will grow by 82 per cent between 2006 and 2009, while the rest of the advertising sector grows by 13 per cent during the same period.Zenith estimates worldwide advertising expenditure will grow by 5.5 per cent this year and by 6.4 per cent in 2008. It calculates that the Beijing Olympics will generate about $3bn of extra advertising expenditure globally in 2008.Sentiment towards western european markets has also improved: Zenith estimates that German advertising last year experienced its fastest growth rate since 2000.Carat estimates that global advertising expenditure will increase by 5.8 per cent this year and 6.4 per cent in 2008.Univeral McCann predicts worldwide advertising will grow by 4.2 per cent in 2007.
217;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2007-06-25T20:28:30Z;Wall St down on subprime worries;;US stocks lost ground in late trade on Monday, as worries over the US financial sector’s exposure to the troubled mortgage market sapped sentiment.Stocks in the materials, energy and financial sectors led losses, while utilities were one of the few standouts. The rate sensitive sector was buoyed by lower bond yields, as concern over the mortgage market lingered.Meanwhile, a 0.3 per cent fall in existing home sales for May pulled real estate and home builder stocks lower on Monday.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,497.75 after rising to 1,514.29 earlier in the day. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,577.08 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to close at 13,352.05, after setting a high of 13,488.77 in early trade.The renewed selling in stocks pushed equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, to close near its high on Monday. In late trade, the Vix was up 6.9 per cent at 16.83, after a dip to 15.41 when stocks were in positive territory.Among financial stocks, Bear Stearns led losses with a fall of 3.2 per cent to $139.10. The bank remained in the spotlight after it pumped $3.2bn into one of its troubled mortgage hedge funds. In turn, analysts remain worried that woes could spread. Goldman Sachs lost 2.5 per cent to close at $216.74 and Lehman Brothers fell 2.1 per cent to $75.05.“Hedge fund losses, possible tax law changes and sub-prime mortgage write-downs bedevil equity markets,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. “Prior worries about higher oil prices and rising Treasury bond yields dissipate as the root of investment community unease.”This week marks month and quarter end, and leveraged investors may well value their mortgage positions at current prices and thus possibly reveal sharp losses in their portfolios.“We don’t think there are other funds like Bear Stearns Asset Management, although there may be a number of smaller funds that may face similar financing issues,” said Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse.Another feature of the last week in June is that some portfolio managers may alter their holdings by selling poor performing stocks and buying those that have done well over the past three months.“Over the last four years, we have found that the stocks which tend to perform best up until the last week of the quarter have outperformed the market during the last week,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.Heading into July, investors are also likely to focus on second quarter earnings, which are currently forecast to grow about 4.5 per cent. Still, at the start of April analysts forecast first quarter earnings would expand at less than 4 per cent, only for actual profits to rise around 9 per cent.“Consensus earnings growth expectations for the S&P 500 appears low, similar to the trend seen late in the first quarter, arguably providing the fodder for a turnaround in stock prices as was the case in April and May,” said Mr Levkovich.Beyond financials, a broker upgrade for General Motors, from Goldman Sachs boosted the car maker by 2.3 per cent to $36.27. Goldman Sachs said shares could rise further should GM’s discussions with labour unions end on a positive note for carmakers seeking to control legacy medical and retirement costs.A broker upgrade for Omnicom boosted shares in the advertising company by 2.2 per cent to $103.97.Meanwhile, Walgreens. the pharmacy retailer, fell 1.6 per cent to $44.25, after it reported a 20 per cent rise in its third-quarter profit.Google, set a new record high of $534.99, before the stock closed up 0.5 per cent at $527.42 on Monday.Shares in Harley-Davidson were 3.1 per cent lower at $60.64, after Honda denied it is looking to buy the motor-cycle maker. The stock surged 4 per cent last Friday, amid hefty options trading.Blackstone lost 7.5 per cent to close at $32.44, after last week’s debut for the first private equity firm to list on an exchange.Investors awaited news of whether the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones, can strike an editorial independence pact with Rupert Murdoch and facilitate News Corp’s $5bn bid for the company. Dow Jones fell 2.2 per cent to $57.50, while NewsCorp rose 0.8 per cent to $23.50.
218;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2007-02-27T23:39:59Z;Univision taps advertising veteran as CEO;;Univision Communications, the Spanish-language US broadcasting group, is close to announcing that it has hired Omnicom’s Joe Uva to be its next chief executive, people close to the matter said.Mr Uva’s move to Univision, which is being acquired by a consortium of private investors, makes him the latest senior executive to leave a public company lured by the incentives of the buy-out world.Mr Uva, who runs OMD, a media buying agency owned by Omnicom, will be offered a stake in Univision when it goes private under the ownership of Saban Capital, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, Texas Pacific Group and Thomas H Lee Partners.The appointment caps a search for a successor to Jerrold Perenchio, Univision’s longtime chief executive, that has lasted several months and has been closely followed in the US media industry.Univision is hoping that by selecting Mr Uva it will be able to meet one of its top challenges in recent years: to translate its high ratings, derived from its position as the leading media outlet for Hispanic-Americans, into higher ad sales.“We think there’s tremendous upside and opportunity in Univision and a big component of that is in advertising,” Richard Bressler, a managing director at THL, told the Financial Times.Before his five-year tenure at OMD, Mr Uva spent nearly two decades at Turner Broadcasting System, handling advertising sales and marketing for cable TV channels including TBS, TNT and Cartoon Network.Univision agreed to be taken over in June in a $12.3bn deal that is expected to close next month. Gaining regulatory approval for the transaction proved fraught, with the Federal Communications Commission imposing a $24m fee on Univision for violating rules governing the broadcasting of educational programmes.Mr Uva’s move from Omnicom, the world’s largest marketing services firm, comes amid fears of an exodus of talent from the public markets to private equity-backed companies. One of the most high-profile examples of this came in the media industry last year when General Electric’s David Calhoun left the US group to join Nielsen, the Dutch information group that was known as VNU before it was acquired by a consortium including Carlyle, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and Thomas H Lee Partners.Mr Uva did not return a call seeking comment. Univision declined to comment.
219;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2006-12-01T08:38:29Z;WPP takes stake in Chinese agency;;WPP, the global marketing group which believes China will be its third biggest market by the time of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, on Friday said it had acquired a 49 per cent stake in Beijing Raynet, a Chinese advertising group.The deal, subject to regulatory approval, was agreed through Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, the WPP wholly-owned advertising network, and continues the group’s expansion into the fast-growing Chinese market.The price paid was undisclosed though Raynet had unaudited revenues of Rmb37.2m (£2.4m) for the year to December 31, and gross assets at that date of Rmb70.1m. Raynet clients include China Netcom, Liaoning Mobile and Liaoning Netcom.China is estimated to expand its media advertising sector by about 29 per cent to $19bn this year, according to GroupM, the WPP media buying holding group.The three largest international marketing services groups – Omnicom of the US, WPP and Publicis of France – have been jostling to capture a slice of China’s increased advertising and marketing spend, and to partner with or buy local businesses.Earlier this year a joint venture between WPP’s network, Grey Advertising, and the Chinese Citic Guoan advertising group ended. Citic Guoan partnered instead with Omnicom.However, in September, WPP raised its stake in one of its Chinese joint ventures - between Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and Shanghai Advertising, part of the Shanghai World Expo Group - and extended this partnership for another 15 years.The joint venture had Rmb250m in the year to December 31, 2005, gross assets of Rmb807m, and a multinational client base which includes Motorola and BP.Through Bates, the WPP network of agencies dedicated to Asia, the group also agreed in November to buy 51 per cent of Chengdu Apex, a Chinese integrated marketing services group.WPP shares were down ½p at 674½p in early trading.
220;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2006-11-02T18:11:19Z;Publicis warns of slower growth in China;;Publicis, the Paris-based marketing services group, expects to grow revenues in China more slowly as a result of adopting a more selective approach to taking on assignments in the country.Maurice Lévy, chief executive of Publicis Groupe, on Thursday described competition for Chinese clients as “frenzied” with the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics expected to provide a strong platform for Western and indigenous advertisers.Mr Lévy said: “People in China are running fast in order to get whatever accounts are in the market. We have decided we will not enter into that race. We will choose only the clients who pay our bills and will give us our margin.”During the third quarter, Publicis revenues from Asia-Pacific grew by 3.1 per cent - a relatively low rate for the fast-moving region.The change in approach is expected to be complete by mid-November and Mr Lévy said he expected Publicis to grow faster than the Chinese market again next year.A disappointing third quarter in North America also caused underlying revenue growth across the group to drop to 2.6 per cent in the period - well behind rivals such as Omnicom of the US and UK-listed WPP.In North America, Publicis grew by just 0.6 per cent, as accounts losts from HP, the electronics group, and Sprint, the telecommmunications group, took their toll.Publicis, which owns the advertising networks Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett, said the disappointment should be “largely offset” as account wins in the third quarter fed through into the business.Mr Lévy said: “We have experienced similar situations in the past and their impact has always been limited.”In Europe, Publicis grew organically by 4.9 per cent and noted increased confidence in France and Germany.Over the first nine months, Publicis has averaged organic revenue growth of 5.4 per cent and total revenue was €3.13bn. It forecasts organic growth for the year of at least 5 per cent.Net new business won in the third quarter totalled $1.2bn, bringing the total for the first nine months to $2.8bn.Publicis shares, which closed before the third quarter revenues were announced, on Thursday fell 0.9 per cent to €29.94.
221;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2006-10-24T20:55:11Z;US stocks quiet as Fed meets;;US stocks were caught in narrow ranges on Tuesday, as earnings continued flowing while unsettled investors were distracted by the two-day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.36 points, or 0.03 per cent, at 1,377.38 while the Nasdaq Composite was 10.72 points, or 0.5 per cent, lower at 2,344.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled up 10.97 points at 12,127.88, marking its fourth record close in five days.Some observers warn that the surge in equities since markets bottomed in July might not be sustainable. “The break-neck expansion of the past three months may give way to a needed short-term pause in the coming weeks,” noted David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.Among steel-makers Nucor was up $6.47, or 11.74 per cent, at $61.58 and US Steel up $3.61, or 5.4 per cent at $70.19. Carmaker General Motors hit a 52-week peak for the second successive day with investors expecting good earnings on Wednesday as GM executes its turnround plan. GM rose $1, or 2.8 per cent, to $36.19 and is up 86 per cent for the year.Chemicals group DuPont, trimmed earlier gains, but closed 55 cents, or 1.2 per cent, higher at $46 after posting stronger than expected earnings and reiterating a solid outlook for 2006.Hurting the Nasdaq was a decline in Qualcomm.

Separately, Western Union rose 37 cents, or 1.9 per cent, at $19.95 after its earnings beat estimates.
222;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2006-09-11T16:09:35Z;WPP ups stake in Chinese JV;;WPP, the marketing services group, on Monday increased its investment in China by upping its stake in a local joint venture and agreeing to extend the partnership for another 15 years.WPP has reported rapid growth in China, one of the world’s fastest growing advertising markets, through a long-standing joint venture between its subsidiary Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and Shanghai Advertising, one of the largest Chinese advertising agencies.In Monday’s deal, the Shanghai Ogilvy joint venture, which was due to expire in October, was renewed for another 15 years. Ogilvy has also increased its stake in the joint venture from 51 per cent to 75 per cent for an undisclosed amount.The joint venture had revenues of Rmb250m in the year to December 31, 2005, and gross assets of Rmb807m. Its international clients include IBM, Motorola and BP, and it also works for Chinese advertisers such as Lenovo, China Mobile and Great Wall Wine.According to GroupM, the WPP-owned media buying operation, the Chinese market is forecast to see total media advertising revenue grow by 29 per cent this year.It is also the scene of intense jockeying among the multinational marketing services groups — WPP, Omnicom of the US and Paris-based Publicis — which have all attempted to position themselves to capture the market’s growth via joint ventures or acquiring Chinese companies.Earlier this year, a joint venture between WPP’s network, Grey Advertising, and the Chinese Citic Guoan advertising group, ended. Citic Guoan partnered instead with Omnicom.Separately, the Ogilvy Group China has agreed to acquire 60 per cent of Black Arc Advertising, a Chinese agency which specializes in real estate advertising and promotions.Black Arc had unaudited revenues of Rmb27.9m in the year to December 31 and gross assets of Rmb14.8m.WPP shares closed down 1½ p at 639½p on Monday.
223;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2006-07-20T17:24:44Z;Wal-Mart’s amateur advertisers;;"Could Babi, Sam Flow and Jay Jay So Sexy represent the future for Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer?All three are featured on the personal web pages of The Hub – School My Way, an online project that is part of its current “back-to-school” season marketing campaign.Launched earlier this month, The Hub is Wal-Mart’s latest bid to reach out to fashion-conscious youth consumers, urging them to “check out what styles are on the horizon”, and to “express your style”.It also marks the giant retailer’s first venture into the rapidly evolving world of interactive consumer-generated advertising – with an online competition inviting high school students to create their own web pages and videos, with the winners to be used in a Wal-Mart cable television commercial, possibly also for cinema release.The “School My Way” project is jointly sponsored by Sony, and put together by Wal-Mart’s GSD&M marketing agency, part of Omnicom, the world’s biggest marketing services agency. It follows similar campaigns this year by Nike and its Converse brand, and by MasterCard, Toyota Motor and L’Oréal.Such strategies are a response to broader changes in the way media is consumed, especially by teen­agers and people aged in their 20s, an audience prized by advertisers.The rapid spread of high-speed internet connections, together with the greater ease with which people can put their own text, audio and video content on the web and edit it, has changed media consumption from a passive experience to an interactive one. The same factors are also contributing to increased viewing of video on the web, including video advertising, previously available mainly on television.“This is the most creative generation that ever lived,” said Aaron Cohen, chief executive of Bolt.com, a user-generated content site which this week ran a competition to create a cyberspace “virtual band”, sponsored by the Wendy’s hamburger chain.“For these consumers, everything is recorded on their phones or on digital cameras. Just as watching ­television is entertaining for many older people; for
them, putting up music and videos and being part of a group talking about this is entertaining.”MySpace.com, the world’s biggest social networking site – and owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp – has nearly 250,000 new people around the world signing up every day and is expected to reach 100m registered users next month. The site, launched just three years ago, allows users to create personal profiles and put up blogs, video and songs, link to other users and communicate with them. It is now being tested by many advertisers, for example, with the creation of profiles based around made-up characters promoting a product.Reggie Bradford is chief executive of ViTrue, a company that provides marketers with the technology to create interactive advertising and which is in talks about partnering with a large advertising agency. He says that while this year a handful of brands were experimenting with the new interactive advertisements, he expects hundreds of campaigns next year.“We are just scratching the surface. Instead of a small number of ad agency executives creating the best ads, millions of people will be contributing to creating the best ads. This is a huge change that will really enhance brand advertising.”Compared with the tens of billions of dollars spent every year on television advertising, the amount spent on internet video advertising is very small: probably tens of millions of dollars in the US, according to some estimates. Even as a share of the rapidly growing internet advertising sector, which reached $12.5bn last year in the US, video commercials are tiny, with most spending going on search- word advertisements.YouTube, the fast-growing video-watching site, which recently passed the milestone of 100m video downloads a day, does not carry much advertising, in spite of its reach. This is partly because many advertisers are cautious about the new media. The risks of being associated with inappropriate or illegally reproduced content might damage a brand’s reputation.Indeed, the perils of handing over creative control to the internet were demonstrated earlier this year by GM’s Chevrolet brand’s new advertising-building website for the launch of its Tahoe 2007 SUV, where viewers were able to add their own text to a selection of clips and music. The responses included more than 3,000 attacking the company over fuel economy, global warming and its safety record.Wal-Mart has adopted a restricted format, with rules that preclude posting a range of potentially offensive material – including impersonations of politicians and other public figures. Web pages can only use recorded music from a limited selection of songs made available on the site by Sony.All submissions are also reviewed. As a result, after 10 days of operations, most of the original video submissions were still blank and marked “pending approval”.Registering to join Wal-Mart’s Hubster community also requires parental consent. Registered Hubsters are not allowed to post personal contact details, such as phone numbers, e-mail addresses or last names.Wal-Mart’s effort comes at a time when other mainstream online retailers are beginning to take a closer look at the opportunities for creating online communities – which can both reinforce customer loyalty and provide valuable marketing feedback.Target, Wal-Mart’s main discount rival in the US, this year started posting customer reviews below products on its online site – using technology developed by Amazon Web Services, which administers the Target site.Amazon itself has pushed even further ahead in the US, developing its online reviews to create user profile pages that can include photographs, e-mail addresses and lists of recommendations. These can then be linked to other selected “Amazon friends”.It is also continuing to test “tagging”, which allows a user to create a personal set of links connecting a variety of recommended product pages under topics such as “money” or “amazing story”.Tim Stock, president of scenarioDNA, a brand consultancy, argues that the Amazon site – unlike Wal-Mart’s marketing-focused Hub – reflects a more appropriate understanding of the role that social networking can play.“A lot of companies are still misunderstanding what social networks are,” he says. “They’re not websites . . . they’re people who use the technology to connect. So you have to do something that is authentic, and offer something to make them want to use it. You are tapping in to what people do naturally.”YO, BUYERS! DIY COMMERCIALS DRIVEN BY FUN, FAME AND FORTUNENew web tools and cheap technology make it easy for people to create their own material for advertising. Online blogs, pictures, videos and music can be home-made or edited versions of existing content. Yet they still require people to do some work rather than just sit back and watch something. Why should anyone take the time and trouble to make advertisements for a company that is not their client or employer?■It’s fun. Contributors enjoy the creative aspects and entertainment of making their own videos or music.■Fifteen minutes of fame. Many websites offer the chance to get your art, video or music shown to the world, either online or on television or even in film advertising. You no longer need to have good contacts or luck to get one of a handful of jobs at advertising agencies.■Prizes. Probably the most traditional of incentives, prizes are already used in many marketing campaigns. The chance to win fashionable clothes, electronic goods or tickets to concerts or film screenings, often with exclusive access to stars, remains a popular way for companies to try to encourage participation.■Money. Advertising agencies are starting to experiment with paying people to reflect the popularity of their advertisements, using the pay-per-click model commonly used in the online advertising world. As well as giving amateurs an incentive to try to make great advertisements, this model might also encourage agency employees to do their most creative work incognito, unhampered by the need for client approval."

It was awarded the most prestigious prize at the finale of advertising’s equivalent to the Oscars on Saturday.The win - staving off competition from commercials for Sony and Carlton Draught beer - gave the UK a total of 22 Lions during the week long festival, one ahead of the US on the event’s national league tables.Some rivals queried whether the winner contained a strong and new business idea since the slogan has been used in award-winning Guinness commercials previously.But Paul Brazier, executive creative director of AMV, said the spot, which has shown in the UK only, celebrated the product’s distinctively slow-pouring nature and was designed to increase the brand’s share amidst a declining UK beer market.Mr Brazier told the FT: “We went back to “Good things..” because it is such a strong endline.”He said the agency, which also provided the “Try something new today” campaign for J Sainsbury, credited with its part in helping the recent good performance of the supermarket chain’s food sales, had been given a brief to create “big, simple, beautiful ideas”.Elsewhere, Design Barcode, a tiny Japanese firm, was the surprise winner of the Titanium Lion for the best breakthrough idea in any medium. The company designs product barcodes to look like striking images of people and landscapes.In another success for Omnicom, its agency TBWA Paris won agency of the year.
225;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2006-06-14T17:32:10Z;Aegis and Bolloré in fresh clash;;A battle between Aegis and its biggest shareholder drew nearer on Wednesday after Vincent Bolloré, the French investor whose company owns 29 per cent of Aegis, vowed to continue fighting for board seats despite losing two shareholder votes.Mr Bolloré pledged to lobby investors and requisition company meetings this autumn after a majority of investors voting at the Aegis annual meeting opposed two board directors nominated by Groupe Bolloré, the conglomerate controlled by Mr Bolloré and his family.He warned the situation could damage Aegis – the media-buying and research group that has a market value of about £1.4bn ($2.6bn) – and help rivals such as WPP. Aegis shares, which have been increase by hopes of a Bolloré bid, duly fell 5.5 per cent on Wednesday to 123¾p.Mr Bolloré said: “I believe the board of Aegis has opened the door to the destruction of value at the company.”Lord Sharman, chairman of Aegis, however described the two nominees – Phillipe Germond and Roger Hatchuel – as representing a “fundamental and irreconcilable conflict of interest” because of their links to Mr Bolloré. Mr Bolloré also chairs Havas, the Paris-based marketing services group, which competes against Aegis for media-buying accounts.Lord Sharman, who is sceptical about any substantive benefits to Aegis investors from greater co-operation with MPG, the Havas media-buying division, had urged shareholders to oppose the two Bolloré nominees.After it was announced that 58.3 per cent of the votes cast were against the nominations, Aegis stressed that 94 per cent of the non-Bolloré votes cast supported the board’s position.It is understood Aegis has tried and failed in attempts to identify the holder of about 2 per cent of Aegis shares which voted with Groupe Bolloré.However, the Bolloré camp argued the margin of defeat was sufficiently narrow to encourage a drive this autumn to persuade about 8-9 per cent of shareholders to join their side.Mr Bolloré, who emerged as the victor of a boardroom battle at Havas, described the vote as the “first date” in what would be a “long love affair” with Aegis.He defended the nominees as independent, arguing that Omnicom, the US marketing group, also at one time had both a stake in Aegis and board representation, but it was not accused of a conflict of interest.Aegis replied that, at the time, Omnicom and Aegis did not compete substantially in the same territories and Aegis had been in a turnround situation.
226;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2006-04-03T22:02:39Z;Branding consultant named new DDB ad chief;;Omnicom of the US, the world’s biggest marketing-services group, on Monday named Chuck Brymer, head of its branding consultancy, as chief executive of its DDB Worldwide advertising agency.Mr Brymer, 46, who is currently the chairman and chief executive of Interbrand, succeeded Ken Kaess, who died last week at age 51 after a battle with cancer.Mr Brymer began his career at Omnicom’s BBDO advertising agency but he has worked since 1985 at Interbrand, which helps companies estimate the economic value of their brands and develop branding strategies.His appointment at DDB – an agency regularly awarded for its creative work - underscores the rapid pace of change in advertising. Clients are increasingly looking for new marketing solutions – employing a variety of means – because of fears that technological developments are enabling viewers to avoid television commercials.“Great advertising is the core of what DDB does, but it has expanded into a number of another areas – interactive, retail, customer relationship management,” Mr Brymer said in an interview. “Clients are requiring a richer and deeper tool box and I hope my experience in the brand consulting area would complement DDB.”Mr Bryner’s appointment also highlights the increasingly prominent role of Interbrand executives at Omnicom. Another Interbrand veteran, Michael Birkin, was named last year as Omnicom’s first chief executive for the Asia-Pacific region.Mr Brymer will be replaced at Interbrand by Jez Frampton, chief executive of the consultancy’s London office.DDB, one of Omnicom’s three global advertising agency networks, has 206 offices in 96 countries and represents clients such as McDonald’s, ExxonMobil and Bud Lite. Under Mr Kaess, it also became known for its Tribal DDB digital advertising agency, which was named Adweek’s interactive agency of the year in January.John Wren, Omnicom chief executive, said: “One of Ken’s legacies as a CEO is the management team, including the executive committee, he assembled at DDB. The appointment of Chuck will carry on that collaborative spirit.”Omnicom said Bob Scarpelli, 53, its chief creative officer, will also take on the post of chairman of DDB. He succeeds Keith Reinhard, the advertising agency legend known for the McDonald’s campaign: “You deserve a break today.”
227;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2006-03-03T14:49:10Z;Lex: Publicis;;"In advertisements, the world is usually portrayed as a beautiful place. It looks pretty good in Publicis’s 2005 results too.The French media group beat its peers with organic growth of 6.8 per cent and record net new business with a gross value of €7.8bn. Despite the depressing effect of the cost of new accounts, operating margins improved by 60 basis points to 15.7 per cent. Earnings momentum looks set to continue this year, bolstered by the impact of those new accounts and the World Cup in Germany.Following a 50 per cent rise since May, the shares discount much of the good news. Publicis has closed the price/earnings gap with WPP and Omnicom and now trades at a modest valuation premium.Of greater interest is what it will do next. The balance sheet has been simplified and strengthened. A 10 per cent ratio of net debt to equity is well below a stated “optimum ratio” of 50 per cent.Maurice Lévy, chief executive, feels shareholders will be better served by acquisitions than share buybacks. Further small acquisitions that extend product coverage and emerging market exposure are probable. A larger deal, such as buying Aegis, is less certain. So far, Mr Lévy has shown little inclination to pay up. Enjoying a sweet spot in the advertising cycle, Publicis can afford to wait. As Omnicom has shown, WPP-style, headline-grabbing deals are not the only way to grow.- Click here to add your comments

229;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2006-02-14T19:56:32Z;Mudlark: Simons’ starring role with Cagney;;"Twenty years after being part of the team that floated advertising agency Gold Greenlees Trott on the stock market, Paul Simons is repeating history, writes Clay Harris.Simons is chief executive of Cagney, a newly created marketing services group that made its debut on Aim this week after a placing by Keith Bayley Rogers.Cagney has been put together to hold broadcast advertising agency WTCS, brand consultants Paul Simons & Partners and Brand Aid, the PR firm Media Foundry and sales promotion agency Cubo.Talks are at a fairly advanced stage on adding other agencies to the group, Simons said on Tuesday. His aim is to fill a UK vacuum left by global agencies’ pursuit of growth in other markets, especially Asia.Simons’ career has veered between start-ups and industry giants. After leaving GGT, he started Simons Palmer, which was later taken over – like GGT – by Omnicom, chairing the combined business. In 1999, he became UK group chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy and Mather, part of Omnicom rival WPP Group. When that ended in tears in 2002, he started the brand consultancy that he has brought into Cagney.It will style itself the “mainstream alternative”; most of its leading lights have similar pedigrees with big agencies. And the “T” in WTCS is Dave Trott, renewing a partnership.But whence Cagney? Was it inspired by Angels with Dirty Faces? Or was it a slightly more contemporary tribute to Lacey’s detective partner? The prosaic truth, Simons says: “It’s an anagram of ‘agency’.”Langbar International shareholders were able to vent their feelings on Tuesday about their losses in the Aim cash shell at a meeting deep within the maze that is the New Connaught Rooms in Covent Garden.It’s fortunate that tempers did not get overheated; chairman David Buchler had warned the assembly that if the alarm were to sound, it would not be a fire drill but the real thing.Much of Britain’s property industry decamps to the MIPIM festival in Cannes for a week in mid-March.But Ian Coull, chief executive of Slough Estates, says the real place to be then is the Not The Mipim Lunch, an alternative event in London organised by John Stephen, UK chairman of property advisers Jones Lang LaSalle.National Express tried the teasing subject line “4 out of 10 people don’t open their e-mail”. Curiosity didn’t tempt this cat.The announcement by David Pitt-Watson, a leading light of Hermes’ activist Focus funds, that he was stepping down as the investment manager’s chief executive and reducing his commitments to Hermes came less than a week after he was its voice at the launch of London Business School’s Centre for Corporate Governance.The event kicked off with the initial results of a detailed study of Hermes UK Focus Fund by four academics showing that shareholder activism does – or may – generate better returns for shareholders.In his response, he touched on the need for responsible share ownership and accountability. He intends to use his new free time to expand on these themes in a book on corporate governance.Pitt-Watson has alluded to pursuing other interests – including spending more time with his children and at the Institute of Public Policy Research where he is a trustee. He might even find himself back in politics. He was Labour’s finance director until he joined Hermes in 1998, although he says he “has no more intention of doing that than anything else”. An adroitly political answer if ever there was one.Mudlark is well ahead on dry days this month, so his first sighting of this motto was amusing rather than sad: “The liver is evil.

230;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2006-01-23T18:47:24Z;Is ‘it’ the future of advertising?;;A few years ago, the argument could be made that the BBDO Worldwide advertising agency just wasn’t made for these times. It could still create flashy television commercials – it was the agency, after all, that accidentally set Michael Jackson’s hair ablaze at a shoot for Pepsi – but that began to seem rather quaint given the growing importance of other media.Today that argument does not wash. BBDO, the largest advertising agency in the world’s biggest marketing services group, Omnicom of the US, is on a roll. In the last year, it has won more than $1bn in new accounts (measured by client spending), adding such names as Ebay, Bank of America, and Motorola to a client roster that included General Electric, Pepsi and Gillette. If it had not been for the defection of Visa to another Omnicom agency, TBWA\ Worldwide, its year would have been nearly perfect.The results have raised the question of how BBDO has done it, and when Andrew Robertson, its chief executive, and David Lubars, its North American chief creative officer, give their answer, the remarkable thing is that it can be summed up in a word.It is “it”.The “it” in question is an example of what Mr Lubars calls a “reductionist nugget” – the Holy Grail of the new BBDO. By that, he means an idea so powerful, yet so adaptable, that it can be used as the basis of a marketing campaign that works in any medium – a television commercial, a website, a word-of-mouth campaign, an outdoor poster or even a package design.BBDO developed “it” in response to the creative challenge posed by one of its new clients, Ebay – the online marketplace that is itself a symbol of the “new economy”.“They are a very complicated client,” Mr Lubars says. “They don’t make or sell anything. Other people use them. They are like an enabler, a host. What they do is like air or gas.”BBDO’s campaign began with a similarly nebulous quality. For several days last autumn, BBDO promoted “it” itself. Posters of a brightly coloured “it” began to appear on city streets. A website came to life with video evidence of the global popularity of “it”. The message was emphasised in television advertisements that featured an unnamed actor stepping aside to reveal “it” – the letters “I” and “t” perched on a pedestal like a work of art in a museum.“Introducing the new It,” the actor said with all the gravitas of a supporting player in a soap opera. “With sleek design and incredible handling, it can turn on a dime. It can hold up to 2,500 of your favourite songs. It can cook anything from succulent chicken to chateaubriand. It doesn’t lose suction. It was designed by German engineers and developed in Sweden by renowned Japanese scientists. It has over 17,000 lines of resolution. It.”It was only several days later that the public was let in on the joke. “Whatever it is, you can get it on Ebay,” the advertisements said now, still treating the word “it” – rendered in the typeface of the Ebay logo – like a product itself.“We have given them a physical manifestation of the cerebral thing that they do,” Mr Lubars said. “What is ‘it’? ‘It’ is anything. Then ‘it’ became TV. ‘It’ became print. ‘It’ became online. ‘It’ became guerrilla [marketing]. ‘It’ became all these things because an idea can go anywhere.”The Ebay campaign only began running in the US at the end of last year, but officials of the online company mentioned their marketing efforts as a factor in strong fourth-quarter results, which added to the growing sense of vindication at BBDO.Only a couple of years ago, BBDO was an agency in transition, if not turmoil. Global leadership was turned over to Mr Robertson, then 43, a Zimbabwean-born one-time wunderkind of the London advertising world who had already served as chief executive of its London unit, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO as well as WCRS, another UK agency.Mr Robertson wasted no time in displaying the taste of a new generation, replacing BBDO’s long-time creative leader in New York, Ted Sann, with Mr Lubars, a BBDO veteran who had gone to rival Fallon, where he made his name by helping to create a series of internet films for BMW, the carmaker.Together, Mr Robertson, now 45, and Mr Lubars, 47, look like the stars of a production of The Odd Couple. Mr Robertson is the advertising world’s equivalent of a Brancusi sculpture – stylishly dressed in braces and bold ties, he is so polished he glows. Mr Lubars, by contrast, tends to look as if he has just rolled out of bed.But they are kindred spirits in their belief that BBDO did not need to be fixed, only redirected – an assessment shared by outside analysts such as Lauren Rich Fine of Merrill Lynch. She says creative people at agencies paid so much attention to television because they were encouraged to do so. By changing incentives, agency executives can change behaviour. “I don’t think it’s that hard to take that same creative mind and let it loose,” she says.In that sense, Mr Lubar’s “reductionist nugget” is a creative filter – a test of whether an idea is sufficiently mobile to work in different media.“The insight that forms the work, that’s a timeless thing – great insight, great work, no matter what era,” Mr Lubars says. “[Now], it’s got to have such legs that I can go more than three places. Not everything works in every medium, so that’s hard to do.”One consequence of this focus is that advertising may become more visual. The “it” of the Ebay campaign works both as language and as a sculptural element. “It is a much more visual medium,” Mr Lubars says.Mr Robertson argues that BBDO’s emphasis on cross-media ideas has become common across the creative industries. He says he saw a similar dynamic taking shape during a recent visit to Electronic Arts, the video game-maker based in Redwood City, California.“Guys who are into sounds now – guys who want to make music – aren’t going into the record business,” he says. “All the kids that when we were growing up would have formed bands are now creating soundtracks for video games. The forms are changing. There are many, many more forms.”Mr Lubars says BBDO is working on ways to turn its advertising ideas into entertainment concepts – maybe even situation comedies – and Mr Robertson looks forward to the day when consumers will not just tolerate advertising but pay for it, which sounds implausible until you think about how many people buy T-shirts with corporate logos.“Content can earn time with consumers that you cannot buy – can earn engagement with consumers that you cannot buy,” he says. “You can use that time to change what people do. You can use that time to change people’s behaviour. But it’s got to be really good.”That is wishful thinking, of course. But it may also be one of the big reasons that BBDO has been doing so well in recent months. It is run by real advertising people. Their glass is always half full – and it always tastes better than Coke. Blind taste tests prove it, you know.WHEN THE TV GETS A MIXED RECEPTIONAndrew Robertson, chief executive of BBDO Worldwide, is well suited for life today as the leader of an advertising agency. He thinks I Love Lucy is boring, writes Gary Silverman.Traditionally, advertisers and their agencies liked television shows such as I Love Lucy because they gathered large audiences. At one point, Mr Robertson says, I Love Lucy was watched by 52 per cent of US households.But there was always a flaw in this marketing model. A household television set may have been tuned to a particular programme but this did not mean that everyone in the room was enjoying the show – or even paying attention. Not all people watching Lucy loved her – and that probably made them a less receptive audience for advertisers.“If you happen to watch television late at night you will realise that actually I Love Lucy was pretty boring,” Mr Robertson says. “She had her moments, but it wasn’t worth 52 per cent of the households.”To Mr Robertson, the fragmentation of network television audiences – a product of the rise of the internet and other media – represents an opportunity for advertisers to reach more consumers on their own terms.“What has happened is that technology has made it easier for people to do what they want to do,” he says. “You can look at that as a huge threat or as an opportunity. The threat is you don’t get anything by right. You don’t get consumer engagement just because people are available to you.”The opportunity is to create advertising content that is interesting enough to attract its own audiences. It is a tall order – as anyone who ever watched the title character in I Love Lucy try to break into show business knows. Pleasing the public is tough.“You only get consumer engagement by earning it,” Mr Robertson says. “It’s not about better ads in the break. It’s not about having the best soft-drink commercial in the category. It’s about: I want to engage with you now, for a few seconds, a minute, or hours ideally, and you have the option of going to a million other places by touching a button. If I can create something that is compelling enough, you are going to stay with me. If I can’t, you’re gone.”LUCKY STRIKE OPENS P&G’S DOORThe BBDO Worldwide advertising agency is not only good. It is also lucky.Procter & Gamble’s $57bn acquisition of Gillette last year represented a stroke of good fortune for BBDO, the largest advertising-agency network in the world’s biggest marketing services group, Omnicom of the US.BBDO has produced Gillette’s advertising for decades, but neither it nor any of the other creative advertising agencies owned by Omnicom worked for P&G.That matters because of P&G’s unique position in marketing services. Agencies are keen to work with P&G because it is not only the world’s biggest advertiser, it is the most sophisticated. Working for P&G is a learning experience like no other.By virtue of the Gillette deal, BBDO became a “P&G agency” at an opportune time. Jim Stengel, P&G’s global marketing officer, has been expanding its roster of agencies – for instance, by shifting its Eukanuba pet food brand from the Saatchi & Saatchi unit of Publicis of France to Wieden + Kennedy, the agency behind Nike’s “just do it“ campaign.Mr Stengel also sounds impressed with Omnicom and BBDO. Indeed, at the Association of National Advertisers convention in Phoenix, Arizona, last October, he could be seen locked in friendly conversation with Andrew Robertson, BBDO chief executive.“Bringing Omnicom and [Omnicom chief executive] John Wren and Andrew and [David] Lubars [BBDO chief creative officer in North America] and all[in] is going to make us a better company,” Mr Stengel said.The links between P&G and BBDO have prompted chortling at Omnicom. After all, P&G bought Gillette just weeks after Omnicom’s leading rival, WPP of the UK, paid more than $1.5bn in cash and shares for Grey Global, gaining its first P&G advertising agency in the process. Omnicom pulled off the same trick without doing a thing.
231;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-10-11T19:27:29Z;Mudlark: JWT - Just Wait ’Til next time?;;"Pity those hard-working folks at JWT, the WPP unit formerly known as J Walter Thompson. It is the hard-luck agency of the London advertising world.For the second time this year, it has come agonisingly close to snagging a high-profile account from a competitor, and then fallen short.The bad news on Tuesday came from British Airways, which handed its £60m creative account to Bartle Bogle Hegarty. JWT was one of four finalists, along with the incumbents, M&C Saatchi, and DDB, a unit of Omnicom of the US.Earlier this year, JWT was one of two contenders for a £45m creative account at J Sainsbury. In that case, the incumbent agency, AMV BBDO, another Omnicom unit, retained the account.Agencies can spend hundreds of thousands of pounds preparing their pitches, pushing themselves to exhaustion to win big accounts. Someone at JWT must now explain what happened to Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s famously competitive chief executive.Party on, dudesMudlark has been wondering, meanwhile, about the etiquette of informing the winners and losers of agency pitches. It’s odd when a client insists that nothing has been decided when the winners have already been out for public celebrations that can’t help but be noticed in such a very small world.A merry quantWhen literary and business circles meet, sparks can fly, as shown by bookworld’s opposition to Waterstone’s proposed merger, through HMV, its parent, with Ottakar’s, the bookseller.But there were few such tensions on Monday at the Man Booker Prize. Indeed, Harvey McGrath, chairman of Man, the hedge fund group, was positively delighted to read John Sutherland, a professor of modern English literature and chairman of the panel of judges, in the FT last weekend discussing the complex “decision theory” behind picking the winner.That sort of discussion is meat and drink to the mathematical eggheads in the hedge fund industry. “Call it the quant theory of the Booker Prize,” said McGrath, beaming.The result itself would have made a hedge fund arbitrageur proud.In the run-up to his surprise victory for The Sea, John Banville, the Irish writer, was overlooked by the punters, and stood at 7-1, somewhere between the bookies’ favourite and the rank outsider.But McGrath was kept in less suspense than most. As he chatted before dinner, he patted the £50,000 cheque in his pocket. It already had the winner’s name on it.Whistle testAnyone who doubts that chambers of commerce can be a bit of a pantomime should consider the appointment of Simon Topman, manufacturer and amateur dramatics enthusiast, as president of the Birmingham Chamber.Topman has secured £50,000 in grants to create “the largest arts and business club in Europe” at the body, which represents 4,000 businesses.The club will encourage workplace arts projects. Topman has already tried this at his family company, Acme Whistles, which, as its name suggests, makes high quality whistles.He has built a small theatre on the third floor of his factory, where workers spend two hours every Friday honing their dramatic skills with help from Birmingham Repertory actors. The result, according to Topman, is that “cross-departmental problems have eased and time taken off normal duties has not resulted in a loss of production”.Topman is taking a year-long career break to concentrate on the presidency. This might suggest Acme Whistles will veer into dangerous waters without his hand on the tiller; after all, Acme boasts, with curious pride, that it supplied whistles to officers on the doomed Titanic. Topman says his wife Debbie will run Acme in his absence, and that she, rather than he, “is the mainstay of the business”.Break a legStaying with am dram and without leaving the Midlands, mark your diaries for next week’s production of Guys and Dolls by North Staffs Operatic Society in Stoke on Trent. Ewan McGregor and the rest of the West End cast of the same musical have already sent their good wishes.North Staffs traces its history to 1892; Mudlark has attended productions regularly since 1993 when it performed the amateur premiere of Billy, the unjustifiably neglected musical version of Billy Liar. Society veterans still fondly remember young Robbie Williams, the most famous son of Burslem since Arnold Bennett.He played the Artful Dodger in Oliver! and appeared with his friend, actor Jonathan Wilkes, in Hans Christian Andersen. http://hello.to/northstaffsThe navy larkSatisfaction, of sorts, for David Franklin, who had taken Hodder Stoughton to task over its use of the term “British navy” (Mudlark, October 1).When his initial letter went unacknowledged, Franklin wrote to the publisher’s chairman. No surprise – this brought an almost immediate answer, along with the rather lame excuse that “a few things were misplaced” during a recent office move.The publisher said the editing of the book about which Franklin had complained, To Rule the Waves, had taken place in the US, but it would “endeavour to correct this error” if it was reprinted. In the meantime, Franklin was sent a copy of Trafalgar by Tim Clayton and Phil Craig.Tactical withdrawalThe apocryphal story of a Canary Wharf ATM that only dispensed £50 notes (Mudlark, on Tuesday) struck a chord. One reader wrote: “This would be possible with all the banks located there except, of course, HSBC, which does not pay its staff sufficiently well for them to be able withdraw £50 at a time, let alone multiples thereof. I know; I used to work there.”"
232;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-10-04T19:38:09Z;Lombard: WPP joins Publicis under starter’s orders;;"What began two months ago with a bit of stake-building is turning into a two-horse race. To add to the excitement, the investor who sparked the initial interest is not directly in the running but has acquired a blocking stake.The share price is certainly excited. When Vincent Bolloré, corporate raider and chairman of Havas, bought a shareholding in Aegis early in August, the media buying group’s shares leapt to their highest level for more than four years. News that WPP had joined forces with Hellman Friedman in an approach, alongside the latest increase in Mr Bolloré’s stake to 12.6 per cent, sent the shares up to 143¾p on Tuesday – ahead of the indicative 140p a share approach from Publicis last month.In principle the purchase of the last sizeable independent media agency by any of the largest global advertising groups should make strategic sense. In practice, the interests of WPP, Omnicom and Publicis are far from identical.WPP’s real interest seems to be in Synovate, Aegis’ market research arm. But taking part in a £1.6bn acquisition seems a roundabout way of getting hold of a business with an estimated price tag of £320m.Hellman Friedman have bought other media assets, but the synergies available from buying Aegis would not be as great as those for a trade buyer.Omnicom has not expressed an interest. The purchase of Aegis would not fit with its strategy of bolt-on acquisitions, while the European focus of the group’s Carat network would not address Omnicom’s need to increase its media buying in Asia.For Publicis, the acquisition of Aegis would make the French group the biggest media buyer in Europe – a role currently held by WPP. There would just remain the question of how any bid would be financed.As for Mr Bolloré, his stake-building has already netted him a paper profit and given him a strong hand in negotiations with any bidder. He is in no hurry to make clear his aims, but his position as Aegis’ largest shareholder has made him a winner before the race’s official start.Aim and destinyManifest destiny, a term coined by a New York journalist and implying a God-given right to territorial conquest, helped inspire the white man’s 19th century westward expansion across the American continent.Was there a faint echo of this yesterday in the assertion by Chris Gibson-Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, that it is the Aim market’s “destiny” to expand across another continent – Europe – and provide it with its growth market for small and medium companies?Aim is a long way from that now. But talking yourself up is good marketing and the ambition is not unreasonable in the long term, given London’s position as Europe’s financial centre; the junior market’s record, good regulation and remarkable expansion of listings over the past couple of years; and the lack of serious competition from continental exchanges.Straws in the wind include the recent flotation of the first German company to have its primary listing on Aim. And the potential market is large. Research for the LSE by Oxford Analytica suggests success could triple Aim’s listings.But if Aim is to succeed, it will need Mammon rather than God on its side, and that means giving continental companies and their financial advisers good material reasons for floating in London.Aim’s success so far is due in considerable measure to its system of Nominated Advisers, which vet companies before bringing them to market. So it makes sense that the LSE, which already has one nomad in Brussels, now aims to roll the system out across Europe. But that is no guarantee it will overcome deep-seated national biases against listing in a foreign country. Aim needs more work to present itself as European. Its destiny here is far from manifest.Bundle of funThe unbundling of brokerage commissions into execution and research elements, due to take effect in January, will give institutional investors valuable new information about their fund managers’ charges and could lead to huge changes in City relationships.But what about small investors in retail funds? As individuals, they have little hope of influencing their fund managers’ behaviour. Few of them would even understand these data dumps, so should they get them?The Financial Services Authority wants specified investor representatives – for example, depositaries of unit trusts – to vet the information on behalf of retail investors and take any action needed.As for disclosure, it does not think the benefits of compulsory reporting to all investors outweigh the heavy costs. Instead, companies could make the information available on request, for example on a website.This all looks sensibly proportionate – unlike the reaction of the Investment Management Association, a City umbrella body, which criticised the FSA for supposedly seeking to withhold information from private investors. It seems to have got the wrong end of the stick."
233;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-09-27T12:09:35Z;Bollore increases his stake in Aegis;;Vincent Bollore, chairman of Havas, raised his stake in rival Aegis on Tuesday to 8.04 per cent from 6 per cent. The French corporate raider’s move strengthened the impression that there could be a struggle to takeover the UK independent media company.However, the news failed to lift Aegis’ share price back to 140p, the indicative price put forward by Publicis of France in preliminary talks that were confirmed last week.In early afternoon trading, Aegis shares stood at 139p. Last Wednesday they had traded at 145p after news of the talks with Publicis.Omnicom of the US, the world’s largest marketing services group, dampened speculation there could be a three horse race, indicating a few days ago that it was not interested in bidding for Aegis.
234;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-09-21T19:02:51Z;Lex: Aegis;;When a large independent media company is up for grabs, Vincent Bolloré, the French corporate raider, is never far away. Mr Bolloré, as a prominent shareholder in Havas, opposed its bid for Grey Global, which fell to WPP.Now, his purchase in August of a 6 per cent stake in Aegis has shaken out a bid approach for the media buying group, understood to be from Publicis.Investors see scope for a second bidder and yesterday pushed Aegis's shares above the 140p-per-share indicative offer. The potential for synergies favours a trade buyer over a financial one. Interpublic is wrestling with accounting woes and, while WPP can never be ruled out, it is digesting Grey. Omnicom appears the most likely rival and is reported to have shown a prior interest in Aegis.Mr Bolloré, meanwhile, took advantage of weakness in Aegis's share price, but is not an obvious counterbidder, either as a financier or as the new chairman of Havas. He prefers creeping control to paying a significant bid premium and Havas would struggle to afford the indicative £1.6bn price.With at least two credible trade buyers a competitive auction is possible. Omnicom's takeover criteria that deals should immediately enhance earnings may dampen the bidding, although it probably could afford to pay 150p-per-share before taking account of savings. But, after a 47 per cent rise since the start of August and with the indicative bid already at 21 times consensus 2006 earnings, investors should not set their sights too high.
235;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
236;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-07-27T19:02:40Z;Lex: Publicis;;There may be no such thing as bad press. But unveiling record new business volumes certainly beats ugly boardroom spats and accounting investigations.Publicis, the French media group, won contracts with a gross value of $6.1bn in the first half. Two-thirds were in media buying and consultancy, including a $3.2bn contract with General Motors.Maurice Lévy, chief executive, points to the strength of Publicis' two media buying agencies. But competitors' woes have also played a part. GM and L'Oréal business was won from Interpublic, which has been unable to file accounts for 2004 and is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, instability at Havas, culminating with the effective ousting of Alain de Pouzilhac as chairman by French investor Vincent Bolloré, can hardly have helped its business.Good fortune notwithstanding, Publicis is in fine shape on most metrics: organic growth, profitability and cash flow generation. It has closed the recent growth gap with main rivals WPP and Omnicom, and even surpassed them in the second quarter. The cost of new accounts typically depresses margins early in the contract's life. But, encouragingly, operating margins increased by 90 basis points.Publicis has momentum, lending confidence to its upbeat outlook and re-iteration of longer-term margin targets. The fly in the ointment is that, after gaining more than 20 per cent in the last three months, the shares have already priced in the good news.
237;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-06-29T17:16:20Z;Dru rejects chance to run Havas;;The future of Havas, the French marketing-services group, grew murkier on Wednesday as advertising legend Jean-Marie Dru turned down a chance to head the company.Mr Dru's decision represented a blow to Vincent Bolloré, the French investor who this month was elected to the Havas board along with three allies, and then forced out Alain de Pouzilhac as chairman and chief executive of the company.Mr Dru, 58, who will remain as chief executive of Omnicom's TBWA Worldwide, was widely seen as the French advertising world's best candidate to turn around the fortunes of Havas, the fifth-biggest global marketing services group.However, Mr Dru wound up embodying the title of his own well-known book, Disruption, surprising even some of his own colleagues by walking away from an opportunity to play the role of a national champion at a French corporate institution.Mr Bolloré's courtship of Mr Dru had been unusually public. After he and his allies won board seats, Mr Bolloré told the Financial Times Mr Dru would make a good chief executive and might take the job because he was French.The possibility Mr Bolloré might succeed in luring away Mr Dru galvanised the global advertising community last week as it gathered for its annual awards in the sweltering city of Cannes in the south of France.When Mr Dru was seen huddling at a three-hour lunch with John Wren, chairman and chief executive of Omnicom, rumours spread that Mr Dru was leaving TBWA.But Mr Dru appeared subsequently at a TBWA beach party and was met by an outpouring of affection. Colleagues printed t-shirts with his image and declared their love for him. “The first thing he said when he sat down at the table was that this had nothing to do with money,” Mr Wren said. Mr Wren added that he was “just delighted” that Mr Dru was remaining at TBWA, calling it a confirmation of the “values and culture” of Omnicom, which is based in the US.Mr Bolloré, who owns 22 per cent of Havas, has given little indication of his plans for the company other than to say that he is a long-term investor. Speculation is rampant in the industry that he will wind up selling Havas or pieces of it.Richard Colker, a former banker and Havas board member, is serving as acting head of the company.The board has named a compensation and selection committee that is seeking a successor to Mr de Pouzilhac.Havas shares rose €0.01 to €4.54. Analysts have suggested the company's stock price has been boosted by speculation that Mr Bolloré might sell off assets.
238;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-06-22T16:36:47Z;Havas in limbo after chief is ousted;;Havas, the French advertising group, has entered a period of management limbo following the ousting of Alain de Pouzilhac as chairman and chief executive on Tuesday night.Havas, which owns Euro RSCG Worldwide, Arnold Worldwide and MPG, is now being run by four board directors until a new leader is appointed. Jean-Marie Dru, the chief executive of Omnicom's TBWA Worldwide, is seen as the leading candidate for the job.Mr de Pouzilhac stood down as chairman and chief executive but kept his board seat after mishandling a spat with Vincent Bolloré, Havas's largest shareholder.The overthrow of Mr de Pouzilhac has, at least temporarily, left the future direction of the business unclear in an industry where clients are increasingly mobile and hard to retain.Frederik Kooij, an analyst at CSFB, said the uncertainty could hamper Havas's ability to hold on to its accounts: “It is a big problem. There is no way that this is helping the business.”Havas had already suffered two big contract losses this year involving Intel and Volkswagen. However, it has also posted contract gains with clients such as RadioShack and Jaguar.Havas said that there was no reason why it should lose business now, pointing out that its agencies still had their individual leaders, while adding that the dispute with Mr Bolloré meant it had long been coping with uncertainty.In the process of building a 22 per cent stake in Havas and then securing four board seats despite opposition from Mr de Pouzilhac Mr Bolloré has not outlined his preferred strategy for the group beyond dropping heavy hints that he wanted to recruit Mr Dru, and questioning the group's international acquisition record.Havas refused to discuss the financial terms under which Mr de Pouzilhac agreed to stand down. His mandate as director runs until next summer and it is understood that he has signed an immediate non-compete clause.Mr Bolloré's success in winning four board seats is thought to have hinged on a last-minute alliance with Havas's second-largest shareholder, Sebastian Holdings, which had been expected to vote its 5 per cent stake with Mr de Pouzilhac at the annual shareholder meeting on June 9.On Wednesday, Amir Jahanchahi, the representative of Sebastian Holdings at the shareholder meeting, denied that the switch constituted a betrayal. He suggested that the exclusion of Mr Bolloré had become dangerous to Havas's health, making a solution imperative.
239;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-06-21T21:57:54Z;De Pouzilhac quits as Havas chief;;Havas, the French advertising group, was on Tuesday night left under temporary leadership after Alain de Pouzilhac's tenure as chairman and chief executive ended during a lengthy board meeting without a permanent successor being appointed.The advertising industry veteran gave up the two posts - but kept his board seat - after publicly losing a long-running dispute with Vincent Bolloré, the French investor, who has built up a 22 per cent stake in Havas, the fifth-largest global advertising group.Havas - which owns Euro RSCG Worldwide, Arnold Worldwide Partners and MPG - will be left under the temporary stewardship of Richard Colker, an independent board member, until a successor is announced.Mr Colker will be aided by three other directors employed by Havas: Ed Eskandarian, Fernando Rodés and Jacques Séguéla.Prior to the board meeting, there had been speculation that Mr de Pouzilhac would be replaced by Jean-Marie Dru, chief executive of TBWA Worldwide, part of Omnicom.In a statement on Tuesday night, Havas said the board would meet soon to consider a new stock incentive plan for staff, after a previous arrangement was vetoed in the crossfire between Mr Bolloré and Mr de Pouzilhac.The dispute that ultimately cost Mr de Pouzilhac his job followed Mr Bolloré's request for four board seats to reflect his status as Havas's biggest single shareholder.This request was opposed by Mr de Pouzilhac, who accused the investor of being difficult to trust, while claiming that there was a risk of ceding control of the company to Mr Bolloré without other shareholders receiving a takeover premium.However, Mr de Pouzilhac was roundly defeated at the Havas annual shareholder meeting last week. Mr Bolloré - who had told the gathering that he was a long-term investor rather than a corporate raider, or even “Darth Vader” - secured enough investor support to win all four of the board seats that he and his allies had requested.In the aftermath of the defeat, however, Mr de Pouzilhac told staff that he would be staying on. In a memo distributed to employees he wrote, “I feel neither personally beaten nor dejected, just sad.”He added: “I now intend to assume fully my responsibilities. I will devote all my heart and all my energy to continue the turnround of our company.”However, this determination to continue in his old position became untenable under sustained pressure from Mr Bolloré, who had told the FT that he was “not sure at all” that he could work with Mr de Pouzilhac.The two men met over breakfast last Thursday for the first time after the June 9 shareholder meeting. Mr Bolloré said they discussed the “different possible hypotheses” for the management of the company.
240;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-05-16T17:22:11Z;Marketing giant Publicis starts to think small;;The argument that small is beautiful in advertising is drawing support from an unlikely quarter Publicis of France, the world's fourth-biggest marketing-services group.Publicis is launching a creative agency in Paris that will try to respond to the recent success of smaller advertising shops in winning global assignments.The rising profile of these smaller agencies is ironic, coming as it does at the same time that giant communications groups such as Publicis have been created to serve multinational clients.Publicis officials said they believed that most big clients still wanted a big agency partner. But there were also enough big companies that preferred an alternative to justify the creation of a smaller agency under the Publicis banner, they said.“It's not a contradiction despite the fact that it looks like one,” said Maurice Lévy, Publicis chairman and chief executive.“It's one of the paradoxes, and we love paradoxes at Publicis, that have allowed us to be at the top of innovation.”The new marketing agency, named Marcel, after Publicis founder Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, will be run by Frédéric Raillard, 34, and Farid Mokart, 38, an award-wining creative team that worked most recently at Omnicom's Goodby Silverstein agency in the US.Their work has included advertisements for companies, including Pepsi and Microsoft-Xbox, as well as a well-known music video, Rock DJ, for Robbie Williams, the UK pop star.Mr Lévy said he decided to use two creative people to headthe agency, rather than business managers, as is often the case, as a sign that “we are creating something totally new”.The rise of the smaller agency with a global perspective comes at a time of crisis in advertising. Agencies fear their traditional weapon, the 30-second television commercial, is losing its influence and they are casting about for replacements.The result is increasing complication. There are more ways of delivering advertising, such as via the internet or mobile phones, and less confidence in the industry that consumers are paying attention.Smaller agencies have won fans by coming up with unlikely solutions, such as the “subservient chicken” website cooked up for Burger King by Miami's Crispin Porter + Bogusky. It has attracted a whopping 418m visitors by giving them a chance to give orders to a man wearing a chicken suit.Mr Raillard and Mr Mokart said they believed that smaller agencies were better equipped to create advertising that works as entertainment and will thereby win the attention of increasingly jaded consumers.“Many of these agencies think like Hollywood,” Mr Mokart said of agencies such as Crispin Porter. “It's high concept.”They said Marcel, which will start with 20 to 30 people, will offer an array of marketing services, from advertising to promotions and website design. The only office for now will be in Paris but the intent will be to serve global clients. It is already working on brands at Nestlé and Allied Domecq.“It's about having all those people in the same place, to have this coherence,” Mr Raillard said. “The agency is where we build a scenario, a strong story, for the brand.”Publicis decided to put Marcel in Paris because the French capital suffers from a shortage of “hot shops”, such as London's Mother, and 180 Amsterdam in the Netherlands.Mr Raillard and Mr Mokart said many French advertising executives preferred to work for well-known names in the agency world, as they did during stints at shops owned by such holding companies as Havas, Publicis and Omnicom.“We want Marcel to shake up the rules in France,” Mr Raillard said.
241;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-04-26T22:43:23Z;Omnicom sees worldwide revenue growth;;Omnicom of the US, the world's largest marketing services company, said on Tuesday its first-quarter earnings rose 11 per cent as revenues grew in all regions of the world.The earnings were announced in New York as one of Omnicom's London advertising agencies, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, won one of this year's most hotly contested pitches in the UK, retaining its £45m ($85m) account with Sainsbury's, the retailer. WPP's JWT agency was the other contender.Omnicom earned $150.5m last quarter, up from $135.6m in 2004.Revenues rose 7.7 per cent to $2.4bn, with gains of 11 per cent in Europe, 7.5 per cent in the US, 5.7 per cent in the UK and 5.2 per cent elsewhere.Omnicom's revenues were up 5.8 per cent after being adjusted for currency fluctuations and acquisitions. WPP, Omnicom's closest competitor, said last week its like-for-like revenues rose nearly 6 per cent in the period. Omnicom made only $2m in acquisitions in the first quarter, but Randall Weisenburger, chief financial officer, said the company's “acquisition pipeline was fairly full”.He said Omnicom, which usually does smaller deals that add to its product capabilities or geographic reach, would probably make more acquisitions this year.In a note to clients, Alexia Quadrani, a Bear Stearns analyst, called Omnicom's results “very encouraging” and said the company's shares deserved a higher price-earnings multiple.Omnicom shares fell 88 cents to $84.82 in New York.
242;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-04-22T11:39:05Z;WPP reports first-quarter growth;;WPP, the UK advertising group, said on Friday that business was looking beyond cost-cutting and paying more attention to branding as it recorded a third successive quarter of growth.The strong results did not however prevent shares from slipping slightly to 599p by midday.Reported revenues in the first quarter to the end of March were up 16 per cent at £1.11bn ($2.1bn) including a three week contribution from Grey Global, the US advertising agency, following the completion of a $1.5bn acquisition on March 8.Despite its global reach, the group said the impact of currency fluctuations during the quarter was minimal.On a like-for-like basis, WPP achieved organic growth of 6 per cent with double-digit growth across all regions on a constant currency basis. Growth was especially strong in the emerging markets, rising 22 per cent in Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East.“This maintains the improvement in the organic growth rate of the last two quarters of 2004 and reflects the growing focus by clients on improving profitability through innovation and branding and top line growth, rather than by relying solely on cost cutting,” the company said.WPP also said on Friday that profitability was ahead of its full-year target and reiterated that it expected a full-year profit margin of 14.3 per cent, as set out in March by Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive.The advertising group booked £875m worth of new business during the quarter as the company benefited from consolidation trends in the industry with large assignments from new and existing clients.The benefits from quadrennial events - the US presidential election, the European football championships and the Olympics - meant this would be ”the easiest quarter in which to show a difference”, according to Paul Betts of Charles Stanley.Kingsley Wilson of Investec said that organic growth of 6 per cent was better than expected but Mr Betts said that good comparative results would get much harder to achieve as the year progressed, especially in light of doubts over the direction of the US economy.In its quarterly report, WPP gave details of how its accounts would be affected by the new international financial reporting standards (IFRS) . Full year results for last year would shrink from £292m to £273m under the new accounting rules.The advertising industry has been through a decade of consolidation leaving four global holding companies dominating the business, WPP of the UK, Publicis of France and Omnicom and Interpublic of the US. These groups are now shifting their focus away from a reliance on television commercials to a more integrated approach to advertising and marketing, including important new channels such as the internet.Online advertising is booming, although total revenues are still small compared with the industry as a whole. Google on Thursday said that the boom in advertising on its search engine had more than doubled its revenues and sent profits soaring in the first three months of the year.However, not all news has been positive for WPP. Last week, William Eccleshare, the chairman and chief executive of Young & Rubicam (Y&R) brands division for Europe, Africa and the Middle East, defected to rival BBDO Worldwide of Omnicom. The move adds to problems at the unit, which Sir Martin said was underperforming when he raised profit forecasts in February. Y&R compounded its problems by losing the accounts for Jaguar and Sony Electronics in March.
243;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-04-11T15:13:48Z;Young & Rubicam executive jumps ship;;WPP's Young & Rubicam Brands unit suffered the latest in a series of setbacks on Monday as its European chief left for a post at a leading advertising rival.William Eccleshare, chairman and chief executive for Y&R Brands in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, has agreed to take a position heading BBDO Worldwide in the same region.Andrew Robertson, chief executive of BBDO, said Mr Eccleshare would be joining his company once he fulfilled his obligations at Y&R.Mr Eccleshare, 49, is one of the most respected figuresin the London advertising community and his departure could add to concerns about Y&R, which haslost accounts recently at Burger King, Computer Associates, Jaguar and Sony Electronics.The setbacks at Y&R have mainly involved its creative advertising output in the US. Other parts of the company such as its European operations and Wunderman, its direct marketing arm have been producing stronger results, analysts say.WPP bought Y&R for $4.7bn in shares in 2000 and installed Ann Fudge, a former Kraft Foods executive, as chief executive in 2003. In recent months, Y&R's problems have stood out, given the success of many of WPP's other operations and its stock price.In February, when WPP raised its profit-margin forecasts for this year and next, Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive, said: “Young & Rubicam advertising has to raise its game and we are taking actions to try to improve that level of success.”BBDO is the biggest advertising agency network in Omnicom of the US, the only marketing-services holding company bigger than WPP, which is based in the UK.Under Mr Robertson, 44, who took control of BBDO last year, the agency has been trying to move away from its dependence on TV commercials. This would involve a more multi-disciplinary approach combining advertising with other marketing services. Mr Robertson said one reason BBDO was turning to Mr Eccleshare was his experience in managing complex organisations.Mr Eccleshare took control of Y&R's operations in EMEA in August 2002. He was given responsibility for Wunderman's operations in the region the following June. Before joining Y&R, Mr Eccleshare served for two years as a partner at McKinsey, the consultancy group. He had more than 20 years' advertising experience before joining McKinsey at J Walter Thompson, now another unit of WPP, and Ammirati Puris Lintas.
244;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-04-06T20:49:24Z;Mobiles to ?replace TV as prime ad medium?;;Mobile telephones and other wireless communication devices will soon become the most important medium for advertisers to reach technology-savvy consumers, one of the world's leading advertising executives said on Wednesday.The forecast by Andrew Robertson, chief executive of Omnicom's BBDO advertising agency, the world's third-biggest, underscores the uncertainties facing advertisers in developed markets as they shift from their traditional dependence on television.The problem for advertisers is that technological developments such as the spread of digital video recorders are giving consumers the ability to avoid TV commercials.Mr Robertson said he believed the way forward for advertisers to reach consumers would be to use wireless devices such as mobile phones, laptop computers and the BlackBerry e-mail devices favoured by travelling corporate executives on the go.?We are rapidly getting to the point where the single most important medium that people have is their wireless device,? he said. ?It's with them every single moment of the day. It's genuinely the convergence box that everyone has been talking about for so many years.?Mr Robertson, a 44-year-old native of Zimbabwe with experience of the London advertising industry, was named chief executive of BBDO last year in what was seen as an attempt to shake up an agency known for its TV commercials.While stressing the importance of reaching consumers on wireless devices, Mr Robertson was open about the difficulties this will create for advertising agencies.Unlike television viewers, mobile phone users are unaccustomed to commercial interruptions. To reach them, agencies will have to develop content so engaging that mobile phone users will it seek out - a tall order.?You have no way to interrupt because they can choose what they can do,? Mr Robertson said. ?The opportunity is if you can create some content that they want to engage with, they can do that all of the time from anywhere.?Mr Robertson spoke as BBDO released a report that said consumers are now more willing to live without television than without mobile phones or home computers.The agency asked nearly 3,000 typical consumers in 15 countries to choose the communications device they would most want to keep. Forty-five per cent said their home computers, 31 per cent their mobile phones and 12 per cent their televisions. In China, 61 per cent opted for mobile phones, compared with 30 per cent for home computers and 4 per cent for televisions.The survey found that mobile phones users like to stay connected even while they are asleep. More than 60 per cent said they kept their phones on and within reach 21 to 24 hours a day, and 15 per cent said that figure was 16 to 20 hours a day.
245;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-03-14T18:38:46Z;Omnicom’s agencies do the talking;;"For two decades, consolidation has been the name of the game in advertising and marketing services.Hundreds of the world's most important agencies have been combined into a handful of gargantuan holding companies, led by Omnicom and Interpublic of the US, WPP of the UK and Publicis of France.Now, John Wren, chief executive of Omnicom, the world's largest advertising group by revenue, says a new era is fast approaching.""What happened in the 1990s was the consolidation of this business,"" Mr Wren says, speaking in his modest, Madison Avenue office. ""What's going to happen in the 21st century is the evolution of these assets into fully integrated advertising and marketing communications organisations which are no longer simply focused on television commercials.""It has not been an easy conclusion to come to - because his agencies are so good at TV advertisements.But, already, Omnicom has conducted a structural rethink, and Mr Wren - known as the quiet man of advertising, in contrast to Sir Martin Sorrell, his great rival at WPP - says that his company is in the final stages of a quiet, three-year reorganisation of its business. This is designed to transform its global advertising networks - BBDO Worldwide, DDB Worldwide and TBWA Worldwide - into what he calls ""communications companies"". These are, in effect, a move back towards the multi-disciplinary agencies that once ruled New York's Madison Avenue.The strategy, acknowledging that television commercials no longer pack the marketing punch they once did, is not without risk for Omnicom. Its agencies have built their reputation by producing many of the world's best-known commercials for clients such as Pepsi, McDonald's, DaimlerChrysler, Budweiser, FedEx and General Electric. The moving-and-grooving ads that have helped make the Apple iPod hip were the work of TBWA\Chiat\DayinLos Angeles.Mr Wren's conviction that Omnicom has had to move with the time is founded on a belief that the advertising agency of the future will have four key abilities: it will make advertisements; it will be able to help clients figure out where to place them for the maximum impact - a business known as media planning; it will practise customer relationship management - employing the internet, mail or other means to interact with consumers; and it will have specialist knowledge in how to use retail stores for advertising.To some degree, Omnicom is turning back the clock in order to make these changes. When the company was formed in 1986 by the merger of BBDO, Doyle Dane Bernbach and Needham Harper Worldwide, it put all the marketing services operations into a division called Diversified Agency Services, or DAS.At the time, the decision was taken to give marketing services - such as direct mail, design and branding consultancy - greater freedom. But now, in the new business climate, some of the marketing services companies are being reintegrated with the advertising agencies.""The clients don't want to deal with 100 suppliers any more,"" says Mr Wren, who once led the DAS division. ""They want to go to a place that can ensure that communication across all media is integrated and that the people working on their behalf speak to, and understand, the other guy's discipline.""The changes are being made with great deliberation, which is typical of Omnicom and Mr Wren, a laconic 52-year-old accountant who began his business career at Arthur Andersen in 1974 and joined the old Needham Harper agency a decade later.When Omnicom first began thinking about reorganising, Mr Wren thought that his agencies possessed about 80 per cent of the necessary capabilities for the new era.Three years on, he says that the exercise should be ""90 per cent done by the end of the second quarter"" and ""virtually complete by the end of the year"".Mr Wren refuses to comment on Omnicom's next move. But, as part of a broad strategy to beef up its leading agencies, the company is expected to shift two interactive marketing operations - Agency.com and Organic - to TBWA and BBDO respectively. The internet units will operate alongside the agencies' direct marketing arms - Tequila at TBWA and Proximity Worldwide at BBDO.The decision to enlarge his three big agencies constitutes Mr Wren's response to what has become known in the industry as ""the holding company pitch"".There is a growing trend for a small but significant number of major companies to make a direct approach to the big holding companies - Omnicom, WPP and the rest - asking them to bid on all, or a big chunk, of their marketing services work.According to some analysts, this trend poses a problem for Omnicom, which is a decentralised company that likes to let its various agencies have a creative face-to-face relationship with the client. As Mr Wren likes to say: ""We have no creative people here at Omnicom."" Indeed, the company's head office takes up only a floor-and-a-half of space.The impression that Omnicom might have a problem was reinforced when WPP, its chief competitor, last year won major holding company advertising competitions at HSBC and Samsung (Omnicom agencies only took part in the HSBC pitch).Playing the role of globe-trotting super-salesman, Sir Martin Sorrell took a central role in the two competitions, snaring a place for himself on the covers of several business magazines in the process. WPP then drew from its agencies to create special teams to do the work.As a result, questions were raised about whether Mr Wren ought to follow Sir Martin's example by taking a more active part in the big ticket deals. But Mr Wren is not about to do this. Instead, he is trying to give all three of his global advertising networks sufficient firepower to win these holding company battles.The appeal of a diversified agency was demonstrated last week when Intel awarded a global assignment to Interpublic's McCann Worldgroup, a multi-disciplinary agency that could be seen as a model for what Mr Wren is doing at Omnicom.Who will win the battle of the giants? Certainly Mr Wren's strategy can be viewed as an attempt to outflank Sir Martin's WPP. In essence, his argument is, to borrow a sports analogy, founded on the premise that all-star teams rarely outperform the squads that practice and play together.""We believe people from different disciplines do their best work when they have worked together and when they have shared clients.""And not because someone in the company decides that it looks better on a chart to organise them that way,"" Mr Wren says. For the quiet man of advertising, who says he would prefer to leave the client work to others, Mr Wren seems capable of making a pretty good marketing pitch for the world's biggest advertising company."
246;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2005-03-14T18:34:21Z;A place where the subsidiary is king;;"Omnicom was born amid fear. Saatchi & Saatchi, the London advertising agency that once counted Sir Martin Sorrell as finance director, was hunting for acquisitions, and executives up and down Madison Avenue - America's advertising capital - were feeling like potential prey.To counter this, three New York agencies - BBDO, Doyle Dane Bernbach and Needham Harper - decided to take matters into their own hands, joining together in 1986 under the antiseptic Omnicom banner.It was a holding company for advertising executives who did not want to be owned by a holding company.This heritage is reflected in the management philosophy of the company's chief executive, John Wren, 52, an accountant-turned-manager who expresses doubts about how much value a head office can bring to advertising agencies.""If you don't have the hearts and minds of the people and you aren't completely focused on the product,"" he says, ""we don't think being clever accomplishes anything in the long run.""Mr Wren sees Omnicom as having a two-fold role: providing the resources that its various agencies need to be successful and making sure the clients get what they have been promised.""Internally, I see Omnicom as a service organisation for my major groups,"" he says. ""The role of the holding company becomes that of guarantor and provider of resources.""Mr Wren has become particularly interested in promoting standards through an in-house education strategy. Omnicom University, headed by Tom Watson, first president of the company's Diversified Agency Services division, has trained 700 executives - and counting.The limits of Omnicom's ambitions are demonstrated by its size. It owns 1,500 companies and earned $723.5m last year - yet Mr Wren says that the holding company has only 150 employees.Omnicom is hardly inactive. Just this month, Michael Birkin was named as its first president and chief executive for the Asia-Pacific region.In Omnicom fashion, Mr Birkin sounds almost apologetic about his new holding company job, explaining that his role is to help Omnicom's branded agencies move more quickly to take advantage of growth opportunities in the region.""It's not signalling a change in the way Omnicom does business,"" he says. ""My job is not to build an Omnicom brand.""Omnicom has been an active acquirer, but its tendency has been to buy large numbers of smaller firms that help it to gain new skills - particularly in marketing services - or to extend its reach into new geographic areas.Doing small deals has not been without its risks. Omnicom's shares lost about half their value in 2002 amid questions about how it was accounting for acquisitions and internet investments.Its shares have reclaimed nearly all the losses, but - like the other sprawling advertising holding companies - it remains a complex organism that is difficult for outside analysts to understand.Mr Wren refuses to discuss the controversy over Omnicom's accounting, but insists that the company's approach to deals would remain the same. Despite its past, it is trying to position itself as the good cop to all the bad cops in the rough-and-tumble advertising world.As before, Omnicom uses the so-called ""Tom Watson airport test"" - named after the head of the corporate university - to vet prospective partners: ""Would you spend six hours waiting in an airport with this person?""""Our first step is to say: 'What does the management of that company want to do' and 'What are they happiest with', and if they say they are happiest to be independent and battle with you in the market place, we respect that,"" Mr Wren says.""We have never played the world domination game - where we would inflict on anyone a point of view other than what their management wanted."""
247;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2004-11-02T18:35:06Z;Publicis warns of football fatigue;;Maurice L?vy, chairman and chief executive of Publicis, said on Tuesday that advertising spending at the European football championships was ?quite disappointing? and warned that the sport ran the risk of becoming overexposed.Mr L?vy made his comments as his company, the world's fourth-biggest marketing services group, reported that a rebound in European activity helped increase its organic revenues 4.8 per cent in the third quarter. Organic revenues exclude the impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions.Organic revenues in Europe rose 3.5 per cent despite ?tepid? spending at the football tournament. ?This has been, unfortunately, quite disappointing,? he said. ?The market was expecting that the Euro [2004 championship] would drive some interesting business. In fact, we had very little business.?Mr L?vy said the early elimination of larger countries might have hindered advertising spending. But he was also worried that too much football was being televised.?There is a French expression that too much football kills the football,? he said. ?I think we may well arrive at a level of saturation. We have to be careful not to kill the golden goose. The clubs have to be careful, as do the federations.?Mr L?vy said exact figures for the European championships were not available, but his remarks will only add to the sense of malaise in football. Attendance for Premiership football in the UK is also down this year.Overall, the Publicis results were consistent with positive results released last week by the two largest marketing services companies, Omnicom of the US and WPP of the UK.Mr L?vy said he was positive about next year based on his expectations for Europe. He said he believed northern Europe would rebound next year, helping ad revenues in the continent to grow more quickly than those in the US.?Europe seems to be growing faster than expected,? he said. ?When Germany, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries are fixed, I think we should expect very strong growth and that is why I am so positive for next year.?Publicis reported revenues of ?932m ($1.2bn) in the third quarter, up from ?918m in 2003. The 4.8 per cent rise in organic revenue compared with increases of 4.4 per cent in the first quarter and 4.5 per cent in the second.Publicis said organic revenue growth in the US was 3.1 per cent last quarter.
248;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2004-11-02T07:36:13Z;Not necessarily a big deal;;Small can be effective too, but convincing a company that a low-budget campaign can have the desired results is half the battle for marketing communication agencies.Often with small-budget campaigns - defined by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising as having a total communications budget of less than £1m - the decision- maker is the person who owns the business. The message that advertising and marketing communications are an investment as well as a cost is particularly pertinent at the low- cost end of the industry.”This can mean convincing them of the need for advertising over the need to buy a yacht or a new car,” says Sam McIlveen, client services and media director at AV Browne Advertising, a Belfast-based agency and a former winner of a IPA Effectiveness Silver Award for its work on promoting Northern Ireland.One of the main levers in this negotiation is the use of research to demonstrate the effectiveness of the medium. Mark Holden, executive planning director of PHD Group, part of Omnicom, says that the measurement of a low-budget campaign must be as rigorous and insightful as that of any big-budget extravaganza.Once the decision to embark upon a campaign is made, research is still important. However, when people are spending smaller amounts of money the cost of research can seem very high. Qualitative research groups can cost up to £12,000, which may not seem that much for clients spending over £10m, but can feel like a lot for those spending £400,000. “Spend the research budget before you do anything, rather than saving it for post-campaign reassurance,” advises Francesca Brosan, chairman of ad agency Omobono.The other big task for small-budget communications is achieving the goals of a campaign with a limited range of media options. Two broad strategic routes are open. The first and most common approach is to simply pursue the most cost-effective choice of media. “This can include buying small media units and following a closely targeted media strategy,” says Holden, who puts local radio advertising or TV spots with a very low audience cost per 1,000 people into this category. Sponsored searches on the internet is one of the most accurately targeted tools agencies have at their disposal.The second option is to follow a less targeted high risk-high reward strategy aimed at getting people talking. This can include the use of sponsored events, PR and content creation. Holden cites Mates Condoms’ “ishaggedhere.com” campaign as an example of this approach, where teenagers were able to share their sexual adventures online and magazine giveaways included ishaggedhere plaques similar to those celebrating the former residences of famous people.Clients opting for this kind of approach must be willing to relinquish control over the message as the campaign spreads. “It has its own personality and its own energy,” says Holden. “It focuses on using the small media budget to create free exposure in other media.”When the appropriate channels to market do not exist, the agency has to create them. Omobono’s campaign for the East of England Development Agency was designed to persuade BT and other telecom companies to supply broadband access to the region. The aim of the campaign, which won a Silver at this year’s awards, was to get enough registrants within the broadband “blackspot” to convince the telecos to supply broadband.The activity directed users to an online brokerage, effectively creating a viral home for broadband malcontents. Actual registration surpassed targets set by the development agency by 800 per cent, and regional access to broadband increased from 53 per cent to 98 per cent. BT changed its policy and is now in the process of providing broadband-enabled telephone exchanges throughout the region.The key to this success lay in using parish council data as the basis for mailing lists, and by turning the audience into a lobbying group for the cause. Such ingenuity also requires particular management skills from the client: “It’s tough on clients who have to manage such a disparate campaign,” says Brosan, chairman of Omobono. “Working with an audience that is hard to reach has always been part of the job.”Good ideas can provide a special boost for small-budget campaigns. TBWA\London’s “Know what you’re getting into?” campaign, winner of a Silver and this year’s Best Small Budget award, is a case in point. The marketing push, created as part of Transport for London’s Safer Travel at Night initiative, is credited with preventing minicab-related rapes and sexual assaults in London over the period of the scheme.Suzy Shaw, new business director of TBWA\London, says that the strength of the idea and the importance of the issue enabled her to attract top creative talent into the project. “We got a big discount on the TV ad director’s time, who happened to be Mike Leigh [the film director], but not on the media time,” she says.However, the case for advertising on any size of budget comes down to a good idea. “A bad idea brilliantly executed is still a bad idea,” says Julie Anne Bailie, executive director of Lyle Bailie International, formerly McCann Erickson Belfast. “There is never just one creative solution to any problem. It is the breadth of the vision that is important, not the size of the budget.”richard@gillisonline.co.ukESSENTIALS- If research cash is tight, focus on pre-campaign work- Concentrate on low-cost channels or be ready to create your own- Be relaxed about controlling messages
249;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2004-10-26T13:09:29Z;WPP sees benefits of sustained recovery;;WPP, the advertising and marketing group, has revealed its strongest quarterly growth in revenues since the start of 2001 as this year's advertising recovery gathered momentum.The UK-based group, which last month bolstered its advertising business with the $1.5bn acquisition of Grey Global of the US, revealed that like-for-like revenues grew by 5.7 per cent in the three months to September 30. This compared with 3 per cent growth in the second quarter and 1.8 per cent in the first three months of the year.“The rate of acceleration in the recovery is the real excitement and this is what happens on recovery: it gathers pace,” said LornaTilbian, an analyst at Numis Securities.WPP said that the strongest preformances during the quarter came from Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, with revenues up 22 per cent. North America achieved its eighth consecutive quarter of growth, with revenues up by 10 per cent. In the UK revenues grew by 2 per cent and by nearly 7 per cent in continental Europe.The year has been helped by Euro 2004, the Olympics and the US presidential elections.However, the group sounded a cautious note about next year: “The jury remains out on 2005. There are still concerns about the prospects for the US economy after the presidential election, with its fiscal deficit, weak dollar and rising commodity prices, including oil, although the weakness in some of the major markets in Western Europe is ameliorating.”The group added: “If industry growth rates this year are 3-4 per cent, next year will probably be at 2-3 per cent, a slight reduction.”Nevertheless, analysts remained encouraged by suggestions that any slowdown in the US might be tempered by continued growth elsewhere.“We think that when business turns on the tap it doesn't turn it on for one year,” said Ms Tilbian. “It takes more than one year to get new products on stream.”Shares in WPP gained 16p to 539½p.Kingsley Wilson at Investec Securities said the only blip in the results appeared to be the low net new business billings figure of £234m for the quarter.This made a total of £1.77bn ($3.24bn) for the first nine months but compared with £402m reported for the third quarter of last year. “However, new business is notoriously lumpy and WPP notes that it has already won over £830m of new business with a further £1.6bn pending client decisions.”WPP said: “New business and activity and the conversion rate is running at an unprecedented level, suggesting market share gains.”
250;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2004-10-06T11:18:07Z;Havas falls as Intel reviews ad business;;Shares in Havas, the French advertising group, fell sharply on Wednesday after Intel, its third biggest customer, said it was reviewing its account.The stock dropped more than 4 per cent to €4.17 in morning trade as investors feared it may lose business from the world’s leading semiconductor maker, estimated at $300m or about 3 per cent of Havas’ revenues.Earlier, Intel revealed it was reviewing its global advertising account with Havas’ Euro RSCG unit and putting it up for tender. The review follows the accession of a new head of marketing at the chipmaker, Eric Kim.It was the latest blow for Havas, the world’s sixth largest advertising group, which is regrouping after its failure to buy rival Grey Global, a move that would have placed it among the top tier of the marketing world, rubbing shoulders with Interpublic, Omnicom and winner of the Grey Global auction, WPP.Havas, which came up with Intel’s current jingle, sought to allay investor worries, saying a it had not lost the account but would now strengthen its team to win the business competitively.The loss of the account adds to mounting speculation about Havas’ future. Following the Grey Global debacle, the company is now viewed as a possible takeover target itself, with UK-based WPP and French rival Publicis in the frame as potential bidders.Meanwhile, investors are also trying to determine the intentions of Vincent Bolloré, the French corporate raider and one of Havas’ biggest shareholders, who has built up his stake to above 16 per cent in recent weeks.
251;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2004-09-30T17:11:56Z;Setback as WPP target loses client;;Grey Global of the US has lost a leading advertising client Mars, the food and confectionery maker only days after agreeing to a takeover by WPP.The announcement represented a setback for WPP but it did not appear to be unexpected either to the marketing services company or to its investors.According to people familiar with the auction of Grey, the possibility of a Mars defection was known by WPP before it unveiled its $1.5bn (?890m) cash-and-share offer on September13.Investors on Thursday also shrugged off the news of the advertising loss, sending shares in WPP, the world's second-biggest marketing services company, rising by 2?p to 514?p.Late on Thursday, Mars said that it was consolidating all of its global advertising work with the BBDO and TBWA units of Omnicom, the world's biggest marketing services group.Mars said it would retain Grey for ?below-the-line? activities such as interactive advertising, direct marketing and sales promotions.Such services which include the online marketing of M&Ms are potentially quite lucrative.The loss of the advertising business, however, raises questions about the state of Grey's relations with itsclients in the period before Ed Meyer, 77, its chairman, chief executive and controlling shareholder, decided to sell the company.In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this year, Mr Meyer acknowledged that his company needed to improve its creative reputation, saying it was ?first class in every way else not first class (increativity)?.After reaching the agreement to sell to WPP, Mr Meyer said he had discussed the possibility of a sale with his clients and found them agreeable.He told investment analysts: ?It's fair to say I did not find any client who had any large concern.?Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, was understood to have conducted extensive due diligence on Grey, which included meetings with a number of top clients and senior executives.WPP has said it expected the deal to buy Grey to be completed towards the end of this year.
252;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2004-09-13T20:32:00Z;Tech shares start week with a rally;;"Technology shares outpaced the broader market on Wall Street on Monday at the onset of a week with a busy economic calendar.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 10,314.69. The S&P 500 index added 0.2 per cent to 1,125.91 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index put on 0.9 per cent to 1,910.38.Some market observers have said that a far from clear picture of the US economy, combined with the imminence of the November presidential elections and stubbornly high energy prices, are keeping investors on the sidelines.On Monday, only 1.3bn shares exchanged hands at the New York Stock Exchange.This week brings a bevy of economic data on retail sales and consumer confidence, as well as consumer-price inflation and industrial production. But their impact on trading could be limited by the impression many market participants have that the recent data could be distorted by the hurricanes affecting the south-eastern US. In addition, the end of the week brings quadruple-witching, or the simultaneous expiry of options and futures for indices and stocks. The accentuated volatility normally caused by quadruple witching could be compounded by the observance of the Jewish new year on Thursday and Friday, which could keep many Wall Street employees at home. In all, the stage appeared set for more inconclusive trading, with some analysts pointing out that a decrease in oil prices or another similar event could breathe new life into a short-term rally lacking in both volume and pace.Tobias Levkovich's team at the Smith Barney unit of Citigroup wrote on Monday: ""We continue to be tactically cautious as we think earnings concerns could interrupt the widely anticipated fourth-quarter rally.""A high-profile acquisition in advertising dominated the morning's action. The shares of Grey Global added 4 per cent to $977.90 after the advertising agency agreed to be taken over by the UK's WPP for about $1.5bn in cash and shares. The transaction is aimed at putting WPP on a par with Omnicom, the global leader. The latter's shares were 0.4 per cent higher at $69.19.In other M&A news the shares of Metro-Goldwyn Mayer rose 4 per cent to $11.55 after reports that Japan's Sony raised its offer to buy the entertainment group to $5bn and was close to taking control of the company, as Time-Warner pulled out of the contest to buy MGM. Sony's NYSE-listed shares were up 1.5 per cent at $35.82. Time-Warner eased 0.4 per cent to $16.45.Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks rallied once again. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 2.5 per cent, paced by a 9.4 per cent rise in Broadcom shares to $30.30. The company, which makes broadband semiconductors, said rising inventories would weigh on its sales but the market focused on its stronger products.Amid the broader chip rally National Semiconductor added 4.4 per cent to $14.86 while Advanced Micro Devices was 5.7 per cent higher at $12.90.Away from technology investors reacted vehemently to US Airways' second bankruptcy filing in as many years, sending its shares in a 30.1 per cent tailspin to $1.02. The airline failed to secure backing for its restructuring plans from unions. The damage appeared contained as the Amex airline sector index was flat, with Delta Air Lines shares gaining 8.1 per cent to $4.13 as it met bankruptcy lawyers in case it might also have to file.Shares in CKE Restaurants gave up 9.6 per cent to $11.19 after the operator of Carl's Jr and Hardee's fast-food restaurants reported a loss for the quarter due to one-time charges.Energy-related stocks saw a moderate reaction to reports that Hurricane Ivan could hit the Gulf of Mexico this week, prompting a shutdown of offshore drilling facilities there. Shell, which is evacuating non-essential staff from platforms, saw its NYSE-listed shares inch up 0.1 per cent to $51.75."
253;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2004-09-13T18:47:46Z;Failed bid puts Havas on the radar screens;;Havas has turned from predator to prey. The French advertising group lost a bid battle for US rival Grey Global at the weekend, prompting investors to question its strategy and speculate that it looks vulnerable to bids from larger rivals.Shares in Havas rose 10 per cent to ?4.28 on Monday after the Paris-based group announced it had pulled out of the auction for Grey. It was outbid by WPP, its larger UK rival, which clinched the deal with a $1.5bn offer.Havas's shares rose on relief that its risky bid, launched against the advice of its biggest shareholder and closest bankers, had failed. The rally was underpinned by expectations that Havas would be the next victim of consolidation in the sector.Alain de Pouzilhac, Havas chairman and chief executive, was under pressure before the Grey bid. The company slid to a net loss of ?396m ($485m) last year, obliging him to launch his third restructuring in as many years in September.Mr de Pouzilhac believed that Grey, the world's seventh largest advertising group, was the last opportunity for Havas, the sixth largest, to gain the critical size needed to compete against the top tier of ad groups WPP, Publicis of France, Interpublic Group and Omnicom of the US. He is expected to face calls to step down when Havas reports first-half results on Thursday.On Monday he said: ?We concluded that the price required by Grey would not allow us to generate sufficient added value for our shareholders. As a result, we did not increase our offer, so as to remain totally focused on the objectives I set our teams over a year ago: to relaunch our group to rapidly reach the same growth and operating margin levels as the market leaders.?Mr de Pouzilhac launched the bid over the objections of Vincent Bollore, the French corporate raider who acquired 5-10 per cent of Havas's stock this summer. A person close to Mr Bollore said he believed the offer was reckless and was ?satisfied it did not succeed?.Havas's offer was also made without the support of Societe Generale, its bank of reference, which has a seat on its board and voted against the bid. SocGen refused to provide financing, forcing Havas to turn to Deutsche Bank and Calyon.WPP and Publicis are seen as likely bidders for Havas, and Mr Bollore could seek to encourage a bidding war to sell out at a big profit. Mr Bollore's advisers denied Mr de Pouzilhac was ?the problem? but said Havas ?needs to return to profitability, whether under this management or another?.Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, remarked to analysts on Monday: ?I would not want to upset Vincent Bollore.?
254;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2004-08-11T17:45:55Z;Way out of advertising ghetto;;Spike Lee likes television commercials. The director of such caustic commentaries on US society as Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X is an ad man himself – the chief executive and majority shareholder of Spike DDB, an advertising agency unit of Omnicom, the world's largest marketing services company.But even Mr Lee has his limits. He cringed when Nike, the sportswear maker, ran television ads this year that featured LeBron James, the US teenage basketball sensation, displaying his ball-handling skills in an African-American church packed with a swaying congregation of basketballluminaries.“That LeBron James ad where he comes in the church where negroes are flying through the air doing somersaults [and] tomahawk dunks – to me that was sacrilegious,” observes Mr Lee, speaking at his company's headquarters in Madison Avenue. “I defy anyone to tell me that they will see a commercial that will take place in a synagogue selling any kind of products, or a Catholic church. That was a complete mockery of African-American faith and the black church.”Mr Lee's observations are particularly noteworthy because, as he puts it, “I'm a Nike person.” He directed and acted in a series of groundbreaking ads with Michael Jordan, the basketball star, that helped establish Nike's Air Jordan trainers as the epitome of street fashion in the 1980s. He is also a fan of Mr James, since his ad agency cast him in one of its advertisements. But Mr Lee is a social critic, too, and his reaction to the Nike church ad provides a glimpse into the sensitivities involved in the growing business of US ethnic marketing. Advertisers have been focusing on African-Americans, Hispanics and other US minority groups because of new data demonstrating their buying power.African-Americans in the US, if considered as a separate country, would rank 11th by gross national product, according to UniWorld, an ad agency associate of WPP, the UK marketing services company. More than a quarter of African-Americans earn more than $50,000 a year.At the same time, advertisers have seen an opportunity to reach a new group of consumers that they call “urban” – people of various races who respond to trends emanating from cities. This audience would include everyone from urban professionals accustomed to living in interracial areas to the legions of white suburbanites who have become devotees of rap music – a group so large that it has invited parody in the form of Ali G, the comic creation of the UK's Sacha Baron Cohen now known to television audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Dana Wade, Spike DDB president, estimates that about three-quarters of its business is “urban”, with the rest focused on African-American consumers.Mr Lee says he formed his agency – which employs about 45 people – in the late 1990s because he grew frustrated directing other people's ideas. He owns a 51 per cent stake, with the rest held by DDB Worldwide, one of Omnicom's ad agency networks. But even with majority control, Mr Lee still faces obstacles in the form of corporate notions of African-Americans.Spike DDB's recent work includes a Pepsi-Cola ad that was based on the opera Carmen - with the singer Beyoncé Knowles in the starring role. But Mr Lee and Ms Wade say many potential clients still want to portray African-Americans – particularly young men - in less flattering ways.Ms Wade says: “There is a certain kind of imagery using young African-American men that Americans at large are willing to accept – and that's gangster, over-the-top imagery.” Mr Lee adds: “I hear from a lot of my actor friends that when they go on an audition, they [white directors] go: ‘Can you be a little blacker? Can you be a little more street?'”The result is that, as Mr Lee and Ms Wade see it, African-Americans still exist in an advertising ghetto. Companies selling cars and clothes, or food and drink, or financial services such as insurance, clearly care about minority audiences. But marketers of luxury goods steer clear.“The more luxury-oriented the brand becomes, the more afraid the marketing organisation is,” Ms Wade says. “We are missing in the luxury areas completely. They want to believe that allAfrican-Americans are poor and that we are all uneducated. Thank God for the census, in some way, because people discovered that there was not only a middle class, but an upper middle class in the African-American community.”Mr Lee says the popularity of African-American culture suggests that African-Americans have a greater appeal than many advertisers assume. In this sense, he leaves the impression that he would like his advertising agency to take on a more universal tone.“We [African-Americans] are the ones generating everything as far as fashion, music, language, whatever, goes – but then we are not thought of as being universal and appealing to everybody. If we didn't appeal to everybody, why wouldAfrican-American culture be siphoned off or appropriated?” he says. “What makes us distinct at Spike DDB is that we think we can market to anybody. We have never, ever, ever, had the mindset as African-Americans that what we do and who we are and what we project is limited and not universal.”But for all his universalist ambitions, Mr Lee remains a defender of the faith in a sense – an African-American keen to protect his culture against those who would exploit it or reduce it to minstrelsy. This is hardly a new threat in US society, but Mr Lee remains a keen preservationist.“African-American culture has always been appropriated. Look at Aunt Jemima. Look at Uncle Ben,” Mr Lee says. “One of the – you might say – hustles is how to be black without being black. A lot of people who mastered that made a whole lot of money. You go down the line: Elvis, Eminem, the Beatles when they started out, the Rolling Stones, AlJolson.”Ms Wade says in some cases the agency has broken off relations with clients that stepped over the line into exploitation. She declines to name the companies, explaining that Spike DDB wants to handle such situations “politely”.“When you know you are getting robbed and you know what they want to do is co-opt African-American culture and turn it into something that they believe is African-American culture, you have to move on,” she says. “The good guys are coming because they want to understand the consumer and they don't want to make mistakes. When they come here, with Spike as our leader, they come with an understanding, for the most part, that whatever we do will be respectful of the consumer. There is stuff we are just not going to do.”Mr Lee waited until the end of the interview to mention that he has a film coming out - She Hate Me - and only then to link its theme to his Spike DDB work. Even in advertising, Mr Lee says his ambition is to teach people how to do the right thing.“A lot of what Dana and I have to do is educate our clients, who just don't know. They have a monolithic view of African-Americans: that we all look alike, talk alike, come from the same social and economic background.“If there's racism in the world, in America, it's going to be in the educational system, it's going to be inmovies, it's going to be in advertising.”
255;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2004-08-02T16:55:56Z;Designers’ creative flair fails to draw the money men;;"Design agencies have missed the investment boat - or so it is easy to believe. During the 1990s and into 2000, any agency with any credibility was courted and often snapped up by a marketing communications holding group. Hence Newell and Sorrell (think BA tail fins) went to Omnicom; Davies Baron - the agency behind Air New Zealand’s corporate identity - to Interpublic; Fitch, the group best known for its WH Smith makeover, was bought by Lighthouse, itself part of Cordiant; Lambie-Nairn, the company closely associated with the BBC’s graphics, became part of WPP, and so it went on.These conglomerates were aiming to create multi-disciplinary design offices worldwide on the back of the strong brand of an acquired agency, and therefore offer their bigger clients a complete range of services from design and branding to advertising, direct marketing and PR.Since then, however, mutual disillusionment has set in. The design agencies probably expected more glamour and certainly more referrals from their network. The holding groups did not foresee how badly a downturn would affect the design and branding parts of their businesses, as clients cut back spending. With few major corporate identity projects coming in these days, the likes of Interbrand and FutureBrand are mere shadows of their former selves. A depressed market is, however, always a good place for canny investors to go fishing.”The market for investing is coming back,” says Amanda Merron, partner at accountants Willott Kingston Smith, which specialises in the design, media and marketing industries. “Now’s quite a good time to invest because prices are still a bit depressed.”But where are the target businesses? Design is still largely a cottage industry, with many studios less than a dozen-strong. Only seven of the private independent groups listed in Design Week magazine’s Top 100 league table this April have a UK fee income of more than £5m.Independent businesses of any size are also few and far between. Names that spring to mind are Checkland Kindleysides, Design Bridge, Jones Knowles Ritchie and Corporate Edge.Size is a problem when it comes to attracting bigger professional investment, as the latter tend to shy away from deals which are too small to be worth their time and involvement.Rose Lewis, partner at business accelerator Pembridge, says that up to five years ago the listed venture capital group 3i was making investments of just £250,000, but that’s no longer seen as cost-effective. Private equity, with its offers of £1m or £2m, has not been a significant a player in this field. High street banks, meanwhile, are in the main happy to lend, but not invest.This leaves independent angels with a track record in the creative industries, who put in £100,000 to £500,000. “But this leaves a funding gap,” says Jim Surguy, managing director of Results Business Consulting, a business adviser to the marketing communications industry. “So you have to find three or four individuals if you want something in between.” Angel investors in the sector have included the likes of Luke Johnson, chairman of Channel 4.So assuming the lack of targets and big-money investors can be overcome, what are the other obstacles designers need to tackle?Several issues leap out. First, there is the view that the sector is high-risk, as design agencies tend to rely on a small pool of clients to work for and a small cluster of in-house talent to do the work.Many industries attract similar reservations, but according to James Stewart, partner at private equity group ECI, it may be more relevant to design than other sectors because of the strong links often forged between an agency and its current or past owner-manager - such as Wally Olins and his former outfit, Wolff Olins, whose high-profile clients include Orange and First Direct.Second, long-held industry practices tend to militate against the idea that design can be a diversified and secure business, rather than one prone to the vicissitudes of economic booms and downturns. To offset their anxieties, says Stewart, investors want to see a spread of clients in size, and across different countries, “so [agencies] are less reliant on two or three accounts and can counter cyclicality in an advertising downturn in any one region”.With ECI specialising in deals between £5m and £100m, it is unsurprising that Stewart has looked at design agencies but has not struck any deals.Bill Greaves, head of media at Barclays, is even more specific. When it comes to lending, he’s after “a spread of good clients, with no reliance on any specific client greater than 60 per cent”.”Client lock-in is important, but difficult to achieve if your offer is purely creative, because clients like change,” says David Sherratt, director of private equity firm ISIS Capital.Ideally, whatever the client mix, the design business plan should show a forward order book stretching a year ahead. Again, this is a rarity in many parts of the industry, and some are sceptical about how realistic an aim this is.”Design is a short-term business, so they can rarely see more than two months ahead,” says Ian Cochrane, a management consultant to the design industry, who says business should have five years of profits to show investors.Nick Horswell, who sold his business, PHD, to Abbott Mead Vickers in 1995, says: “I am deeply sceptical about the numbers because they simply don’t know where the future revenue is coming from. Experienced investors will take business plans with a handful of salt.”Then there is the executive team to consider. Typically, a design agency is started by a couple of designers who have broken away from a bigger operation. It is unusual for them to have any formal training in business management or strategy.”They [the agency team seeking investment] reassure about creative talent and not the business talent. They need somebody on the team that ticks that box,” says Horswell who set up Uncle as an angel business after his earn-out, following the AMV deal. He has also invested seed capital in design consultancy Spirit of Creation.”Designers are not skilled in selling themselves to investors. They should appoint someone such as their accountant, bank manager or lawyer,” says Cochrane.These rules are real enough, but sometimes they were made to be broken. When Jonathan Sands was just 28, he led a management buy-out of Leeds design agency Elmwood with £250,000 of backing from 3i in the late 1980s.At the time, Elmwood had a turnover of £1m, was heavily reliant on one client and had a young and inexperienced management team. The consultancy also had an overdraft of £250,000 and net assets of just £900. “3i was very brave to invest in us,” says Sands, now chairman of Elmwood.The business paid back 3i in five years and now has net assets of £1.5m. So whatever the risks and hurdles, investors do back design agencies, and make money doing so.claredowdy@htomail.comNext week: Investing in computer games developersTHE ESSENTIALS- Do not be reliant on one key person who holds the key client relationships.- Clients of all sizes and nationalities give confidence in the event of a downturn.- The business plan should show a forward order book, with long-term, retainer-style client relationships.- A credible sponsor with a solid business background is a must for talking to potential investors.FINAL THOUGHT’Design is very much a people-led industry. We would look at: the strength of the management team, the track record of the business and the directors, the strength of the business in terms of the balance sheet and profitability, and the spread of good clients, with no reliance on any specific client greater than 60 per cent.’Bill Greaves, Barclays head of media"
256;OMC;Omnicom Group Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
