The City was much amused four years ago when news broke of the sinking off the coast of Dorset of the £250,000 new yacht of Paul Compton of Collins Stewart. Mr Compton had gone below to check the boat’s position on his satellite navigation system, leaving his companion at the helm. Both were rescued after the yacht hit rocks and quickly foundered.By coincidence Mr Compton was head of smaller companies sales at Collins Stewart when the firm brought Raymarine, a supplier of marine electronics to the leisure boating market, to the full list in December 2004.Last week Raymarine, which had been negotiating tricky shoal waters for months after running up too much debt, was put into administration and sold in a few hours.The credit crunch had proved too much for the company, which last November warned shareholders that they were likely to lose all their money. It was a sorry pass for both the company and its investors.Anyone with the remotest interest in taking to the water would see the brand name festooned over both motor and sailing craft in every marina and at every boat show.However, as the year wore on, news of potential bidders emerged, although only Garmin, a competitor based in the US, was identified. But any deal with Garmin would have been subject to antitrust clearance, and that could have delayed a final decision for many months.In March the company’s banking syndicate extended facilities on its debt of more than £90m ($129m) to September. But the company was operating under short-term waivers, the last of which expired at midnight on Thursday.Last Friday’s quick succession of events began with Raymarine’s announcement at 9.39am that one of its bidders was pulling out. However, the bidder had told the banking syndicate that if the company went into administration, it would be willing to conclude a deal.At 11.35am Garmin also said it was prepared to talk to the administrators, and it made a further announcement at 3.53pm saying it was prepared to make an offer “likely to equate” to 35p a share, but conditional on antitrust approvals.At 4.05pm the Financial Services Authority suspended the shares. The banks, facing months more of uncertainty, sent in the administrators at 5.30pm, and by 6.06pm the company had been sold.The buyer is Flir Systems, a $4bn Nasdaq-quoted company that specialises in thermal imaging and infrared equipment. Earl Lewis, chairman and a leisure boater, says the company has started to supply infrared equipment to the boating market.“Raymarine is in a wonderful position, selling equipment to 400 [original equipment manufacturers] and to 1,000 boat dealers,” he says. “In our opinion, it’s the number one supplier and brand.”But he was prepared to walk away after months of negotiations because the sale process had proved so complex. “I believed if it continued to drag on any longer, the company would have started to lose market share and employees.”It looks as though the board found itself in an almost impossible position trying to balance the bidders and the banks. The administrators took the price Flir was willing to pay up to $180m, worth about 20p a share after clearing the debt and well above Garmin’s offer last month, worth 7.2p a share.Some shareholders still believe that the company has been sold too cheaply. But they are getting much more than they can have hoped for six months ago.The last day of trading was chaotic and the shares should have been suspended more quickly. But no one has emerged covered in glory from this saga, which was bedevilled by secrecy. The best that can be said is that a full-scale shipwreck was narrowly avoided, and that as much as was reasonably possible has been salvaged.Slow burnSprue Aegis, which this week took the Plus Company of the Year award, floated in June 2001 at 34p a share after developing an innovative domestic fire alarm. The prospectus looked forward to sales of £8.3m and pre-tax profits of £1.8m in 2002.Last month the company, which now offers a diverse range of safety devices, reported a 53 per cent rise in sales to £14.4m for 2009, and pre-tax profits of £1.9m. It paid a 0.5p maiden final dividend.In nine years the market capitalisation has edged up from £10m to £12.3m. It’s an example of the dogged persistence needed for a company to grow. Even so, it should resist any suggestion of moving to Aim – it’s still far too small.david.blackwell@ft.com
