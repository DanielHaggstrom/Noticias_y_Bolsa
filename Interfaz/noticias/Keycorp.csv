This beat Wall Street forecasts for 65 cents a share on revenue of $14.5bn.The company’s fourth quarter sales guidance of $14.5bn-$15.2bn beat expectations for $14.5bn. The company also repurchased $4.2bn of stock in the quarter.Analysts at Morgan Stanley think this is “as good as it gets” for Intel. They downgraded the stock to “underweight” while maintaining their $30 price target.“From here we see unit growth decelerating, with continued declines in average selling prices, pressure in gross margins as construction in progress gets drawn down, and continued limited progress in building profitable foundry and tablet businesses,” said Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.The chipmaking industry was recently given a jolt after Microchip warned that the industry as a whole was on the verge of a correction.Intel shares slipped 3 per cent to $31.27.KeyCorp led the S&P 500 lower after the Ohio-based lender missed third-quarter earnings expectations.The company reported net income of $197m or 23 cents a share, compared with $229m or 25 cents a share in the year ago period. Revenue of $998m was down from $1.04bn the previous year.Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings of 25 cents a share on revenue of $1.03bn.Shares of KeyCorp slipped 6 per cent to $12.16.UK based CSR jumped 31 per cent to $54.74 in New York after Qualcomm agreed to buy the chipmaker for $2.5bn in cash.Shares of Qualcomm were flat, following losses earlier in the trading session, as analysts believe this is a good move for the California-based company.“In general, this seems like a wise diversification away from handsets and into various ‘Internet of Things’ end markets, which will drive wireless connectivity growth for the next decade or more as smartphones, tablets, and PCs mature.”Shares of Time Warner advanced 2 per cent to $72.21 after HBO, the channel that brings much-watched shows such as Game of Thrones and such original programming as True Detective, said it would launch a standalone online streaming service.Statoil shares slipped 2 per cent to $23.42 after chief executive Helge Lund unexpectedly stepped down to take the helm at BG Group, another oil and gas company next year.Statoil appointed the head of the marketing, processing and renewable energy division, Eldar Saetre, as acting CEO.US stocks followed global markets lower on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.8 per cent to 1,862.49, wiping out its gains for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.1 per cent to 16,141.74 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 4,215.32.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
1;KEY;Keycorp;2013-05-13T22:35:58Z;KeyCorp: cut and pay;Regional US bank is gaining investors’ confidence by sticking to the plan;"Historically low – and seemingly permanently low – interest rates and sluggish loan growth makes it hard for US banks to increase revenues. That leaves cost cutting and capital returns to offer investors. KeyCorp, based in Ohio, is sticking to that plan, and gaining investors’ confidence. The shares have returned 24 per cent in 2012, beating the S&P 500 and fellow regionals, such as Fifth Third Bank and SunTrust. KeyCorp boasts a market value of $9.5bn.Like many other regional banks, KeyCorp ran into big trouble during the financial crisis and ensuing recession. The years since have been spent recapitalising, cleaning up the loan portfolio – positioning it to cut overheads and send cash to investors. KeyCorp’s efficiency ratio – operating expenses divided by revenues – fell 170 basis points to 66 per cent in the first quarter versus a year ago. Its goal is to be between 60 and 65 per cent. (A ratio between 55 and 57 per cent is considered good; larger rival US Bancorp at 51 per cent is considered excellent.) KeyCorp also received regulatory approval to buy back $426m in shares and boost its dividend by a 10th. It hopes to use the proceeds from the sale of Victory Capital Management, its investment management unit, for additional share repurchases.What can keep the recovery story going? A green shoot or two from the economy would help. The bank’s portfolio is almost half loans to businesses. Hopes for a quickening recovery this year have been mostly dashed, however. Expectations for higher dividends and buybacks may be in the shares already. They trade slightly above tangible book value. It looks like more cost cutting is in order. An efficiency ratio in the low to mid-60s is an improvement, but not sufficient. Once KeyCorp reaches its goal, it will need to aim lower to keep boosting the share price.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
2;KEY;Keycorp;2013-03-07T22:05:20Z;US equities boosted by jobless data;;US stocks were bolstered on Thursday by better-than-expected labour market data that showed a decline in the number of Americans claiming first-time jobless benefits.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,544.26 in New York, reaching its highest level in more than five years. Investors were encouraged by the latest weekly jobless claims data, which analysts had projected to rise but claims unexpectedly fell by 7,000 to 340,000.The data, along with Wednesday’s private-sector jobs figures, have boosted sentiment on Wall Street ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls report.The benchmark, which is up 8.3 per cent since the start of the year, has been marching closer to its all-time record high of 1,565 in recent sessions.Financial sector stocks were the best performing, rising 0.7 per cent as investors favoured industry groups tied to the economy. Among financials, the gains were led by shares in regional banks including Key Corp, up 2.7 per cent to $9.92, and BB&T Corp, up 1.5 per cent to $31.12.Meanwhile, shares in Bank of America gained 2.9 per cent to $12.26.The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.3 per cent to 3,232.09. Shares in Apple, the technology group with the heaviest weighting in the tech-focused index, gained 1.2 per cent to $430.26 as investors weighed market rumours that the company had slashed iPad shipments amid a slowdown in demand.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher to 14,329.49.Shares in Time Warner were 2.4 per cent higher to $56.78 after the media and entertainment company said it would spin off its magazine unit. Time Inc, the publisher of many magazine titles, is expected to become a public company by the end of 2013, the company said late on Wednesday.“Similar to News Corp’s decision to split, Time Warner hopes to unlock value by separating the structurally challenged print business and focusing on the higher growth media assets,” said Michael Senno, analyst at Credit Suisse.Meanwhile, analysts at JPMorgan said the magazine unit would continue to face challenges over the next few quarters as advertising revenue is expected to decline while subscription sales have flat-lined.Dell lost 0.7 per cent to $14.22 as the computer maker confirmed reports from Wednesday that activist investor Carl Icahn had taken a stake in the company . Dell shares are trading about 4 per cent above the take-private price of $13.65 that it accepted last month from founder Michael Dell and private equity group Silver Lake Partners.Facebook rose 4.1 per cent to $28.58 as the social networking company unveiled a redesign of its popular website to increase engagement with users.February sales figures from some of the largest US retailers left shares in many of those companies unchanged. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index was flat on the day and underperformed the broader benchmark even as companies said same store sales grew at 1.8 per cent and above market estimates, according to Thomson Reuters.Oliver Chen, retail analyst at Citigroup, said the monthly figures were better than feared given the poor weather conditions and delayed tax returns faced by many Americans last month.The clothing retailer Gap advanced 4.1 per cent to $35.87 after the premature release of its monthly sales data forced the company to halt its shares for about 30 minutes in the morning. Meanwhile shares in Ross Stores, a discount clothing retailer, dropped 7.5 per cent to $55.23 after missing sales forecasts for last month.Artisan Partners Asset Management, which raised $333m after pricing its initial public offering at $30 a share on Wednesday, jumped 29.4 per cent to $38.83.Pandora Media, the online radio company, were set to open higher on Friday after climbing 19.2 per cent to $13.97 in after-hours trading. The company, which closed 0.5 per cent higher to $11.73 during market hours, reported that a jump in advertising sales helped boost revenues in its latest quarter.
3;KEY;Keycorp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Cost-cutting US lenders beat forecasts;;Three of the leading US regional lenders reported third­-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ expectations as lower expenses and fewer loan delinquencies overcame decreased revenues to fuel higher profits.KeyCorp reported a 19 per cent year-on-year jump in net earnings to $212m. Fifth Third said its income more than doubled to $373m from last year’s $175m. BB&T said its net income rose 69 per cent to $371m, its best showing in three years.Separately, after the close of trading, Capital One, a leading credit-card lender that also owns retail banking operations, reported a 1.2 per cent year-on-year increase in profits to $813m, reflecting increased lending and lower funding costs.KeyCorp slashed its non-interest costs by 6 per cent to $692m compared with last year, while Fifth Third cut expenses by 3 per cent to $946m. BB&T reported slightly higher expenses, prompting Kelly King, chief executive, to announce a cost-cutting initiative during Thursday’s conference call with analysts. Mr King declined to provide a target but said it would be “substantial”.Regional banks are facing increasing pressure to cut expenses as a sluggish US economy depresses loan demand and rising compliance costs hit earnings. The restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal said this week that large US regional banks would need to reduce expenses by up to 40 per cent to cope with the worsening banking environmentFifth Third’s share price jumped 9.1 per cent to $11.63 and KeyCorp shares rose 6.9 per cent to $6.81, making them the top two performers in the KBW Bank Index. BB&T shares rose 1 per cent to $22.53.All three lenders reported fewer borrowers were falling behind in their payments. Severely delinquent loans at KeyCorp fell by nearly half from last year. BB&T said its bad-loan charge-offs were the lowest since 2007 and told analysts it expected delinquencies to continue to decrease in coming quarters.The lenders all reported lower revenues, as high unemployment in the US and deleveraging by consumers sapped loan demand.But one bright spot was the rise in commercial lending. BB&T said its loans to commercial and industrial customers rose nearly 7 per cent year on year to about $35bn. KeyCorp’s lending to commercial, financial and agricultural clients increased more than 8 per cent to about $18bn. Customers were also making use of a greater share of their credit lines, it said.Fifth Third said its business loans rose a more modest 1.7 per cent.The rise in commercial lending comes as many of the regionals’ rivals ramp up their loans to businesses, a sign clients may be getting more optimistic about the economy.
4;KEY;Keycorp;2011-07-31T22:35:56Z;HSBC will sell 195 US branches;;HSBC has agreed to sell 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, the Buffalo-based bank, for $1bn in cash.The deal, announced late on Sunday, is one of the first concrete signs of the strategy outlined by Stuart Gulliver, the new chief executive, which includes a plan to rationalise branches, and comes ahead of HSBC’s second-quarter results on Monday where the bank is expected to announce 10,000 job cuts.The sale price is 6.67 per cent of the $15bn of deposits that will be transferred when the deal closes next year. It is subject to approval by US regulators.HSBC announced a strategic overhaul in May, which involved putting part of its US branch network and its credit card business up for sale.The divestitures are part of a pruning of the bank’s global ambition, in which it is seeking to scale back in markets that are sub-scale or producing inadequate returns.The bank, which operates in 87 countries, also said it would close 13 branches in Connecticut and New Jersey. It is expected to hold on to its 116-strong branch network in the five boroughs of New York City.“HSBC is committed to the US and leveraging our international network and skill set, which are our competitive advantages,” said Niall Booker, chief executive of HSBC North America.The deal would mark another large expansion for First Niagara, which last year merged with Connecticut-based NewAlliance Bancshares in a $1.5bn deal.John Koelmel, chief executive of First Niagara, said the acquisition would require his bank to raise capital to support the larger balance sheet.“Obviously, the financial markets are in a bit of disarray,” he said, and the capital raising might not take place immediately.He said the deal would be used as a platform to “build out our footprint in Pennsylvania and New England” and was confident that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the relevant bank regulator, would approve the transaction.With larger peers, including Buffalo-based M&T Bank and Cleveland-based KeyCorp, also interested in HSBC’s New York branches, First Niagara was considered by some to be a long-shot in the auction.All buyers would have been likely to face some antitrust concerns, as the Buffalo market is reasonably concentrated.According to 2010 data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, HSBC’s bank had a 38 per cent share of the metropolitan market, M&T was second with 30 per cent, while First Niagara had about 11 per cent.Bank deals can usually negotiate antitrust clearance from the authorities through the sale of branches in highly concentrated areas, experts said.While the authorities tend to examine deals closely which result in one institution controlling more than 35 per cent of the market, FDIC data does not include deposits held in thrifts or credit unions, they added.First Niagara has about $30bn in assets and $18bn in deposits, in upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts. The bank has been acquisitive, doing more than nine large bank and branch-network deals in the 10 years before the combination with NewAlliance.JPMorgan advised HSBC on the deal.
5;KEY;Keycorp;2011-04-25T23:17:56Z;Loan figures raise doubt over bank earnings;;Sluggish loan growth and ultra-low interest rates are depressing US banks’ revenues, compounding investors’ fears that future earnings will remain under pressure in spite of the domestic economic recovery.Bankers and analysts said that recently released first quarter results underlined the low-growth environment plaguing the US financial sector, with profits beating Wall Street’s expectations only thanks to large releases of bad loan reserves.The make-up of the results failed to please investors, with shares in large and small banks underperforming the broader market and remaining at historically low valuations over the past few weeks.“Earnings driven by the release of reserves or lower charge-offs are not cutting it right now,” said Scott Siefers of Sandler O’Neill. “Investors are focused on the lack of top-line growth.”With most banks back on a solid footing after the financial turmoil and with the recovery well under way, investors had expected them to show stronger revenue gains, mainly through more loans.Lending growth – a crucial driver of revenues for retail and commercial banks – resumed in important areas such as loans to industrial companies at the end of last year after nearly two years of contraction.But it failed to build on that momentum in the first quarter. Average loans at the 28 US banks that have reported results fell 2 per cent from a year before, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. At large banks, the annual drop in loans was 6 per cent.Near-zero interest rates – the result of the monetary authorities’ desire to stimulate the economy – have made it difficult for them to earn large profits on the loans they make.The net interest margin – the difference between what banks receive from borrowers and what they pay out to savers – was lower than a year ago for large banks and only slightly higher for smaller rivals, KBW said.As a result, earnings remained disproportionately dependent on the release of loan-loss reserves and lower charge-offs.Some executives said the pause in lending could be because of unforeseen events such as the Japanese earthquake and the unrest in the Middle East, which put a dampener on companies’ investment plans. But others voiced concerns.“Things are actually not quite as positive as we thought they would be at the middle of the quarter,” Richard Davis, chief executive of US Bancorp, told investors. Mr Davis said that while US Bancorp’s lending commitments to businesses are up 2 per cent compared with the fourth quarter, actual usage is down about 1 per cent.“Even when they have the availability of credit, they are not using it,” Mr Davis said.Overall lending declined at some smaller regional banks, including KeyCorp and Comerica. Larger banks, including Wells Fargo and Bank of America, saw flat to slightly positive lending to commercial customers and loan growth to consumers remained depressed.The shares of Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase have traded lower since the banks reported results last week.The main banks continue to trade within historic multiples of about 11 times forward earnings. But that could change if investors decide banks are more like slow-growth utilities than the earnings powerhouses they became over the past decade.“Investors are questioning whether banks can earn a competitive return,” Mr Siefers said. “If they determine they can’t, their multiples will likely contract.”
6;KEY;Keycorp;2011-03-18T15:15:43Z;US banks lift dividends after Fed green light;;"JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo led a parade of US banks to unveil dividend increases and stock buy-backs within hours of getting the green light from the Federal Reserve to return more cash to shareholders for the first time since 2009.Nineteen institutions were probed by the Fed as part of its “comprehensive capital analysis and review”. The exercise was an update on the 2009 stress tests, which helped shore up investor confidence in the financial system.This latest battery of tests appeared to cheer investors, too; by midday trading in New York, banks that had announced higher dividend or buy-back plans saw their shares rally. JPMorgan had climbed 3.3 per cent, while Wells Fargo was up 2.2 per cent.JPMorgan said it would lift its quarterly pay-out to 25 cents a share, up from 5 cents, and won approval from its board to buy back $15bn in shares. Of that total, as much as $8bn can be repurchased this year, the company said.Goldman Sachs won approval to buy back $5bn preferred shares the bank issued to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway during the crisis, repurchase common stock and raise its dividend. Goldman said the Berkshire deal, which included a one-time dividend payment, would trim its first-quarter earnings by $2.84 a share.American Express, BB&T, USBancorp and PNC Financial Services also weighed in with plans to raise their dividends, stock buy-backs or both.Morgan Stanley said its “capital allocation priorities are the continued investment in our businesses and purchasing the rest of” Citigroup’s stake in the two banks’ wealth-management venture. Citi reiterated plans to return capital to shareholders next year.SunTrust Banks and KeyCorp launched stock offerings to raise cash required to exit the government’s bail-out programme.In the months leading up to Friday’s results, bankers conceded that regulators would cap their dividends at about 30 per cent of earnings while limiting the total shareholder pay-out to about 50 per cent.Banks that failed to convince the Fed that they are sufficiently well-capitalised to return more cash can resubmit their plans as soon as next month. However, they will be told by officials that the same plan is unlikely to be approved.The Fed adopted a “yes or no” approach to the request – so any bank that asked for approval for a 100 per cent dividend increase and would have been allowed an 80 per cent increase received a flat no. In that situation, the institution would be given the opportunity to tweak its request next time.Bank of America has said it planned a “modest” dividend increase later this year.The approval from the Federal Reserve on Friday comes more than two years after increased dividends and share buy-backs were put on hold in February 2009.The resumption of pay-outs is a step that many will welcome as another sign of a return to normal but that is likely to attract some controversy.Anat Admati, professor at Stanford University, wrote a letter with a group of like-minded economists to the Financial Times last month arguing that “taxpayers should be concerned when banks pay dividends and remain thinly capitalised”.Ms Admati was responding to a call from William Isaac, the former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for the Fed to allow banks to return cash to shareholders.Unlike the 2009 tests, the Fed itself will not release detailed results. However, the Fed released its methodology for the new tests, revealing that banks would have to exceed a tier one common equity ratio of 5 per cent under a stress scenario that envisaged unemployment rising to 11 per cent this year and real gross domestic product falling 1.5 per cent. The standard is tougher than the 2009 stress tests, which required banks’ core capital ratios to exceed 4 per cent.The stress scenario compares with the latest estimates from Fed governors and regional bank presidents of a 3.2-4.2 per cent increase in real gross domestic product this year and an unemployment rate of 8.4-9 per cent.The six largest bank holding companies, which range from Bank of America to Morgan Stanley, also had to measure the performance of trading desks and private equity operations under a “severe global shock scenario”, which forced them to assume a similar deterioration in markets as occurred between June and December 2008.Officials at the central bank are keen to draw a distinction between the stress tests, which involved hundreds of bank examiners scouring balance sheets over several weeks. The capital assessment exercise relies on banks testing themselves against the stress scenario and a series of additional tests.The Fed said it had evaluated the banks’ capital plans against five criteria: their capital assessment and planning processes, the policy for capital distribution, plans to repay any remaining government bail-out money, ability to absorb losses under the stress scenarios and whether they were on track to meet tougher capital requirements set out by the Dodd-Frank financial reforms in the US and the international Basel III agreement.Only those groups that wanted to increase dividends or share buy-backs or repay government capital received a call from the Fed on Friday. Others will wait until next month when they will receive a more detailed analysis and critique of their capital plans.Fed officials say they have taken a cautious approach to allowing the return of dividends amid continued uncertainty over the final capital buffer banks will be forced to adopt as a result of post-crisis international negotiations.Pat Parkinson, the Fed’s top bank supervisor, said this week that the US was pushing for a graduated approach to a capital surcharge on the biggest international banks, with the very top of the list forced into a significant surcharge and only those that only surpass a US measure for “systemic importance”, with more than $50bn in assets, required to hold only a “nominal” surcharge."
7;KEY;Keycorp;2011-03-13T20:58:03Z;Investors hope for Fed test windfalls;;"The largest US financial services companies are poised to unleash a flurry of dividend increases, stock buy-back plans and, in some cases, equity offerings as early as this week.Nineteen financial groups, which range from leading banks such as JPMorgan Chase to credit card companies and regional lenders, are eagerly awaiting the results of a battery of tests that the Federal Reserve began in January to gauge how their balance sheets would withstand various economic and financial shocks.The Fed will also rule by next Monday on whether the banks have stockpiled enough capital to begin returning some of it to shareholders in the form of dividend increases and buy-backs, or for those that have yet to withdraw from the US Treasury’s troubled asset relief programme, to repay the bail-out funds they received during the financial crisis.For investors in financial stocks, the second-largest component of the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, the results cannot come soon enough. At conferences and in private meetings, shareholders have peppered bank executives with questions on when and how much will be returned to them.Indeed, the Fed has aimed to wrap up the tests in time to allow financial groups to raise dividends and buy-backs in the second quarter.Fed officials have sought to play down the capital assessment exercise’s similarities with the 2009 “stress tests”, whose results helped reassure investors about the resilience of the remaining US banks after the demise of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.The Fed released detailed results for each of the 19 institutions at that time. It has said that the current round of testing may become an annual exercise and some Fed officials favour complete confidentiality of results, although others have considered publishing some information on the outcome of the tests.While this is an event financial companies have been waiting for since 2008, when regulators froze most buy-back plans and dividend increases, it may not be the Christmas morning investors had dreamed about as they slogged through quarter after quarter of one-cent dividend pay-outs. Many banks have sought to keep expectations in check, with many predicting gradual increases.Bank of America, for one, has forecast a “modest” dividend rise in the second half of 2011. Citigroup has said it would be in position to return capital next year.Some bankers said they expected the Fed would allow them to boost their dividend in two steps. Over time, they said, the pay-outs would account for about 30 per cent of annual earnings.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have said they aim to find more profitable uses of their excess capital, though each have stated a preference for stock buy-backs over dividend increases. And Goldman has sought permission to buy back preferred shares held by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.SunTrust Banks and KeyCorp and their investors are also eager to hear from the Fed, but for a different reason: “What’s it going to take for them to repay Tarp?” asked Brian Foran, an analyst for Nomura.On average, lenders have raised about 50 per cent of their bail-out debts to exit the programme, Mr Foran said; SunTrust and Key have argued they can issue fewer new shares while still maintaining capital ratios.“They’ve done the work” to prepare for an equity offering, one investment banker said. “The only question is when and how much.”Some bankers and analysts also said the results could reignite takeover discussions that withered as the industry awaited the Fed’s imprimatur to spend some of its excess capital.Bankers have said they do not expect the Fed to announce the results publicly, leaving each institution to decide what information they will share with investors, and when they will offer these details.Given the interest from an investment community still relatively underweight financial stocks, it may be difficult for any of the 19 companies to remain silent."
8;KEY;Keycorp;2011-01-21T03:32:54Z;Fifth Third raises funds to repay Tarp;;"Fifth Third, a leading Midwestern bank, sold $1.7bn in shares on Thursday to help repay funds the US Treasury lent it during the financial crisis.The US government invested $389bn in US financial institutions in 2008 and 2009 and $118.5bn of that is still outstanding, highlighting the struggle many banks face to stabilise their loan portfolios even as the broader economy shows signs of recovery.Four of the 19 banks that were subjected to government stress tests have not repaid funds to the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The group includes Fifth Third, KeyCorp, Regions Financial and SunTrust Financial.On Wednesday, Cincinnati-based Fifth Third said it was selling $1.7bn worth of shares in a secondary offering. The shares priced on Thursday at $14, a 4 per cent discount to their previous close. The bank said it would use the proceeds from the sale together with a five-year bond issue to repay $3.4bn in government loans.JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs were bookrunners. Bankers have competed fiercely for roles in share sales by bailed-out institutions, including the impending sale of shares in AIG. Anshu Jain, global head of Deutsche Bank’s investment bank, personally visited Cincinnati to pitch the plan, according to a source close to the deal.Also on Wednesday, Fifth Third reported that non-performing assets fell 8 per cent to $4.2bn in the fourth quarter from a year ago, versus total assets of $111bn. The improvement was driven by a pick-up in commercial business loans, leases and construction loans.Quarterly net income was $270m, versus a loss of $160m a year earlier, as the bank released $190m of reserve funds.Fifth Third’s shares fell 2.7 per cent to $14.22 on Thursday. ""The company still has significant credit issues to work through,” said Paul Miller, analyst at FBR Capital Markets.The Federal Reserve announced this month that it would begin a second round of stress tests, retesting the same 19 banks, as JPMorgan Chase and others face pressure from investors to begin returning capital.KeyCorp, based in Cleveland, Ohio, and SunTrust, based in Atlanta, Georgia, have also turned profits in recent quarters. SunTrust reports earnings on Friday, and KeyCorp next week. The two banks are also anticipated to announce capital raisings to repay Tarp in conjunction with the second round of stress tests.“We have already set aside the full amount of money to repay the Government’s investment,” said Michael McCoy, a spokesman for SunTrust. KeyCorp declined to comment.Regions Financial, based in Birmingham, Alabama, has not turned a profit since the second quarter of 2009. It reports earnings next week."
9;KEY;Keycorp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

And opportunistic independent asset managers will be the beneficiaries.”In recent months, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, has bought a “long-short” equity team from Goldman Sachs, while its rival, Blackstone, plans to add $1bn to its strategic alliance fund so it can put money behind teams of traders as they leave banks.MatlinPatterson was founded in 1994 within Credit Suisse and established as an independent entity in 2002.It owns a diverse group of companies including homebuilder Standard Pacific, Flagstar Bank and Foamex.In the past, it has made hundreds of millions of dollars from investments in WorldCom and Huntsman.The team from KeyCorp, which is headed by Craig Ruch, is expected to invest in both corporate credit and municipal debt on behalf of MatlinPatterson, said people familiar with the matter.While he was at KeyCorp, Mr Ruch oversaw almost $20bn in debt investments. He was also in charge of KeyCorp’s Absolute Return Credit Strategy fund, which had a total return of 78 per cent from the time it opened in June 2008 through to the end of June 2010.Last year, Mr Ruch was able to generate more than 30 per cent returns by buying the bonds of companies such as Georgia Pacific and ArcelorMittal as the price of their debt rose on the back of reduced borrowings and improved fundamentals.The hiring of the KeyCorp team comes as corporate credit markets are thriving. Low interest rates have made it easy for companies to service their debt.Meanwhile, investors who have been starved of higher yields have fuelled a huge rally in the junk bond market for lower-rated companies.

He joined Ohio-based KeyCorp in December 2008.People familiar with the matter said Mr Hancock would receive a pay package of up to $7.5m for this year, comprised of cash, restricted stock and a performance-related cash-and-stock bonus. Kenneth Feinberg, the Obama administration’s “pay tsar” who oversees compensation at bailed-out companies, is believed to have signed off on Mr Hancock’s package.AIG declined to comment.Mr Hancock, whom friends described as a cerebral type with a fierce intellect, was the leader of the band of young financial wizards who set up JPMorgan’s derivatives unit in 1991.The team invented a new type of financial product: credit derivatives backed by cash flow from loans such as collaterised debt obligations and collaterised loan obligations.Their aim was to reduce the risk associated with the loans – and make them easier to sell – by slicing them, dicing them and offering them to investors.The products were a hit, earning lucrative revenues for JPMorgan and prompting other banks to replicate them.By the middle of the next decade, CDOs and CLOs were a multibillion-dollar industry that span out of control when US house prices collapsed, leading to the financial crisis and causing huge losses for banks and investors.In spite of that, Mr Hancock’s lieutenants managed to keep JPMorgan away from the worst of the credit derivatives implosion – a move that gave the bank a valuable advantage over its rivals during the crisis.At AIG, Mr Hancock will have to focus on overseeing the disposal of non-core businesses such as its Asian operations.Mr Benmosche has said he wants AIG’s surviving core to be its global property and casualty business and the US life and retirement unit.

Its shares ended down 3.6 per cent at $24.45.Bank of New York Mellon also lost ground after reporting earnings slightly below expectations, falling 6.2 per cent to $27.32.The markets followed several banks and bounced back during the day.“Even if you have a few people hitting the “sell” button on results, there are others underneath willing to buy the dips,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.The markets were also helped by optimism on housing after figures showed an unexpected rise in home prices in May.Mr Bernanke told the Senate he saw a “levelling-off” in house prices, although he added that foreclosures could yet pressure them again.KB Home gained 6.1 per cent to $15.03 while Lennarrose 7.7 per cent to $10.62 and DR Horton climbed 5.6 per cent to $10.38.Starbucks led the consumer sector higher after cost cuts helped it swing to a profit and beat analysts’ forecasts.

22;KEY;Keycorp;2009-05-12T00:09:48Z;Stress tests unleash fee bonanza;;The completion of US banking “stress tests” has unleashed a fee bonanza for Wall Street, with financial institutions set to earn more than $500m in just a few weeks for helping rivals raise equity to plug capital shortfalls and repay federal aid.Bankers expect a bumper period for equity fund-raisings as many of the 19 lenders involved in the tests tap the market to fill the capital holes uncovered by regulators or pay back funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp).The spike in underwriting fees, which touched a record low in the first quarter of 2009, will boost profits of banks’ securities units at a time when they have been hit by the slump in lucrative markets such as securitisations and mergers.Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Bank of America raised, or announced plans to raise, a total of nearly $30bn in the hours after Thursday’s release of the tests.On Monday they were joined by four other banks - US Bancorp, Capital One, BB&T, and KeyCorp, which plan to sell a combined $6.3bn in stock.The first three do not need additional capital but said they wanted funds to repay Tarp, while KeyCorp has to add $1.8bn in fresh equity by November following the stress tests.The stress tests already appear to be helping banks gain access to private capital, a key element in economic recovery, Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, said on Monday, according to Reuters. ”The initial indications are encouraging,” he said in a statement.Banks advising the lenders that have already announced capital-raising deals stand to share around $450m in underwriting fees, according to regulatory filings and people close to the situation.With a number of smaller banks expected to announce equity raisings in the coming weeks, the current quarter could become the biggest on record for underwriting fees from US banks.The most lucrative period for US banks advising rivals to raise funds was between April and June last year, according to Dealogic. At the time, more than 20 financial institutions paid out $845m in fees as they rushed to build a capital cushion against the worsening credit crunch.Some of the fees to be earned in coming weeks will be intra-company transfers as lenders with securities units such as BofA and Wells Fargo, have hired in-house bankers for the fund-raisings.However, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs - two of Wall Street’s traditional equity powerhouses - are set to gain large slice of the fees as they are underwriting several deals.The wave of new equity raisings pushed the US stock markets lower but bankers said investors showed a new-found appetite for financial companies.“The success of the capital raisings represents a positive catalyst in a sector and a market that hasn’t had many positive catalysts for quite a while,” said David Erickson, co-head of global equity capital markets at Barclays Capital, which was sole bookrunner on the Capital One deal.
23;KEY;Keycorp;2009-05-11T15:09:52Z;Banks to raise $7.5bn to repay Tarp;;Three US banks that passed government stress tests last week announced stock offerings on Monday in an effort to raise capital to repay federal funds.Capital One Financial, a leading issuer of credit cards, US Bancorp, the regional bank based in Minnesota, and BB&T, which operates banks mostly in the south-eastern US, between them set to raise $7.55bn by issuing new shares.The banks were among the nine US banks, out of a total of 19 that were stress-tested, that were said not to require additional capital cushions in the event that the economic downturn worsens. The move to offer common stock and repurchase shares bought by the government signals that US banks are feeling more confident in their ability to function independently.Last week the US Treasury said that the issuance of non-Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-backed debt was a condition for financial groups that want to repay funds received under the Tarp. It said that companies that had received such funds must be able to issue senior unsecured debt for a term of more than five years without FDIC guarantees to show that they can meet funding needs without government help.Capital One said it would offer 56m shares of common stock and would use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and to repay the $3.55bn in Treasury funds it received through the troubled asset relief programme.“We believe our balance sheet is a source of strength for Capital One and positions us well to continue to serve the banking and borrowing needs of our consumer, small business, and commercial customers,” Richard Fairbank, Capital One’s chief executive, said last week. “The results of the banking regulators’ stress test of Capital One confirm the strength and resilience of our capital.”US Bancorp announced it would sell $2.5bn in common stock to the public. Like Capital One, US Bancorp – parent to the sixth largest US commercial bank – said it would use capital it raises to repay the $6.6bn it took in Tarp funds.Separately on Monday, BB&T said that it would offer $1.5bn in common stock. It said it would use the capital raised toward its tangible common equity and tier-one capital, and that it would begin to repay the $3.1bn in preferred stock and warrants it issued to the US Treasury for the capital purchase programme.”I am pleased to announce that BB&T is poised to be one of the first large financial institutions to repay the government investment,” Kelly King, BB&T’s chief executive, said in a statement.”Following the favourable results of the government’s rigorous stress test and consistent with our own internal projections that BB&T has sufficient capital under an adverse economic scenario, our board of directors has approved a plan that effectively positions BB&T for the long term.”BB&T also said it would slash its third-quarter dividend by 68 per cent, saving $725m in capital annually.Meanwhile, KeyCorp, which was told to raise $1.8bn, said on Monday that it would sell up to $750m in common stock as a “first leg” to fulfill its requirements.Many banks which were directed to raise capital have already begun to do so. Last week Wells Fargo, which needs to plug a gap of $13.7bn, launched a $6bn equity issuance, while Morgan Stanley said that it would sell $2bn in shares and $3bn in non-government-backed debt to fill its $1.8bn capital requirement. Citigroup, which needs $5.5bn in additional equity, said that it would expand an existing offer to convert preferred shares.Bank of America said that it would add $17bn in equity through a share sale and the conversion of preferred shares held by non-government investors. It also plans to raise the money through earnings and the possible sale of assets, including asset manager Columbia Management and First Republic Bank.Shares of BB&T fell by 3.1 per cent to $25.50 in early New York trading on Monday. Capital One shares fell 8.6 per cent to $28.64 and US Bancorp slid by 5.6 per cent to $19.39.
24;KEY;Keycorp;2009-05-07T23:59:56Z;Stress tests show $75bn buffer needed;;US regulators on Thursday ordered 10 of the nation’s largest banks to add a total of $74.6bn in equity following the completion of stress tests, triggering a frenzy of activity as banks lined up to announce capital-raising plans.“These tests will help ensure that banks have a sufficient capital cushion to continue lending in a more adverse economic scenario,” Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, said.The US authorities said that the tests projected that losses at the top 19 banks over 2009 and 2010 would reach $599bn if the adverse scenario set out in the stress test materialised.They said that bank operating earnings would absorb $363bn of these losses under the stress scenario. They estimated that 10 of the 19 top banks would need a further $74.6bn in equity to be sufficiently well capitalised at the end of 2010 to cope with potential losses beyond that period.The regulators put the additional equity need at a much higher $185bn at the end of 2008, but said that actions taken by the banks subsequently had reduced that amount by $110bn.The long-awaited publication of the test results, which came after days of tense discussions between regulators and the banks, prompted a flurry of activity among lenders with Bank of America, which was found to have the biggest capital shortfall at $33.9bn, announcing plans to raise $17bn in equity. BofA said that it would add equity through a share sale and the conversion of preferred shares held by non-government investors. It also plans to raise the money through earnings and the possible sale of assets, including asset manager Columbia Management and First Republic Bank.Wells Fargo, which needs to plug a gap of $13.7bn, launched a $6bn equity issuance, while Morgan Stanley said that it would sell $2bn in shares and $3bn in non-government-backed debt to fill its $1.8bn capital requirement.Citigroup, which needs $5.5bn in additional equity, said that it would expand an existing offer to convert preferred shares.The stress tests could force the government to gain a large stake in a number of regional banks such as SunTrust, KeyCorp and Regions which might have to ask the government to convert its preferred shares into common stock unless they manage to sell enough shares to investors to meet the tests’ requirements.A number of banks, including Wells, BofA and Citi indicated that regulators had been very conservative in their assumptions and expressed confidence that their profits over the next two years would be better than the government’s projections.People close to the situation said that Citi convinced regulators to reduce their estimates of its capital shortfall, from an original $30bn-plus to just $5.5bn.
25;KEY;Keycorp;2009-05-07T23:30:05Z;Banks turn to markets in effort to plug holes;;Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup quickly turned to the public markets on Thursday to fill a combined $21bn (€15.7bn, £14bn) capital shortfall identified by the government’s stress tests.Wells unveiled plans to raise $6bn of common equity shortly after stock markets closed, pre-empting news of its $13.7bn capital shortfall by almost an hour.Morgan Stanley followed minutes later with plans to raise $2bn in equity and sell $3bn in non-government-backed debt to plug its $1.8bn capital need and to repay the $10bn in federal aid it received last year.Citigroup confirmed it would plug its $5.5bn capital shortfall by expanding an existing plan to convert $52bn of preferred shares held by the government and other investors. Citi said it would add $5.5bn of trust preferred shares – a hybrid of debt and equity – held by non-government investors to the conversion plan, which is expected to be completed in the next few weeks. The expansion of the plan will reduce the stake to be held by the government in Citi from the 36 per cent originally expected to about 34 per cent.Solutions for some of the smaller banks were less clear, however, and could result in significant government ownership of Regions Financial, SunTrust and KeyCorp.These banks do not enjoy the same access to the public equity markets as some of the larger companies, and they lack sufficient private preferred shares to convert into common equity and plug their combined $6.5bn capital shortfall.For Regions, this could, in theory, result in the bank being more than 40 per cent government-owned, unless it can find other ways to raise the $2.5bn it needs. It is working on a plan to avoid a larger government stake, which it hopes to present by the June 9 deadline.At Wells, the capital shortfall identified by the government prompted protests from senior management, while the stress tests projected losses under an economic downturn that were similar to the bank’s own projections,Howard Atkins, the bank’s chief financial officer, said the Federal Reserve had used significantly different assumptions of the bank’s revenue generating ability.“The main reason the Federal Reserve has required Wells Fargo to hold an extra $13.7 billion in tier-one common equity is based on what we believe is their excessively conservative estimate of pre-provision net revenue in the adverse scenario,” said Mr Atkins.Wells’ planned $6bn common equity raise is expected to price on Friday.The bank bargained with the Fed to obtain credit for the difference between the Fed’s projected revenues and the bank’s actual revenues over the next 6 months, which it believes will be sufficient to plug the remaining gap.

27;KEY;Keycorp;2009-05-02T01:44:51Z;Bank objections delay stress tests;;US regulators will delay the release of stress test results for the country’s 19 biggest banks until next Thursday, after some lenders, including Citigroup and Bank of America, objected to government demands that they needed to raise billions in fresh capital.Citi, one of the biggest victims of the crisis that has already been bailed out three times by the government, is believed to have been told by regulators that it needs more than $5bn in fresh capital, while BofA might need to convert $45bn in government preferred shares into common equity.Both companies are still contesting the findings and might still persuade the government they need less, or no capital, according to people close to the situation. Citi’s own projections are believed to show the company will have hundreds of millions of dollars in excess capital.After a week of tense talks between regulators and the banks, government sources said the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were set to unveil the outcome of the tests after the market closes on May 7 – three days later than anticipated.The authorities’ decision to let the original timetable slip also reflects the widespread belief that, after months of speculation since the tests were first announced in February, their outcome has the potential to disturb the markets.Government sources said regulators were likely to release both aggregate and individual data for each of the 19 banks, detailing their losses and capital needs under adverse economic scenarios.Some of the banks will then supplement those data with regulatory filings and analysts’ calls. Bankers said a number of lenders had pleaded with regulators for more time to lay out plans to plug any capital shortfall identified in the stress tests, by raising equity from either the government or from the stock market.People familiar with the situation said that, despite their objections, Citi and BofA – and at least four more lenders – were almost certain to need more equity capital.Citi could boost its equity by expanding a planned conversion of preferred shares into common stock, or taking a further capital injection from the government.The latter move could increase the government stake in Citi beyond the 36 per cent it has already agreed to buy and could then, in turn, lead to the removal of chief executive Vikram Pandit.The move would give the authorities a sizeable stake in the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender and further undermine the position of its chief executive Ken Lewis, who was stripped of his role as chairman after a shareholder vote this week. That vote followed an organised campaign against Mr Lewis and a series of demonstrations across the US at his perceived greed and the bank’s ruthless practices. Analysts have suggested that at least four more banks could need capital injections.A recent note by Morgan Stanley identified SunTrust, KeyCorp and Regions Financial Corp, as regional banks that might require capital, while other experts have suggested Wells Fargo, the large San Francisco-lender could also need to raise more equity.The banks and regulators have not commented on the likely outcome of the tests.

Citigroup rose 8 per cent to $3.12 on the analysis.Bank of America, the other leading banking group reported to require more capital after the test results, also rose after Fox-Pitt’s analysis. The bank’s shares gained 6.5 per cent to $8.68 in spite of the fate of Ken Lewis’ role as both chairman and chief executive hanging in the balance after a vote among shareholders.Regional banks involved in the stress test also performed strongly, with Keycorp gaining 3.1 per cent to $6.26 and Fifth Third jumping 11.6 per cent to $4.13.The upgrade by Fox-Pitt helped the banking sector overcome concerns over revenues from mortgage refinancing, as figures showed that the number of home loan applications dropped significantly last week. It also mitigated the effect of a Bloomberg report that said six of the 19 banks “stress tested” by the government needed more capital.“People are seeing the Bloomberg report as a positive, as it adds clarity to banks’ capital positions,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS.Investors also looked beyond a sharper contraction in the US economy than analysts had predicted, and took confidence from an unexpectedly strong rise in personal consumption.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.2 per cent up at 873.64 points, a level not seen since January 9, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.1 per cent to 8,185.73 points and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.3 per cent to 1,711.94 points.Several companies reported better earnings than predicted.Time Warner, the media group, said it might spin off one or more parts of its AOL internet division after reporting a lower fall in profits than predicted. The company rose 1 per cent to $21.98 as analysts said shedding AOL could improve the company’s valuation.Time Warner Cable, the company’s cable unit, which was split off from the main business, was able to add customers, however, and, having cut capital expenditure, was able to beat expectations with first-quarter profits. Its shares gained
14.2 per cent to $31.12.Telecoms company Qwest was able to combat falling revenues and report better earnings than expected, excluding certain one-off items. Its shares climbed 3.1 per cent to $3.68.Wyeth, the pharmaceutical company, also made better profits than expected, as cost cuts proved effective. Shares in the company, which has agreed to be bought by Pfizer, gained 0.8 per cent to $42.60.Aetna weighed on the healthcare sector after it reported worse first-quarter profits than Wall Street had expected.Costs remained high, taking their toll even as customers rose, and its shares fell 10.3 per cent to $21.88.Dendreon jumped after it reported the results of tests on its experimental prostate cancer drug Provenge, which were good enough for Wachovia to upgrade the company to “outperform”.Its shares dropped on Tuesday before trade was halted ahead of the results, but rebounded on Wednesday to the previous session’s highs. They closed on Wednesday 94.2 per cent up at $22.94.“Stocks look pretty attractive, having hit highs for the latest bull run,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global. “The rally may continue as people buy stocks to cover their short positions.”"

But other regional banks, particularly smaller ones, did not fare as well.“I think there is some clear delineation between big healthy institutions and the plain-vanilla small-cap regional banks,” said analyst Andrew Marquardt of Fox-Pitt Kelton.“They’re having much worse results in terms of charge-offs and reserve builds.”Alabama-based Regions Financial, which cut its dividend to 1 cent per share last week, eked out a profit of 4 cents per share on earnings of $77m.Utah-based Zions surprised investors late Monday by announcing a loss of $832m, reflecting its exposure to commercial real estate.Analysts said they were impressed by US Bancorp’s increase in market share and its ability to build up reserves against future charge-offs. The bank’s stock was up 17 per cent to $18.65 in late trading.Mr Marquardt said US Bancorp’s credit reserves of $1.3bn, almost triple the amount reserved a year ago, is a healthy sign, compared with other regional banks, such as Comerica, which so far have not reserved against a similar percentage of loans.Zions was down 18 per cent in late trading.Sandler O’Neill slapped a sell rating on the stock, while Moody’s downgraded the bank’s debt ratings because of Zions’ large exposure to commercial real estate loans, as well as its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations.Mr Marquardt described KeyCorp’s results for the quarter as disappointing and questioned whether the Ohio bank would have to cut its dividend again.As for Regions, its earnings and outlook would be negatively affected in the near term by the recession, which is now hitting the south-eastern part of the US with particular ferocity, the analyst added.

Bank of America, which fell nearly 25 per cent on Monday following warnings in its results about deteriorating credit conditions, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.76.US Bancorp was another significant riser, jumping 20.9 per cent to $19.27 after making better profits than expected.State Street reported operating earnings marginally ahead of estimates as mark-to-market losses declined following a change in accounting standards from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Its shares gained 17.9 per cent to $36.15.Lincoln National, the health insurer, surged after Bank of America recommended investors buy its stock and Reuters reported it would sell its Delaware Investments asset management unit. Its shares rose 20.3 per cent to $10.56.This helped the benchmark S&P 500 index rise 2.1 per cent to 850.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index gained 1.6 per cent to 7,969.56 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.2 per cent to 1,643.85.The overall rise in the financial sector masked falls from some companies as they missed earnings estimates, however.Keycorp, the Ohio-based bank, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent per share as it reported its fourth straight quarterly loss. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to $7.05.Bank of New York Mellon also cut its dividend, reducing it to 9 cents per share, after feeling the effects of falling global stock markets, which put potential customers off investing with the bank. Its stock lost 0.2 per cent to $27.98.“Much of Monday’s trade was technical, with short-sellers betting that the six week rally could not continue. A lot of the most bearish estimates were factored in to the share price already,“ said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The Nasdaq’s gains came as IBMand Texas Instruments announced better earnings than predicted.IBM climbed 1.9 per cent to $102.31 after surprisingly good earnings.This helped Microsoft which gained 1.9 per cent to $18.97. Oracle, which on Monday announced a deal to buy Sun Microsystems, a former IBM target, also rose, gaining 3.8 per cent to $19.53.Texas beat expectations and raised its forecast for full-year profits gave up its early gains, following other chip makers downwards, and fell 1.2 per cent to $17.11.Some of the biggest Dow components added to the morning’s flurry of corporate news. Caterpillar reported earnings ahead of predictions, helping its shares gain 3 per cent to $31.39 even though this equated to a loss once the cost of making redundancies had been factored in.AK Steel offered further strength to the industrial sector as lower costs helped it report a narrower loss than Wall Street had expected. Its shares jumped 13.8 per cent to $11.66.Du Pont also gained as it reported earnings in line with estimates. Even though the chemical maker cut its full-year outlook, predicting further weakening of demand, its shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $28.06.Merger partners in the drug industry Merck and Schering-Plough both fell after Merck missed estimates for its first-quarter earnings. Schering’s earnings came in ahead of expectations, but both companies declined as Merck cut its full-year outlook. Merck lost 6.7 per cent to $23.54 while Schering Plough gave up 4.1 per cent to $22.11.Coca-Cola lost initial gains after reporting earnings in line with estimates. Investors worried about disappointing sales numbers though, sending its shares down 2.8 per cent to $43.09.“Today’s moves are a confluence of bargain hunting, Geithner’s comments assuaging fears over banks and short-covering after yesterday’s falls,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.
31;KEY;Keycorp;2009-02-11T22:34:47Z;US bank fears over stability plan;;Washington’s “financial stability plan” has fuelled some of the most volatile trading in recent history for US regional bank stocks.Investors’ high hopes for the plan, which led to soaring stock prices for regional banks last week, were spectacularly dashed on Tuesday by the lack of detail in the rescue initiative. Several regional bank stocks lost more than a quarter of their value amid fears that the plan would amount to a creeping nationalisation of the US banking system.Regional banks accounted for six of the 10 biggest falls in the S&P 500 following comments from Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, on Tuesday. Huntington Bancshares, Regions Financial, SunTrust Banks, KeyCorp, Fifth Third Bancorp and Marshall & Ilsley all lost more than 25 per cent. The stocks recovered a little in morning trade on Wednesday, swinging higher by between 5 and 15 per cent.Investors fear the Treasury’s new measures – the details of which are yet to be fleshed out – will not restore confidence in the banking industry, fall short of cleaning up balance sheets and prevent banks from raising private capital. But for the regional banks, in particular, there are fears that the plans could do more harm than good, say analysts.Much will depend on how the Treasury’s scheme values toxic assets that will be sold to a new $1,000bn public-private “bad bank”, the design of which is still unclear.Regional banks have continued to hold many troubled housing assets at valuations far above where the loans could be sold in the secondary market. Sales of such assets to the Treasury’s “bad bank” at severely distressed market prices could force banks to take severe markdowns on loans they have kept on their balance sheets. In turn this could erode regulatory capital.Investors also fear a regulatory stress test mandated by the Treasury’s plan will highlight new weaknesses in the balance sheet and loan portfolios of the banks, particularly if they are forced to take new markdowns on previously unimpaired assets.All banks with more than $100bn in assets will be required to undergo the stress test to determine whether large financial institutions have enough capital to continue lending and absorb potential losses in a more severe downturn.Banks that fail the stress test will be given additional capital in the form of convertible preferred securities, providing the government with a larger stake in the banks that could dilute existing shareholders and deter private capital.Many of the fears investors share would only materialise in a worst case scenario. Yet until there is clarity on the government’s plans, such a worst case could still materialise.

Nordstrom, another department store chain, bounced 6.5 per cent to $13.98 and the retail sector stood 1.8 per cent higher overall, helping pare the market’s losses.“It’s a good sign for the retailers, that’s for sure,” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global. He said the move could be a sign that banks were “being a little bit less restrictive”.The market overall failed to hold gains enjoyed in the previous session, when the Federal Reserve’s historic move to cut rates to virtually zero spurred a 5.1 per cent rally in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 closed down 1 per cent on Wednesday at 904.42 after drifting between positive and negative territory throughout the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.1 per cent lower at 8,824.34 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.7 per cent weaker at 1,579.31.Trading was largely muted, however, as investors digested the effects of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate policy.Financials finished 1.3 per cent lower overall. Shares in Morgan Stanley lost as much as 8.3 per cent in the morning session as the bank reported a fourth-quarter loss that was wider than even the most bearish predictions. The figures prompted Moody’s to downgrade the bank’s senior debt rating.Yet the shares finished 2.3 per cent higher as traders were encouraged by the bank’s attempt to reduce its leveraged capital structure. Richard Bove, analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, lifted his price target on the stock to $18.Goldman Sachs, which jumped 14.4 per cent in the previous session following its fourth-quarter results, added a further 3.7 per cent to $78.78.However, regional banks, off 2.3 per cent overall, underperformed the wider financial sector after Fifth Third’s move to cut its fourth-quarter dividend to 1 cent a share sparked concerns others may be required to take similar action. Fifth Third fell 6 per cent to $7.51 while KeyCorp lost 4 per cent to $8.33.Among other consumer stocks, ConAgra and General Mills jumped 8 per cent to $16.25 and 0.2 per cent to $61.35, respectively, on the back of better-than-expected second-quarter profits.Newell Rubbermaid was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, pushed 27.3 per cent lower to $9.58 by a profit warning that prompted analysts at BMO Capital Markets to question whether the company would retain its dividend.Investors did not appear reassured by plans from the maker of Sharpie pens, among other products, to cut up to 10 per cent of non-
manufacturing jobs.Meanwhile, the materials sector provided the market with support, up 0.1 per cent overall. Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold advanced 4.5 per cent to $26.01 as gold prices enjoyed strong gains.However, the energy sector came under selling pressure as US crude prices neared $40 in spite of Opec’s production cut.Elsewhere, Apple continued its bad run, down a further 6.6 per cent to $89.16, after the withdrawal of Steve Jobs, chief executive, from the group’s main event of the year prompted Oppenheimer to downgrade its view of the stock to “perform”.“It’s past time for Apple to either disclose the state of his health or elaborate a viable plan for eventually transferring power,” the analysts wrote, removing their price target. “Until such time, we can no longer continue to recommend Apple as a long-term investment.”Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Adobe afforded the technology sector scant comfort.Shares in the software group were dragged 2.8 per cent lower to $21.69 as the wider sector fell 1.7 per cent.Barclays noted the company did not give guidance for next year. “We believe the near-term environment will continue to pressure the top-line,” wrote the analysts, although they maintained their “overweight” stance."

National City said it planned to cut about 4,000 jobs, or 14 per cent of its workforce, over the next three years after the bank posted a net loss of $729m, or 85 cents a share. Fifth Third reported a quarterly loss of $56m, or 61 cents per share, and KeyCorp lost $36m, or 10 cents per share.Profits fell at US Bancorp, which operates in the western two-thirds of the country, as well as at south-east bank Regions Financial and at M&T Bank, based in the mid-
Atlantic region. US Bancorp said profits dropped 47 per cent to $576m. Regions’ profits fell 80 per cent to $79.5m and profits at M&T Bank fell 54 per cent to $91.1m.All the banks more than doubled their reserves for loan losses from a year earlier, and net write-offs for bad loans also soared. “We have experienced the most severe financial crisis any of us has known in our business lifetime,” said Henry Meyer, chief executive of KeyCorp.The results echoed signs of deteriorating consumer credit and further housing weakness at big rivals such as Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which have experienced losses on mortgages and credit card loans. Regional banks have suffered from losses on second mortgages and residential construction and development loans.Several regional banks reporting on Tuesday also suffered losses from holdings of preferred shares issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were virtually wiped out when the two US mortgage agencies were taken into government supervision last month. KeyCorp said it took $54m of charges related to market disruption caused by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.The Treasury last week revealed plans to inject $125bn into banks through the purchase of preferred shares and warrants as part of a $700bn industry bail-out that could include buying troubled loans and securities. Fifth Third, KeyCorp, US Bancorp and Regions said they were considering applications to participate in the scheme.National City said it was looking at details of the proposal but it was too soon to discuss participation. At 11 per cent, the Cleveland-based bank has one of the highest tier one capital ratios among US banks. The bank’s $21bn portfolio of troubled loans has fuelled speculation it might need to seek further capital."
35;KEY;Keycorp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.8 per cent at 9,310.99The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3.5 per cent at 1,779.01. Intel slipped 6.3 per cent to $15.93 ahead of results that were due after the bell. Microsoft fell 5.5 per cent to $24.10 after Credit Suisse cut its forecasts and Google lost 4.8 per cent to $362.71 after Barclays cut its price target from $600 to $542.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 8.8 per cent to 59.81, which continued to indicate signs of severe distress.“You’d be delirious to say all of a sudden that this situation has been resolved,” said Joe Cusick, analyst at OptionsXpress, who added the reaction to the PepsiCo numbers showed traders were “starting to focus on the earnings and economic outlook.” A slew of other corporate results are due in coming days.Financials were the stand-out winners on Tuesday, up 6.4 per cent overall. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – surged 16.4 per cent to $26.53, 10.7 per cent to $122.90 and 18.2 per cent $18.62, respectively. There were also tentative signs on Tuesday that the paralysis in credit markets, which reached historic levels had begun to ease.Bucking the trend, JPMorgan Chase fell 3.1 per cent to $40.71, weighed down as Barclays cut its third-quarter earnings estimate ahead of results due today. Some analysts also said that the government plan may be of less benefit to the group, which has thus far appeared more resilient to the crisis than rivals.Regional banks boasted the biggest gains, up 14.3 per cent. The Treasury confirmed that it was also prepared to plough money into a wide range of lenders in addition to the nine institutions from whom it has secured participation. Keycorp and National City surged 54.3 per cent to $11.97 and 34.8 per cent to $3.10 respectively.Meanwhile, General Motors and Ford soared as much as 22.6 per cent and 24.3 per cent, respectively.The hard-hit car groups, subject to merger speculation, later retreated to stand 0.5 per cent higher at $6.54 and 2.5 per cent higher at $2.45. Concern over the likely success of a merger with each other, or Chrysler, offset hopes that the Treasury could purchase auto loans under the remit of its financial sector rescue plan.Most non-financial sectors posted declines.

The credit card company’s shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to $37.99 while peer Discover Financial lost 3.8 per cent to $14.62.An $8.9bn loss from Wachovia and some depressing results from regional banks, including Regions Financial and Keycorp, initially added to the sour mood.But by midday investors had shrugged off the bad news, focusing instead on a strategy from Robert Steel, Wachovia’s new chief executive, to cut $2bn of expenses by the end of 2009, sell assets and slash jobs and the dividend at the bank.Wachovia shares swung from an 11.6 per cent loss to a 27.4 per cent gain at $16.79. Regions Financial and Keycorp overturned early losses to gain 9.6 per cent to $11.40 and 4.3 per cent to $11.99, respectively.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim, an online brokerage, said: “Wachovia presented a plan this morning, they cut their dividend – they are doing something. This credit crisis is not going away in a month, but if we have a plan to get ourselves out of it in a year that makes the market feel good.”There were some more consistent bright spots. Western Union advanced 8.6 per cent to $27.23 after the money-transfer company said second-quarter profit had risen 13 per cent, thanks to international revenues, and raised its 2008 profit forecast.SunTrust Banks said second-quarter earnings had slumped 21 per cent. But that was a smaller fall than expected and the shares rallied 17.1 per cent to $39.97 after the bank ruled out a capital raising or dividend cut.CME Group, which runs futures exchanges, said second-quarter profit had risen 60 per cent to $201m thanks to its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME shares rose 12.5 per cent to $366.27.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had shaken off early losses and was up 1.4 per cent at 1,277.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 11,602.5 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was ahead 1.1 per cent at 2,303.96 points.The day began in downbeat fashion after Apple forecast fourth-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ projections. The news, and speculation about the health of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, sent shares in the iPod maker down 2.6 per cent to $162.02.Texas Instruments and SanDisk also disappointed investors in the technology sector. The semiconductor makers both predicted earnings that trailed analysts’ expectations. Texas shares fell 14.2 per cent to $24.48, SanDisk dropped 24 per cent to $13.62, while an index of semiconductor stocks slipped 2.8 per cent.A $4 drop in oil prices took the sting out of the worst results. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks were among the best performers, adding 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart added 3.1 per cent to $59.06 while Starbucks rose 7.4 per cent to $15.13.In industrials, some solid earnings news helped steady investor concerns about the health of the economy. Caterpillar, the heavy goods maker, Lockheed Martin, the defence company, Paccar, the truckmaker, and United Parcel Service, each met or beat analysts’ expectations for their quarterly results.Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 per cent to $74.98, Lockheed Martin added 2.3 per cent to $103.88, Paccar climbed 4.4 per cent to $44.60 and UPS advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.11.Energy was the best performing sector on Monday, but that trend petered out on Tuesday as oil prices slipped back below $130 a barrel and some decent results from the services sub-industry left investors unmoved. BJ Services and Baker Hughes rose 6.6 per cent to $31.99, and 3.2 per cent to $87.06, respectively.
38;KEY;Keycorp;2008-07-22T19:21:25Z;SunTrust sells stake in Coke;;SunTrust on Tuesday completed the sale of a coveted stake in Coca-Cola that the Atlanta-based bank has owned for almost 90 years, allowing the bank to prop up its capital position after mounting mortgage losses led to sharply weaker second-quarter earnings for the bank.News of the SunTrust disposal came as the deepening housing slump and slowing economy weighed on second-quarter earnings for banks including North Carolina’s Wachovia , Ohio’s Fifth Third and KeyCorp and Alabama’s Regions Financial.Wachovia, the fourth-largest US bank by assets, posted an $8.9bn loss, slashed its dividend for the second time this year and announced 10,700 job cuts. Net charge-offs at the bank increased more than eightfold from last year.SunTrust’s sale of 43.6m shares in the world’s largest soft drinks company, executed through three different transactions and valued at about $2bn, was used to prop up the bank’s capital position after higher credit losses tied to real estate led to a 21 per cent decline in second-quarter earnings to $535m. SunTrust, which holds the Coke secret formula in one of its safe deposit boxes, has held Coke shares since 1919, when predecessor bank Trust Company of Georgia helped take the company public. The stake has long been regarded as equivalent to the SunTrust family silver, and its sale is emblematic of the declining fortunes of US banks.The Coca-Cola transactions boosted the bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio to around 7.95 per cent – compared with the 6 per cent statutory minimum. In one of the transactions, SunTrust will dispose of 30m shares in the next seven years, while collecting part of the money now. “It is timely to reiterate that the impetus for the transactions announced today was exclusively related to SunTrust’s own capital optimisation goals,” said James Wells, chairman and chief executive of SunTrust, adding that the bank retained “the highest degree of institutional respect” for Coca-Cola.Wachovia, Fifth Third, KeyCorp and Regions reported higher losses on consumer debt and mounting problems on construction loans tied to residential real estate.Home equity losses accelerated amid borrower stress and falling home prices, particularly in the boom-and-bust regions of California and Florida and older industrial areas such as Michigan and Ohio, the banks said.Fifth Third posted a $202m loss while writing off $167m of consumer debts, almost a third of which were home equity loans. Losses tied to residential construction loans also mounted for Fifth Third and Regions.KeyCorp suffered in previous quarters from losses on residential construction loans, but has been trying to reduce its exposure.
39;KEY;Keycorp;2008-07-20T19:47:24Z;Regional US banks in fears of cash calls;;US regional banks will draw scrutiny during earnings season this week amid fears that losses on home equity and residential construction loans may force some to raise fresh capital or put themselves up for sale in turbulent markets.Shares of regional lenders have come under heavy pressure on fears about the ability of smaller institutions to ride out the turmoil in the banking sector.Such fears were thrown into stark relief last week after US banking regulators took over California-based IndyMac, making it the second-largest banking failure in US history, and leading to queues of anxious depositors outside branches.After mixed earnings reports from regional lenders thus far, a flurry of banks with large portfolios of real-estate loans will report their second-quarter results on Tuesday, including SunTrust, Regions Financial, Fifth Third and KeyCorp, while National City will follow on Thursday.Last week, Pittsburgh-based PNC and Ohio-based Huntington BancShares were the only two banks to report higher profits in the second quarter.While financial services ended last week as the second-biggest boosters of the S&P 500, regional banks were one of the heaviest drags. The S&P regional banks index ended Friday’s session down 0.8 per cent.Keith Horowitz, banking analyst at Citigroup, said that as losses from portfolios of home equity and residential construction loans mount, “a number of banks will be forced to come to seek their first, or in some cases second or third rounds of capital, and as time progresses it will be increasingly difficult and more costly to raise”.However, investors fear that many regional lenders, particularly banks with smaller deposit bases or less strategic attraction for private equity funds, could struggle to raise new capital.Many larger banks with stronger brands have already tapped investors for fresh funds and the value of those investments has deteriorated amid the recent slide in bank stocks.Analysts say consolidation in the sector – the traditional escape hatch for pressurised regional banks – may also be less realistic in the current crisis.David Hendler, analyst at CreditSights, a research provider, said: “Even relatively healthier banks are for the most part now saddled with their own credit problems and/or merger integrations …they are therefore less likely to rescue banks which may need a saviour.”New accounting rules that force an acquirer to value a target’s portfolio at current market prices may also stand in the way of consolidation for troubled regional banks, as potential buyers may be deterred until there is evidence that credit deterioration has slowed or access to fresh capital is more readily available.
40;KEY;Keycorp;2008-06-20T01:45:57Z;Small lenders expected to slash pay-outs;;Investors are betting mounting credit costs could force US regional banks such as SunTrust and PNC to slash dividends to preserve cash.A spike in the volume of equity options trades on Atlanta-based SunTrust in recent days shows investors now expect the bank to cut its dividend by half, according to research from Deutsche Bank. The option-implied dividend for PNC is 20 per cent below its last announced dividend.The volume of options trades on the regional banks has spiked to between four and five times the daily average in recent days.The sharp increase in such options bets comes after Ohio-based banks KeyCorp and Fifth Third both announced substantial dividend cuts and plans to raise capital. Bank analysts are now widely predicting that as credit costs continue to mount, other regional banks will not be far behind.Equity options prices suggest investors are betting on dividend cuts that will save banks around $22bn a year, according to Deutsche’s analysis of the 95 financial institutions listed in the XLF, XBD and BKX indices.Such fears have prompted sharp falls in the share prices of several regional banks in recent days. On Thursday, the sell-off pushed the BKX banking index to a five-year low, led by falls for Huntington Bancshares, SunTrust and Regions Financial.Shares of SunTrust, which on Thursday traded as low as $33.22, are at their lowest since 1996. Scott Valentin, analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey, said in a research note there was a lack of positive catalysts to support a turnround in SunTrust’s shares due to “uncertainty surrounding ultimate credit costs and the sustainability of the dividend, along with SunTrust’s lack of desire to sell the company at the current depressed valuation”.BB&T, which had been as much as 12 per cent lower on Thursday on fears it might cut its dividend, recovered in late trading after the bank said it still expected to make some increase to its dividend in 2008. Options markets had been betting the bank would cut its dividend by up to 27 per cent, according to Deutsche.Once beloved by investors for their generous dividend yields, regional banks have in recent months come under growing regulatory pressure to cut back on pay-outs to shareholders and bolster their balance sheets with fresh capital.Fifth Third on Wednesday slashed its dividend by two-thirds and said it planned to raise $2bn of capital in preferred shares and through asset sales. KeyCorp said last week it planned to raise $1.5bn and slashed its quarterly dividend in half.National City raised $7bn in May from outside investors led by Corsair Capital, the buy-out firm.
41;KEY;Keycorp;2008-06-19T03:22:24Z;Fifth Third in cut to weather credit losses;;Fifth Third Bancorp on Wednesday joined a string of Ohio-based banks seeking to bolster capital levels against growing credit losses.The bank cut its dividend by two-thirds and said it planned to raise $1bn of preferred stock, citing “continued deterioration” in credit trends during the second quarter, conditions that were “unlikely to improve” in the near-term. Fifth Third also said it hoped to raise another $1bn by the end of the year through the sale of “non-core” businesses.The bank’s shares closed 27.3 per cent lower, and prompted a rating downgrade for the lender from double A to A.Kevin Kabat, the bank’s chief executive, said: “We expect these actions to enable us to weather further depreciation in home prices as well as a significant weakening in economic activity.”Three other Ohio-based institutions have been forced to raise capital or slash dividends to bolster balance sheets hit by mortgage-related writedowns or credit charge-offs. Ohio has a high rate of foreclosures as the housing slump has been compounded by its declining manufacturing industry.Fifth Third had been widely expected to boost capital levels with a dividend cut and capital raising, particularly since the bank had the highest dividend yield of large US banks – 13.41 per cent before the cut.Mr Kabat said: “We recognise our dividend payments are important to our shareholders. This is a time where retaining more of our earnings is appropriate.”KeyCorp said last week it planned to raise $1.5bn and slashed its quarterly dividend in half. National City raised $7bn in May from outside investors led by Corsair Capital, the buy-out firm. The company has also cut its dividend twice this year. Huntington Bancshares raised $500m of preferred stock in April to bolster its capital.Consolidation amongst US regional banks, which many industry sources feel is warranted in “overbanked” states such as Ohio, has not yet materialised, partly because of accounting and regulatory issues.If a competitor buys a struggling bank, accounting rules require the buyer to mark down the target’s lending portfolio to market prices, which could wipe out most, or all, of the value of its equity.Regulators would also generally not allow a buyer to touch the target’s portfolio until the deal is completed. That could leave a purchaser with no way to stanch its target’s losses for months after a deal is announced and could force a buyer to mark down the value of the target’s portfolio for a second time once a deal closes.
42;KEY;Keycorp;2008-06-13T04:07:06Z;KeyCorp plan to raise $1.5bn upsets investors;;Shares in KeyCorp plunged 24 per cent on Thursday after the US bank announced plans to raise $1.5bn in equity and halve its stock dividend.The measures, devised to help buttress a balance sheet weakened by an adverse court ruling on taxes owed from its portfolio of leveraged leases, troubled investors already concerned that the Ohio lender had under-estimated its exposure to the US housing market.The shares, which fell 10 per cent on May 28 after the company doubled its loan-loss forecast, have lost 49 per cent of their value this year.KeyCorp will issue common shares and convertible preferred stock to pay for the accounting charge and help maintain its capital ratios. Facing slack demand for financial shares, the lender’s common stock offering is likely to be priced below Thursday’s close of $11.98, a person familiar with the offering said.KeyCorp will take an after-tax charge of as much as $1.2bn to second-quarter earnings to account for a steeper tax bill on some of its leveraged leases and litigation costs incurred during its battle in the federal court.The company is weighing whether to appeal against the court’s decision.“If it had not been for the adverse court ruling on our tax treatment of a leveraged lease transaction, we probably would not have considered the capital-raising actions,” said Henry Meyer, KeyCorp’s chief executive.“But the ruling forced our hand and prompted the decision to build on our strength with a capital raise, one that we think not only is prudent in light of the economic climate, but also is an appropriate move as we look to the future.”Nevertheless, regional US lenders have faced mounting pressure from regulators and investors alike to bolster their balance sheets amid the lingering housing slump and deteriorating economic conditions.On Tuesday National City confirmed that it had entered into a “memoranda of understanding” with federal officials in April and May stemming from concerns about the fellow Ohio-based bank’s risk-management standards and liquidity. The lender raised $7bn in capital to help shore up confidence in its finances.The actions by KeyCorp and National City may put pressure on a third Ohio lender, Fifth Third Bancorp, to take similar steps.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the regulators that could bring enforcement action against National City, said on Thursday its annual survey of national banks revealed that commercial- and retail-lending standards had tightened for the first time in four years.The bank will trim its full-year dividend to 75 cents a share, ending a streak of 43 years of annual increases to the pay-out.The dividend cut will save the company about $200m a year.Additional reporting by Francesco Guerrera and Julie MacIntosh in New York
43;KEY;Keycorp;2008-06-12T20:42:38Z;Wall St gains trimmed by oil rally;;"Wall Street stocks bounced back on Thursday as investors cheered takeover bid news and some better-than-expected retail sales data, but a late rally in oil prices pared gains at the close.In a largely positive day of trading the mood was barely dented by news that Lehman Brothers, the embattled investment bank, had replaced Erin Callan and Joseph Gregory, its chief financial and chief operating officers, respectively.On Monday, Lehman spooked markets by pre-announcing a second-quarter loss and raising $6bn to help it survive the credit crunch. Its share price has been under siege ever since and has lost over 30 per cent of its value in the past week.Lehman shares fell 4.4 per cent to $22.70 but the news proved cathartic for the broader financials sector, which rallied as much as 3.6 per cent before falling back slightly to close 2 per cent higher.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 0.3 per cent higher at 1,339.87 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent at 12,141.58. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,404.35.Wall Street had fallen sharply on Wednesday as financials resumed their relentless downward path and technology stocks came under selling pressure after a key industry group cut its sales outlook for semiconductors.Thursday, however, began in upbeat fashion after InBev, the Belgian brewer, said it had offered $46.3bn in cash for Anheuser-Busch. InBev plans to fund the unsolicited bid with $40bn of debt, highlighting that bank financing remains available for the right deals.Anheuser jumped 5.2 per cent to $61.40 and the news lifted the consumer staples sector 0.6 per cent.Consumer-facing stocks more generally received a boost from a dip in oil prices and the latest retail sales data for May. According to the Commerce Department last month, retail sales rose twice as fast as forecast, spurred on by tax rebates.At present, consumer spending remains weak but has not entirely capitulated, thanks in part to the rebate cheques – a key part of President George W. Bush’s economic stimulus package.Among retailers, Office Depot rose 5.5 per cent to $12.53, Limited Brands added 3.3 per cent to $17.72 and Kohl’s gained 3 per cent to $43.88. The consumer discretionary sector advanced
0.7 per cent.Still, observers warned that the stimulus from the rebate cheques would not last forever.Lehman Brothers analysts said: “We expect the rebate to boost spending over the next few months. But we expect it to be temporary, acting like a shot of caffeine by boosting growth in the third quarter but pushing growth to negative territory in the fourth quarter as the caffeine kick fades.”Moreover, the macroeconomic news was not all good and gains were limited by a bump in the number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits.But it was the unlikely rebound in the banking sector that hogged the spotlight. Citigroup rallied 3.5 per cent to $19.89, JPMorgan added 2.4 per cent to $38.01 and Bank of America rose 2.1 per cent to $29.44. An index of investment banking stocks gained 2 per cent.Earlier in the day, strategists at Morgan Stanley upgraded financial stocks from underweight to neutral, arguing that lower interest rates and a correction in property prices had improved fundamental conditions, while banks were deleveraging.KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, was the exception, slumping 23.7 per cent to $11.98 after the bank said it would cut its dividend and raise $1.5bn after losing a tax case that will result in a second-quarter charge of as much as $1.2bn.Technology stocks were in focus on Thursday after Yahoo said it had ended all talks with Microsoft. Yahoo shares plunged 9.8 per cent to $23.59 but the sector held its ground as Microsoft advanced 4.1 per cent and Google popped 1.4 per cent to $552.95 on speculation it would step in and partner with Yahoo.In industrials, Cummins, the maker of heavy-duty truck engines, stood out, soaring 9.9 per cent to $69.38 after rival Caterpillar said it would pull out of a key market segment.Energy was one of the few sectors to cede ground, falling 1.8 per cent in spite of the rise in oil prices. ExxonMobil fell 1.2 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips lost 1.7 per cent to $92.49."

Goldman analysts said share prices were relatively inexpensive while high oil prices might boost earnings.The sector has massively outperformed the broader S&P 500, adding 8.3 per cent compared with a 7.3 per cent decline. ExxonMobil, Conoco-Phillips and Hess added 2.6 per cent to $89.07, 3.3 per cent to $95.24 and 2.9 per cent to $127.47 respectively.Those gains helped markets skim past news of record losses at Lehman Brothers and comments from Fed officials that higher interest rates might be needed to curb inflation.The KBW banking index set new multi-year lows, while the S&P 500 index of financials fell 2.3 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,361.77 points; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent at 12,280.32 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,459.46 points.On Friday the Dow Jones suffered its biggest one-day fall since February 2007 as equity markets were hit by surging oil prices and a jump in the unemployment rate that pointed to continued recession-like conditions in the US economy.Some analysts argued that this was an over-reaction and stocks seesawed between gains and losses in afternoon trading.There were bright spots. McDonald’s rose 4.1 per cent to $59.31 after the fast-food chain said it had made gains in May same-store sales due to strong international demand. That did not stop the wider sector from falling 0.1 per cent.New data that showed a surprise rise in pending home sales in April helped improve sentiment. According to the National Association of Realtors, the index of pending home re-sales rose 6.3 per cent to 88.2, the highest level in six months. That too had a limited impact and an index of homebuilding stocks slipped 0.9 per cent.Energy and materials stocks were leading gainers, up 2.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Alcoa rose 7.5 per cent to $42.17 after Barron’s said the aluminium producer could rise markedly in value to $60 a share if it were to become a takeover target, citing a Citigroup analyst. Monsanto rose 2 per cent to $138.45 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 2.2 per cent to $118.26.Banking sector travails curbed those gains. Lehman, the smallest of the leading investment banks, said it lost $2.8bn in the second quarter and that it would raise $6bn in new capital.Fitch, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Lehman, while its peer Moody’s lowered its ratings outlook for the brokerage. Lehman, which has lost more than half its value in the past year, fell 8.7 per cent to $29.48, striking a 52-week lows before recovering slightly. The news hit the financial sector, which is reeling from the protracted fall-out from the subprime mortgage crisis.Merrill Lynch fell 3.2 per cent to $37.76, JPMorgan lost 6.4 per cent to $37.51 and
Citigroup slid 2.3 per cent to $19.60. A UBS note suggesting Washington Mutual would suffer $21.7bn in mortgage losses through 2011 crushed the banks’ share price, while earnings downgrades for Fifth Third Bancorp and KeyCorp weighed on their stocks.WaMu slipped 17 per cent to $6.25, Fifth Third Bancorp edged up 0.2 per cent to $16.78 and KeyCorp fell 3.8 per cent to $16.65.In the past few weeks analysts have slashed earnings estimates for the financials sector with the result that according to Thomson Reuters the consensus estimate is for a 45 per cent decline in the second quarter.Technology shares slipped in spite of a positive note on the sector from Lehman.Apple led the fallers, off 2.2 per cent to $181.61 as investors took profits after the company unveiled a new and cheaper iPhone. Google slipped 1.6 per cent to $557.87 while Intel fell 1.8 per cent to $22.49.According to Thomson Reuters, tech is expected to achieve the second-highest earnings growth rate among leading industry sectors in the second quarter of 2008."
45;KEY;Keycorp;2008-05-28T22:57:28Z;KeyCorp plunge sparks fears for smaller lenders;;Shares of US regional banks slumped Wednesday after KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, doubled its forecast for loan losses and prompted concerns that small US banks may have underestimated the cost of the housing slump.KeyCorp plunged 10.4 per cent, and was down as much as 12 per cent in intraday trading, after the bank said in a regulatory filing that it might have to write off up to 1.3 per cent of its total loans this year.It said that second-quarter and potentially third-quarter net charge-offs could be even higher than the new estimate, citing exposure to residential homebuilders, education and home improvement loans. KeyCorp’s revision to its loan loss estimates is its second in as many months.The news dragged shares of other regional banks lower amid concerns that similar revisions could be looming elsewhere as US house prices continue to fall, putting pressure on all housing-related loans, many of which have stayed on regional bank balance sheets.“Things are going to get significantly worse before they are going to get better for KeyCorp and the banking industry,” said Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets in a note to clients.Shares in Regions Financial, the largest bank in Alabama, fell by more than 5 per cent, Texas-based Comerica fell by 3.8 per cent, and Cincinatti-based Fifth Third fell by 3.58 per cent.The selling pushed the BKX banking index to a five-year low in intraday trading, before it recouped some of its loss to close 1.7 per cent lower.KeyCorp said last year that it would exit troubled lines of business such as lending to homebuilders and dealer-originated home improvement loans outside its regional base in areas such as Southern California, Arizona and Nevada.However, such loans remain on KeyCorp’s books and have been the epicentre of losses for the bank.Rising credit problems have caused many US regional banks substantially to increase their provisions to cover loan losses, as declining home prices have spread credit deterioration beyond subprime mortgages and complex structured mortgage assets to affect prime mortgages, home equity and residential construction exposure. The pace of losses in these asset classes accelerated in the first quarter.David Hendler, banking analyst at CreditSights, a research company, said: “The current credit cycle has been surprising in the pace and severity of deterioration, with banks repeatedly caught off guard by the rapid increases in credit quality deterioration.”
46;KEY;Keycorp;2008-05-28T20:41:19Z;US stocks climb in volatile session;;Wall Street stocks climbed for a second session on Wednesday, after a stop-start day of trading that featured bad news from regional banks, a lurch in oil prices that boosted related stocks but trimmed advances elsewhere and a steady rally in materials.A drop in crude prices initially sent markets into positive territory, a trend reinforced by data showing an unexpected rise in orders for core durable goods in April.By mid-afternoon in New York, oil prices had made an abrupt U-turn, retracing earlier declines. This combined with a sell-off in financials to forestall the positive momentum - but only temporarily.A rally in materials stocks, which followed some commodity prices higher, helped kick the broader equity markets back into the black in late afternoon.By the end of the day, materials had added 2.8 per cent, breaking a four session loosing streak and powering to their biggest one day gains in a month.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,390.87, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 0.4 per cent at 12,594.03. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,486.70.On Tuesday, falling crude prices and some post-holiday cheer helped markets bounce back from their biggest weekly fall in three months. The momentum carried investors through another round of dismal housing statistics and a survey showing languishing consumer confidence.The consumer discretionary sector held onto narrow gains on Wednesday, adding 0.4 per cent thanks to decent results from American Eagle Outfitters and Polo Ralph Lauren.American Eagle shares, which have lost 36 per cent of their value over the last year, clawed back 8.1 per cent to $18.61.Polo Ralph Lauren surged 11.7 per cent to $69 after the clothing brand reported an unexpected increase in fourth-quarter profit, helped by its new line for JC Penney and sales in Europe.Expedia also made ground, advancing 4.7 per cent to $22.75 on speculation that chairman Barry Diller might attempt to take the internet travel agency private.Despite pockets of outperformance, the picture for retailers remains bleak. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, weekly chain store sales stalled last week as gasoline prices continued to drag on consumer spending.Investment banks were in the spotlight again on Wednesday after JPMorgan became the latest brokerage to cut its earnings estimates for the sector, citing Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley in particular.JPMorgan analysts argued that less effective hedges, slowing client activity and yet more write-offs would hurt results. The group advised investors to steer clear of the sector.The sector swung between gains and losses during the day before settling up 0.4 per cent. Lehman slipped 1 per cent to $36.84, hit also by suggestions it might need to raise more capital, while Goldman and Morgan added 0.5 per cent to $174.83 and 1.3 per cent to $42.77 respectively.AIG, the insurance group, was among the sector’s biggest fallers, dropping 4.7 per cent to $34.91 after a Citi analyst suggested it might need more capital on top of the $20.3bn it has raised.Regional commercial banks also came under pressure after KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, doubled its forecast for loans that are unlikely to be repaid.KeyCorp slumped 10.4 per cent to $19.66 and was followed down by Regions Financial and Huntington Bancshares, which dropped 5 per cent to $18.08 and 4.9 per cent to $9.04 respectively.Commercial banks, as measured by the KBW index, have lost over 12 per cent of their value since the start of the month and are down about 37 per cent since their highs in February 2007.Energy-sensitive stocks such as carmakers swung from profits to losses as energy prices rebounded above $130. Ford fell 0.3 per cent to $6.78 while General Motors lost 1.6 per cent to $17.15.The volte-face in oil prices also helped energy groups overturn early losses and snap a four-session losing streak. Chevron rose 0.8 per cent to $100.42, ConocoPhillips added 2.1 per cent to $92.56, while the sector as a whole rose 1.5 per cent.In materials, Ashland, Allegheny Technologies and Monsanto were among the leading gainers, advancing 5.2 per cent to $58.19, 5.1 per cent to $76.73 and 5.3 per cent to $125.32.

The sector slipped 1.5 per cent in early trading, led down by Liz Claiborne, which fell 6.7 per cent to $18.24 and Jones Apparel, which dropped 5.7 per cent to $16.68.The sector was not helped by the latest Reuters/University of Michigan index that showed consumer confidence this month slumped to the lowest level in 28 years.Financials also proved a weak spot, slumping 1.7 per cent after Merrill Lynch analysts recommended selling regional banks and Nobel Prize winner Myron Scholes said the worst of the credit crisis may not be over.KeyCorp and Regions Financial led the sector lower, dropping 5.1 per cent to $23.80 and 5.4 per cent to $20.16, respectively.By lunchtime in New York, the benchmark S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent to 1,416.66 yesterday but up 2.1 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent lower at 12,904.32 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,512.90.The technology sector was notably active this week. Hewlett-Packard, started the ball rolling on Tuesday when it tabled a $13.9bn deal to buy Electronic Data Systems. HP shares fell 5.2 per cent to $46.60 over the week while EDS was among the weeks leading gainers, rising 29 per cent to $24.33.Equities were surprisingly jaunty this week and markets are on course for their best performance since mid-April. Of the leading S&P 500 industrial groups, the energy and material sectors were the standouts, adding 3.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively.Earnings from retailers that were not as bad as feared and the stimulating prospects of government rebates played a part in that rally. Consumer discretionary stocks added 3.1 per cent over the week.On Wednesday, Macy’s reiterated its annual forecasts, in spite of tough trading conditions, and saw its share prices bounce. That picture of weak but better-than-expected results has been a hallmark of the first- quarter earnings season and some analysts expect the pattern to sustain equity markets.Analysts at UBS said: “We think the S&P 500 should continue rallying from here as investor’s price in resilience and sustainability in earnings.”The outlook for financials is less rosy. Meredith Whitney, at Oppenheimer, slash- ed her earnings forecasts for brokers this week, citing accounting changes, weakness in the capital markets and reduced revenues.But over the week, financial stocks rose 0.8 per cent on the back of some positive news. On Wednesday, for example, Freddie Mac posted a smaller-than-expected loss.In the background, the saga surrounding Yahoo and its decision to reject a take-over offer from software giant Microsoft trundled on.Yahoo is now fighting efforts by billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn to replace its board and force the company back into negotiations with Microsoft. Over the week, Yahoo shares rose 7.3 per cent to $27.80 and Microsoft shares added 2.2 per cent to $30.05.Homebuilders were also in focus as dismal data and earnings from the sector continued to pour out.But stocks maintained their composure, taking solace from news of efforts in Congress to address the housing slump.

48;KEY;Keycorp;2007-10-21T18:21:45Z;US loan default problems widen;;Poor quarterly results from banks across the US over the past two weeks suggest credit problems once confined to high-risk mortgage borrowers are spreading across the consumer landscape, posing new risks to the economy and weighing heavily on the markets.US banks have raised reserves for loan losses by at least $6bn over the second quarter and by even larger amounts from last year, indicating financial executives believe consumers will be increasingly unable to make payments on a variety of loans.Banks are adding to reserves not just for defaults on mortgages, but also on home equity loans, car loans and credit cards.“What started out merely as a subprime problem has expanded more broadly in the mortgage space and problems are getting worse at a faster pace than many had expected,” said Michael Mayo, Deutsche Bank analyst.“On top of this, there is an uptick in auto loan problems, which may or may not be seasonal, and there is more body language from the banks that the state of the consumer was somewhat less strong [than thought].”Dick Bove, analyst at Punk Ziegel, said bank earnings indicated “there are problems with consumer debt that extend beyond the well-known issues in the real estate markets. Auto loans are clearly a new area of concern”. At Wachovia, the fourth largest US bank by assets, credit loss provisions more than doubled from the second quarter to $408m.Troubled loans that could turn into losses also more than doubled. Ken Thompson, chief executive, said the housing market could remain weak through next year. Wachovia’s poor earnings fuelled a stock market rout on Friday.Problems can be seen at banks across the US. At KeyCorp, in Cleveland, non-performing assets rose $241m from last year and loan-loss provisions doubled. In Dallas, Comerica’s loan loss provisions tripled from last year to $45m. Net credit losses jumped from $663m last year to $892 at Wells Fargo, in San Francisco, due to home equity and car loan losses. Loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing increased to $5.53bn from $3.66bn last year.“There has been a fast sea-change in thinking,” said Rick Klingman, interest rate trader at BNP Paribas. “Stocks are showing some real concern about bank earnings and there are worries about credit in general.”Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie in New York
