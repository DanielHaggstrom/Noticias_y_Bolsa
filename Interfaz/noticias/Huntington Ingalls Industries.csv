0;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US navy carrier contract steams in circles as cuts hit defence;;Sequestration budget cuts have bitten for the first time into one of the US defence department’s most critical procurement programmes, after the navy delayed the award of a contract for its next aircraft carrier, possibly for up to a year.Instead of awarding the detailed design and construction contract for the USS John F. Kennedy, the second carrier in the latest Gerald R. Ford class, the navy said it was extending a preliminary construction preparation contract with Huntington Ingalls, the Virginia-based warship builder.The preliminary contract is intended to allow Huntington Ingalls to complete some of the most time-consuming early stages of construction work on the vessel and keep its supply chain in place, without committing the navy to paying the full costs of building the vessel.The Pentagon has previously sought to protect some of the biggest, longest-term programmes from the effects of the across-the-board spending cuts, which came in to force from March 1.These programmes include aircraft carrier and submarine programmes, the F35 fighter and the air tanker programme. The Pentagon has instead sought to concentrate cuts on less vital areas, such as ground fighting vehicles.The sequestration cuts – agreed as part of the negotiations over the raising of the US debt ceiling in 2011 – cut nearly every defence department budget by 10 per cent.The delay to the award reflects both the defence department’s desire to reduce year-by-year spending on some big programmes, as well as a new focus on cost-effectiveness.The US’s Government Accountability Office on September 5 published a report criticising the cost increases on the first vessel in the Ford class, currently under construction at Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News yard, the only shipyard in the western hemisphere capable of building nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The Kennedy is currently scheduled to cost $11.3bn.There have been concerns that, if production on the critical projects were slowed, it would push up the costs of each aircraft or ship because workers would be laid off or supply chains disrupted.This extension will help ensure that the fragile supplier base and our shipbuilders remain workingHowever, the navy said the extension to the preliminary contract would prevent such a costly break and allow the yard to implement cost-cutting measures. The step would neither delay the carrier’s scheduled entry into service in 2022 nor put up the project’s overall costs.“Extension of the construction preparation contract will not impact the ship’s funding profile, ship’s delivery date, or the cost cap,” Thurraya Kent, a US navy spokeswoman, said.Huntington Ingalls said the delay would give it more time to find ways to stay within what it called a “challenging budget” for the Kennedy.“This extension will help ensure that the fragile supplier base and our shipbuilders remain working, minimising delay to ship delivery and associated cost increases,” the company said.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, think tank said there was no sign that the navy had “changed its mind” about wanting the Ford class carriers. The first work on the Kennedy started in 2010, while the Ford – on which work started in 2005 – is scheduled for delivery in early 2016.“The navy is trying to find ways of saving money on the programme from year to year,” Mr Thompson said of the delay.
1;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2013-07-23T13:31:12Z;US spending cuts spell work for ship repair yard;;"About 10 miles south of the long line of aircraft carriers along Newport News Shipbuilding’s piers sits another flat-topped US warship. But, while Newport News undertakes the glamorous work of building the navy’s biggest vessels from scratch, the facility in the Elizabeth River, by the naval port of Norfolk, plays a different role. The yard – owned by the US arm of the UK’s BAE Systems – carries out repairs and refurbishment work on naval vessels; in this case, a large deck amphibious assault ship, sitting in its floating Titan dry dock.Such facilities can have far less confidence than Huntington Ingalls and other US contractors involved in large, long-term new procurement programmes about their future funding. Few of their programmes are allocated congressional funding several years ahead, as happens with aircraft carriers and other big, new items.Nevertheless, Bill Clifford, president of BAE Systems Ship Repair, insists the yard is in “the sweet spot” to thrive in the new, tighter budgetary environment.“The maintenance has to be done,” he says. “They could make a decision to slow down maintenance and upgrading, but you’re going to have to do the maintenance to keep those ships deployable, to keep those weapons systems up and running.”Erin Moseley, president of BAE Systems Support Solutions, doubts there will be significant fleet reductions that would take away work opportunities.“For the navy to make that kind of move – where they would just retire entire portions of their fleet – would require pretty significant review of what their mission is,” she says. “The question is, ‘How do we take the assets they already have and help them to extend their life?’”The yard is nevertheless vulnerable to the kind of short-term funding crises that have been a regular feature of federal budget-making in recent years.Mr Clifford also accepts that BAE will see some effects from sequestration, because of scheduled reductions in the navy’s fleet.“There already are ships scheduled for decommissioning,” he says.Yet such withdrawals and other cutbacks – which Mr Clifford says are already pushing some ships to spend longer at sea on each voyage – are themselves producing more work for his yard.“Those missions are going up from six to seven months to nine months,” he says. “Those ships coming back require more maintenance.”"
2;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2013-07-23T13:00:59Z;Defence contractors hopeful that big US programmes are safe;;"Contractors involved in some of the US military’s most sensitive and high-profile procurement projects are growing increasingly optimistic that some programmes could escape largely unscathed from sequestration spending cuts.The spared programmes would include those so complex, long-term or strategically important that it could prove nearly impossible to impose the spending cuts, introduced on March 1, meant to cut nearly every US defence budget item by around 10 per cent.Among the items that look likely to survive relatively unscathed are programmes to build nuclear-powered aircraft carriers at Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News Shipbuilding yard in Virginia, Boeing’s KC46A air tanker refuelling aircraft and Lockheed Martin’s F35 joint strike fighter.However, because many of the most complex items are paid for out of funds committed years in advance, it may take years for Defence Department policy in the area to become clear.Some further clarity may emerge this week when five big military contractors – Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Raytheon – all report second-quarter figures.Mike Petters, Huntington Ingalls’ chief executive, said sequestration’s near-term impact on his business was “fairly neutral” – but he accepted programmes might later be delayed slightly.“The intermediate impact is scheduling of future programmes could start to be impacted,” he said. “I think aircraft carriers, submarines and destroyers are the priorities. Everything else is in the mix of, ‘What can we do for the money we have left?’”Mr Petters’ view echoes that expressed by Phebe Novakovic, General Dynamics’ chief executive, at a Deutsche Bank conference in June.She said that in a “budget-constrained environment” mature, established “programmes of record” – those already fully established and properly funded – tended to do better than “high-risk, developmental programmes”.About 10 miles south of the long line of aircraft carriers along Newport News Shipbuilding’s piers sits another flat-topped US warship. But, while Newport News undertakes the glamorous work of building the navy’s biggest vessels from scratch, the facility in the Elizabeth River, by the naval port of Norfolk, plays a different role. The yard – owned by the US arm of the UK’s BAE Systems – carries out repairs and refurbishment work on naval vessels; in this case, a large deck amphibious assault ship, sitting in its floating Titan dry dock.Continue reading“So, to the extent that the department has some discretion in how they apply their reductions, you’re likely to see the programmes of record doing better and booking rates should be unaffected,” she said.Another figure in the sector pointed out that Pentagon officials had recently made supportive statements about the F35.Loren Thompson, a defence analyst for the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said it was “quite possibly true” that Huntington Ingalls’ key aircraft carrier and nuclear attack submarine programmes would largely escape cuts.Mr Thompson also predicted the F35, the DDG-51 destroyer, the air tanker and Boeing’s MV-22 Osprey rotorcraft would largely escape cuts, thanks to their strategic importance and the costs of modifying the programmes.Several defence contractors have already warned they expect sequestration to hit this year’s revenues at their services arms. Unlike long-term procurement programmes, for which funds are allocated years in advance, services tend to be paid for out of present-year budgets.Light armoured vehicles of the kind used heavily in Afghanistan are expected to become a far lower priority, following the US military drawdown there.F-35: Lockheed MartinThree branches of the US military – the marines, air force and navy – plan to buy some of the 2,443 F35s on order from Lockheed Martin, in a programme whose total cost is now expected to reach $1.5tn. The aircraft’s centrality to the US’s future defence plans, and the challenges in further adjusting it, are expected to leave it largely intact.KC-46A Tanker: BoeingThe tanker aircraft, being built by Boeing and based on its 767-200 commercial aircraft, is critical to replace the air force’s existing tanker fleet and preserve the reach of the air force’s other aircraft.Gerald Ford class aircraft carriers: Huntington IngallsIt takes around 11 years to build each $5bn aircraft carrier, from first steel-cutting to entry into service. US legislation also requires the navy have 11 operational at any one time, although only 10 are currently available. The carriers’ vital role in securing the US’s strategic position – and the complexity of altering the order – makes it likely the programme will survive with only some slowing.Virginia-class attack submarines: Huntington Ingalls and General DynamicsThe nuclear-powered attack submarines have a vital strategic role.DDG51 Destroyers: Huntington Ingalls and General DynamicsThe destroyers are expected to play a vital role in missile defence and other key strategic initiatives.MV22 Osprey rotorcraft: BoeingThe MV22 is considered vital to the marines’ ability to airlift troops over long distances. Equipped with two large rotors and wings, it operates like a helicopter when taking off or landing but swivels its rotors and converts itself into a faster, more fuel-efficient fixed-wing aircraft when travelling long distances.Programmes expected to sufferAbrams Tank: General DynamicsThe US Army, which is currently parking some tanks currently not needed, wants to stop production of the tank but has so far been ordered by Congress to keep building the vehicles.Bradley Fighting Vehicle: BAE SystemsThe programme is also threatened because of the number of vehicles already in service.Joint Light Tactical Vehicle: manufacturer not yet selectedThere has been speculation that the JLTV – intended to replace the Humvee as a battlefield vehicle – could be cancelled because of sequestration and the need to focus on other priorities."
3;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2013-07-23T12:36:53Z;Long-term work shields Newport News shipyard from US defence cuts;;"It is hard, when visiting the Newport News shipyard, in the Virginia town of the same name, to square the scene with the gloom widely predicted for military contractors following the start of deep, indiscriminate defence spending cuts earlier this year.The streets in the shipyard – so big it has its own railway, fire brigade and road names – teem with vehicles and workers going to and from the scores of buildings. The site, owned by Huntington Ingalls, remains Virginia’s biggest industrial employer, with 22,000 workers, well above its post cold war lows.But, from the office of Mike Petters, Huntington Ingalls’ chief executive, overlooking the yard, it becomes clear why the company and a handful of other key US military contractors are relatively unconcerned about the effects of sequestration, which mandates that nearly all US defence budget items must be cut by about 10 per cent.At one end of the yard, employees are still working on an aircraft carrier – the USS Gerald R Ford – on which work started in 2005. Further down, work is under way to “inactivate” the 52-year-old USS Enterprise, the country’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which needs its nuclear reactor and other sensitive equipment removed. Next to it, work is under way to overhaul and refuel the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a Nimitz class aircraft carrier built in 1986.The long planning horizons for such work mean that Huntington Ingalls and a few other key companies on big, sophisticated, long-term projects are still working with money set aside by the US Congress as much as eight years ago.“It’s not a this year effect,” Mr Petters says of sequestration. “It’s not even a this year or next couple of years effect. It’s more of a medium to long-term effect.”However, the question that looms over Huntington Ingalls as surely as the vast crane over the Gerald Ford is whether the tougher budget environment will eventually catch up with its work. It remains unclear whether military services will seek to make cuts solely in less high-profile programmes and spare aircraft carriers and other key programmes – or cut 10 per cent from all procurement programmes across the board.“The question is, ‘How does the navy buy 90 per cent of a ship?’” Mr Petters says.Even before sequestration, spending was falling following the US’s withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan, which many analysts expect to hit sales of some types of ground-fighting vehicles – a speciality of BAE Systems and General Dynamics. Some programmes might, however, be boosted by the US’s shift in strategic focus towards being able to fight a war in the Pacific, which is expected to ensure continued demand for the warships that Huntington Ingalls, General Dynamics’ Bath Iron Works and others manufacture.All the decisions, meanwhile, are being taken against the background of continued political disagreements over budgets in Washington. Arrival at Newport News of the Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier due to undergo $2.6bn of refit and refuelling work, was delayed because of Congress’s initial failure to agree a federal budget for 2013, which meant the money for the project was at first unavailable.About 10 miles south of the long line of aircraft carriers along Newport News Shipbuilding’s piers sits another flat-topped US warship. But, while Newport News undertakes the glamorous work of building the navy’s biggest vessels from scratch, the facility in the Elizabeth River, by the naval port of Norfolk, plays a different role. The yard – owned by the US arm of the UK’s BAE Systems – carries out repairs and refurbishment work on naval vessels; in this case, a large deck amphibious assault ship, sitting in its floating Titan dry dock.Continue reading“We did find ourselves in a predicament,” says Mr Petters, who adds that the stand-off was eventually resolved – and the vessel delivered – in time for the issue not to affect the shipyard’s revenue for the year.The key to understanding the future impact of the myriad budget changes under way is that sequestration – introduced in legislation that ended the crisis over the US’s debt ceiling – was intended to be so irrational that all involved would find an alternative means of putting the US’s public finances back into order.The Pentagon is consequently faced with trying to make rational procurement choices based on a law intended to be irrational.“There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty around US defence spending and the impacts of sequestration,” says Northrop Grumman, another significant contractor, which declines to speculate on how its programmes might be affected.Huntington Ingalls executives expect the Pentagon to protect the key programmes and relegate other equipment to what it calls “the scrum” of less strategically important equipment. Huntington Ingalls could suffer from cuts to programmes to build amphibious assault ships, which it makes at the second of its two shipyards in Mississippi. But continued protection for the most strategically sensitive ships would leave it in an unusually strong position compared with rivals.It is “quite possibly true” that the company will continue to evade serious cuts in its biggest programmes, says Loren Thompson, defence analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.“Huntington Ingalls is the only major defence contractor that’s currently talking about margin expansion,” he says.However, Mr Thompson predicts there will, if sequestration continues, eventually be slowdowns even to the highest-profile programmes. Mr Petters agrees there could be slippage.“Sequestration might cause a programme to move from 2014 to 2015 or 2015 to 2016,” Mr Petters says.For the moment, however, the flow of work for the yard looks likely to remain strong.Next to the Gerald Ford’s dry dock, cut steel and other early components for the USS John F Kennedy, its sister ship, lie waiting. Work on that vessel started, with congressional funding, in 2011, even though no formal contract has yet been signed. Once the contract is signed, Newport News workers are expected to be busy with that vessel until at least 2021."
4;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2012-12-22T00:06:36Z;Defence cuts likely to hurt service providers;;The effect of defence spending reductions under the fiscal cliff package of cuts would fall more quickly on providers of services to the Pentagon than on weapons makers, analysts have said.Any cuts for big weapons makers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman would probably be only about 2-3 per cent next year, said Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defence analyst.However, companies that offer day-to-day services to the Pentagon such as data processing would be more likely to see more immediate cuts, according to Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute.The men spoke as the Aerospace Industries Association, a lobbyist for military contractors, called for defence spending to be split from negotiations over the fiscal cliff mixture of tax increases and spending cuts that are set to come in on January 1.The Pentagon’s budget accounts for about half of the government’s discretionary expenditure – spending that is not mandated under fixed government programmes. As a result, defence budgets are set to fall 9.1 per cent next year, across all programmes, if the automatic spending cuts come into force.The complexities of the Pentagon’s $550bn annual budget mean that different programmes would be affected differently. The main division is between companies whose earnings come from Pentagon procurement budgets and those paid from short-term operational budgets. Procurement budgets set up for individual programmes tend to be set up to disburse funds over three years as weapons are ordered and manufactured.As a result, programmes such as Lockheed Martin’s F35 joint strike fighter are likely to feel the effect of the sequestration cuts only after three years, according to Mr McAleese.For naval shipbuilding, each procurement budget can be spent over as long as five years. That had “major application” for General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, two of the biggest operators of naval shipyards, Mr McAleese said.“It will be 2015 before they actually begin to feel the effects of a sequester,” Mr McAleese said.However, companies paid from “short-cycle budgets” – such as CACI, the information technology provider based in Virginia – would feel the cuts far more quickly. “Companies providing services such as data processing, logistics and accounting will feel a significant impact in the first year,” he said.The only operational budgets exempt from the sequestration cuts would be those that pay for continuing deployments such as in Afghanistan.Despite the exemption, Marion Blakey, chief executive of the AIA, attacked plans to implement the sequestering of defence spending.“Risking American lives and livelihoods for political leverage is wrong,” she said.She demanded that defence spending be decoupled from the other tax and spending issues under negotiation between the two political sides.“The victims of this political gamesmanship will be the warfighters who risk their lives to protect our country and the American workers who will start losing their jobs when this game implodes on January 2, 2013,” Ms Blakey said.
5;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2012-09-03T10:26:34Z;US military contractors – war horses;A tough battle that will not be won by financial engineers;The past decade or so has been a good time to be a contractor working for the US military or intelligence agencies. Between 2000 and 2010 the military budget grew 9 per cent a year, to about $690bn, faster than the budget as a whole or any of the big budget items besides Medicare. The Department of Homeland Security had a fiscal 2010 budget of $55bn, $15bn more than five years before.More recent years have been tougher. In 2010 both the secretary of defence and the CIA director went on record in the Washington Post voicing serious concerns about how many key jobs were being filled by contract employees. But the debate is not just over who should fight wars or collect intelligence. It is about how many soldiers and spies the country can afford. Hence the 2011 Budget Control Act and its threat of sequestration. If Congress is unable to agree to cut the federal budget by $1.2tn over 10 years, automatic cuts kick in next year with the axe falling heaviest on the military.Shares in the largest contractors that make the fanciest weapons systems – Raytheon, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin – have held up over the past few years. Smaller contractors that specialise in providing personnel and technical support have had a tougher time. L-3, SAIC, ManTech and CACI International have all lagged behind the wider market badly. SAIC announced last week that, in an effort to create shareholder value, it would separate its low-margin IT and services arm from its higher-margin technology solutions business. This follows two other separations of lower-value divisions by Northrop Grumman (it spun off Huntington Ingalls) and L-3 (Engility). Neither of the earlier moves has generated much in the way of outsize returns, as a recent Credit Suisse analysis shows. This industry faces a tough battle, one that will not be won by financial engineers.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
6;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2012-02-01T14:47:02Z;US defence cuts sink Northrop outlook;;Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, on Wednesday reported another drop in quarterly sales, reduced its estimated order backlog and forecast lower than expected earnings for 2012, pointing to continued US government spending restraints.For the three months to the end of December, revenues slipped to $6.5bn from $6.8bn in the same period a year earlier. Over the full year, sales dropped about 6 per cent to about $26.4bn.Between the end of December 2010 and the end of December 2011, Northrop’s order backlog dropped from $46.8bn to $39.5bn, as it adjusted its order measurement criteria to acknowledge that certain expected sales would not now occur.In recent years, defence contractors such as Northrop and Lockheed Martin have been struggling to cope with an increasingly tough market as their largest customer, the US defence department, cuts its spending in order to help bring down the US budget deficit.Last week, the Pentagon gave its first detailed insights into how it intends to trim about $500bn from its budget plans over the next decade, indicating that it would cancel one version of Northrop’s Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle.Northrop has been particularly aggressive in reshaping its business in response. In 2011, it spun off its shipbuilding division as Huntington Ingalls Industries and the company said it had also cut back on volumes in its underperforming and non-core units.At the same time, it has worked to cut costs and improve productivity. Operating income from continuing operations rose about 18 per cent to $799m in the fourth quarter and margins increased in three of its four units.Net income rose 46 per cent to $548m, giving earnings per share of about $2.09, although the results were flattered by certain charges relating to debt redemption in the prior year.“Fourth-quarter and full-year results demonstrate our progress in achieving superior operating performance and effective cash deployment. Our businesses drove higher operating income, earnings, cash and a strong book-to-bill ratio for the quarter,” Wes Bush, chief executive of Northrop, said in a statement.Mr Bush said that in 2012 the company expected to achieve profit from continuing operations of between $6.40 and $6.70 a share on sales of between $24.7bn and $25.4bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of $6.82 a share on sales of about $26.1bn.“Our 2012 guidance reflects our continued commitment to performance, affordability for our customers and strong cash generation. While we are in a challenging environment, we believe that we can continue to create value,” Mr Bush said.“The pattern continues – defence revenues light, defence margins strong,“ Rob Stallard, with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. “With volumes heading down and the customer tightening the terms, we shall see how long this situation can last.”Northrop shares, which have lost about 14 per cent of their value in the past year, were up 1 per cent to $58.65 on Wednesday morning in New York.
7;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2011-07-28T18:49:06Z;L-3 plans spin-off of units to boost growth;Defence group under pressure from activist investors;L-3 Communications, the US defence electronics and services company, is to spin-off its consulting and training units to shareholders in the latest move by a contractor to shed slow growing segments amid declining military budgets.The spin-off comes in response to a weak performance in 2010, characterised by contract losses and a falling stock price, and pressure from activist shareholders which have urged management to aggressively pursue divestments or even to split the company up.In June, Relational Investors, an activist investment fund run by Ralph Whitworth, revealed a 6 per cent stake in L-3 and said it had spoken to senior executives about the company’s underperforming stock price and “suboptimal business mix”.Michael Strianese, L-3 chief executive, said the spin-off was the best option because it would improve the growth rate of the remainder of the company, end conflicts of interest between offering consulting services and selling products and it is likely it would be tax-free.A number of defence companies have spun off or sold divisions in recent months as they rejig their portfolios to cope with the stark prospect of declining US defence budgets, and demands for cheaper products and services from the Pentagon.In 2009 Northrop Grumman sold its consulting unit to two private equity companies for about $1.7bn in cash and earlier this year it spun off its shipbuilding business to shareholders as Huntington Ingalls Industries.“We are creating two very strong companies and shareholder value will follow that” Mr Strianese told the Financial Times, dismissing suggestions that the plans were too timid after a year-long review. “The market reaction has been very positive.”L-3 shares, which have climbed about 12 per cent over the year to date, rose about 4 per cent to $82. When the spin-off completes in the first half of 2012 L-3 expects to receive a dividend of up to $650m from the sale by adding debt to the new entity.The divestments will leave L-3 with revenues of about $13.5bn and four main divisions, providing aircraft modernization and maintenance, electronic systems, intelligence and surveillance systems, and cyber security services to federal agencies.But growth for the company remains ellusive. On Thursday, L-3 reported second quarter results showing a 5 per cent decline in sales to $3.8bn as contract losses in 2010 and contract delays in 2011 took their toll. Profit rose 6 per cent after certain tax benefits.Engility – as the new company will be known – also faces an uphill struggle. It will have about 10,000 employees, sales of about $2bn and operating income of about $179m, but its revenues are declining as the US military withdraws from Iraq and Afghanistan.Engility provides linguistic services, defence-related training and software development to the US military. Executives in its operations argue that as an independent entity it will be able to bid for “hundreds of millions of dollars” of work that it is currently barred from by conflicts of interest within L-3.L-3 has a long history as a buyer and seller of companies. It was built in the 1990s and early 2000s by the late Frank Lanza, a former top Lockheed Martin executive, who scooped up dozens of niche defence companies orphaned by a wave of mega-mergers in the sector.Since Mr Lanza’s death in 2006, however, the rate of acquisitions has fallen dramatically, although it remained a favourite with investors until a difficult year in 2010, when the company was hit by the drawdown in Iraq and Afghanistan and its stock fell about 19 per cent.
8;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2011-04-27T18:20:03Z;Northrop Grumman earnings beat estimates;;Northrop Grumman’s first-quarter earnings beat estimates and the company raised its guidance, saying it is confident about the future in spite of the looming threat of Pentagon cutbacks.The defence and aerospace group reported a solid quarter with a 13 per cent rise in net income in the first three months of 2011 as higher margins offset a decline in sales.The company also expressed confidence about the future, boosting its annual earnings per share outlook to $6.50 -$6.70 from $6.40-$6.60 and raising its quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, a 6.4 per cent increase from the previous quarterly dividend.Net income for the quarter came in at $530m, or $1.67 per diluted share. This was up from $469m, or $1.34 per diluted share in the same period last year and ahead of the $1.56 expected by analysts, leaving shares up 0.7 per cent to $62.95.Northrop completed the spin-off of its shipbuilding unit Huntington Ingalls Industries in the quarter, which helped earnings due to the $1.4bn received by Northrop as a result of the move.“This was a very productive quarter. We completed the shipbuilding spin-off and our newly aligned portfolio generated solid financial results,” said Wes Bush, chief executive officer and president.Sales were in line with market expectations but were down $200m to $6.7bn from the same period a year ago. Revenues were hit by the company’s reduced participation in the Nevada National Security Site joint venture and the US government’s continuing resolution funding.The Nevada National Security Site is a test site used to determine the viability of the United States’ nuclear arsenal. It is run as part of a joint venture between Northrop Grumman, Aecom, CH2M Hill and Nuclear Fuel Services.Operating margins climbed to 12 per cent from 9.8, helping to offset the decline in sales. The group also announced a $4bn share repurchasing programme.“Northrop had a respectable quarter with margin improvements on lower revenues,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets, adding that the stock was trading a forward price to earnings ratio of around 8.9 times, which is below the average multiple of 9.2 times for the sector.Cash provided by continuing operations in the quarter totalled $112m compared with $452m in the first quarter of 2010.New business awards for the 2011 first quarter totalled $5.3bn, bringing total backlog to $43.7bn as of March 31, 2011. Total backlog also included a $1.7bn reduction due to the reduced participation in the Nevada National Security Site joint venture.
9;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
10;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2011-03-15T22:16:00Z;Northrop nears spin-off of shipbuilding arm;;Northrop Grumman, the US defence contractor, moved a step closer on Tuesday to spinning off its shipbuilding unit after the board approved the transaction and set a deadline of the end of the month to complete the deal.Stockholders will receive one share in the new company, Huntington Ingalls Industries, for every six Northrop shares they own. The standalone company could have an enterprise value of about $2.5bn, according to Barclays.Northrop faces concerns about the deal from its main customer, the US Navy. The service said it was still reviewing the spin-off.Admiral Gary Roughead, chief of naval operations, earlier this month said he wanted to be sure that the “financial foundations” of the new entity were solid in order to minimise any risk that it might not be able to deliver on contracts.“I need stability in shipbuilding,” he said. “We are a very fragile industrial base when it comes to shipbuilding and so how [the spin-off] plays out is of paramount importance.”The Navy has no formal oversight but its influence as the main buyer is considerable.To fund the spin-off, and a $1.4bn payment to Northrop to cover outstanding inter-company loans and the loss of future earnings, Huntington has taken on about $1.9bn of debt.Analysts at Barclays estimate that Huntington’s equity could be worth between $800m and $1bn, but they note that the company has no publicly traded shipbuilding peers, which could hurt valuations.Northrop began to explore strategic alternatives for its shipbuilding unit last July, following a strategic review by Wes Bush – who took over as chief executive at the start of 2010 – in which he decided to dispose of less profitable businesses.Without the yards, Northrop will look much more like its rival, Lockheed Martin. It will generate much of its $28bn revenues from aerospace programmes, such as the F-35 fighter jet, and the rest from electronics, information systems and intelligence work.Northrop shares, which have climbed about 13 per cent in the past six months and outperformed the rest of the industry for much of the past year, slipped about 1 per cent to $65.87 in midday trading.As a standalone shipbuilder Huntington will have $6.7bn of sales and a backlog of $17.3bn. The unit is the sole supplier of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers to the Navy, including the USS George HW Bush, the last of the big Nimitz-class ships, and one of only two US makers of submarines.But Huntington faces considerable challenges. The unit is closing its yard in Avondale, Louisiana, due to poor performance and a lack of future work, and the Navy’s shipbuilding budget is under pressure.
11;HII;Huntington Ingalls Industries;2011-02-09T23:24:26Z;Pentagon will not support big defence mergers;;The Pentagon will not support mergers between the largest US defense contractors and will carefully examine any divestments that create “weaker standalone” companies, as the industry adjusts to a new era of flat spending, according to the top procurement official.Speaking at an investor conference in New York on Wednesday, Ashton Carter, under-secretary of defence for acquisition, outlined the Pentagon’s approach to a broadly anticipated wave of deals.The policy sets the department of defence on a very different course from the one it charted in the 1990s when its budget fell after the cold war ended. Back then, the secretary of defense urged the industry to consolidate at a dinner, known as “the last supper”, leading to a rush of mergers.While Mr Carter acknowledged the parallels and that defense spending is again under pressure, he said things were different this time and that preserving competition remained a priority for the department and the Obama administration.The DoD he said, was “not likely to support further consolidation of our principal weapons system prime contractors” and would carefully scrutinize all deals to make sure that they were in the long-term interests of the “taxpayer and warfighter”.Still, Mr Carter emphasized that the Pentagon both expected, and welcomed, smaller deals and would for the most part “rely on normal market forces to make the most efficient adjustments to the defense industrial base.”Mr Carter also took aim at portfolio restructuring by major contractors in what appeared to be a sideswipe at Northrop Grumman, the contractor which on Wednesday confirmed that it was moving ahead with plans to spin off its shipbuilding business.In cases where spin-offs might lead to “weaker standalone firms less likely to thrive without the necessary capital structure that their larger parent company is able to provide”, the Pentagon would demand particular transparency, he said.In 2010 Northrop said that it would divest its shipbuilding unit, built up through a series of acquisitions earlier in the decade, after concluding that it no longer fit with its core businesses, building planes and electronic systems.The company has already registered a “spinco” under the name Huntington Ingalls Industries, with the stock ticker, HII, although discussions with the Navy continue and a final move requires board approval.On Wednesday Northrop reported fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations of $376m, or $1.27 a share, compared with $413m, or $1.31 a share, in 2009. Sales slipped 3 per cent to $8.6bn and Northrop said revenues would be flat in 2011, excluding shipbuilding.Over the last two years the Pentagon has grappled with the prospect of flattening and possibly declining budgets as politicians look to rein in the federal deficit, cancelling a number of programmes and developing a $100bn efficiency drive.For their part, defence companies have been bracing for slower revenue growth and further contract delays – an environment that analysts see as likely to spur deal making. Acquisition activity picked up in 2010 and Fitch, the ratings agency, expects more deals and more portfolio reshaping in 2011.
