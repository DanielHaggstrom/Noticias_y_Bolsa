Accusing the defendants of “countless attempted delays and diversions”, the organisation praised the judge for allowing the trial to go forward.“Now it’s time, through the bellwether trial for Summit and Cuyahoga counties, to shed light on the actions of the remaining opioid defendants in that litigation [that is] opioid distributors and a manufacturer — in the first federal trial that begins on Monday,” it said in a statement.Opioid makers and distributors are facing mass litigation from US states, counties, and cities seeking to recoup some of the costs of the crisis, which has led to mounting healthcare and law enforcement bills. Two million Americans are suffering from opioid use disorder, according to the Center for Disease Control, and the outbreak of overdoses has contributed to a drop in US life expectancy.The companies, which all deny responsibility for the crisis, did not respond to requests for comment.Shares in the defendants fell in after-hours trading in New York. Teva Pharmaceuticals, the only remaining manufacturer, fell 1.6 per cent to $7.38, after losing 3.5 per cent during the trading day. Drug distributor stocks also dropped: Cardinal Health lost 3 per cent to $50.02, McKesson fell 3.1 per cent to $147.56, and AmerisourceBergen was down 1 per cent to $89.64.Other opioid makers were also brought lower by the news. Even though they have settled the cases with these particular bellwether counties in Ohio, they face other lawsuits related to the crisis.Endo International, which settled these cases for about $10m, was down 2.4 per cent to $4.76, and Mallinckrodt, which settled the two cases for about $30m, fell 3 per cent to $2.66. Johnson & Johnson, which settled with the two counties for $10m, was up slightly after-hours, after losing 6 per cent to $127.70 during the day, due to investor concerns about a recall of one batch of its talcum powder.Judge Dan Polster met with executives from the defendants on Friday, in an attempt to form a deal before the trial starts on Monday. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the week that the distributors had offered about $18bn to settle, while The New York Times said the deal would include the distributors, Teva and Johnson & Johnson, and would be worth about $50bn in cash and addiction treatments.As well as the total value of the deal, the sides have been debating over what period the payments should be made and the split between cash and in-kind payments.
1;CAH;Cardinal Health;2018-06-29T17:10:17Z;Amazon’s unparalleled power over markets;When the US internet retailer sneezes, entire industries catch cold;By spending $1bn, Amazon made $14bn disappear. The money that went missing was not Amazon’s, though. That sum was the loss in market value at the biggest players in US drug distribution and retailing, after Amazon announced on Thursday that it would spend that billion to buy online pharmacist PillPack. Shares in those six companies (Walgreens, Boots Alliance, CVS Health, Express Scripts, Cardinal Health, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen) had been depressed last year by the very suggestion that Amazon was coming into their territory. Proof positive trimmed their values by as much as 10 per cent.It is hard to think of any other company in the modern era that could have that kind of impact on a market that it is not even in yet, just by the industrial equivalent of clearing its throat — not even IBM, General Electric, or Microsoft in their heydays.And yet the market is not overreacting. Amazon’s success in colonising other branches of retail, and even some big non-retail businesses, justifies the wariness. What is more, there are good reasons for everyone to be grateful that Amazon has such tremendous power.The business of getting pharmaceuticals to consumers is complicated, capitally intensive, and surrounded by regulatory barriers to entry. As a result, the big companies that dominate it — distributors, pharmacy benefit managers, and retail pharmacies — face limited competition and have opportunities to extract economic rent. This is exactly the kind of situation where Amazon thrives: investing prodigiously, pricing aggressively, and offering customers better service. Where Amazon goes, margins compress and stock prices fall. The corollary to that is that consumers pay less — and not just at Amazon itself. In 2015, Walmart, by far the biggest retailer in America, was forced to concede that in the era of Amazon its old margin structure was simply impossible to maintain. It would have to cut prices, improve service at its stores, and produce lower profits. It was forced, in other words, to do better by its customers.The main reason that Amazon can have this impact is that its investors do not expect it to make much profit. Concluding (with some reason) that Amazon is the company of the future, shareholders bid up the stock despite razor-thin margins. This is what allows Amazon to invest so heavily in both intellectual property and hard assets — it spent $34bn on technology, content, and capital expenditures last year.So: Amazon competes hard and invests heavily, just the things that make capitalism work as it should. Worries that Amazon is a threat to competition — and many people do worry about this — may therefore seem quixotic. The concern is that when the Amazon steamroller has flattened the industrial landscape, it will be free to raise prices and, more importantly, either crush or buy out any innovative rival to its established franchises.To waive this away on the grounds that one day a new competitor will unseat Amazon, just as Amazon unseated Walmart, seems naive. Amazon has not only a huge edge in physical infrastructure, as Walmart once did. It also enjoys technological network effects to rival Microsoft’s and a trove of consumer data that would make Mark Zuckerberg blush.For now, most of us reap the benefits of Amazon’s unprecedented market muscle. But there may come a moment when the balance shifts, and Amazon’s size and power do more harm than good. The really scary possibility is that, after years as happy customers, we may not even recognise that moment when it arrives.I want to keep real shops, particularly bookshops / From Antony Black, Dundee, UK
2;CAH;Cardinal Health;2017-11-16T12:56:20Z;Pharmacies are set for a big dose of Amazon;A complex, opaque and concentrated market could use a shake-up;One can only admire Amazon’s ambition. It expands into ever more distant parts of the retail landscape: industrial supply, streaming video, groceries, fashion. It provides supply-chain services to other retailers. It operates physical stores. It is the biggest cloud services company in the world. When an experiment fails — as its foray into mobile phones did — its appetite for future ventures is undiminished.It is surprising, then, that Amazon has not already dug into the US pharmacy market. It is a more highly regulated market than any of Amazon’s current markets. That aside, though, it has several features that put it right in Amazon’s sweet spot. It is heavy on both digital and physical logistics: getting the right drug in the right amount to the right person at the right time, with little room for error, is the essence of the industry. The business is dominated by a few companies that make very respectable returns, an invitation for Amazon’s characteristic undercutting strategy. And it is very, very big.Amazon has only gone as far as meeting with a few industry figures and hiring a few executives in the field. This alone has been enough to set the industry on edge.The US pharma value chain has four links. At the top are drugmakers themselves who (for the foreseeable future) have little to fear from Amazon. Then there are the pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which have three roles: negotiating drug prices with manufacturers, processing pharmacy benefit claims, and operating home-delivery pharmacies. Next are the wholesalers, who physically distribute drugs to pharmacies and hospitals. Finally come the retail pharmacies.The PBM, wholesale and retail pharmacy industries are all highly concentrated, after decades of unchecked consolidation. Three PBMs, Express Scripts, Caremark and Optum Rx, control three-quarters of that market, according to Barclays’ research. The first is an independent company valued at $44bn. The latter two are owned by CVS Health, the largest US pharmacy chain, and UnitedHealth, the biggest health insurer, respectively. Unsurprisingly, the industry boasts strong returns. Express Scripts’ percentage return on invested capital is in the mid-teens, well above Amazon’s level, and it earns about $5 in operating profit for every prescription it processes.There are three dominant wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health, with a total market value of $77bn. They distribute 90 per cent of the drugs sold in the US. The two largest retail pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, have almost 18,000 outlets between them and control half of the market. At both the distributors and the pharmacies, returns on capital are, again, solidly ahead of Amazon’s.Join us on November 21 for a conversation about the lessons the global HIV epidemic has had for other areas of medicineIf Amazon shook up this cozy industry, competing profits away while improving service — as it has in other parts of retail — consumers would have reason to be thankful. All the middlemen say they are fighting to keep drug prices low, but drug price inflation continues to outstrip consumer price inflation more broadly.There is just one little question. At what point do we stop thanking Amazon for the invigorating competition it brings to one industry after another, and start worrying about a single company dominating so many industries? At its current rate of growth, Amazon will be selling more stuff than Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, in less than a decade. Today, as Amazon expands, it makes the economy more competitive, and consumers benefit. It would be naive to think that pattern would persist forever.This article has been amended since it was first published to correct the owners of Caremark and Optum Rx

5;CAH;Cardinal Health;2017-09-11T18:02:44Z;US seeks a fix for its opioid addiction;States struggling to cope with the overdose epidemic are suing companies and distributors;"The bodies keep piling up at the coroner’s office in Dayton, Ohio. “Our cooler space is constantly maxed out,” says Kent Harshbarger, coroner for Montgomery County. “It’s directly linked to the opioid epidemic — there’s no doubt about it.”Twice this year, Dr Harshbarger’s facility has been so full that he has considered renting refrigeration units elsewhere. At this rate, he expects to carry out autopsies on roughly 1,800 overdose victims from 30 Ohio counties in 2017, more than double last year’s total.When he qualified as a forensic pathologist in 2001, Dr Harshbarger had been trained how to handle mass transport accidents, natural disasters and pandemic outbreaks. “But nothing like this, not a drug overdose epidemic of this size,” he says. “All those other things have an end point, but this is going to be prolonged for years.” To cope with the demand, he has started working extra hours and taken on 12 staff, including six pathologists, forcing him to seek an increase in funding from local officials.The price of dealing with the increase in overdose deaths is just one line in an ever-expanding list of costs associated with the US opioid epidemic, which was last month declared a national emergency by President Donald Trump. More than 183,000 Americans died from an overdose involving a prescription opioid between 1999 and 2015, and the number of annual fatalities has quadrupled over the same period, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The government agency estimates that roughly 2.6m people are now addicted to drugs derived from the opium poppy. The statistics understate the true scale of the epidemic because many victims die not from prescription drugs but from illegal opioids such as heroin, which they tend to switch to after becoming hooked on painkillers. The CDC says there were 33,000 such fatalities last year, helping turn drug overdoses into the leading cause of death among the under-50s. Government statistics suggest the total for last year could be higher still. Police forces say they need more resources to deal with overdoses and drug-fuelled crime, hospitals and health centres are stocking up on naloxone, a pricey antidote that can cost up to $470 per injection, and local government agencies are spending more on treatment and rehabilitation centres. Ohio alone says it spent almost $1bn last year fighting the epidemic.Faced with the prospect of raising taxes to fund the extra spending, local politicians have instead decided to try to recoup at least some of the money from those they blame for starting the crisis: the drugmakers that made and marketed the drugs, and the wholesalers and pharmacies that distributed them. In the past year, at least 30 states, cities and counties have either filed lawsuits against drugmakers and distributors or formally recruited lawyers using a process that tends to act as a prelude to full-blown legal action, according to a Financial Times analysis of court documents and government records.The attempt to hold companies to account has been likened to the legal action that US states brought against the tobacco industry, which resulted in a $200bn settlement in 1998. “It absolutely could be as big as tobacco,” says Jodi Avergun, a white collar defence lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, adding that overdoses now cause more fatalities than car accidents and gun homicides combined. Richard Ausness, a professor at the Kentucky College of Law, predicts all 50 states will launch legal action, along with “thousands of smaller entities like counties and cities”. The legal costs for the companies involved will be “very substantial”, he says.Law firms are offering to do the work on a “contingent fee basis” meaning their bill is paid by taking a large chunk, usually about a third, from any settlement or damages. If the legal action were to fail entirely, they would not be paid.Joseph Ciaccio, a lawyer at Napoli Shkolnik, says his firm is “meeting almost every day” with “county officials looking to be reimbursed for what they’ve spent, and to take the burden off the taxpayer.“We haven’t found a single place that hasn’t been affected,” says Mr Ciaccio, whose company is representing five counties that have launched lawsuits. Some legal actions target manufacturers. Others focus on distributors. Some take aim at both. For the most part, the plaintiffs argue that drugmakers used aggressive sales tactics to boost revenues from opioids while downplaying the risks, or that wholesalers and pharmacies did little to identify the large numbers of pills that were being diverted to black market dealers. Among the most commonly named defendants are drugmakers such as Purdue Pharmaceuticals, which is privately owned, Johnson & Johnson, Allergan, Mallinckrodt, Endo and Teva; distributors such as McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health; and drugstore chains such as Walgreens and CVS. All of the companies either denied the allegations or declined to comment, although many added that they recognised the severity of the crisis and wanted to play a role in its resolution. In a lawsuit filed in May by Ohio, which has become a template for much of the ensuing litigation, the state’s attorney-general alleged that drugmakers used “multiple avenues to disseminate false and deceptive statements” about which patients were appropriate candidates for opioids. Many pain experts say the drugs should only be used in terminally ill people or those suffering from acute episodes of pain, but drugmakers tried to market the pills to patients with chronic conditions like bad backs or necks, the lawsuit alleges. It points to advertising produced by Endo, which included images of people working “physically demanding jobs” such as construction site employees and chefs, the inference being that the company’s Opana ER drug was suitable for those with long-term pain complaints. The suit also claims that drugmakers spent large sums — almost $170m in 2014 — on sales representatives to convince doctors to use opioids for chronic pain, while paying fees to a “diverse group of seemingly independent experts” who touted the drugs at conferences and played down addiction risks. Americans died from an overdose involving a prescription opioid between 1999 and 2015Local authorities that have filed lawsuits against the drugs industry or hired lawyers to prepare legal action The value of the US prescription opioid market in 2016, according to Quintiles IMSEven after the decline in the number of smokers, the death toll from tobacco still far exceeds the numbers of people being killed by the addiction epidemic. There are around 480,000 fatalities each year related to tobacco, according to the CDC. But many believe that the financial impact of the opioid crisis — which would be a factor in the size of any damages or settlement — will end up being far greater. Whereas the cost of smoking was largely limited to medical bills, drug addiction is putting pressure on an array of public services, from children’s care to prisons and policing. “The nature of the injury is different,” says Mr Ausness. “If you get lung cancer, you don’t live for very long, but addiction might be a 20-year or more thing. In some respects it is more permanent.” Lawyers will have little problem proving that their clients are spending huge sums of money fighting the opioid crisis, according to Ms Avergun. “The costs are astronomical; they’re threatening to bankrupt many counties,” she says. But it will be much harder to show that pharmaceutical companies and distributors are to blame. Lawyers advising the companies say they believe the plaintiffs will struggle to prove that the actions of drugmakers — negligent or otherwise — were the primary reason or “proximate cause” of the epidemic. “There are lots of links in the chain,” says a lawyer working for one of the drugmakers. “Sure, the pharma companies designed, developed and marketed the drugs — but regulators approved them, doctors prescribed them and patients took them. To show proximate cause you have to explain that none of the other links made a contribution.”Ms Avergun agrees. “There is a giant causal gap,” she says. For that reason, a better analogy for the opioid litigation might be the largely unsuccessful attempts to sue gunmakers, according to Mr Ausness, because there are “several intervening elements between the producer and the victim”. Furthermore, many fatalities are not caused by people overdosing on prescription pills, but rather heroin laced with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 100 times more powerful than morphine. Even though roughly four in five heroin addicts say they first became hooked to painkillers, illegal drugs are one of the primary drivers of death and crime, putting some distance between drugmakers and the epidemic. “Unlike tobacco companies, our products are medicines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, prescribed by doctors, and dispensed by pharmacists, for patients suffering pain,” says a spokesperson for Purdue, adding that it “vigorously” denies the allegations but shares “public officials’ concerns about the opioid crisis”.Last week, Purdue filed a response to the Ohio lawsuit, arguing it should be dismissed because the FDA’s decision to approve the drug and safety warnings on the label meant the company could not be prosecuted under state law. Whether juries can be convinced that drugmakers are entirely to blame might turn out to be a moot point, given that lawyers predict the more likely result is an out-of-court settlement. “It would be remiss of us if we did not explore ways to end this early,” says a lawyer working for one of the pharmaceutical groups. “No one on our side is sitting here pounding the table saying ‘never settle’.” The main point of contention is the size of any settlement. Whereas the states and counties point to the undeniably high cost of the crisis, attorneys for the companies counter that the opioid industry is tiny compared with tobacco. Tobacco sales in the US generated $94.4bn last year, according to Euromonitor, the data group, whereas the prescription opioid market was worth $8.5bn, according to Quintiles IMS. Nor is there any certainty that drugmakers could fund a settlement anywhere near the size of the one paid out by tobacco companies in 1998. J&J, the largest company named in the litigation, has deep pockets, but it sold its opioid franchise in 2015 to Depomed, while Purdue does not disclose its financial results. The public companies that dominate the branded opioid industry — Endo, Depomed and Mallinckrodt — ended last year with aggregate net debtsof more than $14bn and have some of the highest borrowing levels in the pharmaceuticals industry. Senior US business correspondent David Crow selects the FT stories that explain America’s opioid crisisEven if the two sides could agree on a number, the lawsuits would have to be rolled up into a claim that could be resolved with a single “global” deal. Then the plaintiffs would need to agree on a formula for working out how the cash is divided up, based on the number of overdose deaths or prescriptions written. Lawyers from both sides say it is hard to judge how long it will take to resolve the litigation, although all agree it is likely to be years. In the meantime, Dr Harshbarger will continue sending local authorities the bills for autopsies on overdose victims. “My situation is kind of unique,” he says, reflecting that he is one of the few people to benefit — financially, at least — from the crisis. “As my workload has gone up, so has my income.”This article was updated on September 12 to reflect that CDC heroin usage rates in the graphic are measured per 1,000 peopleLawyers for the opioid makers are hoping they might be able to strike a “social settlement” over the epidemic, whereby they help to address the crisis by donating anti-addiction drugs and money without accepting legal responsibility. They point to a recent settlement of an antitrust case in Louisiana against Pfizer, which saw the pharmaceuticals group provide the state with 60,000 vials of naloxone, a drug that rapidly halts the effects of opioid overdoses. The medicine was worth a total of roughly $1m. The case brought by Louisiana’s attorney-general against Pfizer had nothing to do with the opioid epidemic, and instead alleged that the company had tried to stop the introduction of copycat generic versions of one of its other drugs. But one attorney for an opioid maker said it was an example of how drugmakers had the “resources and wherewithal” to respond to the epidemic, adding that the donation of drugs could be supplemented by offering resources to run addiction treatment centres. City officials say they intend to pursue legal action, adding the litigation is as much about deterring future misconduct as it is about raising cash. But some lawyers believe that the demand for immediate solutions could trump a legal victory or multibillion-dollar settlement. The money subtracted from any settlement to cover legal fees would be “directing resources away from people who need them”, says Jodi Avergun, defence lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. There is nothing to stop a policy settlement where a fiscal contribution is made in the form of a treatment centre or clinic or another entity.”"

One billion people are now being treated for at least one such condition each year, and strong progress is being made towards eliminating several of them — including lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.Mass drug administration, supported by donations from a dozen pharmaceutical groups, plays an important part in this success. Fresh innovation is needed to produce better medicines and diagnostics.

We are more in touch now with the situation in countries. The next level of difficulty is understanding sub-national data to help us concentrate on coverage and equity. In Pakistan, for instance, the use of phones to report on polio has raised vaccination rates. It’s not about science but simple management . . . Second, we have made our model country-facing, with joint appraisals on evaluation and technical assistance to ensure that governments are getting the best advice they need.Is there a risk of “vertical” vaccine programmes undermining health systems? I’m against vertical systems [those that focus on a particular approach or disease at the expense of a stronger overall health system] but universal health coverage is a vague veneer. I think Gavi is a pretty amazing story in the development space. Immunisation is one of the most cost-effective interventions and if you don’t have it, you don’t have a perfect health system. With vaccines, I see our goal as building the base of the primary healthcare system.What are your concerns about the future?It’s an important moment for our model, with lower-income countries becoming richer and “graduating” from our help. Overall they are doing quite well although there are a few problems in the commodity exporting ones which are “rich” but not really investing in social systems. Sometimes the problem is not about money but political commitment: the willingness, not the ability to pay. There is a question about what we do about new vaccines, and helping countries with shocks like refugees and drought.———-ChartwatchDrug donations Pharma companies provide more than 1.8bn treatments a year for neglected tropical diseases.

The group said on Tuesday it would sell the units that make its feeding tubes and compression machines for deep vein thrombosis, as well as a patient care business that manufactures dressings for wounds, syringes and other supplies.Medtronic is shedding assets following the completion of its almost $50bn acquisition of Ireland’s Covidien in 2015. The deal was one of the last major “inversions”, which allowed the company to reduce its US tax bill by moving its legal headquarters to Dublin.“We came to the conclusion that these products — while truly meaningful to patients in need — are best suited under ownership that can provide the investment and focus that these businesses require,” said Omar Ishrak, Medtronic’s chief executive.Mr Ishrak said Medtronic would allocate $1bn of the proceeds to buying back its shares and the remainder to reducing the company’s net debt of more than $29bn.Shares in Medtronic rose 1.89 per cent in premarket trading in New York to $81.88, giving the company a market value of more than $112bn.However, shares in Cardinal Health tumbled by more than 10 per cent, as the group warned investors its earnings this year would be at the lower end of a previously published range of $5.35 to $5.50 a share. Cardinal reported revenues of $121.5bn in its most recent fiscal year, which runs to the end of June. The company blamed weak performance at its unit distributing generic copycat drugs, which have been commanding a lower price amid cut-throat competition.Medtronic will hand over 17 of its roughly 90 factories to Cardinal Health as part of the sale of the medical businesses, which generated roughly $2.4bn in sales in the last four quarters. Medtronic’s total sales were $28.8bn in fiscal 2016, which ended last April.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningThe deal comes at a time of major upheaval in the medical devices industry as large players such as Medtronic, Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson each try to narrow their focus to compete with smaller operators that concentrate on a particular niche.In 2015, Cardinal Health acquired Cordis from J&J for about $2bn, adding a portfolio of medical devices, including catheters, filters and stents.Last year, J&J, the world’s largest healthcare company, said it would cut 3,000 jobs at its medical devices unit as part of a restructuring effort designed to save up to $1bn a year in costs.
8;CAH;Cardinal Health;2017-04-18T11:18:26Z;Cardinal Health to buy Medtronic units for $6.1bn;;Cardinal Health disclosed on Tuesday a deal to buy Medtronic’s patient care, deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency businesses for $6.1bn in cash.The units encompass almost two dozen product categories, which are “used in nearly every US hospital,” Cardinal said. They generated revenues of $2.3bn in the 12 months to the end of October 2016, with 70 per cent of sales coming from the US.George Barrett, Cardinal’s chief executive, said:We are thrilled about today’s announcement, as this well-established product line is complementary to our medical consumables business and fits naturally into our customer offering. For this reason, this product portfolio has been on our radar for many years.Cardinal said it will finance the transaction with $4.5bn in new senior unsecured notes and existing cash. The group’s shares fell by 7.1 per cent in pre-market trading. Medtronic rose 1.4 per cent.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
10;CAH;Cardinal Health;2015-03-02T16:28:04Z;GSK-Novartis deal ‘a model’ for industry;Pharma groups bet heavy on ‘precision M&A’;A $2bn disposal by Johnson & Johnson and the completion of a $20bn asset swap between GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis on Monday highlighted a push by healthcare groups to streamline their portfolios.J&J’s sale of its cardiovascular care business to Cardinal Health adds to the wave of dealmaking that has swept the sector over the past year as companies seek to offload unwanted assets while strengthening core areas.The GSK-Novartis deal is part of the same trend, with the UK group swapping its sub-scale cancer drugs business for its Swiss rival’s vaccines division, while the pair pooled consumer healthcare assets in a new joint venture. The deal was agreed last April but has taken almost a year to complete because of its complexity.Joe Jimenez, Novartis chief executive, said this kind of “precision M&A” marked a shift away from the mega-mergers of the past in which an acquiring company was often left with an unfocused and ill-fitting collection of assets.“I think this deal will be used as a model,” he told the Financial Times. “We were able to pick out the pieces that work for Novartis, and GSK was able to do the same. We are going to see great value creation through this deal.”Analysts said both the GSK-Novartis transaction and the J&J disposal were examples of how healthcare groups are narrowing their focus on those areas where they have the strength and scale to compete globally.The sale of Cordis, which makes medical devices such as heart stents, for $1.94bn in cash, marked J&J’s second big divestment in just over a year after selling a blood-testing business to Carlyle Group for $4.15bn.Gary Pruden, head of surgical products for J&J, said the latest deal was part of a “disciplined portfolio management approach” to focus resources on growth assets.For Cardinal, an Ohio-based health services group, the acquisition fits its expansion plans in cardiology as well as wound management and orthopedics.In another deal announced on Monday, Boston Scientific said it would acquire the urology portfolio of American Medical Systems for $1.6bn.M&A has been running at record levels across the healthcare sector as investors pressure companies to increase growth and efficiency while budget-constrained health systems around the world try to keep a lid on prices.A total of $57.5bn of healthcare deals have been completed so far this year, up 14 per cent from the same period of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data. More than two-thirds of this activity has involved pharmaceuticals companies.JP Morgan has been the most active adviser on healthcare deals, followed by Lazard and Morgan Stanley.Bankers say that, after huge deals such as Acatvis’s $66bn acquisition of Allergan and the $42.9bn takeover of Medtronic by Covidien in 2014, activity this year is more concentrated around mid-sized deals worth $1bn-$5bn.“M&A activity hasn’t slowed down,” said a senior pharma banker in New York. “If anything the activity has increased . . . the only difference is that many of the deals are smaller.”
11;CAH;Cardinal Health;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;BD/CareFusion: slowing to a drip;More to healthcare than tax avoidance;"There is more to healthcare dealmaking these days than tax avoidance. Yes, the tax element of recent pharma and medical device deals has attracted plenty of criticism. But the controversy has masked an important point: the economics of medicine are increasingly difficult, so the healthcare industry needs to cut costs wherever it can.Enter New Jersey-based BD with a plan to buy California-based CareFusion for $12bn. No cross-border activity here; no tax inversion. BD is best-known as a maker of needles and syringes and has an enterprise value of just over $20bn. It will pay 15 per cent of the price in BD shares. That mix will suit CareFusion – BD shares rallied 7 per cent on Monday.CareFusion, which was spun out of drug wholesaler Cardinal Health in 2009, makes intravenous infusion pumps for drug delivery. The companies estimate $250m in cost savings and believe BD’s international sales network (more than half its sales are abroad) could diversify CareFusion’s business away from the US (75 per cent of its sales).Within the US, the enlarged BD bulk should help it negotiate with hospital groups that are toughening up through consolidation of their own (according to PwC there was $20bn worth of hospital M&A in 2013). US healthcare spending inflation has been below 4 per cent for five years. Novel healthcare delivery methods, such as pharmacies offering medical clinics, are putting pressure on hospitals to cut back on the products BD and CareFusion provide. Recent deals among medical device makers include Zimmer/Biomet and Medtronic/Covidien (the latter is also a so-called tax inversion).And so tax-driven healthcare deals have not emerged from a vacuum. Rather they are a direct consequence of a stingier environment where companies are looking to cut any line item on their income statements. Expect more of the same.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex"
12;CAH;Cardinal Health;2014-02-11T19:31:06Z;CVS Caremark: no ifs, ands or butts;Kicking habit of cigarette sales makes business sense;"There was a cloud of smoke hanging over Tuesday’s earnings report for CVS Caremark. The US drugstore chain/pharmacy benefit manager last week said it would stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products by October to support the wellbeing of its customers. Since its 2007 tie-up with Caremark (the PBM that negotiates drug prices with insurance companies and employers), CVS has become more health provider than drugstore. Kicking the habit makes business sense then – and over time the company appears poised to offset the lost revenue and profit.Last year’s results reveal a company that is growing the top-line slowly, but proving that it can squeeze out more profits on the dollars it brings in. For 2013, revenue at the retail pharmacy segment increased by 3 per cent while operating profit rose by 11 per cent on cost leverage. The pharmacy services segment processed 2.4 per cent more prescriptions, but operating profit rose by 15 per cent. The company estimated it would lose about $2bn in revenue on an annual basis from tobacco shoppers (2013 revenue was $127bn), and about 17 cents a share in earnings. The impact for 2014 would be 6 cents to 9 cents; adjusted EPS is forecast at $4.36 to $4.50, the company has confirmed since the tobacco announcement. In a sign of investor confidence, shares rose by 3 per cent on Tuesday.Operating leverage bodes well when sales are threatened, but it raises some questions about how much more can be squeezed out. A good thing, then, that CVS Caremark stands to benefit over time from new US healthcare laws as more people move into the system. There are other offsets including a 10-year joint venture with Cardinal Health, which will form the largest sourcing entity for generic drugs in the US. At $69, the shares trade at 15 times forward earnings – in line with the market and, perhaps, relatively cheaper than that pack of smokes.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
13;CAH;Cardinal Health;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Boots and Walgreens add to pharma empire;Pharma partners in deal with AmerisourceBergen;Alliance Boots and Walgreens have added another element to their health and pharmaceutical empire in a deal to buy more drugs from – and potentially take a stake in – AmerisourceBergen, a US drug wholesaler.The deal gives Walgreens and Alliance Boots the option to build a stake of up to 23 per cent in AmerisourceBergen, worth $2.5bn, an example of vertical integration with a retail pharmacy becoming part-owner of a drug wholesaler.Walgreens will expand its existing drug-buying arrangement with AmerisourceBergen to a 10-year distribution deal worth $28bn, while ending its current relationship with Cardinal Health, a rival wholesaler.In June last year, the companies announced that Walgreens would take a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots, which is privately owned, in a £10bn deal. Walgreens has an option to acquire the rest of the company in about two years.Walgreens shares rose 5.4 per cent to $44.74 after the wholesale deal was announced on Tuesday.Cardinal made 21 per cent of its sales to Walgreens last year and its shares fell 8.2 per cent on Tuesday to $42.35.The deal gives Walgreens and Alliance Boots the right to purchase up to 7 per cent of AmerisourceBergen in the open market, with associated board representation. They can buy another 16 per cent at a later date.AmerisourceBergen shares rose 3.6 per cent to $50.06 on Tuesday.Stefano Pessina, executive chairman of Alliance Boots, took the group private in 2007 in a £12bn deal. Last year’s stake sale to Walgreens followed a long search for a transaction or partnership with a retailer or a pharmaceutical wholesaler in the US.“We are Alliance Boots, but we are also Alliance Healthcare, and we understand something about the wholesale [business]. AmerisourceBergen is a company very similar to Alliance Healthcare,” Mr Pessina said on Tuesday.“It remains an independent company but the collaboration will be very strong. We have done this for many years. We look at partnerships and collaboration with other companies.”Mr Pessina has continued to strike deals since the partial sale to Walgreens, spending £56m in September to acquire a 12 per cent holding in Nanjing Pharmaceutical, the fifth-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in China by sales.

The CBOE Vix index, which measures implied volatility on the S&P 500 and is dubbed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, has risen more than 25 per cent in the past two days, however it is still below long-term average levels.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks and is a price-weighted index, closed a fraction higher at 14,455.82, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3 per cent to 3,229.09.“The situation in Cyprus has brought a lot of uncertainty to the markets, as now there are different possible outcomes after their parliament votes on the bailout package, but none of them are good,” said Channing Smith, an equity strategist at Capital Advisors.“If they go ahead with levying deposits, then potentially depositors in other countries will lose confidence in the system and could cause bank runs. Such turmoil is potentially very damaging to the rest of Europe, especially in the south,” he said.Earlier, housing starts figures were in line with expectations, but the upward trend indicates continued strength in the housing market. US homebuilders attracted buyers with the S&P 500 subgroup at one stage up nearly 2 per cent, before easing to a rise of 0.1 per cent. The index has increased almost fivefold since bottoming in 2008.PulteGroup shares rose 0.3 per cent to $20.82, while DR Horton rose 0.3 per cent to $24.31. KB Home shares rose 3 per cent to $21.03.In deal news Walgreens, the largest drugstore chain in the US, rallied after the company and its partner, Alliance Boots, agreed to buy a minority stake in Amerisource Bergen. Under the deal, Walgreens and Alliance Boots will distribute pharmaceutical products made by Amerisource Bergen for the next 10 years.Walgreens shares rose 5.4 per cent to $44.74 and have gained 20 per cent since the start of the year.Shares in Amerisource Bergen also rallied 3.6 per cent to $50.06 on the news.Cardinal Health shares suffered, dropping 8.2 per cent to $42.35 after the pharmaceutical company said its contract with Walgreens to distribute its products would not be renewed after expiring on August 1.Lululemon, the maker of athletic and yoga clothes, was hit after recalling one of its most popular items – black yoga pants – after discovering that they were see-through. The stock fell 2.8 per cent to $64.08 as analysts thought the recall would dent revenues in the first quarter.Electronic Arts shares fell 8.3 per cent to $17.15 after the second largest video game publisher by market value replaced chief executive officer John Riccitiello and warned that fourth-quarter profits could fall below expectations.Iron ore miners suffered after Goldman Sachs analysts cut the price forecast, citing seaborne expansion projects, increases in China’s domestic ore production and an escalation of steel recycling. The downgrade follows similar warnings from Deutsche Bank a few weeks before saying iron ore prices face headwinds because of slowing demand for steel in China as well as an abundance of scrap metal.Shares in Cliffs Natural Resources, miner and producer of iron ore, fell 6.6 per cent to $20.33. The company has lost nearly half its market value since the start of the year.Downgrades from investment banks hit some shares on the S&P 500 index. Kohl’s fell 4.1 per cent to $46.56 after Morgan Stanley cut it to underweight and reduced its price target.Juniper Networks fell 5.3 per cent to $19.14 after its rating was cut to “sell” by analysts at Goldman Sachs who said increased competition, especially in its data centre equipment and security business segment, would undermine profits.
15;CAH;Cardinal Health;2013-02-14T22:05:48Z;Cardinal in $2bn AssuraMed home care deal;;US drug distributor Cardinal Health has acquired AssuraMed, a privately held home care company, for $2.07bn, as it hopes to capitalise on an ageing population and the increasing prevalence of chronic disease.The deal comes as remote care and home care become increasingly important because of incentives created by President Barack Obama’s healthcare law that aim to reduce medical costs.The home medical market is valued at $16bn and is growing at 7 per cent a year, according to Cardinal.“We know that in order for our nation to be prepared to deliver quality care to an ever-growing population of patients and to do so without stifling our economy, care will need to be delivered in the appropriate setting with the appropriate caregiver and with the appropriate protocols,” George Barrett, Cardinal chief executive, told analysts on Thursday.The deal, which is expected to close in April, is being financed with $1.3bn in new senior unsecured notes and cash. Cardinal shares rose 1.23 per cent to $46 on Thursday.AssuraMed had sales of $1bn last year and distributes more than 30,000 different medical products to more than 1m patients. It sells products for diabetes, insulin therapy, urology, wound care and incontinence.Cardinal will also use AssuraMed as a new channel to distribute its own products. “AssuraMed will significantly expand the scope of our partner relationships to include more than 1,200 payer contracts,” Mr Barrett said.The Cardinal deal comes amid a surge in merger activity this year. The total value of deals globally is up 14 per cent on the same period last year at $269.3bn, according to Thomson Reuters.Cardinal Health was advised by BofA Merrill Lynch. Clayton, Dubilier, & Rice and GS Capital Partners, which own AssuraMed, were advised by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.
16;CAH;Cardinal Health;2012-05-15T18:34:13Z;Cardinal bows to US drug agency;;US efforts to crack down on the illegal use of prescription pain pills have picked up pace as Cardinal Health, one of the country’s largest pharmaceutical wholesalers, agreed to suspend shipments from one its distribution centres.An investigation by the US Drug Enforcement Agency had found that 7.2m doses of oxycodone were distributed by Cardinal to two CVS pharmacies in a Florida city of just over 50,000 people during a three-year period.The DEA said the supply “grossly exceeded” the needs of the population and that the company missed obvious signs of fraudulent prescriptions.Florida has become the centre of the US “pill mill” problem and several recent arrests have highlighted the role doctors and pharmacists have played in the illicit distribution of prescription narcotics.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said deaths from prescription drug abuse have surpassed deaths caused by cocaine and heroin overdoses and have become more frequent than fatalities from car crashes.The settlement with Cardinal comes as the US has expanded its pursuit of global drug companies and distributors to stem the flow of addictive pain medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, which have become a leading cause of accidental death.A US Senate committee last week launched an investigation into the practices of drug groups such as Purdue Pharma, Endo Pharmaceuticals and Johnson & Johnson. The committee suggested the companies, which produce powerful pain drugs, have improper financial ties with doctors and hospitals and that “dubious” marketing practices could be behind the recent surge in deaths from painkillers.On Tuesday, Cardinal agreed to stop distributing controlled medicines from the facility in question for two years and to improve its “anti-diversion” procedures. Cardinal was not subject to a financial penalty under the settlement. The company said the DEA is not planning to take additional measures against its other facilities.“Cardinal Health will continue its efforts to help stop prescription drug abuse,” the company said in a statement.In 2008, Cardinal was fined $34m for selling hydrocodone to “rogue” internet pharmacies.A DEA spokeswoman had no comment on the settlement.CVS Caremark, a US drugstore operator, continues to face litigation from the US government, which argues that the company should have known that a large number of prescriptions for controlled substances were not for legitimate medical purposes.CVS was not immediately available to comment.

If it happens I don’t see them buying anyone else for a while,” Cai von Rumohr at Cowen and Company.UTC shares were up 0.1 per cent at $75.55.While defence stocks diverged, the rest of Wall Street suffered an almost uniformly dreary day. Every sector of the S&P 500 fell, as the benchmark index ended a five-day rally, and dipped back beneath 1,200 for large parts of the day.The index eventually ended the day down only 1 per cent to 1,204.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 11,401.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 2,612.83.“Bears have taken charge again for the moment,” said Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, as investor concern about a possible Greek default mounted once again. Cieszynski said traders was now looking to a specially extended two-day Federal Reserve meeting to reverse sentiment.“The street may look to more creative responses when the decision and comments come out on Wednesday afternoon,” he said.Big banks again saw heavy selling, with Morgan Stanley, down 7.9 per cent to $15.15 and bellwether regional bank Regions Financial off 4.8 per cent to $3.81.Online job search company Monster Worldwide fell 7 per cent per cent to $8.35, as recession fears hurt recruiters.Life insurers fell after rallying strongly last week. MetLife Inc fell 4.6 per cent to $31.51 and Genworth Financial fell 4.4 per cent to $5.89, in the process giving up almost all of its gains from last week.Investors continue to fear that record low Treasury interest rates and soft equity markets will hamper life insurers’ attempts to generate returns on premiums.In another sign of faltering sentiment, Barclays Capital, an investment bank that has maintained a bullish stance on the S&P 500 throughout recent volatility, advised clients to take a more defensive approach towards the index.“Following the early August 2011 sell-off, we positioned our sector recommendations to take advantage of what worked in the August 2010 rally. [Then] early to mid-cycle cyclicals outperformed …defensives underperformed,” US equities strategist Barry Knapp wrote to clients.But Mr Knapp conceded that “the leadership in the latest rally has had a decidedly defensive tone with utilities and healthcare leading the charge”.He told clients to remain “tactically tilted to cyclicals to take advantage of our expectation for a continued rally off the lows”, but to buy defensive dividend-yielding telecom stocks, which may be less correlated to the market in a further sell-off.Netflix fell 7.4 per cent to $143.75, after announcing it will hive off its DVD mail delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster.The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since announcing on Thursday that it expected 1m customers to cancel subscriptions because of a price rise for combined DVD and streaming services.Among the bright spots, shares in Tyco International advanced 2.4 per cent to $44.75, after the industrial conglomerate said that it would split into three separate companies to maximise value.Shares in homebuilder Lennar advanced 4.9 per cent to $14.47 after the company reported quarterly results, which showed a quarter-on-quarter increase in new orders and a growing backlog of contracts to be complete.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, saying the medical wholesalers were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, arguing saying the medical wholesalers are were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.

The move comes as foreign investment and consolidation of domestic drug producers intensifies in China, which is fast becoming one of the world’s largest markets for medicines.The people close to the transaction said Shanghai Pharma had signed up some cornerstone investors, including a commitment for $300m of stock from Temasek, the Singapore state investment agency.Pfizer, the US pharmaceuticals group, Guoco Group, the Hong Kong-listed investment manager, and Bank of China will buy a total of $250m of shares between them, according to marketing materials distributed to investors.About a third of the proceeds of the offering are expected to be used to acquire drug manufacturing facilities in China, where demand for medicines is rising rapidly along with gross domestic product.Most drug analysts expect China to become the world’s second-largest drugs market within five years. A report by Sinolink Securities in December said the revenues of China’s pharmaceutical industry could increase 20 per cent this year, with profits rising 25 per cent.The robust growth forecasts for the Chinese industry have attracted attention from foreign companies, including Cardinal Health of the US, which in December announced the completion of a $470m acquisition of privately-held Zuellig Pharma China, a leading healthcare distribution business.Shanghai Pharma’s acquisition plans would strengthen the company’s position in the fragmented domestic industry, which is facing pressure from the government to consolidate, according to the state-controlled media.The company distributes medicines throughout most of China and was the second-largest drug distributor behind Sinopharm Group in 2009, and the third-largest drug manufacturer according to a stock market filing. It is already in a partnership with Roche in China.Shanghai Pharma shares are halted from trading in Shanghai until its Hong Kong shares begin.The Hong Kong sale is being managed by China International Capital, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse.There was no comment from Shanghai Pharma or any of the banks or cornerstone investors.

Cardinal said the deal had been completed but it declined to comment further.Some buy-out groups backed away from buying Martindale owing to concerns for reputational risk from methadone and worries about profit margins as public spending cuts loom.Methadone, which generates a fifth of the company’s revenue, is a synthetic opiate given to about half of the UK’s 300,000 heroin addicts. The drug costs £3,000-£4,000 a patient a year.But the main source of profit is the production of specials, which are unlicensed products prescribed by doctors when a licensed product does not exist.Cardinal, which acquired Martindale as part of its £233m takeover of Intercare six years ago, is selling off several assets after deciding to focus on its medical products distribution and services business.AAC, which targets deals worth €50m-€500m (£42.5m- £425m), gained a new lease of life in 2008 when it spun out of ABN Amro after the takeover by Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander and Fortis.The Dutch lender’s three buyers sold its existing buy-out portfolio to Goldman Sachs, AlpInvest and the Canada Pension Plan. As part of that deal, AAC raised a new €950m fund from its former and new owners.That deal included investments in Volution, the UK-based maker of Vent-Axia ventilation and heating units; and Lucas Bols, the Dutch-based producer of liqueurs and spirits including Galliano and Bols.In the UK, AAC’s more recent investments include TGI Fridays, the chain of American-style diners; and Dunlop Aircraft Tyres, the maker of tyres for large commercial and military aircraft."
20;CAH;Cardinal Health;2009-10-11T09:03:18Z;Norwegian fund steps up campaign;;"This month, the world’s second biggest pension fund launched a campaign to drive widespread corporate governance reform in the US.Norges Bank Investment Management submitted four resolutions to four US companies calling on them to appoint new independent chairmen.The fund, which manages the $400bn (£250bn, €270bn) in assets in the Norwegian state pension fund and has invested $66bn in the US, is calling for a shareholder vote on separating the role of chairman from chief executive at Harris Corporation, Parker Hannifin, Cardinal Health Inc and Clorox.It has also voted against all chairmen who are also chief executives of about 700 US companies. This is just the beginning of the campaign, it says.Noteworthy, too, is that NBIM withdrew a fifth resolution to force Sara Lee, the food group, to appoint a separate independent chairman after Sara Lee’s board agreed it would split the roles of chief executive and chairman.Sara Lee promised that when the current chief executive’s tenure ends (at an unspecified time in the future), it would amend the company bylaws to ensure that it appointed a separate and independent chairman to steer the board.Anne Kvam, NBIM’s global head of corporate governance, says this followed “very constructive dialogue” and declared herself “very happy with the outcome”.Sara Lee points out there is a gradual shift taking place with more companies separating out the roles. A spokesman highlighted Senator Charles Schumer’s legislative proposal in a “Shareholder Bill of Rights” which would, among other reforms, require separation of the chairman and chief executive roles.Ms Kvam says many corporate governance reforms in the US, for example giving shareholders a say on pay or rights to nominate directors, require legislative change.Under Mary Schapiro, the chairman of the Securities and Exchanges Commission, there have been a series of reforms boosting shareholders’ powers to influence the composition of boards.But submitting proposals on independent chairs for a vote is the one reform that shareholders can achieve without the help of regulators or legislators, she says.The question is how much traction NBIM will get with other US companies. Some corporate governance analysts say change may be on the way, but it will not be fast.However, Ms Kvam says while this is the first time NBIM has entered the debate publicly, other groups have lobbied US companies to split the roles and shareholder support for these proposals has been rising steadily.She argues the time is ripe to step up the campaign in the wake of the financial crisis, which has put accountability and leadership of boards under the microscope.The pivotal moment came last April when shareholders in Bank of America voted to strip chief executive Ken Lewis of his title of chairman in protest at Mr Lewis’ decision to buy Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis. That changed the landscape on the independence of directors, she says.Nell Minow, from the Corporate Library, is reasonably optimistic, too. She says: “If [change] is proposed by a major shareholder with the expectation that the chairman will be a genuine outsider, yes, I do think it will get a lot of support.” And it could be the beginning of broader move to separate the roles and improve the oversight of boards, she says. “NBIM can leverage a lot of shareholder frustration and a widespread sense that this is a sensible, meaningful, but not disruptive
initiative”.Recent academic research suggests that – despite the criticisms that US shareholders lack the same rights they have in other jurisdictions – the implicit threat of legal action by investors often means companies move swiftly to reform when shareholders submit proposals.Bonnie Buchanan from Seattle University and other academics say in an empirical study of US and UK shareholder proposals: “After receiving a shareholder proposal, US firms are more likely to replace CEOs and separate the CEO and chairman positions.”The study also says although shareholders in the UK have greater powers to effect change, “US [shareholder] proposals have more positive effect on firm performance than UK ones”.NBIM’s work will not be easy. It estimates that just over half the top 1,500 companies in the US combine the role of chief executive and chairman. But Ms Kvam says having an independent chairman is
“essential”.Like many international shareholder groups, it argues that all companies should ensure there is a clear division between the responsibilities of chairman and the chief executive.The chairman’s job is to set strategy and remuneration policy and hire executives, keeping shareholder interests centre stage.The job of the chief executive is to execute strategy and run the company. When companies combine the role they risk
concentrating too much power in one individual, say corporate governance experts.“The roles of chairman of the board and CEO are fundamentally different and should not be held by the same person,” said Ms Kvam."
21;CAH;Cardinal Health;2009-10-09T08:59:37Z;Sara Lee to separate executive roles;;Sara Lee, the US food and household goods group, has bowed to pressure from one of the world’s largest pension funds and agreed to separate the role of chairman and chief executive.After talks with Norges Bank Investment Management, Sara Lee’s board said it would recruit an independent chairman when Brenda Barnes’ tenure as head of the group ends.A Sara Lee spokesman said the group had responded to NBIM’s request in the light of a slow but growing trend in the US towards splitting the role of chairman and chief executive.NBIM, which manages $300bn of Norway’s central bank assets, making it the world’s second largest retirement scheme, this week launched a campaign to persuade a series of US companies to separate the chairman from the chief executive role.NBIM is calling on Harris Corporation, Parker Hannifin, Cardinal Health Inc and Clorox to split the roles of chief executive and chairman. It has also voted against all chairmen that are also CEOs of about 700 US companies.It, like many corporate governance activists, argues that the two roles are different and should not be held by the same person. All companies should ensure there is a clear division between the responsibilities to ensure a balance of power, it says.NBIM estimates that about half of the top 1,500 companies in the US combine the role of CEO and chairman.NBIM started its campaign by submitting proposals to four US companies calling for a shareholder vote on the appointment of an independent director to chair the boards.It withdrew a similar resolution calling for a shareholder vote at Sara Lee’s annual meeting on October 29 after the food group agreed that it would recruit an independent chairman.Anne Kvam, NBIM’s global head of corporate governance, says this followed “very constructive dialogue with the board of Sara Lee and [we] are very happy with the outcome”.No leaving date has been set for Ms Barnes, who has been chairman-chief executive of Sara Lee since 2005 and is taking the group, which is best known for its frozen gateaux, cheese cake and coffee, through a five-year period of restructuring to focus on its core food and beverages business and cut costs.Last month it agreed to sell its personal care business, which includes Radox bubblebath and Brylcreem, to Unilever for €1.27bn ($1.9bn) in cash. The US group is looking at further sales of its household goods business in the next few months.The decision to sell its household business, which contributed some 17 per cent of Sara Lee’s total revenues of about $13bn, comes as the group moves ahead with its “transformation” plan initiated in 2005.
22;CAH;Cardinal Health;2009-10-07T22:55:10Z;Norges seeks reforms in US governance;;The world’s second-biggest pension fund has started a campaign to drive corporate governance reforms in the US by submitting resolutions to four US companies to appoint new independent chairmen.Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the $400bn in assets in the Norwegian state pension fund, is calling for a shareholder vote on separating the role of chairman from chief executive at Harris Corporation, Parker Hannifin, Cardinal Health and Clorox.“The roles of chairman of the board and CEO are fundamentally different and should not be held by the same person,” said Anne Kvam, NBIM’s global head of corporate governance. “There should be a clear division of the responsibilities between these positions to ensure a balance of power and authority on the board. This is a fundamental principle of good corporate governance that we seek globally.”The proposals mark the start of a drive by Norway’s central bank fund to shake up corporate governance in the US, in which it has $66bn invested and where companies frequently combine the two roles.Ms Kvam said NBIM wanted to “step up the heat” on US companies to split the chairman and CEO roles and would submit more proposals next year.She added that it was a good time to raise the temperature of the debate following the financial crisis, which has put accountability and leadership of boards into the spotlight. “Resolutions like ours have been getting more support,” she said.The landscape changed in the US last April when Bank of America shareholders voted to strip chief executive Ken Lewis of his title of chairman in protest at his decision to buy Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis.Boards should be led by an independent chairman who can set strategy and remuneration policy, and hire executives, NBIM said. An independent chairman is “better able to oversee and give guidance” to executives, so defusing conflict and protecting the interests of shareholders.NBIM said: “In our current challenging markets, we believe an independent chairman is essential.”Ms Kvam estimated that more than half of the top 1,500 companies in the US combine the role of CEO and chairman.This is in stark contrast to much of Europe and the UK, where the combined role is much rarer.
23;CAH;Cardinal Health;2009-09-20T22:22:25Z;Martindale is put up for sale by Cardinal;;"The UK’s leading maker of methadone, which is used to treat heroin addicts, has been put up for sale by Cardinal Health, its US parent, attracting interest from a crowd of private equity groups.Martindale Pharmaceuticals, which controls about half the methadone market in the UK, also makes diamorphine, a legally prescribed controlled form of heroin, as well as more than 100 generic drugs, including adrenaline, morphine sulphate and codeine.One of its most potent products is phenobarbital sodium, used for assisted suicides in Switzerland and executions by lethal injection in China.Morgan Stanley is advising New York-listed Cardinal on the auction of Martindale, which has a price tag of about £150m, equivalent to about 10 times the annual earnings of the Romford-based company.However, several private equity groups that showed an interest in buying the drugmaker have since shied away due to concerns over the reputational risk of making methadone and worries about the sustainability of its profit margins.Methadone is a synthetic opiate given to about half the UK’s 300,000 serious heroin addicts, costing £3,000-£4,000 a patient a year.However, Martindale’s main source of profit is the production of specials, which are unlicensed medicinal products prescribed by doctors for a specific indication when a licensed product does not exist or is no longer available on the market.While the volumes on specials are low, the margins are very high. One private equity boss who walked away from bidding for Martindale said the financial strains facing the UK government could put pressure on the price of specials.Remaining bidders include CBPE, the former private equity arm of Close Brothers, which owns Rosemont, a liquid medicine maker; and LDC, the buyout arm of Lloyds Banking Group, which owns Quantum Specials, a rival maker of specials.Other private equity groups also in the running are Silverfleet, the former buy-out arm of Prudential; AAC Capital, the private equity group that spun out of ABN Amro last year; and Exponent, which was set up by four former 3i dealmakers in 2004.Cardinal, which acquired Martindale as part of its £233m takeover of Intercare six years ago, is selling off several assets after deciding to focus on its medical products distribution and services business."
24;CAH;Cardinal Health;2009-08-26T21:50:25Z;US medical equipment;;Monty Python’s sketch about “the machine that goes ping” was a telling satire about doctors’ obsession with snazzy devices. Since medical technology became a separate industry in its own right, investors have been equally obsessed, and for good reason as ageing baby boomers and technical breakthroughs turned an otherwise defensive sector into a growth story.But unexpected complications have developed in the past year, making pharmaceutical benefits company Cardinal Health decision to spin off its equipment arm, CareFusion, a test of investor sentiment. Fears about “Obamacare” have weighed on valuations, mirroring weakness 15 years ago when Hillary Clinton’s healthcare reform proposals loomed. The financial crisis has had real impact too. CareFusion’s revenue dropped 12 per cent last quarter, compared with a year earlier.Cardinal shareholders tempted to dump this more vulnerable part of the business should think twice though. The long-run outlook for CareFusion’s intravenous and surgical products is fundamentally sound under almost any policy scenario. And the sum of the parts may well be more than the whole. A spinoff of a very similar medical products business, Hospira, worked well for drugmaker Abbott Laboratories in 2004. After some typical first-day weakness, Hospira rose 28 per cent in its first year and Abbott 17 per cent. One advantage may be more focused management, while another is the ability to unlock a higher multiple for the faster-growing business. Medical technology stocks trade about nine times prospective earnings versus six times for pharmaceutical benefits management companies.Still, for those squeamish about painful changes in the healthcare system, the spinoff is an opportunity to surgically excise much of that risk. Getting a second opinion may be wise though.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
25;CAH;Cardinal Health;2009-08-18T20:33:56Z;Wall Street stages modest rebound;;"US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after the steepest decline in more than a month during the previous session.Financial stocks, retailers and materials companies, which led the market lower on Monday, all did well as buyers were tempted back into the market.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 1 per cent at 989.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.9 per cent to 9,217.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.3 per cent to 1,955.92.“A lot of people missed the rally in March and again in July,” said Chris Verrone, investment strategist at Strategas Partners. “Therefore any pull-back will be viewed as a buying opportunity.”Investors continued to focus on retailers as earnings season for the sector kicked up a gear with results from Home Depot, Target and Saks. For all three the pattern during the quarter was similar, with strict cost controls mitigating ongoing sales weakness.Home Depot recovered all of Monday’s losses, which were triggered by disappointing results from rival Lowe’s, after lower costs than expected helped it raise its full-year outlook. Its shares picked up 3.1 per cent to $26.93.Budget retailer Target also beat analysts’ estimates with revenues in line with expectations but profit margins improving. The stock climbed 7.6 per cent to $44.32.Upmarket chain Saks reported a similar story as carefully managed expenses kept costs low and helped it beat earnings estimates. Its shares gained 6.9 per cent to $5.72.“Only 43 per cent of companies that have reported their earnings have beat expectations on both the top and the bottom line,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential. “We need to see revenue growth in the next quarter,”Financial stocks led the way, however, helped in part by improving credit card losses. Citigroup climbed 3.5 per cent to $4.14 and Bank of America gained 2.1 per cent to $16.90.Goldman Sachs was upgraded to “buy” at Pali Research, which predicted continued strength in its fixed-income business, and the stock rose 2.1 per cent to $160.48.American Express, meanwhile, was upgraded by KBW after credit losses improved last month. Its shares picked up 4.3 per cent to $31.69.CIT was one of the strongest financial companies, up 2.9 per cent to $1.40 after the commercial lender announced a narrower loss than in the same quarter last year.On Monday the group announced that it had bought more time to fight off bankruptcy by completing a $1bn debt tender.But the rally in financial stocks was not replicated everywhere and economic data limited the bullish mood. Figures showed that deflation continued to
hamper producer prices.There was weakness among health insurers, which bucked Monday’s
losing trend on signs that the Obama administration could abandon the public insurer element of its healthcare reforms.Such a plan has been
criticised as undermining the private sector and, after campaigners hit back at suggestions that it might
be dropped, insurers gave back much of the previous session’s gains.Humana lost 1.5 per cent to $35 and Coventry Health Care fell 2.6 per cent to $22.98.Homebuilders recovered from early losses, which were triggered by data showing that builders started work on fewer homes last month than expected. But economists said the rise in the number of new single-family homes was good for the sector. Lennar and DR Horton both finished the day 2.8 per cent higher, at $13.19 and $12.22, respectively.Technology stocks also showed strength after a bruising previous session. Smartphone makers were particularly strong after RBC described the market as “the next wave of
computing” and raised its price targets on the three leaders in the sector.Apple, which makes the iPhone, climbed 2.8 per cent to $164. Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, picked up 4.6 per cent to $73.99. Palm, which recently launched the Pre, gained 4.9 per cent to $13.88."
26;CAH;Cardinal Health;2009-03-11T20:38:34Z;Financials continue gains on Wall Street;;US stocks held on to modest gains on Wednesday in a choppy session as equity markets closed up for their second consecutive session for the first time in a month.Banks had surged during early trade on the back of comments from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, that he would “do what is necessary” to stem the recession. He also said the government would use the promise of federal loans to entice investors to buy distressed assets from banks, while offering sellers capital injections.Financial shares received another boost late in the day when Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, told CNBC that his bank had been profitable for the first two months of the year. JPMorgan gained 4.6 per cent to $20.40, while Citigroup closed 6.2 per cent up to $1.54 and Bank of America rose 2.9 per cent to $4.93.Confidence in banking stocks was also given a lift by figures showing that mortgage applications had risen 11.3 per cent for the week ending March 6.But the Mortgage Bankers Association was careful to say that this was largely fuelled by existing homeowners refinancing rather than new buyers entering the market.Sentiment was further helped when Goldman Sachs said it believed a number of financial institutions would be able to pay back money received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp) over the next year. They included Morgan Stanley and US Bancorp, which rose 8 per cent to $22.51 and 9 per cent to $12.42 respectively.But American Express fell after being downgraded by Goldman Sachs from “neutral” to “conviction sell”. Fears over bad debts in the credit card industry have increased recently, and the company’s stock fell 2 per cent to $11.93.The gains made by financial companies were largely cancelled out by falls in the energy sector as the oil price plunged by around three dollars in late trade. Chevron’s shares lost 0.9 per cent to $61.22, while Exxon Mobilfell 2.4 per cent to $65.77.There were also significant falls for healthcare companies. McKesson the largest US drug distributor, dropped 17.1 per cent to $34.77 after Deutsche Bank said its earning might suffer as a result of drug store bankruptcies.Fellow drug distributors Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen also lost out. They fell 9.8 per cent to $28.59 and 9.7 per cent to $28.19 respectively. The sector as a whole, which has taken a a battering since President Obama said subsidies to healthcare companies would be cut to pay for his administration’s reforms, fell 2 per cent.Overall the benchmark S&P 500 index gained 0.2 per cent to 721.36 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.1 per cent to 6,930.40.But Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned: “With restrictions on short-selling about to be reinstated, this is the market repositioning itself. But those things do not solve the problem. No major policy change has come out of Washington, which is a headwind to a lasting rally.”The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed the other two measures, however, boosted by strong performance from technology stocks. It rose 1 per cent to 1,371.64.Hewlett Packard rose 5.8 per cent to $28.61 after UBS upgraded the company to “buy”. UBS said market sentiment on the company was overly bearish, and this helped push shares in Appleup 4.6 per cent to $92.68 and in IBM up 1.6 per cent to $88.62.But National Semiconductor, the chip manufacturer, fared badly after reporting earnings of 9 cents a share, which was below analysts’ forecasts. Its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $11.38.Mining companies also did well on the back of a rise in the price of precious metals. Newmont , the gold miner, picked up 4.7 per cent to $36.66. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 4.1 per cent to $35.56.“I think gold is in a great bull market at the moment,” said Rob Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management. “As currencies continue to lose ground, we will see many further upward movements in gold.”But the fragility of consumer confidence and spending was highlighted by worse results than expected from Staples the office supplies store, as weak revenues took their toll. The company’s shares fell 1.7 per cent to $15.47.
27;CAH;Cardinal Health;2007-05-18T20:57:59Z;Bull run continues on Wall Street;;Wall Street’s bull run continued this week, with the exception of the technology sector, as deals and earnings news pushed the S&P 500 index to within sight of its all-time high.Late on Friday, the S&P had risen 0.65 per cent to close at 1,522.75, a gain of 1.1 per cent over the week. The benchmark notched its seventh consecutive weekly rise and closed at its highest level since setting its record close of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Energy and telecoms stocks were the best performing sectors, while information technology was the laggard among the 10 major groups within the S&P.Higher oil prices and a further rise in bond yields were unable to weigh on stocks.“We are seeing so much consolidation and the market has also shifted its focus to the economy,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.“The market can absorb higher oil prices and bond yields if the economy is looking stronger.”Blue chips remained the bull’s prime choice this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 13,500 points for the first time and set a series of record closes as its run of strength since the end of March continued.On Friday, the Dow rose 0.6 per cent to finish at 13,556.53, a rise of 1.7 per cent for the week.A feature of the market’s current rally has been strong buying of large blue chip stocks. This positive sentiment was nurtured this week when high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett, Edward Lampert and Carl Icahn revealed their latest stock selections in regulatory filings.Railroads were a prominent sector, boosted by investment from Mr Buffett and Mr Icahn, and the S&P railroad index rose 3.8 per cent this week. Mr Lampert’s disclosure of a stake in Citigroup helped the bank’s shares rise by 3.6 per cent to $55.By contrast, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite was bedevilled by weakness among many semiconductor stocks amid a general rotation out of tech. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 2.7 per cent this week. On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.75 per cent to close at 2,558.45, but slipped 0.15 per cent for the week.The Russell index of small companies fell 0.7 per cent for the week.Leading declines among chip makers was Micron Technology, down 6.9 per cent to $11.47, after the group said it planned to sell $1.1bn in convertible notes.One ray of light among chip makers was Advanced Micro Devices, up 6.2 per cent to $15.59 this week, as it rolled out a new line of graphics cards designed for high-definition video games.In another week replete with deals, Microsoft said it would purchase Aquantive, the digital marketing group for about $6bn on Friday.It is the largest acquisition yet made by Microsoft, and its stock fell 0.5 per cent to $30.83, while Aquantive soared 77.8 per cent to $63.79 on Friday.“We view the acquisition as a necessity for Microsoft to compete against Google in online advertising, an estimated $40bn market growing at a 20 per cent rate through 2010,” said Jim Yin, systems software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Shares in General Electric rose 1.2 per cent to $36.96 on Friday, as the conglomerate moved towards selling its plastics business for $11bn to Saudi Basic Industries.In other acquisition activity this week, Cardinal Health bought Viasys Healthcare for $1.42bn. Viasys rose 38 per cent to $43.53, and Cardinal Health rallied 3.9 per cent to $71.77.Mylan Laboratories, the drugmaker agreed to pay $6.6bn for the generic drug business of Germany’s Merck KGaA. Shares in Mylan fell 11.8 per cent to $19.75.Bausch & Lomb agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.7bn in cash. Shares in the maker of eye-care products jumped 9.4 per cent to $67.10.Alliance Data Systems, the issuer of private-label credit cards agreed to be acquired in a $7.8bn deal by Blackstone Group. ADS rose 24.6 per cent to $78.33 and set a 52-week high of $80.30.Acxiom agreed to a $2.24bn buy-out from private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and ValueAct Capital. Shares in the information technology company gained 13.4 per cent to $27.78 this week.There was further selling in Amgen after Medicare and Medicaid Services said it may limit coverage of the drugmaker’s anaemia drugs, which a Food and Drug Administration panel recently said should have new labelling. Shares in Amgen fell 4 per cent to $54.04 as it also received multiple brokerage downgrades.In earnings news this week, Intuit said late on Thursday that its third-quarter profit climbed 23 per cent and the software maker raised its fiscal 2007 profit above analysts’ forecasts. Shares rose 13.85 per cent to $31.56 on Friday, and were up 13.2 per cent for the week.Compuware rose 9.9 per cent, to $11.06 and reached a five-year high of $12.56, as its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year results exceeded expectations.Agilent rose 4.9 per cent to $38, after it reported a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and raised revenue outlook for the year.Hewlett-Packard, down 1.5 per cent at $44.58, was the worst Dow performer this week as its second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year-earlier period.Home Depot reported a 29.5 per cent decline in profit for the first quarter due to variable weather and a weaker housing market. The stock closed out the week a fraction higher at $38.62.
28;CAH;Cardinal Health;2007-05-14T20:43:28Z;Nasdaq led lower by tech stocks;;US stocks finished mixed on Monday as the market failed to build strongly on early momentum after plenty of deal news – led by the sale of the Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital – and was weighed down by losses in the technology sector.The sale of an 80 per cent stake in the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler to US private equity group Cerberus Capital led the carmaker sector higher.Reports that members of the Ford family were considering selling their stake in troubled Ford were also welcomed by Wall Street. Ford lost a record $12.7bn last year and its shares rose 4.1 per cent to close at $8.71 after Monday’s reports.General Motors, the largest US carmaker, was led higher by the news in its sector. Its shares gained 3.9 per cent to $30.62, making it top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The Standard & Poor’s 500 index was down 0.2 per cent, at 1,503.2, having slipped below 1,500 earlier in the session, and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 0.6 per cent at 2,546.4.The Dow gained 0.2 per cent per cent to finish at 13,347.1.

Although the higher fee is lower than standard terms in US deals, it makes it harder for the Vornado group to remain in the race.Both sides in the battle are operating under time constraints, as EOP shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Blackstone deal on February 5.On Thursday, Blackstone said: “We wanted to put an all-cash deal on the table that shareholders could feel good about and which was sufficiently compelling to keep us on track for a shareholder vote on February 5 and closing on February 8.“Our offer is clearly superior on price, timing, form of consideration and certainty.”The Vornado group, which includes Starwood Capital and Walton Street Capital, has not yet made a formal offer for EOP. Vornado said it was “continuing to conduct its diligence and will respond at the appropriate time”.The consortium said last week it was prepared to pay $52 a share in cash and stock for EOP, prompting the company to allow it in for due diligence. EOP set a deadline of January 31 for a competing bid to be tabled.On Thursday, EOP shares closed 4.2 per cent higher at $54.90.Separately, the US private equity group clinched another large transaction when it agreed to buy the drug manufacturing business of Ohio-based Cardinal Health for $3.3bn.

31;CAH;Cardinal Health;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
32;CAH;Cardinal Health;2006-05-01T21:47:54Z;Cardinal puts Europe on its drugs radar;;Cardinal Health, the US drug distribution, manufacturing and hospital supply group, is considering acquisitions or joint ventures to expand internationally, particularly in Europe.Opportunities are opening in Europe, according to Cardinal, as hospitals feel increasing pressure to be more efficient and national healthcare systems strive to contain costs.Cardinal is considering several expansion possibilities in Europe, including a strategy of “rolling up” smaller drug and hospital distributors in acquisitions. Other options are expanding its drug manufacturing and packaging outsourcing operation to Europe, particularly for generic pharmaceuticals.It seeks to expand the businesses for drug infusions systems and its electronic prescription stations in hospitals, which automatically dispense and send orders to restock medicines.David Schlotterbeck, head of Cardinal’s international business, said: “We see big opportunities outside the North American market and our focus right now is deciding which one of those to pursue.”Cardinal’s interest in Europe comes amid some signs that the European and US drug and hospital supply markets are converging. Changes in both healthcare markets have increased the similarities between Europe and the US, where Cardinal has aggregated distribution, contract manufacturing, drug delivery systems and services.Acute-care hospitals are under increasing pressure from comparisons of relative quality, to squeezes on profit margins. Hospitals in both the US and Europe have sought to mitigate costs by aggregating purchasing to get more purchasing power, while also looking for ways to improve efficiency.Mr Schlotterbeck said, for example, an average US capital purchase for a drug infusion device would be $1m-$5m and as large as $15m.Until the second half of last year, the largest such purchase he had seen in Europe was $750,000. But late last year, he said hospitals showed sings they were “beginning to aggregate their purchasing,” when two UK purchases came in at $1m and $3m.Cardinal’s near-term goal is to double the percentage of profits derived internationally to about 20 per cent in five years.Robert Walter, founder and chairman, has expanded the company by aggressively acquiring smaller regional business. During the past few years he has restructured the business and Goldman Sachs expects earnings growth to resume next year.“The pressure in cost containment [in healthcare] is an advantage for us,” Mr Walter said.
33;CAH;Cardinal Health;2006-04-19T22:49:10Z;Calpers names six ‘worst’ in its portfolio;;Calpers, the biggest US pension fund, has named six companies – Mellon Financial, Clear Channel, Sovereign Bancorp, Brocade Communications, Cardinal Health and OfficeMax – as having poor corporate governance and financial performance.The six were named in Calpers’ annual Focus list, which “names and shames” those companies that the $208bn fund believes are most in need of improvement.Rob Feckner, Calpers’ board president, said: “The stock performance of these companies is unacceptable to us and other shareowners. We are urging them to make such improvements as requiring majority voting for directors, removing excessive takeover defences that prevent shareowners from amending company bylaws, and accounting for their performance.”Each year, Calpers sifts through the 1,800 companies in its equity portfolio and finds the 15 to 20 worst performers, then narrows that list down further.Charles Valdes, the chairman of the Calpers investment committee, said: “In the coming months, we will continue to work with these companies to find ways to turn them around. We know that this kind of engagement leads to higher returns, positive leadership changes, more transparency and much better accountability to shareowners and regulators.”Highfields Capital, a hedge fund which holds a small stake in Mellon, has also put pressure on the company, suggesting Mellon split off its custody business and focus on asset management.Mellon said in a statement on Wednesday that it had been holding talks with Calpers in recent months about the pension fund’s concerns, and so was disappointed to be included in the Focus list. Mellon stock was at a 52-week high and it had appointed a new chief executive in February, it said.Calpers said Clear Channel paid its executives too much, and had had a 42 per cent slide in its share price in the past five years.OfficeMax and Sovereign both had excessive takeover defences and had also significantly underperformed, it said.
