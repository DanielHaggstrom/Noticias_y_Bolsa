More here. Now to today’s lead topic . . .Banks offer certain perks to win over big clients. One of those is something called a credit line, which under normal circumstances is a “nice to have”. Few banks anticipate that the clients they serve will need to use the credit lines in full. Up until a few weeks ago, if companies needed more money, they could tap the $10tn US corporate bond market where cash is cheap rather than tug on the safety net of a revolver which tends to be used in emergencies. But over the past three weeks, more than 130 companies in Europe and the Americas have drawn at least $124.1bn from their lenders, according to analysis by FT reporters. The figure is probably even higher because some companies just don’t have to report it.The uncertainty injected into the market by the coronavirus — particularly as to how long a global lockdown will last — has pushed many companies to draw on their credit facilities, some of them in full. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer by volume, is among them. It pulled its entire $9bn loan facility last week to secure some flexibility in the weeks ahead. Kraft Heinz, Hilton Worldwide and Delta Air Lines also secured funding in the same way. The pain is more acute for companies in hospitality and aviation, but almost every industry is feeling it. On the day that the final car facilities across Europe halted, General Motors also drew $16bn from its credit facility, hot on the heels of Ford. Bankers at JPMorgan Chase have been kept busy, providing more dollars in credit line extensions so far this year than any other bank. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to them. JPM went into the year with more than $367bn — about 13 per cent of its $2.7tn balance sheet. Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo together provided another $1.2tn of lines, while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had a combined $260bn, regulatory filings show. For many people in the banking industry, this is all relatively new. But for those that have lived through other events — like the 2008 financial crisis and 9/11 — they think the worst is yet to come. Even in the aftermath of the last crisis, tapping a credit line remained taboo.On Tuesday DD told you about “Arbageddon”, today we bring you “Quant Quake”. We’re not panicking, honestly. For anyone out there that feels like they’re having a hard time adjusting to the brave new coronavirus world, perhaps you can take some comfort in the fact that even computers are malfunctioning. Quantitative hedge funds, which rely on high-powered computers, vast data sets and algorithms to turn a profit, have over the past decade been a rare bright spot in the hedge fund industry. But the turmoil inflicted by Covid-19 has unsettled even the gold standard of quant funds. DE Shaw, Two Sigma, and Renaissance — the holy trinity of quantitative investing — have all seen some of their biggest funds hurt this month, DD’s Ortenca Aliaj and our colleague Robin Wigglesworth report. One large hedge fund investor called his book of quants a “disaster”. The pain is more profound because everyone seems to have expected the strategy to perform well, as was the case in 2018 when two volatility leaps inflicted huge losses on the hedge fund industry but quants stood tall. It’s almost unheard of to see Renaissance’s flagship Institutional Equities Fund take losses even in the single digits, let alone the 18 per cent drop it suffered in the first three weeks of March. Similarly, DE Shaw’s pricey “statistical arbitrage” hedge fund Valence, which at 3-and-30 charges almost treble the industry average, lost more than 9 per cent this month. Steve Cohen’s quant unit at Point72 Asset Management has also been hit, Bloomberg reported, and is down more than 20 per cent. The glitch in the quant system is perhaps another reminder that markets aren’t functioning as expected. Investors will have to see how the “Quant Quake” shakes out.India, the world’s second most populous country, is headed into lockdown as it tries to stop the spread of the coronavirus. So depending on how you see things, Facebook’s plan to buy a multibillion-dollar stake in Reliance Jio, the mobile internet service company, has come at an opportune time.As 1.3bn Indians are locked inside their homes in the coming three weeks, internet and mobile services will be of vital importance to receive information, work from home and stay in touch with friends and family. If they can get the deal through the door, that is. The investment has been stalled by the coronavirus travel ban.The deal, first reported by the FT’s Anjli Raval, Tim Bradshaw and Benjamin Parkin, will give Facebook a 10 per cent share in Jio, whose cut-price service has attracted 370m Indians in just three years. The social media network stands to get a key foothold in the Indian market where its WhatsApp chat service already has 400m users and is about to launch a payments service. Launched four years ago by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, below, Jio is valued at more than $60bn, but its rapid expansion has lumbered Reliance with a heavy debt load.A deal with Mark Zuckerberg would help the company meet its target to cut net debt to zero in a year.

1;HLT;Hilton Inc;2019-02-13T19:15:34Z;Hilton’s sunny view boosts travel stocks;;Hotel and leisure stocks rallied on Wednesday as a quarterly update from Hilton Worldwide lifted investors’ hopes for the travel industry.Hilton delivered fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street’s expectations, reflecting higher room rates and resilient demand against the backdrop of sluggish economies in Europe and China.Shares in Hilton gained as much as 7 per cent and was up 5.8 per cent in recent trading.Fellow hotel groups Marriott International and Hyatt Hotels climbed 3.5 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively, before Hyatt moved slightly lower by 0.5 per cent on its own results after the close of trading.Cruise lines Norwegian and Royal Caribbean were up more than 1 per cent. Airlines — which are coming off a string of forecast-beating earnings — also saw gains led by Delta and American Airlines, which each added 1.2 per cent.The rally outpaced gains in the broader S&P 500, which rose 0.2 per cent.For 2019, the Virginia-based Hilton expects to earn $3.66 and $3.78 a share on an adjusted basis, well above analysts’ average estimate of $3.17, according to a Refinitiv poll. Hilton also projected 1 per cent to 3 per cent growth year-over-year in revenue per available room, a key industry metric. That was down from a prior forecast of 2 per cent to 4 per cent, but the high end of the range remained above the consensus view of 2.6 per cent.Revenue guidance for the current year reflects that Hilton “is hanging in there really well,” chief executive Christopher Nassetta said during an earnings call. He added that leisure and short-term business stays will be “a little bit less” than levels seen in 2018 amid softer economic growth globally, which is included in the company’s outlook.In the December quarter, Hilton’s revenue per available room grew 2 per cent against the same period a year ago, primarily driven by higher average daily rates.Revenue grew 10.6 per cent to $2.29bn, while adjusted earnings per share came in at 79 cents. Analysts were looking for $2.27bn and 69 cents a share.But it wasn’t all good news on the travel front Wednesday. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts said its quarterly revenue per available room jumped 8 per cent, though the company’s 2019 outlook fell short of expectations. Shares were trading about 0.4 per cent lower.Meanwhile, TripAdvisor shares tumbled more than 6 per cent a day after the travel website reported a weaker fourth-quarter profit than anticipated and warned of continued weakness in its hotel segment during the first half of 2019 amid lower marketing spending.

A repost of the video on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, by state-run newspaper the Beijing News had been viewed 28m times as of Thursday. The state-run China Consumers Association also reposted the video. The footage apparently showed a cleaner at the Le Royal Méridien Shanghai hotel using the same cleaning cloth to wipe a washbasin and cups, and wiping a toilet with a guest’s towel. The hotel, part of a network run by Marriott International, issued a statement apologising for the “disturbance” the incident had caused to guests. Two Sheraton hotels in the cities of Guiyang and Nanchang, which are also operated by Marriott, issued apologies for practices shown in the video.The Waldorf Astoria in Shanghai, part of Hilton Worldwide, whose cleaner was apparently shown using the same sponge to clean a sink, cups and later a toilet, issued an apology.China is the fastest growing major market for the world’s top hotel chains as rising incomes have led to domestic travel spending increasing at double-digit rates. Marriott alone operates several hundred hotels in China. A cleaner at Beijing’s Park Hyatt hotel, which is operated by the US-listed company Hyatt Hotels, was apparently shown using a guest’s towel to clean drinking glasses. The hotel apologised for what was shown in the video. The Shangri-La Hotel in Fuzhou, a city in eastern China, whose cleaner was shown using a used guest towel to clean a room’s mirror and a drinking glass, said the video showed a violation of standards and apologised. Seven of the hotels shown in the video are located in Shanghai, and the city’s health inspection agency said it had ordered an investigation into their hygiene conditions. Beijing’s tourism agency said it had called representatives of four hotels featured in the video for talks. Several internet users said they were not surprised by the lack of hygiene standards shown in the video. “I bet that if you performed similar investigations at every five-star hotel in the country, none of them would pass the test,” said one Weibo user.
3;HLT;Hilton Inc;2018-05-18T16:32:57Z;Blackstone sells out of Hilton Worldwide;Acquisition was one of the most profitable private equity deals ever;"Blackstone, the world’s largest buyout group, has agreed to sell its remaining 5.8 per cent stake in Hilton Worldwide, bringing to an end 11 years of ownership that proved one of the most profitable private equity transactions.The hotel chain’s largest shareholder will sell 15.8m shares, according to a statement by Hilton on Friday. The total value of the shares is estimated at roughly $1.3bn, based on Hilton’s closing price of $83.30 on Thursday.Hilton, which will not receive any proceeds from the sale, also said it was buying back 1.25m shares owned by the private equity group.Blackstone took Hilton private in October 2007 led by Jon Gray, its star dealmaker who was recently promoted president of the firm, in a transaction worth $26bn.But even though the New York-based group has at least tripled its investment in Hilton, the deal has had its ups and downs.At the height of the financial crash Blackstone wrote down its investment in the hotel group by roughly 70 per cent, leading to more capital injections and a debt restructuring before it relisted the company in 2013.Blackstone has been gradually selling down its holding in Hilton. Last year it sold a 25 per cent stake of Hilton to HNA. The heavily indebted Chinese company sold its Hilton holding recently, but still made a reported profit of about $2bn from its investment.Under Mr Gray’s leadership, the giant asset manager has gained a reputation of buying shrewdly and selling well. Hilton’s growth came partly as a result of profitable sales within its portfolio such as the disposal of the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel in 2014 for almost $2bn, a record-setting price, to China’s Anbang Insurance.Blackstone’s real estate unit has become a true powerhouse since Mr Gray took over in 2005, going from $5bn assets under management to roughly $120bn this year according to official figures.What makes me different is that I take concentrated bets; I go all in. I get a firm view and then I act in scaleHilton, and Blackstone’s acquisition of Equity Office Properties in 2007, stand as two of the largest ever private equity transactions, according to Dealogic. They are also two of the most profitable deals in Blackstone’s history.Shortly after the $39bn purchase of EOP, Blackstone started disposing of properties it regarded as less appealing as it anticipated the end of the property boom. The private equity group sold close to 50 per cent of what it had bought within just weeks.But it was the Hilton deal — one of only three for which he still keeps a trophy in his office — that cemented Mr Gray’s position as heir apparent to Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone’s billionaire founder.“What makes me different is that I take concentrated bets; I go all in. I get a firm view and then I act in scale,” Mr Gray once said of his investment strategy.Among other property deals, Blackstone’s €12.25bn sale of Logicor, the London-based warehouse group to CIC, the Chinese sovereign wealth fund, was the second largest European real estate transaction on record, according to Dealogic. The US firm subsequently bought back 10 per cent of Logicor from CIC as it emerged the Chinese group had recruited Blackstone to manage Logicor’s portfolio."

5;HLT;Hilton Inc;2018-04-09T17:19:49Z;HNA seeks to raise $6bn from Hilton Worldwide stake sale;Chinese group details offering of hotels operator shares as it races to deal with debt;HNA, the heavily indebted Chinese aviation-to-finance group, is poised to sell its 26 per cent stake in Hilton Worldwide, as it intensifies efforts to raise capital to buttress its balance sheet.HNA will raise north of $6bn if it succeeds in liquidating its entire stake in the hotel operator, which owns the Waldorf Astoria, Conrad and Doubletree brands.The Chinese group, which is Hilton’s largest shareholder, plans to sell the bulk of its holding — between 63m and 72.5m shares — in a secondary public offering, according to a filing with US securities regulators on Monday.Hilton also said it would buy at least 10m, and up to 16.5m, shares itself in a deal directly with HNA. That buyback would be carried out at a 1 per cent discount to the price HNA achieves for the rest of its stake.Shares in the hotel chain lagged behind the rest of the US market at lunchtime in New York, trading about 1 per cent lower.HNA is in a race to offload assets and strengthen its finances as more than $20bn of its US dollar-denominated debts mature this and next year. It raised $2bn earlier this year from selling stakes in two of Hilton Worldwide’s former sister companies, Park Hotels and Hilton Grand Vacations.The latest sale was trailed in a disclosure last week that HNA was planning to sell some or all of its Hilton Worldwide stake, a statement that triggered a flurry of trading in the company’s shares.The Chinese group’s exit from its Hilton investments appear to be going more smoothly than its plans to unload stakes in two aviation groups. HNA scrapped an initial public offering for Swiss airline catering business Gategroup last month, and is still at work on a float of Swissport, the aviation services group. Swissport’s finances are more closely intertwined with HNA due to a series of short-term loans the Swiss group has made to HNA affiliates, something that has complicated the float, the Financial Times has previously reported.HNA bought its stake in Hilton in 2016 from private equity group Blackstone, which took the company private in 2007 for $26bn in what was one of the largest leveraged buyouts in history. Blackstone listed Hilton publicly in 2013.The secondary offering of Hilton Worldwide shares will be led by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.“The sale of HNA’s ownership stake in Hilton removes an overhang on the stock and was largely expected as HNA has been systematically monetising its investments outside of China,” said Bill Crow, an analyst with Raymond James who covers Hilton.Hilton on Monday also projected that it would earn between 51 and 53 cents a share for the three months to the end of March, above Wall Street forecasts for 47 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters.
6;HLT;Hilton Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;China’s HNA to exit Hilton investment with stake sale;;Hilton Worldwide’s largest shareholder is poised to exit the hotel operator, as Chinese aviation-to-finance group HNA raises capital to buttress its balance sheet.Hilton disclosed in a filing with US securities regulators on Monday that HNA would sell 63.05m shares in a secondary public offering, with the option for underwriters to purchase a further 9.45m shares over the following 30 days.The hotel operator, which also owns the Waldorf Astoria, Conrad and Doubletree brands, said it would also purchase 10m shares in a private transaction with HNA. Hilton has the option to increase its purchase of its own shares from HNA to as much as 16.5m shares.Together, the stock sales would raise north of $6bn for HNA at Hilton’s share price at the close of trading on Friday.
7;HLT;Hilton Inc;2018-04-05T22:47:22Z;China’s HNA looks to sell Hilton Worldwide shares;Heavily indebted conglomerate bought stake in hotel operator from Blackstone;HNA Group, the Chinese airline-to-finance conglomerate, said on Thursday it had decided to sell some or all of its $6.5bn stake in Hilton Worldwide, triggering heavy trading in the hotel operator’s shares.HNA said in a filing with US securities regulators that it would consider putting its 82.5m shares in Hilton — which also operates the Conrad, Waldorf Astoria and Doubletree hotels — on the block. HNA is the company’s largest shareholder, owning more than a quarter of its common stock.The potential sale comes as the heavily indebted Chinese group offloads assets to strengthen its balance sheet. In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, HNA said that the timing and terms of its eventual Hilton stock sale would be subject to market conditions and other undisclosed considerations.HNA Group has been paring its overseas investments as it stares down about $20bn in US dollar-denominated debt due to mature in 2018 and 2019. This year, it sold stakes it acquired in Park Hotels and Hilton Grand Vacations through its Hilton Worldwide purchase. HNA had attempted to float its 65 per cent stake in Gategroup, the Swiss airline catering company, before withdrawing the offering.* It is also looking at a listing of Swissport, the aviation services group.Hilton declined to comment on the SEC filing. Hilton stock climbed more than 1 per cent on Thursday to $79.04, with nearly 7m shares trading hands — more than three times the average over the past 20 days.As part of HNA’s 2016 agreement to purchase a stake in Hilton from private equity group Blackstone, it agreed to a two-year suspension of share sales unless the hotel operator’s board approved the transaction.Jeffrey Donnelly, an analyst with Wells Fargo who covers Hilton, said he suspected that the $25bn company could use those lock-up provisions to either repurchase its shares directly or ensure that the sale is conducted in a way that gives no one group such a large stake in Hilton.He said HNA’s liquidation of its holdings in Park Hotels and Hilton Grand Vacations “could serve as a model” for what the Chinese group plans to do with its holdings in Hilton.Hilton has warned investors in annual SEC filings that a substantial share sale by HNA or Blackstone could “substantially decrease the market price of our common stock”. Blackstone purchased Hilton in 2007 for $26bn in one of the largest leveraged buyouts. The private equity group went on to list Hilton publicly in 2013.* This has been amended from the original article to reflect that the Gateway float is no longer going ahead.
8;HLT;Hilton Inc;2018-03-25T16:46:26Z;China’s HNA squeaks through turbulent first quarter;Asset sales and fresh loans keep indebted conglomerate aloft;HNA, the debt-laden Chinese finance-to-aviation conglomerate, has navigated a difficult first quarter bolstered by $4.6bn in recent asset sales and a shift in the political winds that has put it back in favour with Chinese banks. The company, which began as an airline on the resort island of Hainan, rapidly became one of China’s most prolific dealmakers, claiming a nearly 10 per cent stake in Deutsche Bank and 25 per cent of Hilton Hotels in a $40bn global spree. In the past year it has come under scrutiny for its murky ownership and high leverage. Company executives had embarked on a rapid sales programme after HNA was reined in by regulators, predicting that liquidity would recover in the beginning of the year. They delayed payments and restructured sprawling holdings to make it through a cash shortfall of more than $2bn in the first quarter of this year. “We had a healthy mix of cash flows . . . in the current quarter and do not anticipate any disruptions going forward either,” HNA said on Friday.In a sign that the high tide of Chinese buying has receded, no prominent buyers have emerged to snap up HNA’s assets in the way that the company and its peers did in their four-year, multibillion-dollar buying binge. Instead, HNA is relying on initial public offerings and secondary offerings for almost everything other than its real estate sales. “There’s no big buyer stepping up. If there’s someone lurking out there they aren’t going to put their head above the parapet,” said Fraser Howie, co-author of Red Capitalism. “You go to the public markets now because it’s the last resort.”HNA has realised about $4.6bn in asset sales over the past year, according to Dealogic and Financial Times calculations, including trimming its Deutsche Bank stake. It has two IPOs in the pipeline in Switzerland, the first of which is set to raise at least SFr1bn ($1.06bn). About $4bn of real estate in the US is on the block. Within China it has consolidated assets into its listed companies, several of which have been suspended from trading for months pending a restructuring. But its biggest salvation came domestically, after Chinese banks that had limited credit to HNA late last year resumed lending in February. Its bonds rallied that month. Last week, it settled about $475m in outstanding fuel bills. “The cash is flowing again,” said one person familiar with the company. The turnround in the banks’ stance came shortly after the political resurrection of Wang Qishan, now vice-president, who retired as anti-corruption tsar in October. His return from retirement was foreshadowed in January, when he was named a delegate to the National People’s Congress. Last year an exiled businessman, Guo Wengui, claimed that Mr Wang’s family had improperly benefited from ties to the company. An FT investigation subsequently revealed that shareholdings were concentrated in the hands of several top executives, including co-founder Chen Feng who worked under Mr Wang in the 1980s. The investigation did not find any direct shareholding in HNA by either Mr Wang or his family. HNA denies the allegations and is suing Mr Guo for defamation over them.In Hong Kong, HNA secured a loan of $396m from private equity firm Pacific Alliance Group against shares in a Hong Kong-listed entity. PAG last year sued Mr Guo in New York courts for an unpaid loan.But HNA is not out of the woods. It had net debt of $55bn as of June 30 2017, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, with net debt 6.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It is weighed down by about $20bn in US dollar-denominated bonds issued by the parent group or its subsidiaries that are due to mature in 2018 or 2019. S&P this month gave the company a 35 per cent chance of default.It still has assets to sell. Its stake in Hilton Hotels is worth about 40 per cent more than it paid in 2016, according to FT calculations. It has sold stakes in Hilton spin-offs Park Hotels and Hilton Grand Vacations through secondary offerings that will fetch roughly $2.5bn.Additional reporting by Sherry Fei JuTwitter: @HornbyLucy
9;HLT;Hilton Inc;2018-03-02T10:44:14Z;China’s HNA unwinds part of its Hilton stake;Group divests from some key offshore assets acquired during $40bn buying spree;China’s HNA Group plans to sell “some or all of” its 25 per cent stake in Park Hotels & Resorts, signalling an unwinding of part of the acquisitive company’s $6.5bn stake in Hilton Worldwide.The company that over the past year became the largest shareholder in Deutsche Bank has in recent months faced a squeeze on liquidity, struggling to repay some debts it has racked up during its $40bn buying spree.The purchase of a 25 per cent stake in Hilton Worldwide from Blackstone in October 2016 was one of several landmark transactions over the past three years made by HNA, which started as a small, regional airline in the 1990s in China’s southern island province of Hainan.The 25 per cent stake in Park Hotels, valued at about $1.4bn, was accrued as it took the larger stake in Hilton.Hilton announced earlier this year plans to carve out its Hilton Grand Vacations timeshare business, including its property, and turn it into a real estate investment company called Park Hotels & Resorts.The plans for the sale, announced in a regulatory filing by Park Hotels, come as HNA begins to sell down several of its key investments.In February, HNA cut its stake in Deutsche Bank from 9.9 per cent to 8.8 per cent and said in a regulatory filing that it had lent out some of its remaining shares in Germany’s largest lender to raise funds.The company also announced last month that it had pledged 1.4bn shares worth nearly $400m from one of its subsidiaries to borrow from private equity company Pacific Alliance Group, in addition to flagging its sale of two Hong Kong land parcels to developer Henderson Land for almost $2bn.In late January, one of its US units sold its 12 per cent stake in US-listed shipping group Dorian LPG, a disposal that came at a loss for the Chinese group.HNA is among several Chinese companies that have come under the scrutiny of the country’s regulators, who are concerned about the rapid build-up in debt associated with the global buying binge.Several groups have already felt the wrath of Beijing. The government said a week ago that it had taken over Anbang Insurance, the company that owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, and charged its chairman with financial crimes.The chairman of another acquisitive group, CEFC Energy, which last year announced it was taking a $9bn stake in Russian oil group Rosneft, has also reportedly been detained by Chinese authorities.HNA has run into a number of regulatory questions on some of the disclosures it has made while scooping up assets abroad, with some takeover watchdogs stating that the company provided false information.

It has also run into a number of regulatory questions on some of the disclosures it has made while picking up assets.Park Hotels noted in a regulatory filing: “The Reporting Persons have determined to pursue a sale, through one or more registered public offerings, of some or all of the Common Stock that the Reporting Persons currently hold.”HNA bought the stake in the US hotel chain from Blackstone for $26.25 a share in October 2016.The disposal comes as the company sells down several of its key investments. In February, HNA cut its stake in Deutsche Bank from 9.9 per cent to 8.8 per cent and said in a regulatory filing it had lent out some of its remaining shares in the bank, Germany’s largest lender, to raise funds. The company also announced last month that it had pledged 1.4bn of shares worth nearly $400m from one of its subsidiaries to borrow from private equity company Pacific Alliance Group, in addition to flagging its sale of two Hong Kong land parcels to developer Henderson Land for almost $2bn.

But its cash position worsened at the end of last year as the company began rolling over loans and delaying payments at some of its subsidiaries.Bank of America Merrill Lynch once provided investment banking services to the company but stopped last year, according to people close to the matter. BofA declined to comment.Other global banks such as Citi do not work with HNA as the company has failed to pass “know your customer” checks because of the opaque ownership structure of the group, people briefed on the issue said.However, some banks such UBS, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse still work with HNA, providing investment banking services such as advice, sources said. Citi, JPMorgan, UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment.HNA has over the past few months begun selling assets and shares in an attempt to raise cash and restore confidence.Last week, the company announced the HK$15.8bn sale of two plots of land in Hong Kong to local developer Henderson Land.Earlier in the month, the group said it had cut its stake in Deutsche Bank from 9.9 per cent to 9.2 per cent, and then again days later to 8.8 per cent. HNA said in a regulatory filing that it had also lent out some of its remaining shares in the bank to raise funds.

However, questions over its shareholding structure and ultimate owners have dogged the company.Earlier in December, a US-based software company filed a complaint with the Supreme Court of the State of New York against HNA over discrepancies among reports of its ownership structure. And in September, Switzerland’s takeover body demanded that HNA clarify its ownership structure after its SFr1.4bn ($1.4bn) buyout of air services company Gategroup.

Its financial health came under scrutiny this year after Chinese regulators acted against private companies moving money out of China.In recent weeks HNA has extended the repayment period for a loan from its Swiss entity, Swissport, to another affiliate and has delayed payments to aircraft lessors, raising concerns about the group’s liquidity.“The US is raising interest rates and the Chinese government is tightening and deleveraging. The general environment is affecting liquidity,” said Zhao Quan, the group’s newly appointed board director, in an interview at HNA’s Buddha-shaped headquarters in China’s semi-tropical island of Hainan. “In December interest rates are relatively high, and not only for HNA.”Mr Zhao said the group had a “healthy” cash flow from its tourism and aviation businesses and “a lot of choices” in its financing.In December interest rates are relatively high, and not only for HNAHe said the company was not in a hurry to sell any assets, dismissing talk that many of its recent purchases could be on the block. Last month, Adam Tan, chief executive, told reporters in Beijing that HNA might sell assets as it adjusted its portfolio to China’s One Belt, One Road investment plan, involving $900bn in infrastructure spending across the world.Chinese liquidity typically tightens at the end of the year as banks’ state-set lending quotas are used up. But this year’s crackdown on capital outflows by private corporations has subjected HNA to additional scrutiny, spurring Standard & Poor’s to warn that its aggressive financing structures were damaging its creditworthiness.HNA is among a group of Chinese companies including Dalian Wanda, Anbang Insurance and Fosun International facing scrutiny after a flood of aggressive overseas investment, as Beijing looks to stem capital flight from the country.A global deal spree in excess of $40bn has seen HNA buy a 25 per cent stake in hotel chain Hilton Worldwide for $6.5bn in October 2016, make a $2.8bn acquisition of Swissport in July 2015, and purchase Gategroup for $1.9bn in April 2016, among other notable deals.HNA and its subsidiaries have turned to online financing platforms in China to raise money for operations, including a product currently offering 8.8 per cent. While high compared with international interest rates for corporate bonds, that is still lower than the 10 per cent to 12 per cent products routinely offered on other P2P platforms in mainland China.In November HNA raised eyebrows with a nearly 9 per cent coupon on a 363-day bond but this week cancelled a planned perpetual bond.“In December money is in short supply so the interest rates rise. If you want capital you have to pay higher interest,” Mr Zhao said, explaining the decision not to issue the bonds. “If I wait for January, the cost might be 100 or 200 basis points lower, so why should I issue now?”Fred Browne, chief executive of aircraft leasing firm Aergo Capital, told industry publication Flight Global that some of HNA’s subsidiaries have missed payments in the past two to three months. Another executive with an international leasing company confirmed the delays to the Financial Times but said that payments were being made “bit by bit”, allaying lessors’ concerns.“It is concerning rather than serious,” he said, adding that the airlines under the group’s umbrella are still operating profitably. “It is not a state secret that the cash is being sucked up by the mother ship. This has to do with the corporate structure rather than the airlines themselves.”Late in November, the company extended the maturity and interest rate payments on a 90-day, €400m ($470m) loan from its Swissport subsidiary to another affiliate. The payment is now due on January 28.Earlier this year, HNA tapped its Irish aircraft leasing subsidiary Avolon for a $365m loan to its Bohai Capital unit, which oversees most of HNA’s fundraising in the domestic high-interest financing markets. The loan was repaid, Avolon said in its second-quarter update.Avolon’s chief financial officer Andy Cronin said this week said that it does not expect to make further loans to Bohai, according to a Goldman Sachs summary of his remarks to the bank’s aircraft leasing conference.Additional reporting by Peggy Hollinger and Robert Smith in London and Archie Zhang in HaikouInternational scrutiny of HNA’s debt and ownership are only the latest hurdles the company has faced. Founded as a scrappy regional carrier at the beginning of China’s experiment liberalising its civil aviation sector, it has survived even as the rest of the sector coalesced into a state-owned triopoly.HNA has been in tight spots before, notably after the 2003 outbreak of Sars, the deadly respiratory virus, when travel revenues in China collapsed, according to a short documentary shown on Hainan Airlines, the airline at the heart of the company. “En route there were times of smooth sailing and there were occasions of storm-like savagery,” the documentary says.Another turbulent time came around 2009, when the company took over a private shipbuilder in Zhoushan, an eastern archipelago, whose owner was caught up in a corruption probe. Around the same time, the global financial crisis and a glut of shipbuilding capacity in China rocked the shipping industry.It is now fending off international scrutiny of its ownership, including regulatory probes in Switzerland, Germany and Austria even after the acquisitions had closed. Company executives say the impact of the probes is limited, but the questions have helped spur a European push towards greater scrutiny of takeover bids from China.At issue is the 29 per cent of the company held offshore, which HNA plans to inject into a New York-based foundation. Company executives say that stake — which passed from an aviation businessman, Bharat Bhise, to a Chinese man named Guan Jun before being transferred to the charity — represents “our shares” and that the two were merely HNA’s representatives. Mr Bhise also offered that explanation in an interview with Reuters.What is clear is that the circle of founding partners and individual shareholders are deeply invested in their creation. In the documentary, co-founders Chen Feng and Wang Jian age from young men joyfully serving tea on Hainan Airlines’ maiden flight into middle-aged executives celebrating the group’s inclusion in the Fortune 500 in 2015. At the ceremony, chief executive and life-long HNA veteran Adam Tan chokes back tears.

The New York-based company posted economic net income, a closely watched measure for private equity that includes unrealised gains on investments, of 69 cents per unit, beating estimates of around 55 cents.Blackstone’s better-than-expected results were partly aided by the firm’s real estate portfolio, which appreciated 5.5 per cent in the third quarter of the year. Some of its key investments include Invitation Homes and Hilton Worldwide. The company has also been selling down on its Hilton’s stake.The company now manages a record $387bn in assets under management, a 7 per cent rise over the prior year period.Blackstone and other private equity giants have enjoyed the best fundraising in the history of the industry with investors desperately seeking yield.“Today, Blackstone reported another quarter of consistent growth for our shareholders, with strong double-digit increases in revenue and earnings for both the quarter and year-to-date period,” said Stephen Schwarzman, the co-founder of the listed private equity group.“We continue to successfully expand our global investment platforms, launching new products and channels, and delivering a broader range of solutions for our institutional and retail clients alike.”Shares in Blackstone rose 0.84 per cent to $33.49 in early trading.Blackstone also posted quarterly distribution at $0.44 per common unit, down from $0.54 in the previous quarter.The company posted its earnings as it is reportedly looking to raise up to $10bn in outside commitments for its first-ever $40bn infrastructure fund.Apollo Global Management and Carlyle are due to report earnings for the quarter later this month.Image source: Bloomberg"
15;HLT;Hilton Inc;2017-09-06T11:45:52Z;Goldman shelves work with HNA’s Pactera over due diligence concerns;;Goldman Sachs has suspended work on raising funding for an HNA unit – including a potential public float – because the group does not meet the bank’s due diligence standards, according to people familiar with the bank’s decision.The halt is the latest blow for HNA, the acquisitive Chinese conglomerate whose opaque ownership has generated suspicion in the west while Beijing has clamped down on a dealmaking bonanza that netted it a stake in Hilton Worldwide and a hedge fund owned by former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, among other assets.Goldman bankers began internal due diligence checks on HNA’s Beijing-based IT outsourcing unit Pactera last month, after being awarded the mandate to manage a pre-float funding round as well as to lead the unit’s eventual IPO. HNA bought the unit last year from Blackstone for $675m.But Goldman bankers were forced to tell the company it did not satisfy the bank’s due diligence standards and they would have to halt work. The bank also informed the investors it had introduced to Pactera about the halt. HNA could not immediately be reached for comment. The news was first reported by Reuters.Goldman is not the only bank to have struggled to work with HNA. Over the summer, a leaked email from the Asia head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Matthew Koder, told staff to avoid working with HNA because of concerns about its corporate structure and its complex business model.Related:
16;HLT;Hilton Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Chinese M&A boom faces regulatory checks;Record dealmaking in 2016 has raised concerns from regulators in China and overseas;China’s HNA Group bought itself a spot on the Fortune 500 list this year — not once but twice in a span of months — as Chinese money flooded into the US corporate sector this year.HNA closed its $6.5bn buyout of software distributor Ingram Micro in December, putting it in control of the US’s 64th-largest company by revenues. A few months earlier, the conglomerate, with holdings in insurance, airlines and department stores, agreed to pay about $6.5bn for a 25 per cent stake in Hilton Worldwide Holdings, which is 254th on the list of the biggest companies in the US.Aggressively acquisitive groups such as HNA helped China dominate cross-border dealmaking in 2016. Companies from the country agreed $220.4bn in acquisitions, or about 16 per cent of global cross border activity, according to data from Thomson Reuters.But the record figures for China, slightly more than double the volume of deals last year, have also sparked a fierce backlash from regulators in both foreign markets and at home.As regulatory reviews for many of the deals struck in 2016 extend into the new year — ChemChina’s $44bn takeover of Swiss agrochemical group Syngenta, China’s largest-ever cross-border takeover, included — questions have emerged over what kind of Chinese groups will succeed in swallowing up foreign assets in 2017.“The whole architecture and lens through which we evaluate Chinese buyers changed during 2016,” says Colin Banfield, joint head of global cross-border mergers and acquisitions at Citi.“Previously, the test was predicated on whether the Chinese buyer could get the deal signed up under competitive dynamics. Now, the test is whether post signing, they can actually make it to the finish line given heightened regulatory hurdles in the target markets and foreign exchange restrictions.”Regulators around the world have come down hard on Chinese investment this year, often citing vague national security concerns.The Australian Treasury, for example, said in August that China’s State Grid would not be allowed to take over Ausgrid for $7.5bn. Deals inked in Germany, the Netherlands and Norway were upended this year by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US on grounds that the national assets involved in the acquisitions presented risks to US security.One of those failed buyouts was that of troubled German chipmaker Aixtron by a Chinese investor group for €670m, which US President Barack Obama blocked over national security concerns. A consortium of Chinese investors aiming to buy a lighting unit from Philips for $3bn received similar treatment at the start of the year.The Chinese government has protested that the blocking of deals was protectionism. However, in the final months of 2016, China’s own foreign exchange regulator has become one of the biggest hurdles for Chinese groups seeking to buy businesses overseas.Fearing cross-border M&A has been used by Chinese groups to move capital offshore, the State Administration for Foreign Exchange (Safe) has signalled that it will crack down on acquisitions it deems speculative in nature. “Strategic” acquisitions, or ones that have synergies with the buyer’s business at home, will be allowed.“The approval process in China has become longer, more complicated, with more questions,” says Philip Li, partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, noting that gaining approval from Safe now takes four to six months, compared to two to three months at the beginning of the year.Guidelines from Beijing regarding future dealmaking have so far been ambiguous. In late December, the Ministry of Commerce said it was monitoring closely all cross-border deals involving the purchase of land, hotels, film production and entertainment assets.Several of this year’s biggest deals — and which lack obvious connections to the buyers’ original businesses in China — fall in this area.Dalian Wanda, the property developer that also owns yachtmaker Sunseeker and the AMC cinema chain, agreed to pay about $1bn for Dick Clark Productions, the US company behind the Golden Globe Awards, and $3.5bn for Legendary Entertainment, which has financed blockbuster films such as The Dark Knight.The year’s biggest failed deal was Anbang Insurance’s attempted $14bn takeover of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, which ended with China’s regulators quietly blocking the transaction.HNA’s buying spree has also included billions of dollars in hotel assets, including Hilton Worldwide, Carlson Hotels and Red Lion Hotels Corp.Similar deals will probably go forward in 2017, bankers say. But the state is set to have a bigger role in deciding what types of acquisitions will be allowed to progress, and which companies can pursue them.“Strategic deals will go ahead. But not just deals that are strategic for the company, deals that are strategic for China Inc,” says Apoorva Shah, co-head of M&A in Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.

Nearly eight months after the announcement, that deal is still being reviewed by US regulators. Seven other acquisitions over the past two years are yet to gain regulatory approval.More recently, HNA, through Avolon Holdings, the aircraft leasing company it acquired in July 2015, agreed to pay $10bn for the rival leasing arm of US-based CIT Group. It also owns Swissport International, the ground handling and cargo services group that was also formerly part of Swissair. It purchased another former Swissair business, air services company Gategroup, for $1.5bn in April this year.

Occupancy rates plateaued in the second quarter at 69.4 per cent, up just 0.6 per cent on the same period in 2015, according to STR, a data and analytics group.During the peak before the financial crisis, occupancy rates hit 63 per cent.“We’re probably in the later innings of this cycle,” said Dan Wasiolek, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. “Revpar [revenue per available room] has probably peaked, but that doesn’t mean it won’t be positive.”Lukas Hartwich, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors, said he expects revenue growth rates to remain low until profits in the energy sector recover and multinationals loosen travel budgets. “The macro backdrop is driving the bus right now,” he said.Hilton Worldwide revised its guidance on full year revenue growth on Wednesday, citing a slowdown in corporate bookings, to a range of 2-4 per cent per available room, down from previous estimates of 3-5 per cent.It also revised down its estimate of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the year from $3.02bn-$3.1bn to $2.98bn-$3.04bn.Marriott International followed suit, limiting 2016 revenue growth to roughly 3 per cent per available room, on a constant dollar basis, from earlier estimates of 3-5 per cent.The company, which excluded the potential impact from its takeover of Starwood, revised down its adjusted ebitda to $1.9bn-$1.97bn from $1.89bn-$1.9bn.Laura Paugh, global chief investor relations officer at Marriott, said business bookings have had an effect on revpar since the fourth quarter of 2015. “With the economy growing slower than we’d like, we’re trying to make up for that dearth of business travellers with leisure [travellers] at lower rates,” she said.Instability in the global economy, including fallout from the Brexit vote, terror events in Europe and the recession in Brazil, have also put pressure on performance.Starwood Hotels reported second quarter declines in revenue per available room in Latin America and Africa and the Middle East of 5.1 per cent and 9.7 per cent respectively. The W Hotels chain owner reported global revenue growth of 1.4 per cent per available room.The large hotel operators, which survived the financial crisis by selling off property and becoming primarily hotel managers rather than owners, have been racing to add scale and consolidate.Marriott’s cash-and-stock takeover of Starwood, worth $13.6bn when it was agreed in March, awaits regulatory clearance from China.Ms Paugh said Marriott has been in a “two horse race” with Hilton to add new units. “If you’re a developer and looking to select a brand, Marriott and Hilton are pretty much taking the lion share of new development. What will be interesting is how the Starwood brand plays into that,” she said.With the closing of the Starwood deal, Marriott is expected to top the list of largest hotels by room size. In the second quarter the group added close to 11,000 net rooms, while Hilton added 10,400.Marriott shares are up 5.2 per cent this year, slightly trailing behind the Baird/STR hotel index, which is up 5.6 per cent. Hilton, the largest hotel operator by market cap, has gained 8.3 per cent.
19;HLT;Hilton Inc;2016-07-27T12:51:53Z;Investors check out of Hilton after guidance cut;;Investors were checking out of Hilton shares on Wednesday.Shares in the US hotel operator fell by as much as 4 per cent in pre-market trading after the company cut its earnings outlook for the year amid tightening corporate travel budgets in the US and global economic uncertainty weighed on room bookings overseas.Hilton, the world’s largest hotel operator by market value, said it now expected 2016 revenue per available room, a key industry metric, to increase by 2-4 per cent on a comparable and currency neutral basis, down from its earlier forecast of 3-5 per cent, report Pan Kwan Yuk and Aimee Keane in New York.Adjusted earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) for the year were also revised lower to $2.98bn-$3.04bn, compared to its previous guidance of $3.02bn-$3.1bn.The cuts come as Hilton – which in addition to the eponymous hotel chain also owns the Conrad hotel brand – reported weaker than expected second quarter sales and profits.Revenue for the June quarter came in at $3.05bn, a 4.4 per cent increase compared to the prior year period but a shade below the $3.06bn the market was expecting.Net income attributable to shareholders rose to $239m, or 24 cents a share. However adjusted earnings, at 25 cents a share, were 1 cent below analysts forecast.Weaker than expected sales this quarter were offset by a 9 per cent growth in management and franchise fees, an area Hilton has said it will focus on as the company prepares to spin off its real estate and timeshare businesses into two separate publicly traded entities.RevPAR rose 2.9 per cent this quarter, below the 3-5 per cent increase that Hilton said it was expecting in April.Shares in Hilton, down 11 per cent over the past 12 months, were down 2 per cent in pre-market trading. They had traded by as much as 4 per cent lower earlier.
20;HLT;Hilton Inc;2016-04-05T16:25:53Z;Inside the deal: How Anbang’s chairman Wu nearly landed Starwood;Audacious bid for Starwood Hotels shows China’s global ambition;"As he summoned executives to his 26th-floor office on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue last month, Wu Xiaohui seemed to have achieved the improbable feat of transforming himself from a low-level regional bureaucrat into one of China’s most politically-connected global tycoons before the age of 50. But now he was ready for his most ambitious act yet.The chairman of Anbang, a fast-moving but little understood Chinese insurer, had acquired his US headquarters, with views of some of New York’s greatest properties, only last year.Now, just a block from the St Regis Hotel — John Jacob Astor’s 1904 temple to hospitality — he presented his team with a proposal: a $13bn deal that would make him the operator not only of that historic property but also its parent, Starwood Hotels & Resorts, owner of the W, Westin and Sheraton brands.The problem was that Starwood had already rebuffed Mr Wu three times in August, September and November, dissatisfied with details of the Chinese company’s bid, including its financing. Since then, Starwood had agreed a mostly stock-based sale to Marriott International, a US rival, in a deal initially worth $12.2bn but which had slumped in value as markets slid early this year.To the strong-willed, inexhaustible Mr Wu this looked like an opportunity. However, a debate ensued in Anbang’s offices.“Most senior managers disagreed,” says one participant. “We suggested that Marriott was well connected, not only in the US but also in China. There would be a lot of publicity. But we all knew he [Mr Wu] is the chairman. He is the only decision maker. Everybody follows him.”And the boss, who is not fluent in English, had made up his mind: Anbang would unleash one of the fiercest bid battles in recent memory and attempt to strike China’s biggest deal to date in the US. He would ultimately fail.But his efforts would also symbolise China’s rising role in global business, providing insights into the country’s outward ambitions and the obstacles it must overcome to compete on the international stage.When, in March, Starwood revealed that it had received an unsolicited, all-cash proposal from an Anbang-led group at $76 per share, valuing the US company at $13bn, it caused a sensation. It raised the unthinkable prospect of a Chinese upstart wresting an agreed bid away from an American business with an 89-year record.Marriott had been within weeks of getting shareholder approval for its acquisition of Starwood, a deal that would make it the largest hotel company in the world at a time when online intermediaries have sliced into its booking fees.This time, Starwood saw “very convincing evidence” that Mr Wu had the cash in the US to complete the deal, says one person close to Starwood, which was working with Lazard, Citigroup and law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. “We had very high stakes if we messed up,” the person says. After a week of negotiations, Anbang’s $76 per share proposal had turned into an agreed $78 per share offer.Like the other entrepreneurs who have driven China’s overseas dealmaking boom, Mr Wu relied on a formidable network built through prior deals to pursue his agenda.Chief among these was Jon Gray, who runs the real-estate practice at Blackstone, the influential buyout group and asset manager. Mr Gray sold Mr Wu Manhattan’s flagship Waldorf Astoria hotel from Blackstone-controlled Hilton Worldwide in 2014 for $2bn, his Fifth Avenue headquarters for $415m and 16 US luxury hotels, including New York’s Essex House, for $6.5bn around the time of its renewed Starwood push.Mr Wu, who resides in the royal suite at the Waldorf when in New York, also brought in investment bankers from PJT Partners, a boutique advisory firm that spun out of Blackstone over a year ago, to assist him.This time, Mr Wu calculated that the presence of partners would aid his effort. He contacted Chris Flowers, a US private equity executive from whom he had bought a Belgian insurer and whose JC Flowers investment firm previously occupied the 26th-floor office that Anbang now controlled.Fred Hu, founder of Chinese private equity firm Primavera Capital and a former Goldman Sachs executive, also came on board. Mr Hu, originally from Hunan, is believed to have close ties with former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji.These two put up only a fraction of the funds for the deal, say several people familiar with the Anbang bid. “He could have had stronger partners,” says one person close to Anbang. “But he did not want that. He wanted to control everything.”Mr Flowers declined to comment and Mr Hu did not respond to requests for comment. Another person close to the process says that even his advisers had little sway: “American investment bankers know how to do American M&A, but he [Mr Wu] did it in his own style.”Marriott’s leadership felt the pressure to act quickly. “This was not a bluff,” says Arne Sorenson, chief executive of Marriott. “These guys [Anbang] are for real. You don’t come in with a $13bn fully financed offer unless you are serious.” Mr Sorenson, while in Havana, Cuba with a US presidential delegation, spent the weekend agreeing a new cash-and-stock bid for Starwood worth $79.53 a share.Mr Wu was determined to return with a counter-offer, but cracks in his strategy were starting to show. Under capital controls in China, the State Administration for Foreign Exchange insists on approving sizeable transactions that involve moving money abroad. In addition, the Chinese Insurance Regulatory Commission limits the size of transactions abroad to 15 per cent of the buyer’s total assets.How that is defined has never been clear cut, however. “The key issue is whether CIRC would allow the inclusion of consolidated assets, in the calculation of Anbang’s total assets,” noted one Hong Kong-based investor specialising in merger arbitrage. “If allowed, Anbang would not breach CIRC’s rule on overseas investment cap; if not, Anbang might not get regulatory approval to make the acquisitions.”Mr Wu told his advisers that the regulators would not be an issue. “He used to boast that he knew everyone there from the chairman to the doorman,” says one person who participated in the process.However, that claim was thrown into doubt when the respected Chinese journal Caixin reported that regulators believed the transaction value would breach the 15 per cent limit.For the Starwood bid, Anbang had secured a commitment from the state-owned China Construction Bank. But after the Caixin report, CCB’s commitment became less clear, according to two people familiar with the situation.Still, Mr Wu pressed on, raising his bid twice over the Easter weekend: first to $81 a share, then to $82.75, or $14bn — hoping that he was closing in on a knockout bid.This time Starwood said the latest Anbang proposal was likely to lead to a “superior offer” to Marriott’s terms, but privately pressed the Chinese bidder to provide greater clarity on financing and other details.As Anbang became less responsive, Starwood worried that the regulatory issues and questions over Anbang’s financing raised in the press were real. Those concerns proved well-founded on Thursday last week, when three letters arrived at Starwood — from Mr Wu, Mr Hu and Mr Flowers. They said the bidders were walking away, mysteriously citing “various market conditions”.Was it a fear of overpaying or pressures back home in China? One person with insight into the talks said that China’s regulators had “clipped the wings” of its high-flying chairman, while a second person confirmed that the problems were regulatory.A spokesman for Anbang rejected suggestions that its funding had fallen apart, that Mr Flowers and Mr Hu had put up only limited funds, and that its senior executives had doubts about a bid.“He wants to create a real international Chinese company and to be the number one businessman in China,” says one Anbang insider. “But he was not well prepared, and he did not listen to advice. He was too impatient to do the deal.”Regardless, the person close to Starwood says, Mr Wu made his mark. “They are using an insurance base to make interesting investments. The fact that they got this far is significant.”"
21;HLT;Hilton Inc;2016-02-26T11:14:30Z;Hilton to spin off timeshare business in shake-up;;Hilton Worldwide plans to spin off its timeshare business and carve out its property assets less than three years after the world’s largest hotel company returned to the US stock market.The hotelier’s 70 properties – home to about 35,000 rooms – will be become a real estate investment trust, offering investors the chance to bet on the value of its real estate assets. The timeshare business, Hilton Grand Vacations, will trade as a separate public company, according to the plan announced on Friday morning.Christopher Nassetta, who has run Hilton since the start of 2008, said the move will allow the three businesses to have capital structures better suited to their needs, and sharpen the focus of their respective management.The decision to split up the company is the most significant since Hilton’s initial public offering in 2013, six years after private equity firm Blackstone bought the chain for $26bn in one of the biggest leveraged buyouts on record.Hilton makes money from its timeshare business by selling a share in a property that gives them the right to use it for a certain period each year. The business generated about $1.2bn of Hilton’s revenues in 2014.Hilton said it expects both moves to be completed by the end of the year. Shares in Hilton popped 4 per cent higher in pre-market trading in New York.
22;HLT;Hilton Inc;2015-12-16T23:33:23Z;Hilton aims to inject hotel portfolio into Reit;Group seeks to capitalise on high property valuations;Hilton is aiming to spin off its hotels into a real estate investment trust, the latest in a wave of companies seeking to capitalise on high property valuations as the industry shifts attention to managing, rather than owning, hotels.Shares in Hilton, whose hotel portfolio could be worth about $12bn, according to analysts, jumped 5.3 per cent to $22.47 late on Wednesday. Its shares have slipped 14 per cent this year.“Investors are betting the entities would be valued more richly apart than combined,” said Lukas Hartwich, an analyst at Green Street Advisors.Hilton and Blackstone, which owns a minority stake in the group, declined to comment.Hilton has contacted the Internal Revenue Service for approval of the deal, according to people close to the situation. The popularity of Reit spin-offs has drawn attention from tax watchdogs: the IRS in September said it had “significant concerns”, while US House Republicans have proposed a bill to curb the activity — which would apply to deals closing on or after December 7.Chris Nassetta, Hilton’s chief, said in October that he was considering “strategic alternatives” and in June he told CNBC he was considering a Reit spin-off.As the property market has bounced back from recession, malls, restaurants, casinos, retailers and billboard companies have converted to Reits to unlock the value of their underlying property. Since 2008, the number of Reits in the US has jumped from 136 to 216.Reits pay low corporate taxes but must pay out at least 90 per cent of income as dividends, with shareholders then being taxed on this income.Sears in June spun off some properties and in November Darden Restaurants completed a spin-off, while activists have pressed McDonald’s and Macy’s to follow suit.In recent years big hotel groups have expanded via an “asset-light” model of managing rather than owning properties. Instead these companies have focused on building and growing their brands, leaving third parties to deal with the capital-intensive parts of property ownership.Hilton’s Reit spin-off would “separate two distinct business lines”, said Mr Hartwich, “letting investors choose whether they want to invest in hotel management or hotel real estate”.
23;HLT;Hilton Inc;2015-11-17T17:27:24Z;Hotels compete for staying power through round of M&A;Since hotel companies sold off assets and became managers rather than owners, the benefits of consolidation are compelling;It is check-in time for hotel companies in search of an upgrade.Marriott International’s $12.2bn approach for Starwood Hotels & Resorts only signals the beginning of a fresh round of dealmaking in the sector.Still to come: a $3bn deal for FRHI Hotels & Resorts, the owners of Fairmont, Raffles and Swissotel, a £1.5bn deal for the UK budget chain Travelodge, a €1bn deal for the French group B&B Hotels and a £595m deal for Atlas, a portfolio of 48 UK hotels.Then there is the prospect of other bidders trying to usurp Marriott in the race for Starwood. The deal does not complete until the middle of next year and Hilton and InterContinental Hotels Group may be interested in Starwood themselves.Since hotel companies sold off their assets and became hotel managers, rather than owners, the benefits of consolidation are compelling: it is the fastest route to growth, scale helps when dealing with big online travel agents, and costs can be trimmed.Mergers and acquisitions fall into a regular cycle and consolidation is being driven by the fragmented market.Arne Sorenson, the chief executive of Marriott, explained why he had returned for Starwood despite not being interested initially. “We were watching a lot of the online travel agencies consolidate and platforms like Google doing more in the travel sphere,” he said. “These things caused us to conclude that having 1m rooms and more resources would allow us to compete better.“We compete in an industry that is highly dispersed. No one really has significant market share. Even after this deal, we will not have significant market share. Marriott has 10 per cent of the US market, for example, and Starwood has 3-4 per cent. But being bigger we can have more dollars to spend effectively on technology, marketing, loyalty and so on.”This has been the biggest year for hotel deals since Blackstone bought Hilton Worldwide for $26bn in 2007. The M&A cycle in the hotel sector comes around every eight or so years, and lasts for two to three.From 1995 to 1997, ITT spun off Sheraton, Caesars World and Madison Square Garden into a separate company, Granada bought Forte for $8.1bn, CUC bought HFS, the owners of Ramada and Super 8, for $14.7bn and Starwood then bought ITT for $13.9bn.From 2005 to 2007, Hilton spun out its hotels business, Cendant spun out its Wyndham hotel business, property group Lightstone paid $8bn for Extended Stay, the mid-range hotel company, Apollo paid $27bn for Harrah’s hotel and casino group and Blackstone bought Hilton for $26bn.The cycle is determined by the industry’s swings in occupancy and room rates. This year, revenue per average room, the industry’s yardstick, rose to 13 per cent above where it was in the previous peak in the US cycle, just before the financial crisis, leading some commentators to comment that the current US cycle may be approaching its peak.It is difficult these days to recognise a hotel room. With the arrival of Airbnb and other sharing websites, any spare bedroom can potentially be a hotel room, and then there are campsites, hostels and micro bed-and-breakfasts.But even if the sharing economy is stripped out — leaving 17.5m hotel rooms worldwide — the industry is still very fragmented, and remains dominated by small individual businesses. The top 10 hotel companies only have one-third of the rooms on the market, with no one having more than 4.7 per cent of rooms globally. Only the airline and packaged food sectors are more fragmented, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.In Europe, the lack of a dominant market leader is even more apparent: the top five European operators account for only 14 per cent of rooms. In the US, they have 48 per cent of the total.In the past, when hotel companies owned their assets, it was difficult and extremely expensive to win scale. Hotel rooms are also a fairly similar product, with location being the most important factor. Today, brands are easier and cheaper to roll out and it is easier to have a consistent product across different countries.The world’s three-largest hotel groups have not been very successful at building global businesses. Hilton, Marriott and InterContinental Hotels have 83 per cent, 81 per cent and 65 per cent respectively of their rooms in the Americas.But different regions have their own economic cycles and diversification is a useful hedge for hotel companies. In 2007 and 2008, the Middle East was booming. In 2010 and 2011, Asia outperformed the rest of the market. Last year, it was the US that shone.Some analysts have suggested that US operators buy up either European or Asian rivals, but such deals are difficult to pull off. By buying Starwood, Marriott is getting access to a company with a strong Asia presence, even as it expands its own Asian arm organically. In recent months, Marriott has opened a new hotel in mainland China every fortnight.For the Chinese company Jin Jiang Plateno, there is a need and desire to move beyond the mainland and acquire foreign assets. Starwood and Accor have arguably the most balanced and diversified portfolios.Hotel companies, now that they have become merely collections of brands rather than the owners of hotels, face an existential crisis from online travel agents.Customers often prefer to shop around on comparison websites rather than going directly to their preferred hotel company’s site. That gives the online travel agents more clout when setting the commissions they charge for their service.To fight back, many hotel companies are now turning themselves, in part, into online travel agents. Marriott, Hilton and Starwood have all opened up their website bookings to independent hotels. Consolidation brings with it more marketing budget to advertise hotel brands and launch national campaigns.Hotels are also prioritising their loyalty programmes. Not only do the schemes provide important insights into consumer behaviour, but customers who are part of the Starwood programme, for example, spend 20 per cent more per room and spend more while they are staying at a hotel.Consolidation helps build bigger loyalty programmes which then in turn attract more members and offer a greater range of benefits. InterContinental has the largest rewards scheme, with 84m members, with Marriott having 49m and Starwood 20m. By comparison, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both have between 90m and 100m members.
24;HLT;Hilton Inc;2015-11-16T17:58:11Z;Marriott makes return trip for Starwood;US hotel group is not the only one trying to book into rival;Seven months ago, when Starwood Hotels & Resorts put itself up for sale, Marriott International was not interested.Starwood — the owner of the Sheraton, St Regis and W Hotel brands — had seemingly lost its way, unsure of how to ride the hotel industry boom. It was growing more slowly than its rivals, and investors complained about how little cash it was returning.“We jumped in seven months ago and took a quick look at the information that was available,” admitted Arne Sorenson, the chief executive of Marriott.“Initially, we were not very interested and we communicated to the guys running the process that we were not going after this,” he added.But blue-chip hotel companies do not come up for sale often, and Mr Sorenson kept thinking about a merger that would create the world’s largest hotel group, with 1.1m rooms.Then, as the months passed, the share prices of the two companies began to move closer, raising the possibility of a deal made up largely of equity. “From our initial unenthusiasm, we saw a couple of things,” Mr Sorenson said. “There was about a 15 per cent swing in our equity values . . . That was one of the things that changed.”“And we were watching a lot of the online travel agencies consolidate and the platforms like Google doing more in the travel sphere. All of these things caused us to conclude that having 1m rooms and more resources to apply against this would allow us to compete better.”Finally, he came to the same conclusion as the rest of the market: as the hotel industry hits record occupancy levels and room rates, especially in the United States, bigger is best. Or, as Marriott put it on Monday: “Today, size matters.”Mr Sorenson said: “We think there are a number of advantages. But we compete in an industry that is highly dispersed. No one really has significant market share. Even after this deal, we will not have significant market share. Marriott has 10 per cent of the US and Starwood has 3 per cent, for example. Even together we are relatively small. But being bigger we can have more dollars to spend effectively in technology, marketing, loyalty and so on.”Putting Marriott and Starwood together in a $12.2bn deal will generate $200m of cost savings, the companies calculated. “We think this is earnings accretive essentially from the get-go,” said Mr Sorenson.He added that by using equity rather than cash to buy Starwood, the risk profile of the combined group does not change. “We have not levered up our balance sheet,” he said. “We are not taking on incremental risk.”But Starwood did not just attract Marriott: and there are still other suitors circling, leading the two companies to agree a $400m break fee on the deal.“Will other bidders crash the deal? We hope they won’t,” Mr Sorenson says. “We think we have got a great deal for shareholders and we hope it completes.”Even so, Hilton Worldwide, the world’s number one hotel company by number of rooms, may enter the fray, concerned that it will be overtaken in size if Marriott clinches Starwood.Behind Hilton is Hyatt, which was reported to be in advanced talks over its own cash-and-shares bid for Starwood only three weeks ago. It knows that acquiring the group represents a chance to catch up with the likes of Marriott and Hilton in terms of size, and create the largest hotel group in Asia. But Hyatt would need to raise fresh capital to fund a deal.And then there are InterContinental Hotel Group (IHG) and three Chinese companies, including Jin Jiang Plateno, the country’s biggest hotel group by number of rooms.Deal will create world’s largest hotel group with 1.1m roomsRead moreHilton’s chief executive, Chris Nassetta, has already signalled that his company is ready to start making acquisitions.“In our business, having huge scale matters, having very large geographic diversity matters, and having a broad price point matters,” he said in a recent interview. “There are other players . . . who, because of the way they are made up, can’t create that loyalty effect to drive those high market share numbers. We can.”Advisers acting for IHG and Starwood held talks in July. But people familiar with the process say IHG was unsure whether Starwood’s acting chief executive, Adam Aron, had really wanted to sell.By the beginning of this month, IHG had been considering a new approach but was scuppered again by media speculation. After putting out a statement denying its interest on November 6, it cannot now engage with Starwood without making a public declaration.Chinese groups might have the means — and buying Starwood would be a way of arriving on the world stage. However, they might find it difficult to win Chinese government approval for such a significant deal.Both sets of companies are assuming the integration riskFull storyOne of Starwood’s main attractions is its position as one of the world’s most innovative hoteliers, having pioneered high-end lifestyle hotels with its W brand. Its former chief executive Frits Van Paasschen, also introduced keyless entry with mobile phones, an Apple Watch app, robot staff and a social media presence both for customer service and brand building.But he left the company in February after investors grew frustrated at Starwood’s slow expansion at a time when the market was booming. Over the seven years of Mr Van Paasschen’s tenure, Starwood grew its hotel portfolio by less than 5 per cent a year, to 1,207 properties.By contrast, Mr Sorenson has presided over a group that intends to grow its room numbers by 7 per cent next year and still return $2.25bn in dividends and share buybacks this year. Marriott, which is opening a new hotel every fortnight in China, now has more than 4,300 hotels and a loyalty programme with 54m members.If Mr Sorenson could secure Starwood, it would change the hotel industry landscape. But the deal is not scheduled to complete until the middle of next year, and other companies may yet try to cancel his booking.
25;HLT;Hilton Inc;2015-07-22T23:58:42Z;Volunteers find it hard to put their skills to good use;Businesses and staff want to help non-profits but often face structural challenges;LinkedIn made a surprising discovery when it launched an online service for executives wanting to use their skills to volunteer at non-profits. While more than 6m people have ticked the appropriate box on their LinkedIn profile, only 55,000 volunteer opportunities have been listed.According to Meg Garlinghouse, who leads LinkedIn for Good, the company’s social impact programme, the gap is growing “wider and wider”. “Every week, we get about 100,000 more professionals checking the box but we only get a couple of hundred more opportunities on the network.”Conventional wisdom has it that most non-profits are crying out for volunteers but the reality is more complex. Many such groups are small organisations that may not have the health and safety policies large companies require. It takes time and resources for non-profits to find appropriate tasks for executives, to train them and to manage their time.“Companies don’t recognise the costs to the [voluntary] sector of taking on business volunteers,” says Jon Burchell, senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield, who has been studying employer-sponsored volunteering with Joe Cook, a senior lecturer at Hull University Business School.In a continuing research project that began in 2011, they have found that non-profits need help in becoming “employee ready” and in presenting activities and volunteering opportunities effectively to businesses.More companies want to send their executives into the non-profit world. Rather than have staff painting schools or serving in soup kitchens, they want them to tackle volunteer projects where they can use their professional skills. Potential volunteers often want that, too. In a recent LinkedIn survey, 79 per cent of members said they favoured skilled over non-skilled volunteer opportunities, Ms Garlinghouse says.Movements have sprung up around this idea. In the US, the A Billion + Change campaign aims to increase the number of companies making pro bono commitments. It says that since it launched two years ago, more than 500 companies have given non-profits $2bn in skills-based and pro bono volunteer services.Businesses such as Hilton Worldwide, ToysRUs, Chevron and American Airlines have signed up as “Pledge Companies”, promising to create volunteer programmes and report on their progress. The organisation gives these companies access to free consulting services and other resources to help them expand their programmes.More than 500 companies have given non-profits $2bn in skills-based and pro bono servicesCompanies are also developing internal systems that help staff find appropriate volunteering opportunities and match those with professional skills.For example, Catchafire, a New York-based organisation that connects skilled professionals with non-profit and social enterprises, has created a portal for the Merck SkillShare programme, which the pharmaceutical company (known as MSD outside the US and Canada) launched in the US in March. The portal allows employees to search for volunteering opportunities.And employees do not necessarily need to leave their desks. “These are virtual projects, so someone sitting in Boston can provide skills to an organisation in California,” explains Brenda Colatrella, executive director of corporate responsibility at Merck.IBM has built its own platform, the On Demand Community, to provide an online hub for volunteer activities for both employees and retirees.For companies that have their own foundations or community investment projects, it can be easier to generate sufficient numbers of volunteering opportunities. Many of the projects Merck offers its employees, for example, are posted by non-profits that are Merck Foundation grantees. Similarly, while non-profits can post projects on IBM’s On Demand Community website, the company can also tap into its own corporate citizenship initiatives to find projects at partner organisations.However, not all companies have the resources to build volunteering websites and many do not have the extensive philanthropic activities that generate volunteering opportunities.Here, technology can play a role through websites such as Catchafire and LinkedIn, which recently extended its volunteer service to the UK and Ireland.Meanwhile, some organisations are supporting the infrastructure that will boost volunteering. California-based Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation, for example, funds organisations such as the Taproot Foundation, which helps US non-profits find professionals to volunteer in areas such as marketing, strategy, HR and IT. Taproot also helps companies create pro bono programmes.“Non-profits are often forced to tackle very complex problems without obvious solutions and are trying to figure out how to absorb all this talent,” says Christy Remey Chin, a partner at the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation. “So these intermediaries are critical.”Certainly, if the claims of the A Billion + Change are true, more effective matching between non-profits and corporate volunteers could make a significant contribution to helping solve some of the world’s social and environmental problems.
26;HLT;Hilton Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Waldorf Astoria NY hotel sold to China’s Anbang for $1.95bn;Hilton to manage hotel for 100 more years after sale of Manhattan landmark to Chinese insurer;Hilton is selling the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel, a Manhattan landmark, to Chinese insurance group Anbang for $1.95bn.The sale allows the companies to “finally maximise the full value of this iconic asset on a full city block in midtown Manhattan”, said Christopher Nassetta, chief executive of Hilton Worldwide. The 1,413-room art deco building on Park Avenue, built in 1931, will undergo a “major renovation”.Hilton will continue managing the hotel for the next 100 years under its new ownership. The Virginia-based hotel chain, majority-owned by Blackstone, had about $11bn in net debt as of end-June, and said it would use the proceeds to buy more hotel assets in the US, with acquisitions to be announced at a later date.The hotel “is an asset that requires a lot of capital expenditure to bring it up to market”, said Nikhil Bhalla, vice-president of equity research at FBR Securities. “It has too many rooms, so it would have been difficult to raise rates with such a large inventory.”Anbang will probably look at alternative uses of the hotel, Mr Bhalla added, such as condominiums, to capitalise on the hot New York residential market and shrink the number of hotel rooms.Beijing-based Anbang, founded in 2004, has more than Rmb700bn in assets and provides financial and insurance services to more than 20m customers, according to a statement.Anbang is paying $1.3m per room, or $356 per day for 10 years, according to FT Alphaville calculations. A basic room at the Waldorf Astoria New York costs $329 a night, plus tax, although rooms can cost more than $2,000 a night, according to its website.Blackstone bought Hilton in 2007, in one of the largest-ever leveraged buyouts, when the ailing hotel group was saddled with $20bn of debt. Blackstone put up nearly $1bn in additional cash to refinance Hilton’s debt, which eventually paid off, generating $8.5bn for Blackstone when Hilton went public in the biggest-ever lodging IPO last year.The original Waldorf hotel opened in 1893 at a site on Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street where millionaire William Waldorf Astor had his mansion. Conrad Hilton bought the later building in 1949, calling it the “greatest of them all”.It has been a haunt for celebrities for the past century, once a home to Marilyn Monroe, and often referenced in film and television. The Gossip Girl series was filmed there until 2012. The hotel was named an official New York City landmark in 1993.This is not the first upscale New York hotel to be scooped up by foreign investors. The Carlyle hotel was sold to Hong Kong billionaire Cheng Yu-tung in 2011, while the Plaza Hotel, at the corner of central park in Manhattan, is owned by jailed Indian tycoon Subrata Roy, who has been attempting to sell it.
27;HLT;Hilton Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Thomas Pritzker, Hyatt chairman: a billionaire with many faces;Breaking up the family empire was painful, now he wants to be seen as a builder;"Tom Pritzker sees himself as an entrepreneur and a good part of his $3.2bn fortune has indeed been the result of his own efforts. So it is frustrating for him when others do not see him quite that way, focusing on the money he inherited instead.“I hate it when people use the word ‘scion’ to describe me,” he says. “I always ask myself, ‘is the money really yours?’ I see myself as a founder. I try to do things by merit.” Nevertheless, he concedes that “there is a big dichotomy between how I see myself and how others do”.Mr Pritzker and his cousin Penny, secretary of commerce in US President Barack Obama’s administration, are the face of the Chicago-based Pritzker family, collectively best known for its control of the Hyatt hotel chain as well as for a well-publicised and bitter dispute among cousins that led to a break-up of the empire.Mr Pritzker, number 530 on the Forbes list of the world’s wealthiest individuals, was the driving force of that break-up, which took more than 10 years and involved 300 companies.He is in New York for the opening of the Park Hyatt Hotel, which towers over Carnegie Hall on 57th Street in midtown and casts a daunting shadow over Central Park for part of the day. Mr Pritzker sits at a choice table in the wood-
panelled Back Room restaurant and greets staff as if Hyatt were still a family business rather than a listed corporation. That said, the 64-year-old remains the business’s largest shareholder and chairman.It was his great-grandfather Nicholas who created the platform for the family’s business success, fleeing the pogroms and likely compulsory military service of Ukraine for the US at the age of 10. But it was three siblings from a later generation – Donald, Jay and Robert Pritzker – who really struck it rich.Jay, Tom’s father, bought the hotel that became the nucleus of the Hyatt chain in 1957. Today, the company has a market capitalisation of $10bnafter a minority stake was listed in 2009.The hotel chain had been the highest profile part of the family empire that was broken up in the aftermath of Jay’s death in 1999.Born Chicago, 1950Education BA from Claremont Men’s College and MBA and JD degrees from the University of ChicagoCareer1976: attorney, Katten Muchin1979: is named president of Hyatt and family’s merchant bank1981-84: co-founds and helps build Triton Containers and First Health1999: is named chairman of Hyatt and Pritzker Architecture Prize1999: co-founds Reliant Pharmaceuticals2000s: leads restructuring of family enterpriseFamily Married to Margot, three sonsInterests Archaeology in western Himalayas, foreign policy“Presiding over the dissolution was painful,” he says. “There were many different views about the family situation. In most things, it is possible to make a course correction but this was a decision that was irreversible. If you make an acquisition, for example, and you are wrong, you can mitigate what you’ve done. You don’t agonise. You just calculate whether this math is better than that math.”For a man who takes pride in building businesses, Mr Pritzker has also had to learn to take pride in exiting on the right terms. His first big sale was Conwood, a smokeless tobacco company that fetched $3.5bn to be divided among the squabbling heirs.One of the companies in the empire that Mr Pritzker was particularly proud of was Marmon, an industrial conglomerate with interests from vehicle parts to railway carriages. He ran the business after his uncle Robert retired and boosted sales, before eventually selling it to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.“I wanted to find the right home for it,” he says. “I considered an auction but auctions involve risk. You may get a market clearing price but not a home that reflects us.”But the sale of Marmon was complicated by the fact that it was 2007 and mortgage funds under the umbrella of Wall Street firms were beginning to blow up. “By the time we began talking it was around Christmas of 2007 and I was scared to death,” he says. “I was very concerned about the timing.”“I knew Warren Buffett was the right home and it made sense for Berkshire Hathaway,” he recalls. “So I had Byron Trott, [a leading Chicago-based banker] call him representing us. From that first call to signing took 13 days.”He pauses. “I also knew I could only be half wrong,” he adds. “I only sold him 60 per cent at first.” The rest of the stake was sold down over time.Still, the stress when Mr Pritzker presents himself is usually on what he has built rather than what he has inherited or sold. These businesses range from healthcare companies to a container leasing concern that he started with $1m and now has $5bn in assets.Hyatt still retains the aura of a private company, which is to say that it has a reputation for being less open than other public companies, including its rival Hilton Worldwide, which secured a stock exchange listing much more recently.In its defence, Hyatt executives say the company does not believe in certain metrics the industry uses and therefore does not disclose them.Mr Pritzker says Hyatt is in better shape than it was five years ago when it became a publicly traded company. “We are more focused. And it is my job to make sure we maintain our core values.”“The connection between Hyatt and the Pritzkers is meaningful,” says Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt’s chief executive. “It gives Hyatt a face.”Mr Pritzker suggests that the culture at Hyatt is very people-centred. He quotes the late Conrad Hilton, founder of the Hilton chain, who famously said that the most important thing for a hotel was “location, location, location”: “For Hyatt it is people, people, people.”However, Hyatt has a long history of disputes with both union and non-union employees. Unite Here, a union that represents hotel workers, was locked in a bitter dispute with the group for four years and only last July reached a settlement that involved an increase in wages and the promise to preserve pension and healthcare benefits until 2018.Workers also air their grievances on a website, Hyatt Hurts, on such matters as how many rooms they have to clean.Mr Pritzker says he is not averse to unions (one of his three sons is a member of a carpenters union) and is concerned about matters such as income inequality. However, he believes the key to lessening the gap between rich and poor is education.“Unfortunately, regulation or redistribution through the tax system is not sustainable,” he says. “You have to have inequality within an acceptable range. You need education and you need growth to create opportunity.”Mr Pritzker, who is on the board of the University of Chicago, has sponsored research and data mining in search of practical information on how to improve urban education in the US.The billionaire’s philanthropic activities have also included financing research into mental health issues after one of his sisters killed herself. He channelled money to both universities and drug companies in an effort to combine private-sector discipline with non-profit goals in this area.A longstanding interest in the mountainous border region that China and Tibet share with India and Nepal has also led to him being named an honorary professor at Sichuan University. He has hiked extensively in the region and spent his honeymoon there.He has been going to China for almost 40 years and lobbied for a recent Pritzker Architecture Prize – set up by his father Jay – to be awarded in Beijing at the Great Hall of the People. An art collector, he also chairs the board of trustees at the prestigious Art Institute of Chicago.Mr Pritzker acknowledges that he has a large number of different identities, including the entrepreneurial one he is so keen that people recognise. “I think like a founder. I only ever wanted to play with the capital that I earned.

He let them back to the group on 25-year leases.Most big hotel operators at the time were reducing freehold assets by selling properties to real estate investors to concentrate on their core operating businesses.Under the original structure of the deal, Mr Tchenguiz’s leases were secured against the Hilton group of companies. But later as part of a group reorganisation, Hilton tried to assign the hotels’ leases to separate subsidiary companies, against which the guarantees would be secured.This would have watered down Mr Tchenguiz’s scope for financial remedy from the group if any of the hotels had become financially troubled. Under the new legal structure, the wider Hilton group was released from its contractual obligations to Tindall.The Court of Appeal on Friday ruled against Hilton and in favour of Tindall, backing a High Court judgment this year. The High Court ruled that Hilton had breached the terms of the leases, but Hilton appealed.Hilton was ordered to pay Tindall’s costs for both court hearings, which amount to £100,000.Law firm BLP acted for Tindell. Roger Cohen, BLP real estate disputes partner, said the judgment was “an important decision for parties who have entered into leases where the covenant of a guarantor is critical to the deal”.The win is the latest legal victory for Mr Tchenguiz, who accepted a £3m settlement from the Serious Fraud Office in July. He and younger brother Robert had sued the agency for a record £300m in damages over a botched criminal inquiry.Mr Tchenguiz was unavailable for comment.Hilton was represented by law firm Paul Hastings.Hilton Worldwide said: “As it is not our practice to comment on legal proceedings, we are unfortunately unable to comment further outside of highlighting that we remain fully committed to our leased estate in the UK.”
29;HLT;Hilton Inc;2014-07-18T16:20:36Z;Checking in on Blackstone’s Hilton trade;;"On Thursday, our colleague Henny Sender reported on Blackstone’s strong second-quarter earnings (assets under management have soared to a staggering $279bn).She also pointed out to Lex that Steve Schwarzman, Blackstone co-founder and CEO, claimed that the once troubled Hilton Worldwide has yielded $12bn worth of returns. Blackstone had acquired Hilton at the peak of LBO boom in 2007 and it had once symbolized the excess of that era. Here’s a Lex note that explains the numbers on its turnaround which have only gotten improved since its re-listing in December 2013.From the earnings call transcript on Thursday:Our second quarter realizations of $18 [ph] billion included several strategic sales, as well as 5 public market dispositions, one of
which was our first sale of Hilton shares. We also successfully executed a loan against part of our Hilton position, which returned over $2 billion of capital to our Limited Partners but preserved future upside on the shares, which continue to perform very well.Hilton’s current share price equates to a multiple of 2.8x our original investment and implies a total gain of almost $12 billion, which we believe is the largest private equity gain in history.Later in the call Tony James, Blackstone President, explained how the firm executed the loan transaction mentioned above:Marc S. Irizarry
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionYes. Just one question on Private Equity in, I guess, 2 parts. The first is on Hilton and the loan on the position. Is that unusual for
your Private Equity business to take out a loan on the equity? And maybe you can help explain how that maybe can enhance returns to LPs, and if that’s unusual?Okay, Marc, it’s Tony. I’d say that recapitalizations, as a general category, are not at all unusual. And with private companies,
sometimes, it’ll be you leave the same leverage at the operating company, but you’ll do a holding company debenture of some sort
and pay out a dividend. In a sense, that’s a — with public companies, you have the option because they are publicly traded securities
of doing more of a margin loan. And so as our portfolio shifted from predominantly private to a lot of public positions, some of them
quite large, I think you’d see some more of that here and there. And the way it — and what it does, of course, is it arbitrages a little
bit of cost of funds. So we can borrow a margin loan at very low interest rates. LT could probably give me a specific one, but I don’t
remember it off the top of my head, and replace with that — and give that back to our LPs that are looking to get 20% a year return.
So by arbitraging that, they’re very happy. And even the pref on our funds, which was, in the old days, the preferred return was set at about government bond rates. Today, it’s like 8% government bond rates are 2 or less. It’s gotten — so the preferred return has become a really significant hurdle, and so if we can borrow at much less than the pref, it allows us to accrue carry faster on the
remaining the gains. So there’s some interesting things about that, and so that’s why we do it. Though, as a general category of things
to do, it’s not unusual. But we haven’t done a lot of it in this particular form because we haven’t, until recently, haven’t had big public
positions. And by the way, we could sell the stock, too, but we love the company, and the company is doing spectacularly well. So
we’re accruing what we think is a lot of value still on that equity. So this allows us to sort of have our cake and eat it, too, get some
money off the table at very low cost and continue to have 100% of the upside on the stocks. So we sort of like that. OAs Mr James mentions at first, dividend recapitalizations are common for private companies whereby the portfolio company borrows and pays a dividend to its PE owners.Here, however, Blackstone is borrowing against its own position, not the company, to pay a dividend. The “pref” it refers to is the preferred return its limited partners are entitled to, of 8 per cent. The first 8 per cent of the fund’s returns belong to the limited partners such as pension funds who have provided Blackstone with capital to investment. That rate is negotiated between the Blackstone and its fund investors. As Mr James states, the preferred return rate was similar to government bond rates when private equity started as an industry but has diverged as interest rates have fallen sharply.Once that preferred return is reached, then Blackstone is entitled to its “carried interest” which is 20 per cent of the investment profits thereafter (with 80 per cent going to fund investors).As Mr. James says, 8 per cent is a high hurdle in this low interest rate environment. However, it can exploit low borrowing rates to accelerate returns to limited partners, so Blackstone can get to the carried interest more quickly. Just the latest example of how clever at financial engineering these guys are."
30;HLT;Hilton Inc;2014-06-01T23:01:43Z;Hilton Worldwide eyes future in boutique hotels;;Hilton Worldwide is launching a new brand aimed at upscale travellers as the recently-relisted US hotel group seeks to catch up with rivals that have pushed ahead in the boutique hotels sector.The Virginia-based hotel operator will announce on Monday that it plans to build a collection of four and five-star independently operated urban and resort hotels under the Curio brand, which it expects to make “material” contributions to earnings in years to come.Hilton is targeting upscale boutique hotels in mature markets, the majority in the US and Europe, said chief executive Chris Nassetta ahead of the launch of the brand.“These are rare, statement hotels that have their own following. There has been a huge demand for these types of properties,” he added.Hilton also intends to launch a “lifestyle” brand for technology savvy travellers later this year, which Mr Nassetta said would be cheaper and would attract a wider demographic than rivals.Neither of the new brands will contribute much to Hilton’s earnings this year, but will have a “material impact” over time, starting in 2015, Mr Nassetta said.The expansion will be implemented exclusively using an asset-light business model, where franchises and management contracts are preferred to outright ownership.So far, it has signed agreements with five US hotels, including the SLS Las Vegas. It is expected to secure two more deals in Doha and Dubai in the coming days. Mr Nassetta said that over the next five years it would seek to bring “hundreds” of independent hotels into the Curio collection.Analysts said the two brands would fill a gap that has long hindered the hotel group. Hilton’s first attempt at launching a lifestyle brand – Denizen, in 2009 – was thwarted by Starwood Hotels & Resorts, which alleged corporate espionage in a lawsuit. As part of a settlement Hilton agreed not to develop another brand in this category until January 2013.February 2014: Caesars and Hilton: a tale of two hospitality leveraged buyouts.Starwood’s own W brand, which launched in 1998, quickly became popular with young, affluent travellers looking for a boutique hotel experience. Marriott International and InterContinental Hotel Group have since created their own versions.Boutique hotels with quirky traits have become more popular as travellers have increasingly sought out alternatives to chain hotels. Hotel groups are also looking to capitalise on greater demand for luxury experiences among the wealthy.The creation of the Curio brand comes six months after Hilton returned to public markets, raising $2.35bn in an initial public offering in December. Private equity group Blackstone, which bought the group for an enterprise value of $26bn in 2007, retains a 76 per cent stake in the company.The company, which opened 9,000 rooms in the three months to the end of March, reported net income for the first quarter of $124m, compared with $38m in the same period last year.

MetLife increased 1.37 per cent to $50.22, while Prudential inched 0.97 per cent higher to $81.09.Europe was the only sour note in the latest quarter for Tiffany & Co as the high-end jeweller reported a jump in earnings and lifted its profit forecast for the year.Sales growth in China, Japan, Australia and the US catapulted the New York-based retailer’s revenues up 13 per cent to $1bn in the quarter to April 30 from $895m in the same quarter the year before.Same-store sales – a key metric for retailers – climbed 11 per cent when excluding the effect of currencies, comfortably ahead of Wall Street’s forecast for 4.8 per cent.“If sales strength were to continue at the same pace in the US, Europe, and Asia-Pac, and we assume a slowdown in Japan given the pull-forward this quarter associated with sales tax change April 1, earnings per share could be in the $4.70 range,” Wells Fargo analyst Paul Lejuez said.The jeweller forecast earnings per share as high as $4.25. Shares in the company jumped as much as 10 per cent to $97.40, a record high, before closing up 9.1 per cent at $96.30.Shares of beleaguered department store chain Sears dipped 3.7 per cent to $36.56 after Sears Canada, the chain in which it holds a 51 per cent stake, reported a wider than expected loss in the quarter amid depressed winter sales.Sears Canada said it lost C$75.2m, or 74 Canadian cents a share, for the quarter, compared to a C$31.2m loss a year earlier. Sales declined 11 per cent to C$772m.Sears Canada shares fell 0.65 per cent to C$15.21.Sears, which has said it is exploring a sale of the unit, has itself struggled to right sales. Same-store sales at Sears dropped 7.8 per cent in the three months to February 1.US hotel operator La Quinta rose after the company eclipsed Wall Street’s expectations in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, following a disappointing initial public offering this April that saw the company sell shares below its initial targets.Revenues in the three months to March 31 rose 7 per cent from a year earlier to $227.7m, ahead of analyst forecasts for $225.2m, while its net loss narrowed 24 per cent from a year earlier to $7.3m.La Quinta also said it expected full-year adjusted earnings between $362m and $368m compared with estimates for $363.3m.The company, which operates 839 hotels with 84,000 rooms in North America, said it would work to reduce its outstanding debt in the current quarter, which totalled $2.1bn.

Profits more than tripled to $123m, or 12 cents per share.Hilton said it had approximately 200,000 rooms in its pipeline, including more than 80,000 in the US – the company’s largest market.“We like the brand strength, robust room pipeline, potential to release value from its real estate, debt reduction strategy and capital-light business model,” Jefferies analyst Ian Rennardson said. “Expect shares to perform well today.”Shares rose 5 per cent following the results, before closing up 1.9 per cent at $23.07. Rival Hyatt Hotels dipped 0.2 per cent to $57.15 while Starwood Hotels rose 0.62 per cent to $78.99.Gap shares were among the top performing on the benchmark S&P 500 after the US retailer reported better than expected April sales and said first-quarter profits would top its own guidance.Executives at the company said they were pleased with the results, which included an 18 per cent year-over-year sales rise at Old Navy and 3 per cent rise at its namesake Gap brand in April.“We continue to like Gap’s focus on protecting and growing margins, returning cash, and future-proofing through omnichannel investment,” Citi analyst Oliver Chen said.Gap shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $40.52.Ralph Lauren, the US luxury goods retailer that competes with the Gap’s upmarket Banana Republic brand, did not fare as well on Friday.The retailer forecast sales in the quarter to June would rise between 3 and 5 per cent, implying sales as high as $1.74bn.Wall Street analysts expected revenues in the period of $1.81bn.Ralph Lauren noted same-store sales in the first three months of the year fell 2 per cent from a year earlier, which it blamed on the weather as well as a late Easter holiday.

33;HLT;Hilton Inc;2014-04-10T13:45:02Z;Ally Financial shares fall on trading debut;;Ally Financial shares fell on their debut after raising $2.38bn in its initial public offering, enabling the US government to recoup the amount it spent on rescuing the motor lender during the financial crisis.The shares opened at $24.25, down from the $25 issue price. Concerns over the growing froth in the motor loans sector had led the company and its underwriters to price the 95m shares sold by the US government at the bottom of a $25-$28 range.The listing ranks as the largest US IPO so far this year and comes amid a resurgence of interest in speciality finance companies.The Treasury said the anticipated IPO proceeds would see it ultimately recover about $17.7bn from Ally. This compares with the $17.2bn used to acquire almost 74 per cent of the former financing arm of General Motors.Ally’s IPO is also an important step for the US government, which bailed out the auto and banking industry as part of the $700bn Troubled Asset Relief Program. More than five years after the financial crisis, Tarp remains controversial, with lawmakers often emphasising their opposition to future bailouts.Overall, the Treasury will have recovered a total of $438.3bn on Tarp investments, compared with the $423.4bn that was disbursed.“Taxpayers’ investment in Ally – together with the broader auto rescue – helped protect the economy by avoiding a catastrophic and disorderly collapse of the American auto industry,” said Treasury Under Secretary Mary Miller. “With this offering, taxpayers have now recovered more than they invested in Ally.”The IPO cuts the government’s stake from 37 per cent to about 17 per cent, and follows two private placements in the last six months.Ally is set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, with investors also watching closely to see whether its shares will perform better than auto finance rivals.Santander Consumer, a competitor that focuses primarily on the subprime auto loan market, raised $1.8bn from a listing earlier this year but has traded poorly since. Its shares have fallen 5.2 per cent from a January IPO price of $24, even as it trades at a higher book value than Ally will trade at based on its offer price.Taxpayers’ investment in Ally – together with the broader auto rescue – helped protect the economy by avoiding a catastrophic and disorderly collapse of the American auto industryAlly’s share price equates to a small discount to its book value, while Santander Consumer trades just below three times book value.In its IPO prospectus, Ally warned that it had lost exclusive rights to provide financing services to Chrysler dealers and consumers to Santander Consumer and that a similar arrangement with GM expired in 2013.One analyst said competition among “prime” auto lenders had been picking up over the past year as banks moved into the market: “Competition is so high that some lenders have reduced auto loan rates to sub 2 per cent levels, well below long-run industry averages and illustrating a propensity for froth in the sector.”Other analysts said they believed auto finance had peaked in terms of profitability and that lower interest rates on loans were starting to affect margins.Though Ally has recovered from the troubles it faced in the financial crisis, it remains a turnround story. In addition to auto lending, Ally operates a bank and wants to grow deposits which would help it cut funding costs.The Ally IPO is the US’s biggest since Hilton Worldwide, the hotel chain operator backed by Blackstone, raised $2.7bn in December.Other large speciality finance companies are expected to follow in the coming months including the North American consumer finance unit of GE Finance, which is now called Synchrony and is preparing a listing.Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays led the underwriting. The Treasury must wait 120 days before it can sell a further large block of shares.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock
34;HLT;Hilton Inc;2014-03-18T12:14:02Z;Hyatt opens up and bets on expansion;;A super-luxury Park Hyatt will open this August in the flashy One57 hotel-cum-residential development on Manhattan’s so-called Billionaires’ Row.The project on 57th Street is part of Hyatt Hotels Corporation’s expansion across the world’s gateway cities under chief executive Mark Hoplamazian, who is facing intense competition from larger public rivals and independent operators.Known for its high-end rooms and corporate jet-setter clientele, the hospitality group, which he took public in 2009, has invested heavily in destinations from New York and Guadalajara to Vienna and Chennai.“We’re punching above our weight,” said Mr Hoplamazian. Hyatt has 525 hotels compared with rivals Marriott International and Hilton Worldwide that have around 4,000 owned, operated or franchised properties. Starwood Hotels & Resorts meanwhile has nearly 1,200.“Having a smaller footprint does not impact our ability to perform. We just have to be thoughtful, deliberate and have a presence in key markets,” the 50-year-old executive told the Financial Times.Mr Hoplamazian came to the helm of the company in 2006. The Chicago-based Pritzker family that controls the hotel group appointed him to the role after he rose through the ranks of its industrial conglomerate over almost two decades. The former Wall Street banker navigated fractious family politics and fused the hotel business’s multiple strands.Since then the Pritzkers have sought to shake off their famously secretive image. Last week, almost 60 years after the company launched, Hyatt hosted its first investor day. Although its hotels are performing well, amid an economic recovery that has seen a rebound in business and leisure travel, Hyatt shares trade at a discount to its peers.The company’s management structure – the Pritzkers own almost 60 per cent of the Hyatt’s common stock and have 75 per cent of the voting power – and poor communication with Wall Street have been partly to blame.“Up until now there has been little transparency on earnings guidance,” said Rachael Rothman, analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. “[By opening up] they are moving in the right direction.”Mr Hoplamazian spoke to investors about growth strategies and how the group expects to use its strong balance sheet to its advantage. “We’ve been incredibly active. We had to paint a picture for investors of where we’re at,” said Mr Hoplamazian.Like other US-based hotel companies, Hyatt – whose brands also include the trendy Andaz boutique hotels and the more casual Hyatt House and Hyatt Place chains – has been pursuing an aggressive overseas expansion, with an emphasis on the luxury segment. Room growth rose by 21 per cent between 2009 and 2013, with Asia leading the charge.In the fourth quarter, earnings doubled to $32m from a year earlier, on revenues of $1.09bn, even as a clampdown on conspicuous consumption by China’s government and slower economic activity in the rest of Asia weighed on results.“This crackdown has changed the tone of the market. We’ve seen real declines in entertainment and business dinners,” Mr Hoplamazian said. “But things are stabilising.”The next multi-decade push in India, China and neighbouring regions, he said, would be in the lower price brackets to take advantage of the rising number of middle class travellers.“Growing from a smaller base means that Hyatt’s expansion prospects look more attractive than its peers,” said Nikhil Bhalla, analyst at FBR Capital Markets. Globally it opened 51 new hotels last year and has another 240 in the pipeline totalling about 54,000 rooms – the highest in the company’s history.Hyatt expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation to rise by a compound annual growth rate of 14 per cent over the next three years. With revenue per available room estimated to increase by just over 5 per cent, the company would have a cumulative $1.9bn to spend on operations, new investments or return to investors over the next three years.The group is using Andaz – which competes aggressively with Starwood’s W brand, Marriott’s Edition and others – to attract younger affluent travellers, who are the hotel sector’s next generation of core customers. It also plans to boost its all-inclusive resort and convention hotel offerings, particularly through franchising.“The initial three years of double-digit revenue growth in the US [where Hyatt has 70 per cent of its hotels] that forecasters had expected, did not materialise,” Mr Hoplamazian said. “We saw growth in the mid-single range, so we still have some time yet.”Having a smaller presence, particularly in secondary and tertiary markets, helped the company weather the financial downturn better than its rivals. But Michelle Grant, analyst at Euromonitor, said the drawback was that “Hyatt may face an uphill struggle when it comes to persuading hotel owners to take up their brand”.Larger competitors have bigger loyalty programmes, larger marketing divisions and lower costs to ensure access to a broader base of guests than Hyatt, she added.As competition escalates, Hyatt will need to try harder to differentiate itself, said Mr Bhalla at FBR Capital Markets. “They are on the right path and this will happen with time, but they still need to define their identity.”
35;HLT;Hilton Inc;2014-02-12T13:47:50Z;Hospitality LBOs: that’s entertainment;Blackstone’s success with Hilton was not just luck, as Caesars’ troubles show;Foolish or unlucky? In 2008 Apollo and TPG bet $6bn on Caesars Entertainment, financing the rest of the $26bn deal with debt. The private equity groups managed to bring the company to market in an IPO in 2012. But this week came unhappy, if not unexpected, news: Caesars has reportedly hired restructuring advisers.Leveraged buyouts of hospitality companies do not have to follow this path. Two months ago Blackstone listed its boom-era buyout, Hilton Worldwide, which once looked disastrous. Blackstone bought Hilton in 2007 for a total value of $26bn, also putting in $6bn of equity. Its stake in Hilton is now worth $16bn, or about 2.5 times its total investment.Before the 2013 IPO, Hilton aggressively refinanced and bought back debt to pretty itself up. The financial engineers had their way with Caesars, too – extending debt maturities, raising cash with equity offerings, and separating the company’s properties from its operating business. The private equity groups even threw in $600m to fund a new public company, Caesars Acquisition Corp, which houses its internet gambling and other high-growth assets.Despite all this, Caesars still has total debt of $20bn, against operating cash flow of just $2bn. And while its shares have more than doubled since its IPO, its private equity backers’ stake is worth just $2bn.Some observers dismissed Hilton’s turnround. Easy money and an inflated equity market have been Blackstone’s version of rolling a double six. Yet Caesars’ troubles show there is more to it than luck. Blackstone picked a business – hotels – that was fixable and could grow after the downturn. Caesars, with a slump in its US casinos and little international exposure, lacked those prospects. Maybe the divergence of hotels and casinos was not foreseeable. But with $20bn of debt the cost of being surprised is high.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
36;HLT;Hilton Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;IPO optimism seen accelerating in 2014 in Europe, especially UK;;A recovery in initial public offerings is expected to accelerate into next year after surging global equity markets encouraged companies and sponsors to launch deals in Europe and the US in 2013.From Hilton Worldwide to Royal Mail, bankers hailed the breadth of sectors participating in this year’s IPO revival as more challenged parts of the economy and debt-laden companies joined technology businesses such as Twitter in garnering strong interest from equity buyers.With the global economy and stock markets propelled by central bank stimulus, the environment remains ripe for issuers heading into the new year.Whether these conditions hold, however, is a matter of debate as investors ponder the effects of a possible reduction in stimulus from the US Federal Reserve.The impact of the move to reopen China’s IPO pipeline is another wild card for 2014 after Asian listings failed to live up to expectations this year and as e-commerce group Alibaba decides where it will place shares in its listing.Mark Hantho, global head of equity capital markets at Deutsche Bank, predicts the momentum will continue. “You are going to see a resurgence of Asia and Europe in 2014.”The optimism is strongest in Europe where volumes more than doubled from a year ago in 2013 as confidence from issuers and investors soared on the back of improving economic conditions, particularly in the UK.“Investor sentiment has been strengthened by increasing valuations and low volatility levels,” says Martin Steinbach, who leads EY’s IPO practice in Europe. “With record highs on the main European indices, low interest rates set to persist for the foreseeable future and European economies continuing their recovery, the stage is set for further expansion of IPO activity in 2014.”The IPO market in the UK, which stood out in 2013, is likely to lead the pack as it re-emerges as a destination for foreign equity investors. Analysts believe the number of new deals on London’s main market will easily surpass the 14 that listed this year.Among the most likely deals are Saga, the insurer and travel agent for the over 50s, and Poundland, the discount retailer. Midsized British companies are also top candidates with TSB, an offshoot from Lloyds Banking Group, which the state-backed bank was ordered to sell as a condition of its £20bn government bailout, expected to list midway through the year.Across Europe, buyout groups are expected to feature prominently after having accounted for almost half of the overall volume in 2013 and ending the year on a high note with Carlyle-backed fashion group Moncler’s well-received market debut.That trend is likely to hold in the US after private equity firms raised a record amount from listing their portfolio companies. From SeaWorld Entertainment to Aramark, investors snapped up shares in companies that were still heavily indebted at the time they came to market.Financial sponsor-backed IPOs averaged a return of 29 per cent through the middle of December, according to Dealogic. Those gains allowed firms to hasten their exits and led to the highest level of broken lock-up agreements since the dotcom era.Follow the latest developments in global IPO activityBankers say that private equity companies have raised funds aggressively on the back of this year’s performance and must continue to show their investors that they can exit portfolio companies. Apollo Global Management-backed EP Energy, an oil and gas company, is among the dozens of portfolio companies expected to list on the US market next year.Neil Mitchell, head of financial sponsor origination at Credit Suisse, says: “Going into 2014, we’re expecting to see technology, healthcare, services, retailing, energy exploration and production as the most active issuance sectors. Much of that activity will come from the financial sponsors, and much of it will be a further monetisation of IPOs that they listed in 2013.”Santander’s US car-financing unit and RBS’s spin-off of Citizens Bank, which is up for a private sale, are among the largest deals that may test the US market next year.Twitter’s strong November listing, which has since seen its shares double on the US market, has provided a catalyst for a new round of technology companies including Box, Dropbox, Square, Spotify and Pinterest to consider listings as soon as next year.But the biggest hopes are reserved for Asia after the China Securities Regulatory Commission took steps to reopen the IPO sector in November after a long hiatus.Sam Kendall, global head of equity capital markets at UBS, says: “2014 is going to see China come back as a more active capital market. You have seen regulators there say they are going to reopen the market and it’s clear China wants to move to more market-driven pricing around its businesses.”How quickly Chinese companies move to do so could determine how big a year it will be for new issuers.
37;HLT;Hilton Inc;2013-12-13T17:30:24Z;Steady steps for modest Hilton chief;;If Conrad Hilton, the founder of the eponymous hospitality group, had run into Chris Nassetta in the lobby of one of his hotels, he probably would not have given the chief executive of what is now Hilton Worldwide a second look.Strait-laced, almost alarmingly modest but with a permanently sunny personality, Mr Nassetta would have little in common with the nightclub-frequenting Mr Hilton, known for his lavish parties and celebrity friends.However, a more sedate approach was what the brand needed after years of complacency and living off the reputation of decades past. It was time for a reality check.In came Blackstone in 2007, scooping up the hotel chain for $26bn in one of the largest leveraged buyouts of all time, seeking to turn Hilton into an industry leader again. The private equity group saddled Hilton with $20bn in debt just as it headed into the financial crisis.Jon Gray, head of Blackstone’s real estate group, called on Mr Nassetta, his friend of 20 years, to help revive the fortunes of the ailing hotel group. Property values were plummeting and the travel business was collapsing.The 50-year-old former chief executive of Host Hotels was seen as a safe pair of hands. He knew the hospitality business well and was someone who could drive a single vision for Hilton’s 300,000-strong staff, who were operating in different business silos. “Steady hands on the wheel,” is how Mr Nassetta describes his management style.Six years later, Hilton Worldwide has again become a public company, which has as much to do with Blackstone’s number-crunching as its management under Mr Nassetta. “How we transformed the business and the culture of the company seemed to resonate with investors,” said Mr Nassetta. “We’ve come a long way. Now we’ve built a platform that is poised for accelerated growth.”Together they drove down costs through franchising and property management, reduced debt and increased room count, largely overseas. Blackstone, which raised $2.35bn in the largest-ever hotel initial public offering this week, has generated a paper profit of $8.5bn since the takeover, amid a broader hotel sector recovery.Mr Nassetta is a sector veteran unlike his peers at Starwood and Marriott, whose careers have stretched from law to private equity, retail and consulting. Industry watchers have said confidence in Mr Nassetta – whose first job at 16 was at a Holiday Inn – was part of Hilton’s selling point. A father of six daughters, Mr Nassetta is a self-styled family man who says he has no ego.How we transformed the business and the culture of the company seemed to resonate with investorsThe shares priced at the upper end of the expected $18-$21 price range and then rose more than 7 per cent on the first trading day.Mr Nassetta’s decision to move Hilton’s headquarters to Virginia from the more showy Beverly Hills “set the tone” for the hotel company’s future, leading to the revamp of the leadership team and the streamlining of operations.But next for Mr Nassetta is the creation of a brand targeted at younger travellers after the botched launch of the Denizen label following allegations of corporate espionage from rival Starwood.Expected in 2014, the new brand would be at a cheaper price point than its competitor’s W Hotels, people familiar with the matter have said, giving Hilton a presence in a sector in which it has lagged behind for years.Some question Mr Nassetta’s ability to create such a “lifestyle” marque, which does not necessarily fit with the more composed image of the new Hilton and its brand portfolio, from the Waldorf Astoria to Hampton Inn. Perhaps Mr Nassetta would be wise to rekindle some of Mr Hilton’s sparkle as he seeks to take the hotel group into its next chapter.
38;HLT;Hilton Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Warm reception for Hilton debut;Blackstone makes $8.5bn gain as shares rise 7.5%;Hilton Worldwide’s shares jumped 7.5 per cent per cent on their stock market debut on Thursday, marking a turnround for the hotel chain that has generated an $8.5bn paper profit for its private equity owner Blackstone.The world’s biggest lodging company by rooms raised $2.35bn in an initial public offering, the largest ever by a hotel operator. Hilton sold 117.6m shares at $20 each, the upper end of the $18-$21 price range. The shares rose to as high as $21.92 before ending their first day of trading at $21.50.For Hilton and its owners the deal caps a rollercoaster journey since Blackstone bought the hotel chain for $26bn including debt in 2007, one of the largest leveraged buyouts of all time.Since the takeover, which saddled the hotel chain with about $20bn in debt as it headed into the financial crisis, Hilton has pursued an aggressive high-margin, “asset light” strategy to franchise and manage hotels, increase room count and expand internationally.“I’m glad the market reacted well and investors see the potential for growth. We’ve come a long way, but our work is not done yet,” chief executive Chris Nassetta told the Financial Times.“There were some people who didn’t think this would work out but Jon Gray [head of real estate at Blackstone] and I never lost faith even when everything was upside down and the world was falling apart during the financial downturn.”Hotelier Conrad Hilton bought Manhattan’s Waldorf Astoria in 1949, calling it the “greatest of them all”. Once the world’s largest and tallest hotel, the Art Deco building on Park Avenue epitomised New York’s jazz age lustre.But decades later, the landmark hotel famed for hosting the likes of mobster Bugsy Siegel and actress Marilyn Monroe became tired and lost its competitive advantage – a fate which mirrored that of its parent company.Continue . . .Hilton increased the size of the offering by about 4 per cent from its original estimate. This, as well as the pricing, indicate resurgent demand from investors for hospitality stocks, that have benefited from a rebound in room rates, occupancy levels and business travel since the depths of the recession.The total amount raised could increase to $2.7bn if underwriters sell extra shares to meet demand, making it the second-largest US IPO this year. Proceeds of the flotation will be used to repay debt.Blackstone, which is not selling any of its shares in the offering, will keep a 76 per cent stake in Hilton. After the IPO, Blackstone will hold about 750.6m Hilton shares valued at about $15bn, and plans to reduce its stake over the next three to five years.According to a regulatory filing dated December 2, Mr Nassetta’s holding of around 7.6m shares, which will fully vest when Blackstone reduces its stake to 50 per cent, would be worth almost $152m at the issue price of $20 a share. The next top four executives’ holdings would be valued at about $78m in total. On the first portion of Mr Nassetta’s shares which vested on the day of the IPO, he was entitled to a paper gain of about $57m based on the closing price.While it did not hamper the stock’s first-day performance, some industry watchers have been concerned about Hilton’s steep valuation compared with its peers. Others have cited the risk of the impact of another downturn and how the company would fare, particularly as it seeks to reduce its debt burden, which although falling remains substantial compared with rivals.Private equity groups including Blackstone have sought to take advantage of an equity market rally to sell their holdings, cashing in on investments they have held on to for several years.Virginia-based Hilton, which operates its eponymous brand as well as Waldorf Astoria, Doubletree, Hampton Inns and others, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol HLT. Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley acted as lead underwriters on the offering.
39;HLT;Hilton Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Hilton IPO prices near top of the range to raise $2.35bn;;Six years after one of the largest leveraged buyouts ever, Blackstone is set to return Hilton Worldwide to the US market after raising $2.35bn in an initial public offering of the world’s biggest hotel chain by number of rooms.Hilton sold 117.6m shares at $20 each on Wednesday, at the upper end of the $18-$21 price range it had set. It sold 5m more shares than it initially said it would, demonstrating resurgent investor demand for hotel stocks, which have enjoyed a rebound in room rates, occupancy levels and business travel.The IPO will rank as the second-largest US offering this year assuming its underwriters, including Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, exercise an additional allocation of shares. It will be the largest offering by a hotel operator.For Hilton and its owners, the deal caps a tumultuous journey since the heady days of 2007 when it was bought by Blackstone, the private equity group, for $26bn including debt. The company intends to use about half the IPO proceeds to reduce its debt burden, which is falling but remains substantial compared to rivals.Even so, Blackstone believes it can turn a profit of around 2.5 times the equity it invested in the buyout, according to people familiar with the transaction.The deal is a triumph for Jon Gray, the head of Blackstone’s real estate group, who had faith in the investment even as property values fell and hotel occupancies tumbled in the darkest days of the financial crisis.However, in the hours before Hilton’s underwriters set the IPO price, some investors questioned whether the hotel chain could sustain a valuation that places the company ahead of its peer group.At $20 a share, Hilton would have an enterprise value of around $32bn. An analysis of the ratio of 2014 enterprise value to earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation shows the company would be valued at a double-digit premium to an average multiple for peers including Starwood, Marriott and Hyatt, according to Morningstar.“We view Hilton as attractive from the standpoint of its shift towards hotel management and franchising, its solid new hotel pipeline, and a deleveraging balance sheet, but a lack of a compelling valuation prevents us from recommending the stock to investors with a long-term investment horizon,” Morningstar analysts said.Hotelier Conrad Hilton bought Manhattan’s Waldorf Astoria in 1949, calling it the “greatest of them all”. Once the world’s largest and tallest hotel, the Art Deco building on Park Avenue epitomised New York’s jazz age lustre.But decades later, the landmark hotel famed for hosting the likes of mobster Bugsy Siegel and actress Marilyn Monroe became tired and lost its competitive advantage – a fate which mirrored that of its parent company.Continue . . .Another concern among investors is that Blackstone will look to unload its majority stake, which will represent about 76 per cent of shares outstanding after the IPO, over the next three to five years, according to analysts at Green Street Advisors.But that is also seen as a possible boon in the short term to its shares since the private equity company is not selling down its stake in the IPO and has an incentive to see the stock trade higher.The deal owes much to Hilton’s high-margin franchising strategy, its management team – under chief executive Chris Nassetta– and its ability to harness the sector’s recovery and drive room count, particularly overseas.Blackstone also benefited from the US Federal Reserve’s easy money policies which made possible both an aggressive restructuring of the chain’s more than $20bn in debt and spurred investment into equity markets, allowing companies such as Blackstone to list their portfolio companies.“The biggest accelerator and improvement in Blackstone’s return profile on Hilton was when they bought back the debt and then restructured it,” said one investor who has followed the transaction closely. “The discipline to stay with their growth plan also contributed significantly to where Blackstone is today with the asset.”The shares will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol “HLT.”
40;HLT;Hilton Inc;2013-12-08T12:29:51Z;Hilton: suite smell of success;Blackstone has handled Hilton well but it’s checkout time;"Perseverance; deep pockets; Ben Bernanke. This trinity has blessed Blackstone with the possibility of solid profit on its investment in Hilton. The private equity house bought out the hotel group at the tippy-top in 2007, with $6bn of cash and $20bn of debt. That debt paired with an economic bust threatened to make the deal a wipeout. But Blackstone hung in there, contributed $800m more cash to get a debt refinancing done and watched as Uncle Ben’s easy money made assets more valuable and debt easier to carry.Now the financials look like this: Hilton will generate perhaps $2.3bn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation next year. If you put a trading multiple of 14 on that ebitda – representing the point between the valuations of peers Marriott and Starwood – then the value of the enterprise is $32bn. The debt has been whittled down to a bit under $12bn. So the equity, of which Blackstone owns three-quarters, is worth $20bn. Blackstone’s bet has more than doubled, providing an annual rate of return approaching respectability.This paper gain must be turned into cash, though. Proceeds from the $2.25bn public offering that will price this week will go to cash out other shareholders and pay down debt. Blackstone will have to unload its own shares later. Suppose that Hilton’s trading multiple falls from its current heights to the 10-year average level of its two big peers (about 12 times ebitda). Blackstone’s stake, and any shares bought in this week’s offering, would then lose a fifth of their value. Do the changes that Blackstone has made at Hilton – principally increasing its exposure to the high-margin, stable, capital-light management and franchise fees – merit a permanent re-rating of the shares? Even for a franchiser, hotels are an economically sensitive business. Marriott, for example, saw fee revenues fall by a fourth between 2007 and 2009. Blackstone has the right idea. It’s checkout time.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
41;HLT;Hilton Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Hilton and Aramark IPOs to test investor appetite;;Big buyout groups are set to test US investors’ continuing appetite for their highly indebted portfolio companies in the final days of a record year for private equity-backed initial public offerings.On Monday, Blackstone-backed hotel chain Hilton Worldwide said it would seek to raise up to $2.4bn in what would be the largest ever IPO by a hotel operator. The deal is expected to price late next week.Aramark, which provides food and concessions for stadiums, prisons and other facilities, also unveiled the terms for its listing. The company, controlled by Warburg Pincus, Thomas H Lee and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, said it would seek to raise up to $834m.Both companies were taken private in 2007 just before the financial crisis. Their return to the markets highlights efforts by buyout groups to take advantage of resurgent interest in US stocks this year to begin selling their debt-laden holdings.So far this year, private equity groups have listed a record 91 portfolio companies raising $29.6bn, in the US, according to Dealogic. US companies are on track to raise the most from IPO proceeds since the dotcom bubble in 2000.Despite high debt levels, the share prices of the 91 companies to list so far this year are on average up 27 per cent from their offer price. However, the Hilton and Aramark offerings come as some investors say they are less willing to take on riskier investments in the final weeks of the year after benefiting from a strong year for stocks.“Investors are chasing deals less right now so the pricing of these offerings won’t see the same demand that led other sponsor IPOs to price strongly this year,” said one banker not involved in either the Aramark or Hilton deals.Hilton, which was acquired for $26bn including debt by Blackstone, has net debt of $13bn. It would have net debt equal to five times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation after the IPO. That is double Marriott’s level and far higher than rivals such as Starwood and Hyatt.The Virginia-based hotel operator said it will aim to sell 112.8m shares at between $18 and $21, giving it a market valuation of $19.2bn at the top end of that range. If Hilton’s underwriters exercise their overallotment option, the size of the offering could rise to $2.7bn.Hilton plans to use the proceeds to pay down its debt and allow preferred equity holders, who had their debt converted to shares as part of a restructuring agreement, to sell down their stakes.“I think equity investors will look through Hilton’s debt,” said Ryan Meliker, hotel analyst at MLV & Co. “But Hilton is higher levered than its peers because it owns a lot of real estate compared to others. No doubt this will limit the chain’s ability to be an investment grade company, which will impact their cost of debt.”Aramark, which was acquired in a buyout worth $8.3bn including debt, has net debt of $5.7bn and a total debt to operating cash flow ratio of 4.75 before its listing. The company plans to sell 36.25m shares at $23 a share, giving it $5.3bn market value.“It has been surprising to us in recent months how investors don’t seem to care so much about balance sheet health,” said Lukas Hartwich, analyst at Green Street Advisors. “In fact, those with the weakest balance sheets have been outperforming, particularly as investors search for yield.”
42;HLT;Hilton Inc;2013-11-21T19:25:48Z;Blackstone’s Hilton Worldwide doubles planned IPO to $2.25bn;;Hilton Worldwide, the Blackstone-backed hotel group, has nearly doubled the amount of money it will seek to raise in an initial public offering to $2.25bn, said people familiar with the matter.If successful, the deal will be the largest ever initial public offering by a hotel operator.The company has publicly said it aims to raise $1.25bn from a listing, but these people said the increased size of the offering will allow preferred stockholders to sell $1bn of their shares.Virginia-based Hilton and its private equity owner are working to get final approvals on its prospectus from regulators. They hope to launch investor meetings as soon as next month and price the deal before the end of the year, people familiar with the deal added.The deal size may increase further amid greater interest in hotel groups from investors, they said.At $2.25bn, the Hilton deal would be the third-largest US IPO this year, and would be larger than this month’s Twitter listing, according to data from Dealogic. By amount raised, it would surpass Hyatt’s $1bn IPO in 2009. The new deal size was first reported by Bloomberg.Blackstone, which acquired the company in 2007 for $26bn in one of the largest ever buyouts, is taking advantage of a rally in hotel stocks as well as a rebound in room rates, occupancy levels and business travel. Hilton now has an enterprise value of around $30bn.Hilton’s preferred stock holders were awarded shares during a 2010 debt restructuring. The company and its creditors worked out a deal whereby $2.1bn of junior mezzanine debt was converted to preferred equity. Blackstone has said it will not sell its shares in the IPO.The remainder of the proceeds will be used towards paying down Hilton’s $13bn net debt burden. Compared with its peers, Hilton remains highly levered. If the company raises $1.25bn in proceeds to pay down debt, its net debt will be roughly 5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That compares to Marriot’s 2.5, Starwood’s 0.8 and 0.9 for Hyatt.The private equity group, which owns more than 200,000 hotel rooms in the US alone through its portfolio companies, is looking to unwind a series of commercial property holdings as equity markets improve.Shares in Extended Stay America, the mid-price hotel chain Blackstone took public earlier this month, have risen more than 20 per cent since its debut.This year is set to be a record one for US hotel IPOs by dollars raised, Dealogic said, amid a stronger global economy that has bolstered the sector.Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are underwriting the Hilton deal.
43;HLT;Hilton Inc;2013-11-20T13:39:25Z;Hilton chief pulled brand through tumultuous years;;When Hilton Worldwide goes public as early as December, all eyes will be on the hotel group’s private equity owner Blackstone. But as industry watchers track how far the company has come, chief executive Chris Nassetta deserves his share of the limelight.While the buyout group restructured Hilton’s debt and aggressively cut costs, the hotel sector veteran and former chief executive of Host Hotels & Resorts helped to restore confidence in the company.“The appeal of the Hilton initial public offering for investors will rest on three things: the brand name, the hotel property portfolio and the hotel group’s management under Chris Nassetta,” said Bjorn Hanson, a dean at New York University’s Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management.When Mr Nassetta joined Hilton in 2007 he set out to create a single vision for the hotel group which was suffering from fragmentation. He made bold decisions including shifting the company’s headquarters from California to Virginia, where it would be easier to hire top talent. He called time on the newly launched Denizen brand after allegations of corporate espionage from rival Starwood.He is respected and liked by his peers, and people familiar with Hilton’s strategy say Mr Nassetta’s credibility helped the brand pull through the tumultuous years that followed the financial downturn and make the most of the rebound in the travel sector.In 2012 Mr Nassetta earned $2.04m, which included a base salary of $850,000 and a cash bonus of $1.08m. Other perks included $11,277 in personal use of the company aircraft and $40,962 in employer-paid expenses for Hilton hotel stays while on personal travel, according to regulatory filings.
44;HLT;Hilton Inc;2013-11-20T13:39:25Z;Successful Hilton Worldwide IPO would be a Blackstone landmark;;Hotelier Conrad Hilton bought Manhattan’s Waldorf Astoria in 1949, calling it the “greatest of them all”. Once the world’s largest and tallest hotel, the Art Deco building on Park Avenue epitomised New York’s jazz age lustre.But decades later, the landmark hotel famed for hosting the likes of mobster Bugsy Siegel and actress Marilyn Monroe became tired and lost its competitive advantage – a fate which mirrored that of its parent company.In one of the largest buyouts of all time, Blackstone Group acquired Hilton Hotels in the heady days of 2007 for $26bn including debt. It sought to give the hotel company a new lease of life, and part of the private equity group’s task was to restore the Waldorf Astoria’s original grandeur.Now after six years under Blackstone ownership, the company – renamed Hilton Worldwide – is set to go public within weeks. Seeking at least $1.25bn, the offering would be the highest amount raised for a US hotel company and would move the buyout firm closer to realising the profits from its biggest single investment.People familiar with the company say Blackstone has doubled its initial $6bn equity investment from its real estate and private equity funds. Hilton now has an enterprise value of around $30bn.The Virginia-based hotel operator has yet to say how many shares it will offer or at what price. While Blackstone will keep its stake for now, it is creating a mechanism to sell down its holding gradually. In the meantime, proceeds will go towards repaying Hilton’s $13bn in net debt.Although the hotel group’s debt is manageable, said Michelle Grant, travel and tourism manager at Euromonitor, “right now income is being used to service debt and not invest in the business. This could hamstring Hilton for a while.”For the six months to June, the company reported net income of $189m on total revenues of $4.6bn, compared with $260m and $3.9bn respectively over the same period in 2007.A successful offering would mark a milestone for Blackstone, which bought Hilton shares at a 40 per cent premium and was criticised for saddling the chain with around $20bn in debt just as it was headed into the financial crisis.Blackstone wrote down the value of its investment by around half in 2009 as the travel sector collapsed and property prices tanked when the global economy came to a screeching halt.Since then, it has been able to mark up the investment, which remains unrealised. Blackstone has benefited from a rally in hotel stocks as well as a rebound in room rates, occupancy levels and business travel. A stronger global economy has bolstered the hospitality sector and this year is set to be a record one for US hotel IPOs by dollars raised, Dealogic says.On the surface it seems Blackstone’s “buy it, fix it, sell it” strategy has had some success. The group appointed hotel veteran Chris Nassetta as chief executive, restructured the company’s debt, renovated properties and cut costs aggressively. By number of rooms the group is now among the largest in the world.When Hilton Worldwide goes public as early as December, all eyes will be on the hotel group’s private equity owner Blackstone.But as industry watchers track how far the company has come, chief executive Chris Nassetta (above) deserves his share of the limelight.While the buyout group restructured Hilton’s debt and aggressively cut costs, the hotel sector veteran and former chief executive of Host Hotels & Resorts, helped to restore confidence in the company.Continue readingHilton operates 4,041 hotels, resorts and timeshare properties in 90 countries through its namesake brand, as well as Waldorf Astoria, Doubletree, Homewood Suites and Hampton Inn among others.But just like the signature New York property of the Waldorf Astoria brand, its parent still has some way to go. Although the building’s lobby has had its opulence restored, its rooms still need work. Hilton, meanwhile needs to clean up its balance sheet.The chain remains heavily debt-laden, which industry analysts say could hamper growth. Hilton itself has acknowledged how its “substantial indebtedness” – cited among 26 pages of risk factors in regulatory filings – could impact its ability to raise capital, fund operations, repay existing debt and react to macroeconomic uncertainties.Although Hilton’s interest expense has fallen roughly 40 per cent from 2010 levels to $575m, it is still eating up almost 30 per cent of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, data for the year to June show.Blackstone has refinanced its debt pile at favourable rates and if the company raises $1.25bn in its offering, net debt will fall to around $11.5bn, which is approximately five times ebitda. Although down from nine times after the takeover, it is still high and greater than Marriot’s 2.5, Starwood’s 0.8 and 0.9 for Hyatt.Hilton has pushed a strategy to license its brands to third-party operators through its franchise and management contract businesses. It is these fee-based divisions that are expected to spread the company’s lucrative luxury brands and entice new travellers from the world’s emerging middle classes, rather than the costly strategy of creating or acquiring new brands.But Starwood and Marriott among others are investing heavily in boutique brands aimed at technology-savvy, younger travellers – a segment where Hilton does not yet have a presence, said Richard Hightower, analyst at ISI Group.Success in monetising assets, generating yields and room growth is crucial. Hilton has done a nice job at increasing the number of rooms available, but it has to be able to maintain thisThe company is expected to sell its less profitable real estate in the coming years, following in the footsteps of its competitors and further reducing its debt burden. But for now the chain is holding on to its $10bn portfolio as property values rise and it tries to generate greater value from its higher-profile hotels.Hilton also hopes to reap the rewards of its aggressive development pipeline which has grown by 50 per cent since the takeover. But some industry watchers worry about the impact of excess supply on the company if global growth stalls again, or other unforeseen events shake the travel sector, as hotels are typically the first in the commercial real estate market to feel the pinch.“Success in monetising assets, generating yields and room growth is crucial,” said Jeff Weinstein, editor in chief of Hotels magazine. “Hilton has done a nice job at increasing the number of rooms available, but it has to be able to maintain this.”As Blackstone prepares to win over public market investors – even using the Waldorf Astoria in its sales pitch – it will need to convince them that the company will restore Hilton back to full health before it cashes out entirely.
45;HLT;Hilton Inc;2013-11-10T16:38:34Z;US companies on target to raise record IPO sums;;Wall Street bankers, buoyed by the successful launch of Twitter, are on track to earn bumper fees as US companies look set to raise a record amount in a single year from a tide of initial public offerings.The frenetic pace of activity has strained equity capital markets desks, according to bankers, as the top deal underwriters cut staff after the financial crisis when the IPO market dried up. Despite the strain, banks are on pace to generate their biggest IPO fees in over a decade.Resurgent interest in US stocks has paved the way for 192 companies to raise $51.8bn from new stock offerings, putting the market on track to rival sums raised by US companies at the height of the dotcom bubble in 2000, according to Dealogic, the data provider.In the coming weeks, those numbers are expected to climb significantly as US markets, already above historic highs, lure a fresh batch of market debutantes. Hilton Worldwide, the hotel chain taken private in 2006 by Blackstone for $26bn, is among the biggest deals due to test investor appetite as early as December, people familiar with the situation said.Steve Baronoff, head of global M&A at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said: “Companies are becoming increasingly confident they can get good valuations from the public markets.”Blackstone has been one of the most active sponsors in bringing portfolio companies to market and is also preparing to raise $550m from an IPO of Extended Stay America, another hotel chain this week. The market conditions are proving a boon to highly indebted companies, including those owned by private equity groups.Also gearing up to list this week is Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the educational publisher that emerged from bankruptcy last year and is backed by Paulson & Co. The company is seeking to raise $274m.Technology, healthcare and real estate related companies have been among the most active corners of the market in terms of new issuance this year. Twitter’s listing last week sits 60 per cent above its offer price and its success is likely to usher in a new round of Silicon Valley tech IPOs from companies such as Box, Square and Pinterest in the new year.Alan Denenberg, partner at Davis Polk, said: “In the internet and social media space, there is a lot of activity going on. Many companies are doing bake-offs at the moment.”Additional reporting by Anjli Raval in New York
46;HLT;Hilton Inc;2013-09-12T12:27:04Z;Hilton Worldwide files for $1.25bn IPO;;Hilton Worldwide will look to raise $1.25bn from an initial public offering as the hotel chain seeks a return to the US stock market six years after it was acquired by Blackstone Group.The New York-based buyout group took Hilton private for more than $25bn including debt in one of the largest leveraged buyouts ever in 2007. It was one of the last large-scale deals struck before the financial crisis.Hilton’s business quickly deteriorated and Blackstone was forced to act to restructure the heavy debt load and aggressively cut costs to nurse the hotelier back to health.The IPO is expected for the first quarter of 2014 and the company will aim for an enterprise value of around $30bn, according to a person familiar with the offering.The move comes as a thriving US stock market has lifted valuations, allowing private equity companies to tap public investors to exit investments made during the buyout boom years of 2006 and 2007.Proceeds from the offering will go towards paying down its net debt, which stood at about $14bn at the end of June. But Hilton did not disclose the size of the offering or its expected price range in a securities filing on Thursday.For the year ending in June, the company reported net income of $427m and revenue of $9.4bn.The company operates 4,041 hotels, resorts and timeshare properties in 90 countries and territories.In recent years, the company has steadily increased the number of rooms it operates amid a recovery in the global hotel industry since the crisis. A strategy to license the Hilton brands to third-party operators, which has become a high-margin business, has also helped.Hilton’s publicly traded competitors include Starwood Hotels and Marriott, which trade at about 12 to 13 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation and the company will aim for a similar valuation by the time of the offering.The listing would also mark a return to the public markets for Hilton chief executive Christopher Nassetta, who previously ran Host Hotels before being brought in to turn around the company in 2007.Ahead of the IPO Hilton will seek to refinance about $13.5bn in debt, including about $3.5bn of commercial mortgage-backed securities – commercial property loans which are pooled and sold to investors in pieces reflecting varying degrees of risk – and $525m of debt on the Waldorf Astoria hotel in midtown Manhattan.The CMBS loan would rank as one of the largest to take place since the financial crisis. The roadshow on the debt refinancing could begin as soon as next week, one person close to the situation said.Blackstone, which owns more than 200,000 hotel rooms in the US alone through its portfolio companies, is looking to unwind a series of holdings in US commercial real estate and housing assets that it has accumulated in recent years.Blackstone will continue to own a majority of the voting shares, allowing it to control the make-up of the board. The company can begin unwinding its remaining stake in the company after a 180 day lock-up expires following the offering.Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley will lead the IPO. Hilton did not disclose which exchange it expects to list on or what ticker symbol it plans to use.Founded in 1919 by Conrad Hilton, Hilton Worldwide’s brands include Conrad, Waldorf Astoria, Doubletree, Embassy Suites, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton Inn and Hilton Grand Vacations.
47;HLT;Hilton Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;How Blackstone revived Hilton brand;;“For a period Hilton looked like it was on death’s door,” says Guy Metcalfe, a real estate banker at Morgan Stanley. “But what distinguished Jon Gray wasn’t the original deal, it was how he saved it.”How Mr Gray saved Hilton Worldwide was a matter of skill and luck, Mr Metcalfe adds. In 2007, when private equity group Blackstone bought the hotel chain, then with 2,900 hotels, it paid more than $26bn, a 40 per cent premium over the share price at the time. That included $6bn of its own and its investors’ money, almost $7.5bn in assumed debt and about $13bn of new debt.The financing market for leveraged deals such as Hilton had already started to collapse. That meant the banks could not get the loans off their balance sheets – it was never chopped into pieces, securitised and parcelled out to many hundreds if not thousands of investors.Since only a handful of banks and a few junior lenders held the debt, rather than a cast of thousands, it was easier to renegotiate, eliminating about $4bn of borrowed money in the process. Blackstone put up almost $1bn in additional funds to buy the junior debt at a sharp discount and converted that mezzanine piece into preferred securities while the banks swapped their debt for preferred securities that gave them some equity upside.When Blackstone bought the chain in what was then the largest hotel buyout ever, Hilton’s brand lacked the panache of some rivals. Today, the company has 4,000 hotels, and about 1,000 in the pipeline, with the majority being built outside the US. The brand has been polished with signature Waldorf Astoria hotels in places such as Shanghai. It also has a new chief executive, after Mr Gray brought in Chris Nassetta, who used to run Host Marriott, the largest hotel real estate investment trust.Both hotel occupancy and rates are up, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation at the hotel chain grew 17 per cent during the first half, though Blackstone does not disclose figures. Staff at Blackstone say they no longer complain about staying at Hilton hotels as they used to in the early days.Two weeks ago, Hilton appointed four banks to take it public in the coming months, though a sale is still possible.
48;HLT;Hilton Inc;2013-08-08T13:44:03Z;Hilton eyes return to public market;;Hilton Worldwide is preparing for a US listing that could see the Blackstone-controlled hotel conglomerate return to public markets as soon as early 2014, people familiar with its plans said.Hilton, which was acquired by the private equity group for more than $25bn including debt in 2007, has hired Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley to lead its IPO and is planning to file a securities registration this autumn, these people added.The US market for new offerings has sprung back to life in recent weeks as companies take advantage of rising equity markets to boost their valuations.There were 22 US listed IPOs in July and four so far in August, with another eight expected later this week, according to data from Dealogic.That marks the highest number of IPOs during the period since 2007, raising hopes that more companies could choose to raise capital through new public offerings.Private equity groups have been driving much of the activity as they look to sell out of investments they made during the buyout boom years of 2006 and 2007.Blackstone, which owns more than 200,000 hotel rooms in the US alone through its portfolio companies, is looking to unwind a series of holdings in US commercial real estate and housing assets that it has accumulated in recent years.The takeover of Hilton, the largest-ever in the hotel industry, burdened Blackstone with a heavy debt load just as the US commercial real estate bubble was about to burst. In subsequent years, it has reworked Hilton’s balance sheet through a series of debt restructurings.Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone, said last month that Hilton’s earnings before tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 17 per cent in the first half of 2013.Blackstone is also looking at a sale of La Quinta Inns & Suites, people close to the group added. Last month, it filed plans to list Extended Stay America, a mid-price lodging chain, and Brixmor Property Group, its shopping centre unit.Other disposals include its massive portfolio of office buildings and its IndCor Properties industrial platform.Blackstone, the banks and Hilton declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported Hilton’s hiring of the banks.
49;HLT;Hilton Inc;2012-12-14T19:15:21Z;Peru tourism: on the up;;"Peru has cashed in from tourism in recent years thanks to a clever strategy of exploiting its biodiversity, exquisite food and Inca legacy.Now hotels chains, with Hilton Worldwide and Marriott International in the lead, are to invest as much as $1.76bn over the next three years as tourism is skyrocketing in the Andean country.According to Peru’s hotel association, Hilton and Marriott alone plan to invest $169m in hotels in Cusco, Lima and Trujillo. Overall investment in the hotel sector, including some luxury operations by Orient Express, was $1.23bn between 2009 and 2012.“Any new hotel capacity is immediately absorbed by growing demand, like the Lima Westin last year,” José Koechlin, president of the association, told Bloomberg this week. The Westin cost more than $100m to build.“This is in line with President Ollanta Humala’s goal of making tourism Peru’s second-biggest revenue earner,” Koechlin added.Tourism is already Peru’s fourth largest sector, behind minerals, oil and agriculture. It is expected to generate revenues of $3.25bn this year, up from $2.91bn in 2011 and $2.47bn in 2010.“There is tremendous potential for growth. Hotel occupancy is above 70 percent and we need to add capacity at a faster rate,” Carlos Canales, president of Peru’s tourism chamber, told reporters on Wednesday in Lima.According to the chamber, in 2012 about 2.1m foreign tourists climbed up to Machu Picchu, trekked around the Colca Canyon, stayed in thatched huts in the Amazon, surfed on Pacific beaches, or admired the Nazca lines from above the ground. It marked a 12 per cent increase on the 1.9m foreigners who visited Peru a year earlier.Tourists come mostly from the Americas and Europe, although Asians appear to be on the rise. That is why one of Peru’s aspirations is not only to attract hotel chains but also new airlines. Turkish Airways appears to be high up on the seduction list – it already has direct flights from Istanbul to São Paulo and has just launched a flight to Buenos Aires. Istanbul would be well suited as a hub for Asians, who otherwise travel to Peru mostly via the US or western Europe.Related Reading:

50;HLT;Hilton Inc;2011-10-18T13:55:26Z;Dubai tourism: mixed fortunes;;"Judging opportunities in Dubai’s tourism market is a tricky business these days.Tourist numbers are rising, underpinned by 50 per cent annual increases in Chinese visitors who want to grab luxury goods and snaps next to the world’s tallest tower, Burj Khalifa. The Arab uprisings have given the industry another fillip as tourists avoid hotspots such as Egypt, Tunisia and Bahrain.But more than 2.5m extra tourists will have to arrive annually over the next five years to meet a whopping 60 per cent increase in the number of rooms bequeathed by the emirate’s over-ambitious boom days.Given the difficulty of gauging the demand-supply gap, we are seeing different reactions, often on the same day.Among the optimists, Hilton Worldwide is teaming up with Al Habtoor Group to launch a $272m Waldorf Astoria resort on the Palm Jumeirah (pictured).Government-owned Nakheel’s offshore developments may have helped push Dubai towards the brink of default in 2009 but the completed Palm Jumeirah is now a chi-chi address. Reality TV starlet Kim Kardashian last week chose to stay at the Atlantis resort on the island, a favourite with Russian tourists seeking some winter sun.Hilton, which is almost doubling the number of hotels it operates in the region, says the outlook is “buoyant”. Occupancy at its properties in Dubai is back up towards 85 per cent and revenue per available room is rising again.Being on the beach helps. Hilton concedes that hotels located deeper in the city are still facing tougher times than before. The tie up, which will also see Hilton operating two Habtoor properties in Beirut, Lebanon, is underpinned by the large Dubai family group.Khalaf al-Habtoor, group chairman, says he is funding the Palm development from internal resources, saying that banks aren’t in the mood for lending these days.The group has been hit by exposure to the construction sector, riddled with debts and incomplete projects. But Habtoor says retail is doing well – especially his agency for selling luxury Bentley cars.Down on the creek in central Dubai, however, things aren’t looking so rosy.Sunland, an Australian developer, has swapped its 49 per cent stake in the almost-complete Palazzo Versace hotel with its UAE partner. Emirates Investment Holdings, in turn, is handing over its 50 per cent stake in a Gold Coast tower to Sunland in a no-cash deal.Further down the creek, Dubai’s original celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsey, is pulling out from his restaurant at the Hilton Dubai Creek.The foul-mouthed TV star, who has been retrenching his global empire amid financial difficulties, has been hinting that he needs to find a new location for some time.When he opened Verre in 2003, Ramsey redefined fine dining in Dubai and energised Dubai’s boom-time expansion, bringing some much-needed gastronomic flare to the city.Other celebrity food brands have followed: Gary Rhodes and Pierre Gagnaire, Nobu and The Ivy, are just some of the high-end outlets that serve tourists and residents willing to shell out for expensive imported food.But as Dubai’s infamous boom-time traffic clogged up the roads, Verre’s bookings dropped off as his pool of rich clients on the other side of the creek gave up battling traffic to sample Ramsey’s rich offerings.The roads are clearer now, thanks to the financial crisis and a new metro, but the focus of deluxe Dubai has shifted from the trade and commercial centre of the creek to more fashionable areas around the Burj Khalifa and Palm Jumeirah.Related reading:

51;HLT;Hilton Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
