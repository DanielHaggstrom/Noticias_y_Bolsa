0;VRSK;Verisk Analytics Inc;2019-08-26T17:04:37Z;Energy data firm Genscape sold to Verisk for $364m;Sale is part of move by Daily Mail and General Trust to narrow portfolio;Genscape, a US company that helped lift the curtain on opaque energy markets, is being sold by owner Daily Mail and General Trust in the latest deal to consolidate the business of commodity flows data. The UK-listed Daily Mail has agreed to sell Genscape for $364m in cash to Verisk, the companies said on Monday. The price was more than 38 times Genscape’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about $9m in 2018, a person close to Daily Mail said. Founded in 1999 and based in the US state of Kentucky, Genscape helped give energy traders a clearer view of energy markets, where success often requires inside knowledge of supply and demand. In one service, a helicopter pilot working for Genscape flew above the tank complex at Cushing, Oklahoma — the delivery point for US crude futures — snapping infrared photos to discern the quantities of oil hidden inside.Genscape’s other products include natural gas pipeline monitoring and estimates of electricity output derived from sensors placed near power plants. The availability of data and prices has given hedge funds and banks an edge in markets once dominated by physical producers, refiners and trading houses. Research companies and consultancies have been buying up specialist commodity data providers to meet demand.IHS Markit acquired the agribusiness intelligence business of London-based Informa in May and in 2016 bought Oil Price Information Service, a price reporting agency. S&P Global acquired energy consultancy PIRA Energy Group in 2016.New York-listed Verisk, which also provides risk analysis to the insurance sector, acquired the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie for £1.85bn in 2015. Genscape will become part of Wood Mackenzie. Neal Anderson, president of Wood Mackenzie, said: “With Genscape joining Wood Mackenzie, our customers will now better understand the defining issues facing key energy commodities — over the long term with Wood Mackenzie’s existing offerings and in the short term through Genscape’s offerings.”Daily Mail and General Trust acquired Genscape in 2006 for $130m. Paul Zwillenberg, Daily Mail chief executive, has outlined a series of disposals to narrow the group’s portfolio and strengthen its balance sheet. “This transaction marks another major milestone in DMGT’s continued transformation and is in line with our strategy,” Mr Zwillenberg said.
1;VRSK;Verisk Analytics Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Verisk buys Wood Mackenzie for £1.85bn;US data group plans move into energy through Scottish consultancy;Verisk Analytics is to buy Wood Mackenzie, the Scottish stockbroker transformed by the North Sea oil boom four decades ago into a global energy consultancy, from private equity ownership for £1.85bn ($2.8bn).The sale comes three years after Hellman & Friedman, the San Francisco-based private equity firm, bought its stake in Wood Mackenzie for £1.1bn.Nasdaq-listed Verisk said the acquisition would help place it at the centre of analysing data in the energy industry, much as its products are already widely used in the insurance sector.Consultants such as Wood Mackenzie have also seen growing demand for their services as the oil and gas industry reconsiders big projects and operating costs after last year’s price decline.The purchase price values WoodMac, as it is known in the industry, at more than 17 times its £107m earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation last year. Verisk’s own shares trade at 26 times its forecast earnings next year.But it is less than the £2bn stock market listing that Wood Mackenzie had been contemplating in parallel to seeking bids from strategic buyers.McGraw Hill Financial, owner of the rating agency Standard & Poor’s and the energy price reporter Platt’s, submitted a £1.5bn bid in competition with Verisk, the Financial Times reported last month.Private equity firms have increasingly oscillated this year between listing the companies they are looking to exit or seeking bids from strategic buyers with reserves of cash to spend. Their tactics have been aided by the emollient valuations that public market investors are placing on companies.Most recently Refresco Gerber, a Dutch soft drinks bottler, chose to list in Amsterdam after a buyout bid battle.On Monday Apax announced a £2bn-£2.5bn IPO of Auto Trader, the UK’s biggest car classifieds site — which itself had been a potential takeover target for Hellman & Friedman.Private equity firms generated nearly $450bn from exiting investments in 2014, making it the best year in some time for buyout firms to reap gains on assets and return cash to investors. The trend may continue this year.However, as those investors look to reinvest the cash back into new private equity funds, concerns are rising within the industry that this influx of money could weaken future returns by pushing up prices — especially as corporate buyers and public markets increasingly compete for the same assets.
2;VRSK;Verisk Analytics Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
